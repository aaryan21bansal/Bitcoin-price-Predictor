Redwood knighted for service to politics,"Sir John has said the UK will be better-off outside the European Union Veteran Conservative MP John Redwood has been knighted in the New Year Honours List. The former cabinet minister and leading Brexiteer is among a number of MPs to be recognised for their political and public service. Sir John, who has represented the Berkshire town of Wokingham since 1987, is opposed to Theresa May's EU deal. Tory ex-minister Gary Streeter and long-serving Labour MP Alan Campbell have also received knighthoods. Decisions on awards for political and public service are made by a committee independent of government. While senior Conservative and Labour figures sit on the body, and it is chaired by a Conservative peer Lord Sherbourne, it has a majority of members who are not affiliated to any political party. Nevertheless, in past years, the committee has been criticised for approving honours to party donors. Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Veteran Tory Eurosceptic given knighthood The unexpected award of a knighthood last month to the Conservative MP Sir John Hayes prompted speculation that Downing Street would seek to use honours as an incentive to persuade sceptical MPs to back the prime minister's Brexit deal. But the 2018 New Year's List features comparatively few politicians compared with previous years and their positions on the Brexit deal are already well-known. One of the most familiar figures in British politics, Sir John Redwood has played a leading role in Conservative debates over Europe and internal battles over four decades. The 67-year old stood against John Major for the Conservative leadership in 1995, losing by 129 votes. Two years earlier, the prime minister had described the then Welsh Secretary and other Eurosceptics in his cabinet as ""bastards"", in unguarded comments picked up by a microphone. Sir John has been at the heart of Conservative battles over Europe for four decades Sir John, who became a councillor at the age of 21 and headed Margaret Thatcher's policy unit in the 1980s, is one of the leading free-market voices in his party and opponents of the UK's membership of the EU. He has said he will vote against the terms of the UK's exit from the EU even if the controversial Northern Ireland backstop is removed, arguing that Brexit should be regarded as an opportunity not a threat. Writing in his blog on Friday, he said the UK would ""cash in"" if it left without an agreement as it would not have to hand over Â£39bn to the EU and would be able to spend the money instead on public services. Sir Gary Streeter, the MP for South West Devon since 1992, has already made clear that he will vote for the PM's Brexit agreement when it comes before Parliament next month. A committed Christian, he told the Press Association that he hoped his honour came, in part, in recognition of his work over the past decade as chairman of the all-party group on Christians in Parliament and mentoring new MPs after their arrival at Westminster. Sir Alan Campbell has been the Labour MP for Tynemouth since 1997. The former history teacher served as a minister under Gordon Brown and, for the past eight years, has been the party's deputy chief whip. ""My first priority has always been and still is my constituency and that includes issues around the regeneration of seaside and coastal towns,"" he told PA. ""If this award is a recognition of that, then that is great."" Other recipients of awards include Andrew Fender, who served as a Labour member on Greater Manchester Council for 40 years, Gurinder Singh Josan, a member of the West Midlands Police and Crime strategy board and the long-serving Conservative MEP Geoffrey Van Orden. Each has become a CBE.

Thai cave divers bravery awards,"Richard Stanton (left) and John Volanthen (right) were both awarded the George Medal A team of British divers have been decorated for their role in rescuing a boys' football team from a Thai cave. Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, who were the first divers to reach the children, have been awarded the George Medal, the second highest civilian gallantry award. Three divers were made MBEs and two others receive the Queen's Gallantry Medal. The dramatic rescue operationgripped the world's attention in the summer. Divers Joshua Bratchley, Lance Corporal Connor Roe and Vernon Unsworth, were appointed MBEs for their role in the rescue, while Christopher Jewell and Jason Mallinson have been given the Queen's Gallantry Medal for exemplary acts of bravery. The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search How the Thai boys were rescued The Thai cave rescue: What happened next? Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Joshua Bratchley, Jason Mallinson and Chris Jewell were among those honoured for their role in the rescue Mr Volanthen told BBC News that while his award was much appreciated, from his perspective as a parent, the most important thing was that the boys were rescued. ""I don't think anyone could ask for any greater honour than being able to be a part of the team that returned the Wild Boars [football team] to their families,"" he said. This video can not be played The moment divers discover the missing boys Reacting to the announcement, Mr Unsworth, originally from St Albans but now living in Thailand, said the operation was ""a team effort"" and he was ""honoured to have been recognised"". ""For me, after saving the boys, this is the icing on the cake,"" he said. Mr Jewell, from Cheddar, Somerset, who is a diving officer of the British Cave Rescue Council, praised the ""amazing support"" which made the rescue possible. ""Behind every one of the cave divers being honoured is a supporting cast of family, friends, rescue volunteers and employers,"" the 36-year-old said. Vern Unsworth (left) and L/Cpl Roe were both appointed MBE Mr Bratchley, 27, who is a Met Office meteorologist based at RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales, used to work for Devon Cave Rescue Organisation. He said to receive such recognition was ""incredible"". Elite divers Mr Stanton, a firefighter in his 50s from Coventry, and Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant in his 40s based in Bristol, are members of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue team. Both had experience of previous cave rescues, with Mr Stanton involved in the rescue of trapped British soldiers from a cave in Mexico in 2004. Richard Stanton is an elite diver and firefighter from Coventry L/Cpl Roe, from Scotland, who is in the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers, attached to 21 Signal Regiment, has been caving for more than eight years and cave diving since 2012. Mr Mallinson, 50 from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, dived with Mr Jewell in 2013 to explore the Sistema Huautla in Mexico - the deepest cave in the western hemisphere. John Volanthen is a member of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue team. The British divers answered a call by Thai authorities to join the search for 12 boys aged 11 to 16 and their football coach, who had disappeared in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system in Chiang Rai province on 23 June. The boys, who were members of the local Wild Boars youth football team, became trapped after heavy rains caused flooding. The first rescuers reached the group on 3 July but then faced the dangerous task of getting the whole team out safely, with the forecast of heavy rains and the risk of water levels rising. The dangers of the three-day operation were highlighted when a former Thai navy diver died from a lack of oxygen during the mission. The final members of the group emerged on 10 July, prompting celebrations across Thailand and further afield.

"Three men guilty of shop blast murdersFive people - including a mother and her two sons - were killed in the botched ÃÂ£300,000 insurance scam.","This video can not be played CCTV shows the moment of the explosion Three men who blew up a shop in a Â£300,000 insurance scam have been found guilty of murdering five people. A mother and her two sons were among those killed in the ""bomb-like"" blast which destroyed the supermarket in Hinckley Road, Leicester, in February. Aram Kurd, Hawkar Hassan and Arkan Ali caused the explosion when they set alight ""many, many litres of petrol"" in the basement of the Polish store. They had denied five counts of murder and conspiracy to commit fraud. Mary Ragoobar, 46, and sons Shane Ragoobeer, 18, and Sean, 17, lived above the shop and were at home at the time of the ""devastating"" explosion on 25 February. Shane's girlfriend Leah Beth Reek, 18, and shop worker Viktorija Ijevleva, 22, were also killed. During the trial, jurors heard how Scotty Ragoobeer, who was 15 at the time, survived because he was dug out of the rubble by police and members of the public just before the blast site was engulfed by flames. Prosecutor David Herbert QC told jurors the defendants deliberately caused the explosion, intending ""to profit from loss of stock, contents and future loss of business from the shop."" Mary Ragoobar and two of her sons, Shane and Sean Ragoobeer, were killed in the blast Shane Ragoobeer's girlfriend Leah Reek, 18, was also killed A five-week trial heard the defendants left Ms Ijevleva to die because she was aware of an insurance policy taken out less than three weeks earlier. Mr Herbert said the trio ""thought she knew too much and decided to leave her to die in the explosion that they created"". Shopkeeper 'made prison confession' Boy's 'miracle' rescue from rubble Trio 'wanted Â£300k insurance payout' Jurors, who took just over 11 hours to find the trio guilty on all counts, were shown CCTV footage of people escaping from a nearby takeaway moments after the explosion. In the video, released by police after the trial, rubble can be seen flying into the road as cars pass by. Further footage recovered from a neighbouring business's camera showed Ali in shot three days before the blast - moments before the camera angle was changed. Images taken from the same CCTV unit a day before the fire showed a gloved hand moving the camera again - at a time when all three defendants were nearby. Kurd was also recorded on a security camera as he escaped from the scene at the rear of the shop. The killers lit 26 litres of petrol in the basement of a shop to benefit from a Â£330,000 pay-out In a statement read outside the court after the verdicts, Jose Ragoobeer said he and his family's lives would ""never be the same"". He described his wife of 22 years as ""our rock"", adding: ""Not a day goes by when we don't think about Mary, Shane and Sean."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Molly Reek said of her sister Leah: ""She was an amazing, inspirational young lady who was just starting out in her life adventure. Leah made a lasting impression on everyone who was lucky enough to know her.""

Kane said: ""We got a letter to the house. Kate [his fiancee] opened the letter. It was before the Southampton game. ""Normally we'd talk a little but she would never call me just before the match. I had a missed call and she texted me 'could you answer?' ""I thought something was wrong! But Kate was excited and told me that we'd had a letter from the Queen saying we'd get an MBE.""

Sepsis campaigner becomes MBE,"This video can not be played This awareness raising video by Melissa Mead was seen 19 million times A woman who led high-profile campaigns to raise awareness of sepsis after the death of her son in 2014 has been appointed an MBE. William Mead died from treatable blood poisoning, known as septicaemia, just after his first birthday. His mother Melissa had taken him to the GP several times and been told not to worry. Melissa became an ambassador for the charity UK Sepsis Trust, and created avideo, seen by 19 million people. Double hand transplant surgeon gets OBE Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Melissa, speaking to the BBC from her home in Cornwall, said: ""I was shocked when the letter arrived, I certainly didn't expect it. This is not something I do for recognition, all I wanted to do was give my son a voice. ""Campaigning alongside the UK Sepsis Trust allowed me to channel my grief and put one foot in front of another. ""This year, I had a Christmas card from a lady with a photograph of her son who started school this year. She said he had been ill with sepsis, but was sent home by doctors who thought it was only a viral infection. ""Because of the video I had shared, she spotted some of the symptoms and took him to hospital. Perhaps if she had left it a day later it would have been too late. ""I can never bring William back, but he lives on in the hearts of the thousands of lives he has saved, and for me that is some comfort,"" she said. ""I am dedicating this award to him."" A 2016 report into William's death called for better recognition by GPs of the signs and symptoms of septicaemia, and more training for NHS 111 advisers. The then health secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised for the failings. Melissa went on to launch a campaign, with the UK Sepsis Trust, to help parents to spot signs of illness. Millions of leaflets urging parents to take their child to A&E or call 999 if their child is displaying symptoms were delivered to GP surgeries and hospitals across the country. The awareness video, in which Melissa held up cards detailing the symptoms of sepsis, was a key part of the campaign, and quickly went viral. Since then the World Health Organization has adopted a resolution to improve sepsis care in all UN member states.  A YouGov poll by the UK Sepsis Trust showed that awareness of the condition increased from 30% in 2014 to 70% in 2016. Sepsis has also featured in storylines in Holby City, Call the Midwife, Coronation Street and The Archers. Mellissa Mead and her son William in December 2014 just before he died Dr Ron Daniels, CEO of the UK Sepsis Trust, said: ""It's fantastic that Melissa's services to raising awareness of sepsis are being recognised in this way. We're incredibly grateful to Melissa; her capacity to turn her grief into something positive is an inspiration to us all. ""We need loved ones to trust their instincts and we need health professionals to listen to them. Of the 250,000 people affected by sepsis every year in the UK, 25,000 are children but so many of these deaths are avoidable. Better awareness could save thousands of lives."" Hunt: 'I let down sepsis death boy' NHS 111 'missed chances to save baby' The biggest killer you may not know Sepsis, also known as blood poisoning, is the immune system's over-reaction to an infection or injury. Around 44,000 people die annually because of sepsis and 60,000 suffer permanent after-effects.  If not treated immediately, sepsis can result in organ failure and death. With early diagnosis, it can be treated with antibiotics. A child may have sepsis if he or she: Is breathing very fast Has a fit or convulsion Looks mottled, bluish, or pale Has a rash that does not fade when you press it Is very lethargic or difficult to wake Feels abnormally cold to touch Is not feeding Is vomiting repeatedly Has not passed urine for 12 hours Source:UK Sepsis Trust,external Many NHS staff have been recognised in the 2019 New Year Honours list.

Honours for Thai cave rescue divers,"Richard Stanton (left) and John Volanthen (right) were both awarded the George Medal A team of British divers have been decorated for their role in rescuing a boys' football team from a Thai cave. Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, who were the first divers to reach the children, have been awarded the George Medal, the second highest civilian gallantry award. Three divers were made MBEs and two others receive the Queen's Gallantry Medal. The dramatic rescue operationgripped the world's attention in the summer. Divers Joshua Bratchley, Lance Corporal Connor Roe and Vernon Unsworth, were appointed MBEs for their role in the rescue, while Christopher Jewell and Jason Mallinson have been given the Queen's Gallantry Medal for exemplary acts of bravery. The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search How the Thai boys were rescued The Thai cave rescue: What happened next? Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Joshua Bratchley, Jason Mallinson and Chris Jewell were among those honoured for their role in the rescue Mr Volanthen told BBC News that while his award was much appreciated, from his perspective as a parent, the most important thing was that the boys were rescued. ""I don't think anyone could ask for any greater honour than being able to be a part of the team that returned the Wild Boars [football team] to their families,"" he said. This video can not be played The moment divers discover the missing boys Reacting to the announcement, Mr Unsworth, originally from St Albans but now living in Thailand, said the operation was ""a team effort"" and he was ""honoured to have been recognised"". ""For me, after saving the boys, this is the icing on the cake,"" he said. Mr Jewell, from Cheddar, Somerset, who is a diving officer of the British Cave Rescue Council, praised the ""amazing support"" which made the rescue possible. ""Behind every one of the cave divers being honoured is a supporting cast of family, friends, rescue volunteers and employers,"" the 36-year-old said. Vern Unsworth (left) and L/Cpl Roe were both appointed MBE Mr Bratchley, 27, who is a Met Office meteorologist based at RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales, used to work for Devon Cave Rescue Organisation. He said to receive such recognition was ""incredible"". Elite divers Mr Stanton, a firefighter in his 50s from Coventry, and Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant in his 40s based in Bristol, are members of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue team. Both had experience of previous cave rescues, with Mr Stanton involved in the rescue of trapped British soldiers from a cave in Mexico in 2004. Richard Stanton is an elite diver and firefighter from Coventry L/Cpl Roe, from Scotland, who is in the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers, attached to 21 Signal Regiment, has been caving for more than eight years and cave diving since 2012. Mr Mallinson, 50 from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, dived with Mr Jewell in 2013 to explore the Sistema Huautla in Mexico - the deepest cave in the western hemisphere. John Volanthen is a member of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue team. The British divers answered a call by Thai authorities to join the search for 12 boys aged 11 to 16 and their football coach, who had disappeared in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system in Chiang Rai province on 23 June. The boys, who were members of the local Wild Boars youth football team, became trapped after heavy rains caused flooding. The first rescuers reached the group on 3 July but then faced the dangerous task of getting the whole team out safely, with the forecast of heavy rains and the risk of water levels rising. The dangers of the three-day operation were highlighted when a former Thai navy diver died from a lack of oxygen during the mission. The final members of the group emerged on 10 July, prompting celebrations across Thailand and further afield.

'World's best teacher' appointed MBE,"This video can not be played Andria Zafirakou accepted her teaching award at a ceremony in Dubai earlier this year A teacher at a north London secondary school who won a global competition to find the world's best teacher has been appointed MBE. Andria Zafirakou, who teaches art and textiles at Alperton Community School in Brent, has been honoured for her services to education and young people. Mrs Zafirakou said the appointment was a ""wonderful surprise"". Mrs Zafirakou, 40, became the first UKwinner of the Global Teacher Prize earlier this year. She beat teachers nominated from more than 170 countries to win a prize worth $1m (Â£790,000). Since Mrs Zafirakou joined Alperton in 2005, she has set up a boxing club, redesigned the curriculum to improve access for every student, and even conducted personal patrols outside the school to deter gang members from trying to recruit her pupils. She has also visited students in their homes and learned basic phrases in languages such as Hindi, Tamil and Gujarati to engage with her pupils. Andria Zafirakou with pupils from Alperton Community School Mrs Zafirakou, who is an associate deputy at Alperton, said she felt ""humbled, emotional and extremely proud"" at receiving the honour. Reflecting on her 13 years at the school, she said her most proud memories were ""those wonderful individual stories of children who have succeeded against the odds because of your intervention"". However, she added: ""I do not see this as an honour I have done all by myself. I see this as something I am receiving on behalf of my school community."" Mrs Zafirakou said she hoped to keep the news of her honour ""low key"" so it was ""business as usual"" for the children when they returned to school in January.

Honour for former gang memberCook & Beaumont among sports stars listedSepsis campaigner becomes MBERedwood knighted for service to politics,"A former London gang member who runs boxing classes to draw young people away from crime, has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. Stephen Addison, who has been awarded the British Empire Medal, says he was prompted to turn his life around by a bad dream in which he saw himself jailed for murder. It spurred him on to rejoin his parents' church and go to university. Since 2013 Stephen has helped more than 4,000 young people change their lives. He was a keen boxer himself until the age of 15 when he says he was distracted into gangs. His behaviour deteriorated to the extent that he was asked to leave his school in Barking, East London, and for the next five years, made a living through crime. But, he says, a ""random dream"" one night changed his life - he was so shocked at the idea that he might commit murder that he was determined to change. This video can not be played Combating crime: Faith + Boxing = Meaning He told his friends he was leaving the gang way of life, went back to his parents' church and applied to South Bank University to study business. At university he took up boxing again and, when he won gold in a major university boxing championship, his story was covered in the newspapers. While he was looking at the papers, he spotted another piece, about a friend from his gang days who himself had just been jailed for life for murder. The contrast made him determined to go back to his community in East London and help young people like himself escape a life of crime. Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Fighting crime with faith Reality Check: How much violent crime is due to gangs? His dissertation was about setting up a boxing academy - he got a first -  and the university was so impressed it put money behind a pilot project which he ran in August 2013 for about 100 young people. His organisation, Box Up Crime,external, now works with about 600 young people every week in schools, pupil referral units and community centres mainly in Barking and Dagenham and is looking to expand across the capital and beyond. The project uses boxing training, along with individual mentoring and a focus on education, to develop self-discipline and boost educational and social skills. The project uses boxing training along with mentoring to boost confidence and educational attainment Stephen was even invited to run a behaviour programme at Barking Abbey, the school he was asked to leave as a teenager, and where he is now a governor. He says many of the young people he works with are very similar to himself. He calls them: ""dirty diamonds"", and he believes all are capable of the same transformation. ""I want to see those dirty diamonds shine again."" He tells them the hard work of finding their potential will be down to them and believes they just need support: ""They just need someone to believe in them, motivate them."" He hopes the award will mean that: ""Young people can look at me and look at my life and say, 'Stephen was involved in gangs... Stephen was involved in all this messed-up stuff just like me but he's been able to turn it around and and  I can do the same thing.'"" Stephen's award comes alongside an OBE for another Londoner, Mark Prince, who has given around 200 school talks since losing his own son Kiyan to knife crime in 2006. Throughhis work Mr Prince tries to raise awareness,externalof the dangers of gang and knife crime and personally mentors dozens of young people. Other education honours include: A CBE for Ruth Miskin, creator of the widely used Read Write primary school reading programme An MBE for Andria Zafirakou, associate deputy head, Alperton Community School, andwinner of the 2018 Global Teacher Prize And Prof Madeleine Atkins, former head of the Higher Education Funding Council becomes a dame.

Tottenham forward Kane, 25, finished the competition, held in Russia, as top scorer with six goals..

Kane said: ""We got a letter to the house. Kate [his fiancee] opened the letter. It was before the Southampton game. ""Normally we'd talk a little but she would never call me just before the match. I had a missed call and she texted me 'could you answer?' ""I thought something was wrong! But Kate was excited and told me that we'd had a letter from the Queen saying we'd get an MBE.""

Sepsis campaigner becomes MBERedwood knighted for service to politics,"This video can not be played This awareness raising video by Melissa Mead was seen 19 million times A woman who led high-profile campaigns to raise awareness of sepsis after the death of her son in 2014 has been appointed an MBE. William Mead died from treatable blood poisoning, known as septicaemia, just after his first birthday. His mother Melissa had taken him to the GP several times and been told not to worry. Melissa became an ambassador for the charity UK Sepsis Trust, and created avideo, seen by 19 million people. Double hand transplant surgeon gets OBE Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Melissa, speaking to the BBC from her home in Cornwall, said: ""I was shocked when the letter arrived, I certainly didn't expect it. This is not something I do for recognition, all I wanted to do was give my son a voice. ""Campaigning alongside the UK Sepsis Trust allowed me to channel my grief and put one foot in front of another. ""This year, I had a Christmas card from a lady with a photograph of her son who started school this year. She said he had been ill with sepsis, but was sent home by doctors who thought it was only a viral infection. ""Because of the video I had shared, she spotted some of the symptoms and took him to hospital. Perhaps if she had left it a day later it would have been too late. ""I can never bring William back, but he lives on in the hearts of the thousands of lives he has saved, and for me that is some comfort,"" she said. ""I am dedicating this award to him."" A 2016 report into William's death called for better recognition by GPs of the signs and symptoms of septicaemia, and more training for NHS 111 advisers. The then health secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised for the failings. Melissa went on to launch a campaign, with the UK Sepsis Trust, to help parents to spot signs of illness. Millions of leaflets urging parents to take their child to A&E or call 999 if their child is displaying symptoms were delivered to GP surgeries and hospitals across the country. The awareness video, in which Melissa held up cards detailing the symptoms of sepsis, was a key part of the campaign, and quickly went viral. Since then the World Health Organization has adopted a resolution to improve sepsis care in all UN member states.  A YouGov poll by the UK Sepsis Trust showed that awareness of the condition increased from 30% in 2014 to 70% in 2016. Sepsis has also featured in storylines in Holby City, Call the Midwife, Coronation Street and The Archers. Mellissa Mead and her son William in December 2014 just before he died Dr Ron Daniels, CEO of the UK Sepsis Trust, said: ""It's fantastic that Melissa's services to raising awareness of sepsis are being recognised in this way. We're incredibly grateful to Melissa; her capacity to turn her grief into something positive is an inspiration to us all. ""We need loved ones to trust their instincts and we need health professionals to listen to them. Of the 250,000 people affected by sepsis every year in the UK, 25,000 are children but so many of these deaths are avoidable. Better awareness could save thousands of lives."" Hunt: 'I let down sepsis death boy' NHS 111 'missed chances to save baby' The biggest killer you may not know Sepsis, also known as blood poisoning, is the immune system's over-reaction to an infection or injury. Around 44,000 people die annually because of sepsis and 60,000 suffer permanent after-effects.  If not treated immediately, sepsis can result in organ failure and death. With early diagnosis, it can be treated with antibiotics. A child may have sepsis if he or she: Is breathing very fast Has a fit or convulsion Looks mottled, bluish, or pale Has a rash that does not fade when you press it Is very lethargic or difficult to wake Feels abnormally cold to touch Is not feeding Is vomiting repeatedly Has not passed urine for 12 hours Source:UK Sepsis Trust,external Many NHS staff have been recognised in the 2019 New Year Honours list.

""I was very proud when I got the envelope three or four weeks ago saying I was being recommended for a knighthood,"" said Beaumont, who had a lengthy spell as one of the captain's on BBC TV quiz show A Question of Sport. ""It was very official, not the normal envelope I would receive. ""I just thought 'wow'. To think that I would be mentioned alongside the great sports people who have been knighted was very humbling."" England boss Southgate got his side to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup as the team went the furthest it had done at the tournament since 1990. Tottenham forward Kane, 25, finished the competition, held in Russia, as top scorer with six goals.. ""I'm an incredibly proud Englishman so having had the opportunity to have represented my country as a player more than 50 times and then to manage the team at a World Cup has been an absolute privilege,"" said Southgate. Kane said: ""We got a letter to the house. Kate [his fiancee] opened the letter. It was before the Southampton game. ""Normally we'd talk a little but she would never call me just before the match. I had a missed call and she texted me 'could you answer?' ""I thought something was wrong! But Kate was excited and told me that we'd had a letter from the Queen saying we'd get an MBE."" Others to be honoured for services to football include Northern Ireland's Gregg and McAuley.

Honours for Thai cave rescue diversRedwood knighted for service to politicsHonour for former gang memberVideo 1 minute 54 secondsVideo 1 minute 54 secondsMichael Palin: 'I've been a knight before...'The best of the reactions from the newly-honoured stars.Entertainment & Arts,"Richard Stanton (left) and John Volanthen (right) were both awarded the George Medal A team of British divers have been decorated for their role in rescuing a boys' football team from a Thai cave. Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, who were the first divers to reach the children, have been awarded the George Medal, the second highest civilian gallantry award. Three divers were made MBEs and two others receive the Queen's Gallantry Medal. The dramatic rescue operationgripped the world's attention in the summer. Divers Joshua Bratchley, Lance Corporal Connor Roe and Vernon Unsworth, were appointed MBEs for their role in the rescue, while Christopher Jewell and Jason Mallinson have been given the Queen's Gallantry Medal for exemplary acts of bravery. The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search How the Thai boys were rescued The Thai cave rescue: What happened next? Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Joshua Bratchley, Jason Mallinson and Chris Jewell were among those honoured for their role in the rescue Mr Volanthen told BBC News that while his award was much appreciated, from his perspective as a parent, the most important thing was that the boys were rescued. ""I don't think anyone could ask for any greater honour than being able to be a part of the team that returned the Wild Boars [football team] to their families,"" he said. This video can not be played The moment divers discover the missing boys Reacting to the announcement, Mr Unsworth, originally from St Albans but now living in Thailand, said the operation was ""a team effort"" and he was ""honoured to have been recognised"". ""For me, after saving the boys, this is the icing on the cake,"" he said. Mr Jewell, from Cheddar, Somerset, who is a diving officer of the British Cave Rescue Council, praised the ""amazing support"" which made the rescue possible. ""Behind every one of the cave divers being honoured is a supporting cast of family, friends, rescue volunteers and employers,"" the 36-year-old said. Vern Unsworth (left) and L/Cpl Roe were both appointed MBE Mr Bratchley, 27, who is a Met Office meteorologist based at RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales, used to work for Devon Cave Rescue Organisation. He said to receive such recognition was ""incredible"". Elite divers Mr Stanton, a firefighter in his 50s from Coventry, and Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant in his 40s based in Bristol, are members of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue team. Both had experience of previous cave rescues, with Mr Stanton involved in the rescue of trapped British soldiers from a cave in Mexico in 2004. Richard Stanton is an elite diver and firefighter from Coventry L/Cpl Roe, from Scotland, who is in the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers, attached to 21 Signal Regiment, has been caving for more than eight years and cave diving since 2012. Mr Mallinson, 50 from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, dived with Mr Jewell in 2013 to explore the Sistema Huautla in Mexico - the deepest cave in the western hemisphere. John Volanthen is a member of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue team. The British divers answered a call by Thai authorities to join the search for 12 boys aged 11 to 16 and their football coach, who had disappeared in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system in Chiang Rai province on 23 June. The boys, who were members of the local Wild Boars youth football team, became trapped after heavy rains caused flooding. The first rescuers reached the group on 3 July but then faced the dangerous task of getting the whole team out safely, with the forecast of heavy rains and the risk of water levels rising. The dangers of the three-day operation were highlighted when a former Thai navy diver died from a lack of oxygen during the mission. The final members of the group emerged on 10 July, prompting celebrations across Thailand and further afield.

Redwood knighted for service to politicsHonour for former gang memberVideo 1 minute 54 secondsVideo 1 minute 54 secondsMichael Palin: 'I've been a knight before...'The best of the reactions from the newly-honoured stars.Entertainment & Arts,"Sir John has said the UK will be better-off outside the European Union Veteran Conservative MP John Redwood has been knighted in the New Year Honours List. The former cabinet minister and leading Brexiteer is among a number of MPs to be recognised for their political and public service. Sir John, who has represented the Berkshire town of Wokingham since 1987, is opposed to Theresa May's EU deal. Tory ex-minister Gary Streeter and long-serving Labour MP Alan Campbell have also received knighthoods. Decisions on awards for political and public service are made by a committee independent of government. While senior Conservative and Labour figures sit on the body, and it is chaired by a Conservative peer Lord Sherbourne, it has a majority of members who are not affiliated to any political party. Nevertheless, in past years, the committee has been criticised for approving honours to party donors. Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Veteran Tory Eurosceptic given knighthood The unexpected award of a knighthood last month to the Conservative MP Sir John Hayes prompted speculation that Downing Street would seek to use honours as an incentive to persuade sceptical MPs to back the prime minister's Brexit deal. But the 2018 New Year's List features comparatively few politicians compared with previous years and their positions on the Brexit deal are already well-known. One of the most familiar figures in British politics, Sir John Redwood has played a leading role in Conservative debates over Europe and internal battles over four decades. The 67-year old stood against John Major for the Conservative leadership in 1995, losing by 129 votes. Two years earlier, the prime minister had described the then Welsh Secretary and other Eurosceptics in his cabinet as ""bastards"", in unguarded comments picked up by a microphone. Sir John has been at the heart of Conservative battles over Europe for four decades Sir John, who became a councillor at the age of 21 and headed Margaret Thatcher's policy unit in the 1980s, is one of the leading free-market voices in his party and opponents of the UK's membership of the EU. He has said he will vote against the terms of the UK's exit from the EU even if the controversial Northern Ireland backstop is removed, arguing that Brexit should be regarded as an opportunity not a threat. Writing in his blog on Friday, he said the UK would ""cash in"" if it left without an agreement as it would not have to hand over Â£39bn to the EU and would be able to spend the money instead on public services. Sir Gary Streeter, the MP for South West Devon since 1992, has already made clear that he will vote for the PM's Brexit agreement when it comes before Parliament next month. A committed Christian, he told the Press Association that he hoped his honour came, in part, in recognition of his work over the past decade as chairman of the all-party group on Christians in Parliament and mentoring new MPs after their arrival at Westminster. Sir Alan Campbell has been the Labour MP for Tynemouth since 1997. The former history teacher served as a minister under Gordon Brown and, for the past eight years, has been the party's deputy chief whip. ""My first priority has always been and still is my constituency and that includes issues around the regeneration of seaside and coastal towns,"" he told PA. ""If this award is a recognition of that, then that is great."" Other recipients of awards include Andrew Fender, who served as a Labour member on Greater Manchester Council for 40 years, Gurinder Singh Josan, a member of the West Midlands Police and Crime strategy board and the long-serving Conservative MEP Geoffrey Van Orden. Each has become a CBE.

Honour for former gang memberVideo 1 minute 54 secondsVideo 1 minute 54 secondsMichael Palin: 'I've been a knight before...'The best of the reactions from the newly-honoured stars.Entertainment & Arts,"A former London gang member who runs boxing classes to draw young people away from crime, has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. Stephen Addison, who has been awarded the British Empire Medal, says he was prompted to turn his life around by a bad dream in which he saw himself jailed for murder. It spurred him on to rejoin his parents' church and go to university. Since 2013 Stephen has helped more than 4,000 young people change their lives. He was a keen boxer himself until the age of 15 when he says he was distracted into gangs. His behaviour deteriorated to the extent that he was asked to leave his school in Barking, East London, and for the next five years, made a living through crime. But, he says, a ""random dream"" one night changed his life - he was so shocked at the idea that he might commit murder that he was determined to change. This video can not be played Combating crime: Faith + Boxing = Meaning He told his friends he was leaving the gang way of life, went back to his parents' church and applied to South Bank University to study business. At university he took up boxing again and, when he won gold in a major university boxing championship, his story was covered in the newspapers. While he was looking at the papers, he spotted another piece, about a friend from his gang days who himself had just been jailed for life for murder. The contrast made him determined to go back to his community in East London and help young people like himself escape a life of crime. Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Fighting crime with faith Reality Check: How much violent crime is due to gangs? His dissertation was about setting up a boxing academy - he got a first -  and the university was so impressed it put money behind a pilot project which he ran in August 2013 for about 100 young people. His organisation, Box Up Crime,external, now works with about 600 young people every week in schools, pupil referral units and community centres mainly in Barking and Dagenham and is looking to expand across the capital and beyond. The project uses boxing training, along with individual mentoring and a focus on education, to develop self-discipline and boost educational and social skills. The project uses boxing training along with mentoring to boost confidence and educational attainment Stephen was even invited to run a behaviour programme at Barking Abbey, the school he was asked to leave as a teenager, and where he is now a governor. He says many of the young people he works with are very similar to himself. He calls them: ""dirty diamonds"", and he believes all are capable of the same transformation. ""I want to see those dirty diamonds shine again."" He tells them the hard work of finding their potential will be down to them and believes they just need support: ""They just need someone to believe in them, motivate them."" He hopes the award will mean that: ""Young people can look at me and look at my life and say, 'Stephen was involved in gangs... Stephen was involved in all this messed-up stuff just like me but he's been able to turn it around and and  I can do the same thing.'"" Stephen's award comes alongside an OBE for another Londoner, Mark Prince, who has given around 200 school talks since losing his own son Kiyan to knife crime in 2006. Throughhis work Mr Prince tries to raise awareness,externalof the dangers of gang and knife crime and personally mentors dozens of young people. Other education honours include: A CBE for Ruth Miskin, creator of the widely used Read Write primary school reading programme An MBE for Andria Zafirakou, associate deputy head, Alperton Community School, andwinner of the 2018 Global Teacher Prize And Prof Madeleine Atkins, former head of the Higher Education Funding Council becomes a dame.

Honours for Thai cave rescue diversRedwood knighted for service to politicsHonour for former gang member,"Richard Stanton (left) and John Volanthen (right) were both awarded the George Medal A team of British divers have been decorated for their role in rescuing a boys' football team from a Thai cave. Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, who were the first divers to reach the children, have been awarded the George Medal, the second highest civilian gallantry award. Three divers were made MBEs and two others receive the Queen's Gallantry Medal. The dramatic rescue operationgripped the world's attention in the summer. Divers Joshua Bratchley, Lance Corporal Connor Roe and Vernon Unsworth, were appointed MBEs for their role in the rescue, while Christopher Jewell and Jason Mallinson have been given the Queen's Gallantry Medal for exemplary acts of bravery. The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search How the Thai boys were rescued The Thai cave rescue: What happened next? Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Joshua Bratchley, Jason Mallinson and Chris Jewell were among those honoured for their role in the rescue Mr Volanthen told BBC News that while his award was much appreciated, from his perspective as a parent, the most important thing was that the boys were rescued. ""I don't think anyone could ask for any greater honour than being able to be a part of the team that returned the Wild Boars [football team] to their families,"" he said. This video can not be played The moment divers discover the missing boys Reacting to the announcement, Mr Unsworth, originally from St Albans but now living in Thailand, said the operation was ""a team effort"" and he was ""honoured to have been recognised"". ""For me, after saving the boys, this is the icing on the cake,"" he said. Mr Jewell, from Cheddar, Somerset, who is a diving officer of the British Cave Rescue Council, praised the ""amazing support"" which made the rescue possible. ""Behind every one of the cave divers being honoured is a supporting cast of family, friends, rescue volunteers and employers,"" the 36-year-old said. Vern Unsworth (left) and L/Cpl Roe were both appointed MBE Mr Bratchley, 27, who is a Met Office meteorologist based at RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales, used to work for Devon Cave Rescue Organisation. He said to receive such recognition was ""incredible"". Elite divers Mr Stanton, a firefighter in his 50s from Coventry, and Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant in his 40s based in Bristol, are members of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue team. Both had experience of previous cave rescues, with Mr Stanton involved in the rescue of trapped British soldiers from a cave in Mexico in 2004. Richard Stanton is an elite diver and firefighter from Coventry L/Cpl Roe, from Scotland, who is in the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers, attached to 21 Signal Regiment, has been caving for more than eight years and cave diving since 2012. Mr Mallinson, 50 from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, dived with Mr Jewell in 2013 to explore the Sistema Huautla in Mexico - the deepest cave in the western hemisphere. John Volanthen is a member of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue team. The British divers answered a call by Thai authorities to join the search for 12 boys aged 11 to 16 and their football coach, who had disappeared in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system in Chiang Rai province on 23 June. The boys, who were members of the local Wild Boars youth football team, became trapped after heavy rains caused flooding. The first rescuers reached the group on 3 July but then faced the dangerous task of getting the whole team out safely, with the forecast of heavy rains and the risk of water levels rising. The dangers of the three-day operation were highlighted when a former Thai navy diver died from a lack of oxygen during the mission. The final members of the group emerged on 10 July, prompting celebrations across Thailand and further afield.

Redwood knighted for service to politicsHonour for former gang member,"Sir John has said the UK will be better-off outside the European Union Veteran Conservative MP John Redwood has been knighted in the New Year Honours List. The former cabinet minister and leading Brexiteer is among a number of MPs to be recognised for their political and public service. Sir John, who has represented the Berkshire town of Wokingham since 1987, is opposed to Theresa May's EU deal. Tory ex-minister Gary Streeter and long-serving Labour MP Alan Campbell have also received knighthoods. Decisions on awards for political and public service are made by a committee independent of government. While senior Conservative and Labour figures sit on the body, and it is chaired by a Conservative peer Lord Sherbourne, it has a majority of members who are not affiliated to any political party. Nevertheless, in past years, the committee has been criticised for approving honours to party donors. Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Veteran Tory Eurosceptic given knighthood The unexpected award of a knighthood last month to the Conservative MP Sir John Hayes prompted speculation that Downing Street would seek to use honours as an incentive to persuade sceptical MPs to back the prime minister's Brexit deal. But the 2018 New Year's List features comparatively few politicians compared with previous years and their positions on the Brexit deal are already well-known. One of the most familiar figures in British politics, Sir John Redwood has played a leading role in Conservative debates over Europe and internal battles over four decades. The 67-year old stood against John Major for the Conservative leadership in 1995, losing by 129 votes. Two years earlier, the prime minister had described the then Welsh Secretary and other Eurosceptics in his cabinet as ""bastards"", in unguarded comments picked up by a microphone. Sir John has been at the heart of Conservative battles over Europe for four decades Sir John, who became a councillor at the age of 21 and headed Margaret Thatcher's policy unit in the 1980s, is one of the leading free-market voices in his party and opponents of the UK's membership of the EU. He has said he will vote against the terms of the UK's exit from the EU even if the controversial Northern Ireland backstop is removed, arguing that Brexit should be regarded as an opportunity not a threat. Writing in his blog on Friday, he said the UK would ""cash in"" if it left without an agreement as it would not have to hand over Â£39bn to the EU and would be able to spend the money instead on public services. Sir Gary Streeter, the MP for South West Devon since 1992, has already made clear that he will vote for the PM's Brexit agreement when it comes before Parliament next month. A committed Christian, he told the Press Association that he hoped his honour came, in part, in recognition of his work over the past decade as chairman of the all-party group on Christians in Parliament and mentoring new MPs after their arrival at Westminster. Sir Alan Campbell has been the Labour MP for Tynemouth since 1997. The former history teacher served as a minister under Gordon Brown and, for the past eight years, has been the party's deputy chief whip. ""My first priority has always been and still is my constituency and that includes issues around the regeneration of seaside and coastal towns,"" he told PA. ""If this award is a recognition of that, then that is great."" Other recipients of awards include Andrew Fender, who served as a Labour member on Greater Manchester Council for 40 years, Gurinder Singh Josan, a member of the West Midlands Police and Crime strategy board and the long-serving Conservative MEP Geoffrey Van Orden. Each has become a CBE.

Honour for former gang member,"A former London gang member who runs boxing classes to draw young people away from crime, has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. Stephen Addison, who has been awarded the British Empire Medal, says he was prompted to turn his life around by a bad dream in which he saw himself jailed for murder. It spurred him on to rejoin his parents' church and go to university. Since 2013 Stephen has helped more than 4,000 young people change their lives. He was a keen boxer himself until the age of 15 when he says he was distracted into gangs. His behaviour deteriorated to the extent that he was asked to leave his school in Barking, East London, and for the next five years, made a living through crime. But, he says, a ""random dream"" one night changed his life - he was so shocked at the idea that he might commit murder that he was determined to change. This video can not be played Combating crime: Faith + Boxing = Meaning He told his friends he was leaving the gang way of life, went back to his parents' church and applied to South Bank University to study business. At university he took up boxing again and, when he won gold in a major university boxing championship, his story was covered in the newspapers. While he was looking at the papers, he spotted another piece, about a friend from his gang days who himself had just been jailed for life for murder. The contrast made him determined to go back to his community in East London and help young people like himself escape a life of crime. Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Fighting crime with faith Reality Check: How much violent crime is due to gangs? His dissertation was about setting up a boxing academy - he got a first -  and the university was so impressed it put money behind a pilot project which he ran in August 2013 for about 100 young people. His organisation, Box Up Crime,external, now works with about 600 young people every week in schools, pupil referral units and community centres mainly in Barking and Dagenham and is looking to expand across the capital and beyond. The project uses boxing training, along with individual mentoring and a focus on education, to develop self-discipline and boost educational and social skills. The project uses boxing training along with mentoring to boost confidence and educational attainment Stephen was even invited to run a behaviour programme at Barking Abbey, the school he was asked to leave as a teenager, and where he is now a governor. He says many of the young people he works with are very similar to himself. He calls them: ""dirty diamonds"", and he believes all are capable of the same transformation. ""I want to see those dirty diamonds shine again."" He tells them the hard work of finding their potential will be down to them and believes they just need support: ""They just need someone to believe in them, motivate them."" He hopes the award will mean that: ""Young people can look at me and look at my life and say, 'Stephen was involved in gangs... Stephen was involved in all this messed-up stuff just like me but he's been able to turn it around and and  I can do the same thing.'"" Stephen's award comes alongside an OBE for another Londoner, Mark Prince, who has given around 200 school talks since losing his own son Kiyan to knife crime in 2006. Throughhis work Mr Prince tries to raise awareness,externalof the dangers of gang and knife crime and personally mentors dozens of young people.

Music retailer HMV calls in administrators,"Music retailer HMV has confirmed it is calling in KPMG as administrators. The move, the second in six years, involves 2,200 staff at 125 stores. Owners Hilco, which took the company out of its first administration in 2013, blamed a ""tsunami"" of retail challenges, including business rate levels and the move to digital. It said the stores would continue to trade while negotiations were held with major suppliers and it looked for buyers. The rise and fall of a music icon Did streaming finish off HMV? The councils trying to save the high street Boxing Day sales attracting fewer shoppers Retail theatre responds to high street downturn The Darkness performing at HMV's Oxford Street store Paul McGowan, executive chairman of HMV and its owner Hilco Capital, said: ""Even an exceptionally well-run and much-loved business such as HMV cannot withstand the tsunami of challenges facing UK retailers over the last 12 months on top of such a dramatic change in consumer behaviour in the entertainment market."" He pointed out HMV sold 31% of all physical music in the UK in 2018 and 23% of all DVDs and Blu-rays, with its market share growing month by month throughout the year. But he added that the industry consensus was that the market would fall by another 17% during 2019 and therefore it would not be possible to continue to trade the business.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. BBC Money Box presenter and financial journalist Paul Lewis has advised people to use any HMV gift cards immediately. According to consumer publication Which?, whether vouchers and returns will be accepted following administrationdepends on the administrators,external. Their role is to ""try and save the company"", and in doing so, they ""may take the decision not to accept returns"". Hilco's ownership saw HMV host live events in store, with musicians including Kylie Minogue, Stormzy and The Darkness. Digital music revenue overtook sales of physical formats like CDs and records for the first time in 2012. Since then, online shopping, downloads and streaming provided by platforms such as Amazon, Spotify and Netflix, have continued to eat into sales of physical music. Julie Palmer, partner at business consultancy Begbies Traynor, said the fall of HMV had been ""coming for many years"". She added: ""It has been revealed that the business turnaround has been built on a bed of sand rather than rocks."" With video and music still its main sources of revenue, HMV was always likely to be one of the retailers struggling to make it through the Christmas holidays. But this is about more than a struggle to adapt to changing consumer habits. In millions of households, watching a movie now means turning to Netflix rather than selecting a DVD, andlistening to music means streaming it from Spotifyinstead of heading up to the attic to hunt through old CDs. HMV faced the same pressures of low consumer confidence, high rents and a lacklustre Christmas that have put other high street names in danger. And don't be surprised if this is not the end of the story. The Entertainment Retailers Association points out that when you tot up music, video and games there is still a market of nearly Â£2bn worth of physical products. Big releases such as The Greatest Showman, Ed Sheeran and Adele have still attracted millions who want to own a physical copy. So maybe there is another turnaround specialist out there to keep the HMV name alive into its second century. Richard Lim, Chief Executive, Retail Economics, said HMV's situation came amid a weak retailing climate. ""Poor Christmas trading has claimed its first victim,"" he said. But the chief executive of the Entertainment Retailers Association, Kim Bayley, said there was hope. ""What is clear is that following its first move into administration in 2013, HMV has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround and it is conceivable that this will happen again. ""The fact is the physical entertainment market is still worth up to Â£2bn a year so there is plenty of business there."" While Christmas is normally a time of higher revenues for retailers, the number of shoppers hitting the post-Christmas salesdipped this year. Britain's shops have also faced uncertainty over Brexit, which sparked a fall in the pound and therefore raised the price of imported goods, as well as rising labour costs, higher business property taxes and unseasonably warm weather. HMV shop, Oxford Street, London in 1949. HMV, known for its iconic logo featuring the ""dog and trumpet,external"", is Britain's last surviving national music retailer. It was launched by English composer Edward Elgar in 1921, selling gramophones, radios and popular music hall recordings. Did streaming cause HMV to fail?

Channel migrants declared major incident,"Border Force officials detained 12 adult migrants on Friday The rising number of migrants attempting to cross the Channel in small boats has been declared a ""major incident"" by the UK home secretary. Sajid Javid has asked for an urgent call with his French counterpart about the situation. The Home Office said there was ""concern that it is only a matter of time before people lose their lives"". It comes after at least 221 migrants have attempted to cross the Channel to England since the start of November. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Most recently,12 people were detainedoff the coast of Dover in the early hours of Friday morning. Officials on both sides of the Channel have warned of the dangers of crossing what is the world's busiest shipping lane in a small boat.Police have likenedthe journey to trying to ""cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". In a statement, the Home Office said Mr Javid had ""taken control of the response"" to the situation. The 12 detained on Friday were brought to shore and given a medical assessment in Dover before being transferred to immigration officials The latest detention comes after 40 migrants were rescued from the Channel on Christmas Day Mr Javid has been appointed ""gold commander"",meaning he has ultimate responsibility,externalfor the handling and outcome of the incident and sets out a strategy of how to deal with it. He will now receive daily updates from the Home Office, and has spoken to Border Force officials, Immigration Enforcement and the National Crime Agency in a conference call. The Home Office added: ""The home secretary has also asked for an urgent call with his French counterpart over the weekend to reaffirm the continuing need for the UK and France to work closely together to tackle the problem. ""He has also commissioned detailed options from Border Force about the provision of additional vessels in the Channel, including another Border Force cutter, and whether this is likely to encourage more people to try and make the crossing rather than act as a deterrence."" Bridget Chapman, from the charity Kent Refugee Action Network, said the situation was in part a result of UK measures to ""beef up the security around Calais"". ""We've put a big fence up to prevent people from accessing trains and lorries and people are resorting to other methods to get here,"" she told the BBC. ""It's winter, but the weather has been quite good. And I expect people traffickers are exploiting people, saying, 'You know, things are going to tighten up after Brexit, you need to go now.'"" Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies Syrian refugees: The people who want four things before they go home Many of the migrants are Iranian or Syrian. More than five million Syrians have left their country since its civil war started in 2011, and in the past two years, Iranian citizens have made more UK asylum applications than any other nationality according to Home Office figures. ABBC South East investigation last monthfound that people smugglers were telling migrants they must enter before ""the borders shut properly"" after Brexit. British and French authorities have both said the rise in crossings is the result of ""organised criminality"" and ""mafia networks"". Earlier, Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said the number of incidents over recent days was ""deeply concerning"" and crossing the water in a dinghy was ""extremely dangerous"". She is due to visit Border Force officers in Dover on Saturday to discuss the situation. This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 The MP for Folkestone in Kent, Damian Collins, questioned why the UK was not doing more to stop the boats leaving France in the first place. He said: ""We need to make it really clear to the migrants and the gangs that if you try and do this you will be detected early, either as you're preparing to leave or as soon as you're in the water, and you'll be returned to France."" Charlie Elphicke - MP for Dover and Deal - suggested more patrol vessels may be needed. ""One is simply not enough and I think we need to ask questions, what are the two patrol craft doing in the Mediterranean - would they be better placed in the English Channel?"" Responding to the suggestion that bringing rescued migrants to the UK could encourage people to attempt the journey, Steve Valdez-Symonds, from Amnesty International, said that was ""nonsense"". ""If people are in danger of their lives then they need to be saved,"" he told the BBC. ""This is exactly the sort of nonsense we've heard in response to the desperate circumstances where thousands of people have drowned in the Mediterranean. When search and rescue has been withdrawn, more people die."" 28 December -Twelve migrants in two separate boatsdetained off the coast of Dover 27 December -Some 23 migrants, including three children, were detained in Kent aftercrossing the channel in small three boats 26 December -Three migrantsbrought ashore by Border Force 25 December -Forty migrants, including two children,crossed the Channel in five boats 15 December -Four children are among a group of11 people rescued off Dover.

Deadly blast hits tour bus in Egypt,"Police officers examined the shattered vehicle Three Vietnamese tourists and a local tour guide have been killed after a roadside bomb hit a bus near the Giza pyramids in Egypt, officials say. Eleven others were injured in the incident, the first affecting foreign tourists in Egypt in more than a year. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the bus had deviated from its planned route without alerting security forces, although the driver denied this. No group has yet said it was behind the blast. Islamist militants have targeted tourists in the past. What is Egypt like? Two German tourists were stabbed to death at a hotel in the popular Red Sea resort of Hurghada last year. Security is already tight in Egypt, with the tourist season at its height and the country's main Christian minority, the Copts, preparing to celebrate Orthodox Christmas on 7 January.

The bomb went off at about 18:15 (16:45 GMT) on Maryoutiya Street in Giza's Haram district as the bus carrying 14 Vietnamese tourists was passing, according to official accounts. Security forces rushed to the scene in response and police are investigating. The injured were taken to the nearby Haram hospital, Reuters news agency reports. ""We have been in contact with the embassy of Vietnam to contain the impact of the incident, and what is important now is to take care of the injured,"" Prime Minister Madbouly was quoted as saying. All of the injured are Vietnamese tourists apart from the bus driver, who is Egyptian. Tourism is a mainstay of the economy. It peaked in 2010, when the country saw more than 14 million visitors, but fell sharply after the turmoil of the Arab Spring the following year. The pyramids of Giza are a major draw Worse was to come aftermilitants bombed a Russian passenger jet in 2015 as it left Sharm el Sheikh, killing 224 people. The following year just 5.3 million tourists visited, according to the World Bank. However,the sector has since recovered and 8.3 million people visited in 2017,external, the Financial Times reports. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi told visiting Vietnamese leaders in May that he was keen to revive Vietnamese tourism in his country, according to Egypt Today.

Trump renews threat to shut Mexican border,"Migrants from Honduras tried to enter the US illegally on Thursday by jumping a border fence Donald Trump has threatened to shut down the border with Mexico over illegal immigration if Congress fails to fund his proposed wall. ""Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border,"" the US president tweeted after nearly a week of deadlock in Washington over the federal budget. Confirming the threat to close the border was real, the White House said negotiations with Congress had stalled. The dispute has caused a partial US government shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are either on unpaid leave or continue to work but do not know when they will be paid. Both Congress chambers met for just a few minutes on Thursday but took no steps to end the closure. The House and Senate will now meet again on Monday. Later in the week, a new House will be sworn in, dominated by opposition Democrats who won the mid-term elections last month, but Mr Trump's Republicans will retain the Senate with a slightly larger majority. In October Mr Trump made a similar threatto close the southern US border when demanding action from Latin American governments to stop migrants, in what has become known as the caravan, trying to cross into the US illegally. ""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money,externalto finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" he tweeted on Friday. He is seeking $5bn (Â£4bn) to cover the cost of the wall but Democrats and some within Mr Trump's own party insist they will not approve it.

Trump renews threat to shut Mexican borderThe US leader is locked in a dispute with Congress over funding for his proposed wall.US & Canada,"Migrants from Honduras tried to enter the US illegally on Thursday by jumping a border fence Donald Trump has threatened to shut down the border with Mexico over illegal immigration if Congress fails to fund his proposed wall. ""Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border,"" the US president tweeted after nearly a week of deadlock in Washington over the federal budget. Confirming the threat to close the border was real, the White House said negotiations with Congress had stalled. The dispute has caused a partial US government shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are either on unpaid leave or continue to work but do not know when they will be paid. Both Congress chambers met for just a few minutes on Thursday but took no steps to end the closure. The House and Senate will now meet again on Monday. Later in the week, a new House will be sworn in, dominated by opposition Democrats who won the mid-term elections last month, but Mr Trump's Republicans will retain the Senate with a slightly larger majority. In October Mr Trump made a similar threatto close the southern US border when demanding action from Latin American governments to stop migrants, in what has become known as the caravan, trying to cross into the US illegally. ""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money,externalto finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" he tweeted on Friday. He is seeking $5bn (Â£4bn) to cover the cost of the wall but Democrats and some within Mr Trump's own party insist they will not approve it.

Three men guilty of shop blast murders,"This video can not be played CCTV shows the moment of the explosion Three men who blew up a shop in a Â£300,000 insurance scam have been found guilty of murdering five people. A mother and her two sons were among those killed in the ""bomb-like"" blast which destroyed the supermarket in Hinckley Road, Leicester, in February. Aram Kurd, Hawkar Hassan and Arkan Ali caused the explosion when they set alight ""many, many litres of petrol"" in the basement of the Polish store. They had denied five counts of murder and conspiracy to commit fraud. Mary Ragoobar, 46, and sons Shane Ragoobeer, 18, and Sean, 17, lived above the shop and were at home at the time of the ""devastating"" explosion on 25 February. Shane's girlfriend Leah Beth Reek, 18, and shop worker Viktorija Ijevleva, 22, were also killed. During the trial, jurors heard how Scotty Ragoobeer, who was 15 at the time, survived because he was dug out of the rubble by police and members of the public just before the blast site was engulfed by flames. Prosecutor David Herbert QC told jurors the defendants deliberately caused the explosion, intending ""to profit from loss of stock, contents and future loss of business from the shop."" Mary Ragoobar and two of her sons, Shane and Sean Ragoobeer, were killed in the blast Shane Ragoobeer's girlfriend Leah Reek, 18, was also killed A five-week trial heard the defendants left Ms Ijevleva to die because she was aware of an insurance policy taken out less than three weeks earlier. Mr Herbert said the trio ""thought she knew too much and decided to leave her to die in the explosion that they created"". Shopkeeper 'made prison confession' Boy's 'miracle' rescue from rubble Trio 'wanted Â£300k insurance payout' Jurors, who took just over 11 hours to find the trio guilty on all counts, were shown CCTV footage of people escaping from a nearby takeaway moments after the explosion. In the video, released by police after the trial, rubble can be seen flying into the road as cars pass by. Further footage recovered from a neighbouring business's camera showed Ali in shot three days before the blast - moments before the camera angle was changed. Images taken from the same CCTV unit a day before the fire showed a gloved hand moving the camera again - at a time when all three defendants were nearby. Kurd was also recorded on a security camera as he escaped from the scene at the rear of the shop. The killers lit 26 litres of petrol in the basement of a shop to benefit from a Â£330,000 pay-out In a statement read outside the court after the verdicts, Jose Ragoobeer said he and his family's lives would ""never be the same"". He described his wife of 22 years as ""our rock"", adding: ""Not a day goes by when we don't think about Mary, Shane and Sean."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Molly Reek said of her sister Leah: ""She was an amazing, inspirational young lady who was just starting out in her life adventure. Leah made a lasting impression on everyone who was lucky enough to know her.""

Canadian teacher held in China 'released',"A Canadian citizen who was detained in China amid frosty relations between the two countries has been released and returned to Canada, media reports say. Teacher Sarah McIver, from Alberta, was held earlier this month for ""unlawfully working in China"". Global Affairs Canada confirmed that a Canadian citizen had been released, but did not name the person. Ms McIver's detention followed that of two other Canadians. They are still being held. China and Canada both said Ms McIver's case was different from the other two. Former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor face accusations of harming national security. The detentions came amid a dispute between Canada and China following the arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou earlier this month. Ms Meng was held at the request of US prosecutors and faces extradition on charges of violating sanctions on Iran. She denies the allegations. Canadians Michael Spavor (L) and Michael Kovrig are being accused of harming national security China has denied the detention of the two men is tied to Ms Meng's arrest, but many analysts believe it is a tit-for-tat action. Ms McIver had been working at a school in China when she was held over issues with her work visa. ""Global Affairs can confirm that a Canadian citizen, who was detained in China this month, has been released and has now returned to Canada,"" spokesman Richard Walker said.

'People don't realise the threat potholes pose',"Cyclist Martyn Uzzell and his wife Kate on their wedding day Martyn Uzzell was on the latest leg of a charity bike ride when he hit a pothole and was thrown into the path of a car. He died instantly. He was cycling from Land's End to John O'Groats with his brother-in-law and a friend - all three of them experienced cyclists. Since his death in 2011, his widow Kate has been campaigning for better road inspections. However, the RAC claims ""shocking"" new figures prove road conditions are worsening. New research has revealed more than half a million potholes were reported by members of the public to local authorities for repair last year. The data was obtained from Freedom of Information requests to the 212 councils responsible for roads in Great Britain, of which 161 authorities provided comparable figures. Storms blamed as pothole claims double Road-repairing drone idea for potholes Pothole photos: Your pictures of crumbling roads Kate, from North Somerset, said the pothole that killed her husband had been reported to the local council twice by a police officer and by their own inspection team. ""The local authority didn't take any action,"" she said. ""And the consequences of their inaction was the death of Martyn, devastation for his family and friends, and our future was stolen."" The A-road that they were cycling on was generally in good condition and was far better than others they had faced. After spotting a pothole around a drain, Martyn's brother-in-law called back to warn the others. But for Martyn it was too late. ""The first I knew was two police officers turned up at my work,"" Kate recalled. ""They turned up and they obviously said that Martyn had been killed. ""They couldn't tell me what had happened to my brother. He couldn't speak when he got home. He was so traumatised by it."" Kate had been planning a surprise trip to Scotland to watch the three of them cross the finish line. She said that people don't realise the threat that potholes can pose and said the latest figures were ""upsetting"". ""What is dangerous to a cyclist can be perfectly safe for a motor vehicle."" The government said it was spending Â£6.5bn on road repairs from 2015-2021. Drivers breaking down after hitting potholes is at a three year high More than 512,000 potholes were reported to the 161 local authorities, up 44% on the 2015 figure of 356,000 potholes from 152 councils, the RAC said. Extrapolating the numbers to take account of councils unable to provide data, the RAC believes the increase in reports over two years is 33%. As well as being a danger to road users, potholes also caused problems to vehicles. Among the most common were damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels. Earlier this year, drivers breaking down after hitting potholes reached a three-year high, according to the RAC. RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: ""Perhaps motorists are more inclined to report pothole defects than they were a few years ago, but we believe the sheer size of the increase is further proof the condition of our roads is worsening."" He added the figures were ""just the tip of the iceberg"" as thousands of potholes go unreported every year. One in five local roads in England and Wales is in a poor condition and the frequency of road resurfacing has declined, according to the Asphalt Industry Alliance. This video can not be played Why do we have so many potholes? In October's budget, Chancellor Philip Hammondannounced an extra Â£420m of funding for councils to tackle potholes, on top of an existing fund of almost Â£300m. Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's (LGA) transport spokesman said councils were fixing a pothole every 21 seconds but needed more funding to ""embark on the widespread improvement of our roads that is desperately needed"". He said the LGA was calling on the government to reinvest a portion of existing fuel duty into local road maintenance to fund a ""Â£9.3bn road repair backlog"". Kate said the danger of potholes hadn't ever occurred to her before Martyn was killed, and that she was driven to speak out after hearing a segment on potholes on the local radio. ""People were ringing up and saying my alloy wheels were damaged and it made me really angry,"" she said. ""They're far more dangerous than that.""

Tesla adds Larry Ellison to its board,"Oracle founder and chairman Larry Ellison Tesla has appointed Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Walgreens Boots Alliance executive Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to its board. The move  further strengthens the board as pledged by founder Elon Musk to the Securities and Exchanges Commission. The SEC fined Mr Muskover misleading tweets that he had funding to take Tesla private. Investors greeted the news by sending Tesla shares up more than 4% in morning Friday trading. Elon Musk remains as chief executive although he agreed with the SEC in October he would step down as chairman. Larry Ellison is the co-founder and chairman of enterprise cloud software firm Oracle - currently the third largest software maker in the world after Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet. He already owns three million shares of Tesla stock and is a close friend of Mr Musk. Actor Robert Downey Jr modelled the character of Tony Stark on Mr Musk for the film Iron Man in 2008, and in 2010, Mr Musk and Mr Ellison famously made cameo appearances in Iron Man 2 as fellow tech billionaires. Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man Kathleen Wilson-Thompson is the global head of human resources at international pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, and was previously an executive at Kellogg. The new appointments follow November's move byTesla to appoint Australian telecoms executive Robyn Denholmas its new chairman. In August, Mr Musk posted a tweet saying that he had secured funding to take the electric car maker off the stock market and make it a private company. He claimed that the funding proposal would value Tesla at $420 per share. Shares in the company briefly rose after his announcement, but later fell again. The SEC said the claim was ""false and misleading"", and decided to sue him for alleged securities fraud. Although he agreed to step down as chairman and pay a $20m (Â£15m) settlement fine, Mr Musk said recently thathe does not respect the SEC. Elon Musk has had a turbulent year The SEC settlement follows a turbulent year for Tesla and Mr Musk. In February,Tesla reported a record quarterly loss, partly caused by the carmaker's revamp of its manufacturing process to boost output of the Model 3. The revamp was needed after a surge of orders in 2017 saw it struggling to meet manufacturing targets and deliver cars to customers. This prompted worries about Tesla's finances and fanned concerns that customers would get impatient and cancel their bookings. In June,Tesla cut 9% of its workforceas part of a restructuring intended to reduce costs and boost profitability. In October the carmaker reported a quarterly profitfor just the third time in its 15-year history. In a striking and emotional interview to the New York Times in August, Mr Musk said he had not been on drugs when he posted the tweets about taking Tesla private. He did however say thathe was exhausted after working 120 hour weeks, and that the past year had been the ""most difficult and painful"" of his career.

Armed standoff ends after officer sings,"The police negotiator sang four verses of the festive classic White Christmas (file image) A successful police negotiator needs some key qualities. Calmness under pressure, a reassuring presence, and a knack for listening to name just a few. But it turns out that a decent singing voice can also come in handy. One Swat team negotiator in the US state of Pennsylvania brought an armed standoff to a close with his version of the festive classic White Christmas. But it is not clear whether the man surrendered due to the perfection or the sheer awfulness of the rendition. The nine-hour standoff began late on Christmas Day when a man in Chester County began behaving erratically and barricaded himself into his home. A worried family member called the police when the man allegedly armed himself with a rifle. But when officers arrived he reportedly opened fire, damaging a number of police vehicles. ""Over a long and cold night, they kept negotiating with the man,"" District Attorney Thomas Hogan wrote in a Facebook post. He said that he arrived on the scene with (Reindeer-shaped) Christmas biscuits to boost the morale of the officers before one negotiator made a sudden breakthrough. New York awe-struck as sky turns blue World's rarest bird gets new home Ill cricket fan is Australia captain for a day After prolonged talks, the man reportedly demanded that a police officer sing him White Christmas. A negotiator then sang four verses of the hit, thought to be the biggest-selling single of all time, before the man surrendered at 06:00 local time and was taken into custody.

Twelve migrants found off coast,"Border Force officers were deployed to bring the migrants to Dover Twelve more migrants in two separate boats have been detained off the coast of Dover as the local MP questioned why there was not more security in France. At about 03:00 GMT HM Coastguard received reports of a dinghy containing four men approaching the coast. Six hours later the Maritime Intelligence Bureau was notified of a small boat carrying Iranian men. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said they were ""working closely"" with their French counterparts. All of the migrants were taken to Dover and given a medical assessment before being transferred to immigration officials to be interviewed. In the first boat, one of the adults was found to be Syrian, the rest were Iranian. Damian Collins, MP for Folkestone and Hythe, said: ""We need to make it really clear to the migrants and the gangs that if you try and do this you will be detected early, either as you're preparing to leave or as soon as you're in the water you'll be returned to France. ""But I think we should be working with the French Authorities on policing that, and making that happen. But also understand why is it these people are not in the asylum system already? Why have they not claimed asylum?"" A third boat containing 11 migrants was found by French authorities on Thursday As of 28 December, at least 221 people, including 14 children, had crossed the Channel in small boats since 3 November. Mr Collins added: ""We're quite good at spotting vessels approaching the UK and either bringing them in, escorting them in, or having Border Force agents waiting for them when they land. ""This is the busiest shopping lane in the world and it's probably the most closely monitored. But what I don't understand is why are we not doing more to stop the boats leaving France in the first place?"" Bridget Chapman, from Kent Refugee Action Network, said the UK paid to ""beef-up"" the security around Calais, including the putting up of a large fence to prevent people accessing trains and lorries. She said that had made people ""resort to other methods to get here"", adding: ""I expect people traffickers are exploiting people, saying, you know, things are going to tighten up after Brexit, you need to go now."" Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""The number of incidents over recent days is deeply concerning. ""Some of this is clearly facilitated by organised crime groups while other attempts appear to be opportunistic."" UK and France team to target border crime Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? She said UK authorities were working closely with their French counterparts in a recently-opened joint intelligence centre in Calais to target people smugglers.

Why are migrants arriving in dinghies?,"This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 More than 100 migrants, claiming to be Iranian, have attempted the dangerous journey by small boat to the UK in the past three weeks. Why? On 23 November, shortly before sunrise, eight migrants were foundclinging to a dinghy in choppy watersoff the coast of Kent. They told their rescuers they had spent 12 hours at sea. It was a similar story the day before, when seven more were found in a boat just off the Dover coast - the same number of people had been pulled from an inflatable boat just a few hours earlier. Since 3 November, 101 migrants - including four children - have attempted the 21-mile journey across the Channel, one whichpolice have likenedto ""trying to cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". Border Force was called to Dover's marina on 22 November to deal with seven suspected migrants The Home Office has refused to publish official figures, but the BBC has established that at least that number have entered British shores since the start of the month. Without fail, the migrants have told officials they are Iranian. British and French authorities, under pressure to stem the rise in boat trips before a life is lost, face several questions. Why have so many boats set off for the coast of Kent? What can be done to stop it? And why are all the occupants apparently from the Middle Eastern country? The answer to the last question could lie 1,200 miles away in the Serbian capital of Belgrade. A French helicopter joined the rescue effort on 22 November Miodrag ÄakiÄ, chief executive of Refugee Aid Serbia, which monitors migration through the Balkans, believes migrants arriving in the UK are among the thousands who flew into Serbia after the country began offering visa-free access to Iranians in August last year. The move was ostensibly intended to increase tourism and trade between Iran, the world's 25th largest economy, and Serbia, the 90th. The visa scheme - which attracted allegations it was being abused by migrants seeking access to western Europe - ended on 17 October, by which time some 40,000 Iranians were said to have flown to the Balkan nation. It is unknown how many returned home, but according to the Associated Press, local media reported that direct flights from Tehran to Belgrade had been arriving full and returning empty. BBC reporter Simon Jones tweeted a picture of this boat after one rescue near Dover According to Info Park, a refugee support centre in Belgrade, Serbian police estimate the number of Iranians who failed to return at 12,000. Mr ÄakiÄ said it was believed within the refugee community that Iranians were using ""false passports and more complex methods"" to enter western Europe. They arrived better prepared for the journey ahead and would stay in hostels or hotels. Most refugees in Serbia slept in squats, while Iranians reportedly stayed in hotels Meanwhile, refugees from countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, travelled thousands of kilometres on foot and ended up living on the streets or in derelict buildings across Belgrade. Compared to fellow migrants, the Iranians looked ""more like tourists... they were kids in hoodies and jeans, with backpacks"", said Gordan Paunovic, of Info Park. ""Many of [the Iranians] were travelling with fake passports, which were costing between 3,000 to 6,000 euros in Istanbul. ""They didn't share the normal fate of refugees and migrants who have a very hard time in the Balkans. They would not be forced to sleep rough or go to refugee centres like the other people. ""They were here for a month, staying in hotels, and would find a smuggler to make other arrangements."" Iranians were said not to have shared ""the normal fate"" of migrants in the Balkans Iranians may be set apart from fellow migrants by their economic prosperity, yet for many living under the repressive regime, life is far from easy. Kaveh Kalantri, of the Iranian Association, which supports refugees in the UK, said a lack of freedom and human rights violations were driving some Iranians out. ""People get arrested if they have liberal or left-wing views, or if they are from religious minorities. A lot of people experience violence on a daily basis."" Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, it has been estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 Iranians have left the country every year. In the past two years, Iranian citizens have made more UK asylum applications than any other nationality, according to Home Office figures. In 2017, they accounted for 9% of the 26,350 applications. ""Iranians coming to the UK is not unusual, but the way they are coming is,"" Mr Kalantri said. Tens of thousands of Iranians are said to have flown into Belgrade One theory as to why Iranians are choosing to risk their lives on boats stems from their comparative wealth - simply put, they can afford to pay smuggling gangs to get them onboard a vessel. Maya Konforti, of L'Auberge des Migrants, a refugee support group in Calais, described the attempted crossings as ""the speciality of Iranians"". ""Crossing by boat can only be done by people who have some money. Africans don't have any left by the time they arrive in Calais,"" she said. ""There is a new influx of Iranians arriving in Calais. They seem to be the only ones who both dare to do it and find the means to do so."" The Calais Jungle was dismantled in 2016, but migrants from across Africa and the Middle East continue to live in camps Mr ÄakiÄ suggested Iranians heading for Kent had entered the EU via Serbia. ""I don't see any other explanation. Serbia was the only country on the Balkan Route that had a significant number of Iranians."" Not everyone believes all the migrants are Iranian. Prof Adib-Moghaddam, from the Centre for Iranian Studies at SOAS University of London, suspects most of them are of Afghan origin. However, immigration specialist Emma Nawaz said she ""could not see what benefit they would achieve by falsely saying that they are Iranian"". Life and death on Mediterranean rescue boat Which industries employ European workers? How has EU migration changed the UK? Regardless, the ""surge"" in attempts is being fuelled by ""organised criminal and mafia networks"" in France, according to Ingrid Parrot, who works for the Maritime prefecture - the Border Force equivalent based in Cherbourg. She said there had been 30 attempted crossings in 2018, 12 in 2017, and 23 the year before. The majority failed because the vessels were too small - mostly canoes, dinghies and ""makeshift"" boats - but several attempts in 2018 have been made in pleasure crafts and speedboats, which have seen a spike in thefts. Ingrid Parrot says ""our fear is having bodies on the beaches"" Border Force officers have reported that ""access to small craft was getting easier and cheaper, creating more opportunities for criminals to involve themselves in the facilitation of clandestine entry and smuggling,"" according to an inspection of the South Coast ports,published this month. But understanding the true scale of the issue is complicated by the department's insistence that revealing the number of so-called ""clandestine entries"" made by boat would ""prejudice the operation of immigration controls"". Dover and Deal MP Charlie Elphicke, who described the rise in boat crossings as ""unprecedented"", said Border Force needed more resources, including investment in additional patrol boats to act as a deterrent. He said the number of migrants detected in lorries in Dover had ""plummeted"" by more than a third since the Calais Jungle was dismantled. But Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, said the increase in boat crossings was a ""natural consequence of the hostile environment and tightening up the borders"". ""People are having to find ways that are more and more dangerous,"" she added. In the past 21 days, 12 groups of migrants have attempted the crossing from France to England Ashford MP and former immigration minister Damian Green said emphasis should be placed on ""actually knowing where people are coming from [and] breaking up the international criminal gangs that are actually behind this"". ""If we do need more resources, that's where they should go,"" he added. The Home Office said officials were focusing on ""identifying and dismantling the organised crime groups that facilitate illegal immigration"". Ms Parrot said the French were already ""strengthening measures"" to prevent attempted crossings, rather than focusing only on launching rescue operations. ""Our greatest fear is, on the one hand, a collision that leads to a loss of human life and, what's more, an accident at sea that we need to assist with,"" she said. ""On the other hand, our other fear is having injured people at sea and bodies on the beaches. We do not want it to come to that.""

Channel migrants declared major incidentHome Secretary Sajid Javid takes control of the response after a rising number of migrants attempt to cross the English Channel.UK,"Border Force officials detained 12 adult migrants on Friday The rising number of migrants attempting to cross the Channel in small boats has been declared a ""major incident"" by the UK home secretary. Sajid Javid has asked for an urgent call with his French counterpart about the situation. The Home Office said there was ""concern that it is only a matter of time before people lose their lives"". It comes after at least 221 migrants have attempted to cross the Channel to England since the start of November. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Most recently,12 people were detainedoff the coast of Dover in the early hours of Friday morning. Officials on both sides of the Channel have warned of the dangers of crossing what is the world's busiest shipping lane in a small boat.Police have likenedthe journey to trying to ""cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". In a statement, the Home Office said Mr Javid had ""taken control of the response"" to the situation. The 12 detained on Friday were brought to shore and given a medical assessment in Dover before being transferred to immigration officials The latest detention comes after 40 migrants were rescued from the Channel on Christmas Day Mr Javid has been appointed ""gold commander"",meaning he has ultimate responsibility,externalfor the handling and outcome of the incident and sets out a strategy of how to deal with it. He will now receive daily updates from the Home Office, and has spoken to Border Force officials, Immigration Enforcement and the National Crime Agency in a conference call. The Home Office added: ""The home secretary has also asked for an urgent call with his French counterpart over the weekend to reaffirm the continuing need for the UK and France to work closely together to tackle the problem. ""He has also commissioned detailed options from Border Force about the provision of additional vessels in the Channel, including another Border Force cutter, and whether this is likely to encourage more people to try and make the crossing rather than act as a deterrence."" Bridget Chapman, from the charity Kent Refugee Action Network, said the situation was in part a result of UK measures to ""beef up the security around Calais"". ""We've put a big fence up to prevent people from accessing trains and lorries and people are resorting to other methods to get here,"" she told the BBC. ""It's winter, but the weather has been quite good. And I expect people traffickers are exploiting people, saying, 'You know, things are going to tighten up after Brexit, you need to go now.'"" Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies Syrian refugees: The people who want four things before they go home Many of the migrants are Iranian or Syrian. More than five million Syrians have left their country since its civil war started in 2011, and in the past two years, Iranian citizens have made more UK asylum applications than any other nationality according to Home Office figures. ABBC South East investigation last monthfound that people smugglers were telling migrants they must enter before ""the borders shut properly"" after Brexit. British and French authorities have both said the rise in crossings is the result of ""organised criminality"" and ""mafia networks"". Earlier, Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said the number of incidents over recent days was ""deeply concerning"" and crossing the water in a dinghy was ""extremely dangerous"". She is due to visit Border Force officers in Dover on Saturday to discuss the situation. This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 The MP for Folkestone in Kent, Damian Collins, questioned why the UK was not doing more to stop the boats leaving France in the first place. He said: ""We need to make it really clear to the migrants and the gangs that if you try and do this you will be detected early, either as you're preparing to leave or as soon as you're in the water, and you'll be returned to France."" Charlie Elphicke - MP for Dover and Deal - suggested more patrol vessels may be needed. ""One is simply not enough and I think we need to ask questions, what are the two patrol craft doing in the Mediterranean - would they be better placed in the English Channel?"" Responding to the suggestion that bringing rescued migrants to the UK could encourage people to attempt the journey, Steve Valdez-Symonds, from Amnesty International, said that was ""nonsense"". ""If people are in danger of their lives then they need to be saved,"" he told the BBC. ""This is exactly the sort of nonsense we've heard in response to the desperate circumstances where thousands of people have drowned in the Mediterranean. When search and rescue has been withdrawn, more people die."" 28 December -Twelve migrants in two separate boatsdetained off the coast of Dover 27 December -Some 23 migrants, including three children, were detained in Kent aftercrossing the channel in small three boats 26 December -Three migrantsbrought ashore by Border Force 25 December -Forty migrants, including two children,crossed the Channel in five boats 15 December -Four children are among a group of11 people rescued off Dover.

Fisherman clung on to nets for five miles,"This video can not be played A skipper of another vessel held fisherman Nathan Rogers above water until a lifeboat arrived A quick-thinking fisherman who fell overboard managed to cling on to his nets for five miles and was dragged behind his boat back to shore. Nathan Rogers, who is in his late 30s, was ""amazingly"" lucky to survive the ordeal off Cornwall, the RNLI said. He had been adjusting the nets when he fell in but the boat kept powering forward on autopilot until it crashed into Newlyn's South Pier on Thursday. A lifeboat brought him to shore and he was treated for severe hypothermia. The vessel crashed into Newlyn's South Pier Penlee Lifeboat coxswain Patch Harvey said a young boy raised the alarm early on Thursday afternoon when he spotted the ""very well known and popular fisherman"" in the water, about 90ft (27m) from his vessel. Eleven-year-old Louis Matisse Nicholls said: ""I was beach cleaning and I saw a man fall off his boat. ""I just saw a big splash and I saw his head bobbing up and down, and I just saw the boat crash right into the harbour. I told my dad to phone 999."" Latest news and stories from Cornwall When the lifeboat arrived Mr Rogers was being held up in the water by the skipper of another fishing boat. ""He was very, very cold,"" he said, ""We are just amazed he managed to hold on for so long."" Nathan Rogers is recovering at home with his family He added: ""He was moving his hydraulic hauler from one side of the boat to the other and fell over with it. Luckily the hauler was connected to the boat with hydraulic hoses and they managed to stay intact all the way in. ""If they had snapped he wouldn't be here now."" It is believed the boat was travelling at speeds of up to six knots, or about 7mph (11kmph). Mr Rogers was now recovering at home, the RNLI said. The fisherman was ""amazingly lucky"" to have survived, rescuers said.

Speeding lie MP 'to stay in Parliament',"Fiona Onasanya has said she plans to stay on in the House of Commons An MP who lied to police about a speeding offence has said she plans to stay on in the House of Commons, despite facing a possible jail term. Writing in her local newspaper, Fiona Onasanya said constituents should ""rest assured"" she will remain their MP. The Peterborough MP, 35, wasconvicted of perverting the course of justiceat the Old Bailey earlier this month. She has been expelled by Labour, but will only lose her seat in the Commons if she is jailed for more than a year. In the article in thePeterborough Telegraph,external, Ms Onasanya did not mention her conviction for lying to police to avoid a speeding charge. The piece, headlined ""I will continue to fight against injustices"", focused instead on her ""successful year"" in politics. Ms Onasanya wrote: ""It's an honour to be your voice for change over an incredibly consequential period of British politics. ""You can rest assured that I will continue to do so as your representative in the corridors of power."" The paper's editor, Mark Edwards, said it would have been ""wrong"" to deny readers the chance to read what Ms Onasanya had submitted. He said: ""While she is still the MP - and therefore the elected representative - to censor the column would, in my view, be wrong."" Ms Onasanya will be sentenced in January.

Family of Britons killed in crash 'horrified',"The accident took place on a bridge over the area of NÃºpsvÃ¶tn on Iceland's ring road The family of two British sisters-in-law and a baby girl who died in a car crash while on holiday in Iceland have called it a ""horrifying shock"". In a statement, they said they were ""deeply saddened"" by what had happened. The tourists were in a Toyota Land Cruiserwhen it crashedthrough the railing of a bridge on Thursday. The women are believed to be Rajshree and Khushboo Laturia. The baby is understood to be Rajshree's daughter Shreeprabha, born this year. Police - who have not officially released the names of those involved - said the women were with their husbands, Shreeraj and Supreme Laturia. The two families were travelling around Iceland together when their car left the bridge and fell eight metres onto a river bank. The two men and two other children aged seven and nine were also seriously hurt in the crash and all four were airlifted to hospital. The baby who died was less than a year old and travelling in a car seat. In a statement released on Friday evening, the family said: ""The fatal car crash near Skaftafell in Iceland on the morning of December 27, 2018 has come as a horrifying shock for the entire family and friends. ""The Indian, British and Icelandic authorities have been extremely co-operative and extended appropriate support. ""Our family is deeply saddened so we request you to kindly respect our privacy and give us the space to grieve in peace at this difficult time."" TheIndian Ambassador to Iceland,externalsaid relatives from India would be travelling to Iceland. The accident happened at around 9:30 GMT on Thursday on Iceland's national ring road - also known as Route 1 - in an area called NÃºpsvÃ¶tn, between the town of KirkjubÃ¦jarklaustur and Skaftafell. The area is a popular destination for tourists, and the families were heading east on the road towards the VatnajÃ¶kull National Park - which is home to the largest glacier in Europe as well as waterfalls and mountains. Police said tests had shown the driver of the car had not been drinking alcohol. ""The cause of the accident is unknown and under investigation by the police and the investigative committee for transport accidents,"" officers added. ""The car was driven to the east, along the Sudurlandsvegur road, and seems to have turned on the bridge with the result that it went on top of the railing of the bridge, to the right, following it for a short distance and then turned over off the rail and the bridge. ""There, the car fell down on the ground beneath the bridge."" Chief Superintendent Sveinn Kristjan Runarsson said the road was not thought to have been icy, but humidity could have made the bridge's surface - which is made of steel - slippery. A police car blocks off part of Route 1 on Thursday One of the first people on the scene was tour guide Adolf Erlingsson, who told BBC News he believed the driver had lost control. Describing the bank that the car fell down onto, Mr Erlingsson said: ""It's kind of sandy, there's no rivers so it wasn't submerged in water. It just landed there on a sandy bottom and flipped over and was totally destroyed,"" he said. He added that he got out of his van and went to see if he could help emergency services. ""The car was a total wreck. When I got there four people were out of the car, one of them deceased. Then there were three people trapped in the car. ""The driver was alive and trapped more or less under the dashboard. We were trying to get the people out of the car and helping them, it was a very difficult situation.""

Facebook crowdfund couple has girl,"Baby Isla was born thanks to mothers the couple have never met raising Â£2,000 for IVF A couple who underwent IVF treatment paid for by friends from a Facebook group have had a baby girl. Marisha Chaplin, 26, and Jon Hibbs, 29, who met while undergoing cancer treatment, had already had a daughter through IVF but could not afford a second round. A band of social media mums secretly raised Â£2,000 for the couple - despite never having met them. Ms Chaplin gave birth to Isla on Saturday via Caesarean section. The new mother-of-two, from Cotgrave, Nottinghamshire, said she broke the news to members of the Facebook group as soon as she could. ""I messaged them on the Saturday morning when I was still pretty much out of it from all the drugs I had from the operation,"" she said. ""It's amazing, it really is. It's better than we ever imagined and we didn't think we would ever get to this point."" She added that Evie, now two and a half, was ""absolutely in love with her little sister"", and the couple were ""so grateful"" to those who had donated. Marisha Chaplin, 26, and Jon Hibbs, 29, also have a daughter called Evie The couple met as teenagers in 2007 when Ms Chaplin was having treatment and her future partner Mr Hibbs came in for a check-up. ""I saw him and said to our Clic Sargent worker 'I fancy him' basically, and she said she could give him my MSN address,"" said Ms Chaplin. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands She knew she would have fertility problems due to her cancer treatment so they started trying for a baby when she was 16. ""I was told by the time I was 23 my ovaries would give up,"" she said. ""At 16 my gynaecologist said 'You need to try for children sooner rather than later if you want them'."" This video can not be played The money was raised secretly and revealed in a video played via Facebook Live They started IVF using donor eggs when Ms Chaplin was 23 and had Evie in May 2016. She then joined the Facebook group, called May Babies 2016, which was for other mothers who had given birth at the same time. After raising Â£2,000 last July, members created a video to surprise the couple and played it to them via Facebook Live. In the emotional clip, Ms Chaplin starts to cry even before being told they had raised the money. England's images of 2018 Fox found napping on microwave Fisherman clung on to nets for five miles The couple used frozen embryos left over from their previous IVF treatment, meaning Evie and Isla are full genetic sisters. ""We didn't ever think we had the chance to have another little one and the fact she's here is so surreal,"" said Ms Chaplin. ""Even when she came out we were like 'Is that our baby? Is this real?'""

Royal Mail criticised for D-Day stamp mix-up,"Royal Mail has withdrawn a stamp design marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day - after BBC News pointed out it showed US troops landing in what was Dutch New Guinea, nearly 8,500 miles from France. The stamp was due to be released next year in a ""Best of British"" collection. Captioned ""Allied soldiers and medics wade ashore"", it was said to depict the Normandy landings but was actually taken in what is modern-day Indonesia. People who saw the errorin a social media preview,externalcalled it ""embarrassing"". The image appears on theAmerican National WWII Museum website,,externalattributed to the US Coast Guard, and is said to show troops carrying stretchers from a landing craft at Sarmi, Dutch New Guinea on 17 May 1944. The D-Day landings did not take place until 6 June that year, when British, US and Canadian forces landed on the beaches of northern France. The landings were the first stage of Operation Overlord - the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe - and were intended to end World War Two. What was D-Day and why is it important? Royal Mail had revealed a preview of its 2019 Special Stamp programme, showcasing the ""Best of British"" on Thursday. Others depicted a red kite to celebrate the UK's birds of prey and commemorated the bicentenary of the birth of Queen Victoria. The 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings  was to be marked by a set of 11 stamps, in what the Royal Mail called ""a timely commemoration of all those who participated"" using ""images from the day itself"".

Paul Woodadge, 49, a D-Day historian and former tour guide living in Normandy, who is originally from Essex, said: ""It's quite shocking really."" Speaking before Royal Mail announced it was withdrawing the stamp, he said: ""It's going to be the 75th anniversary of D-Day - the last one where there's any veterans around who will remember it. ""These stamps are the kind of thing people will buy for their fathers and grandfathers."" A Twitter account for World War Two tours of Jersey tweeted Royal Mail to point out that the featured ship, LCI-30, did not participate in the Normandy landings. A good alternative? Paul Woodadge suggested this image of Royal Marines at Normandy's Juno Beach would suit a special stamp Writing on Facebook, Peter Simpson said the stamp was ""offensive and disrespectful of those that lost their lives on D-Day"". Late on Thursday, a Royal Mail spokeswoman said: ""We work very hard to ensure that our Special Stamp programme appropriately commemorates anniversaries and events that are relevant to UK heritage and life. ""We would like to offer our sincere apologies that our preview release for our 2019 Special Stamp programme included a stamp design which had been incorrectly associated with the D-Day landings. ""We can confirm that this image will not be part of the final set, which will be issued in June 2019.""

""The cause of the accident is unknown and under investigation by the police and the investigative committee for transport accidents,"" officers added. ""The car was driven to the east, along the Sudurlandsvegur road, and seems to have turned on the bridge with the result that it went on top of the railing of the bridge, to the right, following it for a short distance and then turned over off the rail and the bridge. ""There, the car fell down on the ground beneath the bridge."" Chief Superintendent Sveinn Kristjan Runarsson said the road was not thought to have been icy, but humidity could have made the bridge's surface - which is made of steel - slippery. A police car blocks off part of Route 1 on Thursday One of the first people on the scene was tour guide Adolf Erlingsson, who told BBC News he believed the driver had lost control. Describing the bank that the car fell down onto, Mr Erlingsson said: ""It's kind of sandy, there's no rivers so it wasn't submerged in water. It just landed there on a sandy bottom and flipped over and was totally destroyed,"" he said. He added that he got out of his van and went to see if he could help emergency services. ""The car was a total wreck. When I got there four people were out of the car, one of them deceased. Then there were three people trapped in the car. ""The driver was alive and trapped more or less under the dashboard. We were trying to get the people out of the car and helping them, it was a very difficult situation.""

Syrian army deploys to key city Manbij,"Forces from the US-led coalition against IS are also present in Manbij The Syrian army has entered the key northern city of Manbij for the first time in six years, an army spokesman has said. However the US-led coalition operating in the area said it had not seen military changes inside Manbij. A US official and a UK-based monitoring group said Syrian troops had deployed in the area around the city. US-backed Kurds withdrew and invited Syrian forces to replace them amid fears that Turkish troops would attack. Turkey considers the US-backed Kurdish YPG forces to be part of a terrorist group. The Kurds' request to the Syrian government followed the shock announcement that all US troops are to withdraw from Syria. President Donald Trump announced the pullout of some 2,000 troops last week, asserting that the Islamic State group (IS) had been defeated. Why the battle for northern Syria matters Who are the Kurds Why is there a war in Syria? But that claim has been disputed by important allies who say the move could lead to a resurgence of IS. The Syrian army said it had raised a flag in Manbij. In a televised statement, a spokesman said the troops were there to ""crush terrorism and defeat all invaders and occupiers"".

Twelve migrants detained off coast,"Border Force officers were deployed to bring the migrants to Dover Twelve more migrants in two separate boats have been detained off the coast of Dover as the local MP questioned why there was not more security in France. At about 03:00 GMT HM Coastguard received reports of a dinghy containing four men approaching the coast. Six hours later the Maritime Intelligence Bureau was notified of a small boat carrying Iranian men. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said they were ""working closely"" with their French counterparts. All of the migrants were taken to Dover and given a medical assessment before being transferred to immigration officials to be interviewed. In the first boat, one of the adults was found to be Syrian, the rest were Iranian. Damian Collins, MP for Folkestone and Hythe, said: ""We need to make it really clear to the migrants and the gangs that if you try and do this you will be detected early, either as you're preparing to leave or as soon as you're in the water you'll be returned to France. ""But I think we should be working with the French Authorities on policing that, and making that happen. But also understand why is it these people are not in the asylum system already? Why have they not claimed asylum?"" A third boat containing 11 migrants was found by French authorities on Thursday As of 28 December, at least 221 people, including 14 children, had crossed the Channel in small boats since 3 November. Mr Collins added: ""We're quite good at spotting vessels approaching the UK and either bringing them in, escorting them in, or having Border Force agents waiting for them when they land. ""This is the busiest shopping lane in the world and it's probably the most closely monitored. But what I don't understand is why are we not doing more to stop the boats leaving France in the first place?"" Bridget Chapman, from Kent Refugee Action Network, said the UK paid to ""beef-up"" the security around Calais, including the putting up of a large fence to prevent people accessing trains and lorries. She said that had made people ""resort to other methods to get here"", adding: ""I expect people traffickers are exploiting people, saying, you know, things are going to tighten up after Brexit, you need to go now."" Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""The number of incidents over recent days is deeply concerning. ""Some of this is clearly facilitated by organised crime groups while other attempts appear to be opportunistic."" UK and France team to target border crime Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? She said UK authorities were working closely with their French counterparts in a recently-opened joint intelligence centre in Calais to target people smugglers. She reiterated that attempting to cross the Channel in a dinghy was ""extremely dangerous"" and warned that people were putting their lives at risk to do so. 27 December -Some 23 migrants, including three children, were detained in Kent aftercrossing the channel in small three boats 26 December -Three migrantsbrought ashore by Border Force 25 December -Forty migrants, including two children,crossed the Channel in five boats 15 December -Four children are among a group of11 people rescued off Dover.

Hackers steal data of N Korean defectors,"When defectors arrive in South Korea, they are put through a state resettlement programme Almost 1,000 North Korean defectors have had their personal data leaked after a computer at a South Korean resettlement centre was hacked, the unification ministry said. A personal computer at the state-run centre was found to have been ""infected with a malicious code"". The ministry said this is thought to be the first large-scale information leak involving North Korean defectors. The hackers' identity and the origin of the cyber-attack is not yet confirmed. Could defectors affect North Korea talks? N Korea defector numbers 'drop' under Kim My friend the North Korean defector The North Gyeongsang resettlement centre is among 25 institutes the ministry runs to help an estimated 32,000 defectors adjust to life in South Korea. The North Korean government does not know the identities of all citizens who have defected. Some may be considered ""missing persons"" or they may have even been registered as dead. Some 997 North Korean defectors have now been informed that their names, birth dates and addresses have been leaked but it is not clear what impact this will have. Analysts say there are some concerns that the leak could endanger the defectors' family members who remain in North Korea. Sokeel Park, South Korea Country Director for Liberty in North Korea, an international NGO that assists North Korean defectors, says this hack will make other defectors feel less safe living in South Korea. They may change their names, phone numbers and home addresses. Investigations by the unification ministry and the police are currently ongoing, with the ministry saying it would ""do its best to prevent such an incident from happening again"". On 19 December, the ministry became aware of the leak after they found a malicious program installed on a desktop at a centre in North Gyeongsang province. North Korean defectors are seen here at a different resettlement facility in South Korea The ministry said that no computers at other Hana (resettlement) centres across the country had been hacked. One expert on North Korean cyber-warfare, Simon Choi, believes that this might not be the first time a Hana centre has been hacked. ""[There is a North Korean hacking] group [that] mainly targets [the] North Korean defector community... we are aware that [this group] tried to hack a Hana centre last year,"" he told the BBC. However, he added that it was not yet clear if any North Korean groups were responsible for the latest attack. Cyber-security experts have been warning of the increasing sophistication of hackers from the North for some time. In September, US prosecutors charged a North Korean man alleged to have been involved in creating the malicious software used to cripple the UK's National Health Service. The 2017 incident left NHS staff reverting to pen and paper after being locked out of computer systems. One of the most high profile hacks linked to North Korea in recent years targeted Sony's entertainment business in 2014 - wiping out massive amounts of data and leading to the online distribution of emails, and sensitive personal data. North Korean state media has also often threatened to silence defectors in the South who make derogatory statements about the regime. Sokeel Park told the BBC that cyber-attacks and phishing attempts on people working on North Korea are a common occurrence. ""They represent an asymmetric advantage for the North Korean authorities because attribution for cyber-attacks is so difficult and because the North Korean government intentionally relies so little on the internet"", he added. However, the government in the South has not pointed the finger at North Korea this time. N Korea defector numbers 'drop' under Kim Stupid questions North Koreans are asked.

Acclaimed Israeli author Amos Oz dies,"Oz's novels were translated into more than 40 languages Amos Oz, the leading Israeli author and a prominent advocate for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, has died of cancer at the age of 79. His most acclaimed works included the best-selling 2002 autobiographical novel A Tale of Love and Darkness. It was adapted for the big screen in 2015, directed by Natalie Portman. Early support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict led some to brand Oz a traitor - which he said he wore as ""a badge of honour"". The news of his death was announced by his daughter, historian Fania Oz-Salzberger. ""My beloved father passed away from cancer, just now, after a rapid deterioration, when he was sleeping at peace, surrounded by the people who love him,"" shewrote on Twitter,external. ""Please respect our privacy. I will not be able to comment. Thank you to those who loved him."" Oz's novel A Tale of Love and Darkness was adapted for the big screen, directed by and starring Natalie Portman Oz was one of Israel's most widely-read and best-known writers, winning awards including the Israel Prize, the German Heinrich Heine prize, the French Legion d'Honeur and a membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His books have been translated into 45 languages and he was often tipped as a candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature. He was born Amos Klausner in Jerusalem in 1939, and the city would provide a canvas for many of his works. His breakthrough novel, 1968's My Michael, was written while he worked in a kibbutz and describes the love and marriage of a young woman against the background of 1950s Jerusalem. Referring to A Tale of Love and Darkness, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said: ""It was a tale of love and light, and now, a great darkness. ""Rest in peace, dear Amos. You gave us great pleasure.""

He said: ""We need to divide it. We need to work out a mutually acceptable compromise."" Speaking to BBC Two's Newsnight in 2016 about the reaction to his views in his home country, he said: ""I've been called a traitor many times in my life. I think I'm in wonderful company.

If they called Israel the devil incarnate, I think they are obsessed, I think they are mad, but this is still legitimate.

Did streaming cause HMV to fail?,"Was your first reaction to this morning's news about HMV: ""I thought they went bust years ago."" Well, in a way you were right. In 2013, with sales plunging more than 10%, the firm called in the administrators. Back then the retail analystMark Saunders told the Guardian,external: ""In the digital era where 73.4% of music and film are downloaded or bought online, HMV's business model has simply become increasingly irrelevant and unsustainable."" But restructuring company Hilco saw value in a business selling music and video on the high street, buying it out of administration and keeping around half the stores open. It seemed to go quite well for a while, with the flagship store on Oxford Street re-opened and HMV overtaking Amazon in 2015 as the biggest seller of physical music in the UK. Early this year, Hilco was boasting that it had won the Turnaround of the Decade award for its achievements with the entertainment retailer. But another wave of the digital revolution appears to have halted the turnaround in its tracks. Back in 2013, it was downloads that were blamed for HMV's troubles. But they have gone into decline and streaming of both music and video is the new normal. In millions of households, watching a movie now means turning to Netflix rather than selecting a DVD, and listening to music means streaming it from Spotify instead of heading up to the attic to hunt through old CDs. ""It is disappointing to see the market, particularly for DVD, deteriorate so rapidly in the last 12 months as consumers switch at an ever increasing pace to digital services,"" said Hilco Capital's executive chairman Paul McGowan in a statement. ""During the key Christmas trading period the market for DVD fell by over 30% compared to the previous year and, whilst HMV performed considerably better than that, such a deterioration in a key sector of the market is unsustainable."" With video and music still its main sources of revenue, HMV was always likely to be one of the retailers struggling to make it through the Christmas holidays. But this is about more than a struggle to adapt to changing consumer habits. HMV faced the same pressures of low consumer confidence, high rents and a lacklustre Christmas that have put other high street names in danger. And don't be surprised if this is not the end of the story. The Entertainment Retailers Association points out that when you tot up music, video and games there is still a market of nearly Â£2bn worth of physical products. Big releases such as The Greatest Showman, Ed Sheeran and Adele have still attracted millions who want to own a physical copy. So maybe there is another turnaround specialist out there to keep the HMV name alive into its second century.

The rise and fall of a music icon,"The HMV Store opening luncheon in July 1921 with Sir Edward Elgar (sixth from left) It was on 20 July 1921 that British composer Sir Edward Elgar opened the doors of a new shop at 363 Oxford Street, named ""His Master's Voice"". But the history of the brand that became known as HMV reaches back to the introduction of the gramophone in the 1890s. HMV on brink of second collapse The inventor of the music player, Emile Berliner, got help from William Barry Owen and Trevor Williams to record and manufacture records for his devices, and the trio set up the Gramophone Company in 1898. Once formed, the outfit focused on creating records and players in its factory in Hayes and distributing them to independent shops around the country. But to make them stand out, an iconic logo was needed. Owen bought a painting entitled ""His Master's Voice"" in 1899 from the artist Francis Barruad, featuring Nipper the Dog staring into an Edison cylinder phonograph. The original logo for His Master's Voice, inspired by a painting of Nipper the Dog He asked the painter to substitute it with a gramophone and a year later the company had gained the rights to the picture and what was to become one of the most recognisable brands in music. It became their official trademark in 1909 and while the Gramophone Company was never officially called His Master's Voice Company, the famous pooch on the records meant it was how the public knew them. As a result, it was a natural choice of name for their first store. A couple looking at radios in the window of HMV in 1937 The shop at 363 Oxford Street was destroyed by fire in 1937 and a temporary shop was set up on Bond Street until its reopening in 1939 - with the addition of an air-raid shelter for World War Two. Despite the horror of the war, music lived on, with patriotic songs becoming popular throughout the 1930s and 1940s. HMV also introduced listening posts so customers could come in and listen to records before they took them home - an initiative replicated across the industry. A woman at the first listening booths in HMV in the 1930s Come the 1950s, the world was set to be shaken with a more positive force, as pop music exploded. More than 280 million singles were sold through the decade in the UK and HMV became a magnet for music lovers. These included as Cliff Richard, who cut a demo in the shop's studios and then secured a deal with the shop's parent company EMI, and Brian Epstein, who wanted to do the same for a then-unknown act, The Beatles. Revamped listening posts in 1953 By 1966, HMV began to expand, first in London and then through the rest of the country. In just six years, it doubled in size and became the UK's largest music retailer. The 1970s saw rivals come to bite at its heels. Our Price grew from its humble beginnings in London's Finchley Road, specialising in cassettes and eight tracks, to takeover as the country's second-biggest music seller after Woolworths, and Richard Branson opened his flagship Virgin Megastores a stone's throw from HMV on Oxford Street in 1976. Shoppers browsing and buying in HMV in 1976 But come the 1980s, with the introduction of the compact disc and a 50,000ft flagship store opening in a new Oxford Street premises, HMV was back in the game. The chain was at the heart of the invention of in-store appearances by the biggest acts of the day. Paul McCartney, Michael Jackson, Madonna, David Bowie and Kate Bush were just some of the multi-million selling artists to grace its stores, signing CDs and playing exclusive sets for those who managed to squeeze in between the record racks. David Bowie launching an album at HMV The 1990s saw more growth in sales for HMV and more expansion as the rise of grunge and hip hop dominated the charts. The chain opened its 100th store in 1997 and McCartney returned to Oxford Street to re-launch its flagship, with more than 5,000 people turning up to watch. And as the DVD format rose in popularity, HMV jumped onboard, helping the company expand to more than 200 stores by 2004. In the 2000s, more stars continued to flock to the shops to sell their wares, including Beyonce, Amy Winehouse and Lady Gaga. Amy Winehouse poses for photos outside HMV Oxford Street in 2004 But along with new music, it was the decade that saw the launch of Apple's iPod, and the digital revolution had begun. After a raft of acquisitions by HMV, buying out smaller chains like Fopp and its rival Zavvi, as well as entering the live music business with Mean Fiddler, things took a turn. The year after digital music revenues overtook sales of physical formats for the first time in 2012, HMV appointed Deloitte as company administrators and suspended shares. Little Mix launching an album in HMV Loyal fans of the shops breathed a sigh of relief as Hilco, a firm that specialises in restructuring, took over the company and its 141 stores in a deal worth Â£50m. HMV was to live another day, and despite closing its major store on Oxford Street, it returned to its original home at number 363 in October 2013, reinstating its retro signage and welcoming more acts, such as Stormzy and Kylie. The retro signage was reinstalled when HMV moved back to its original flagship store in 2013 But it was still being hit hard by the expansion of online shopping, the creation of streaming services and the cold hard fact that fewer people were buying physical formats. Just days after the Christmas festivities of 2018, the retailer was poised to go into administration again - with more than 120 stores and 2,200 staff at risk. After a bidding war, it was announced that some of the stores will be saved by the Canadian entrepreneur, Doug Putman, Despite the rescue, fears over the long term future of the famous HMV brand are unlikely to go away.

Twelve migrants detained off Dover coast,"Border Force officers were deployed to bring the migrants to Dover Twelve more migrants in two separate boats have been detained off the coast of Dover as the local MP questioned why there was not more security in France. At about 03:00 GMT HM Coastguard received reports of a dinghy containing four men approaching the coast. Six hours later the Maritime Intelligence Bureau was notified of a small boat carrying Iranian men. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said they were ""working closely"" with their French counterparts. All of the migrants were taken to Dover and given a medical assessment before being transferred to immigration officials to be interviewed. In the first boat, one of the adults was found to be Syrian, the rest were Iranian. Damian Collins, MP for Folkestone and Hythe, said: ""We need to make it really clear to the migrants and the gangs that if you try and do this you will be detected early, either as you're preparing to leave or as soon as you're in the water you'll be returned to France. ""But I think we should be working with the French Authorities on policing that, and making that happen. But also understand why is it these people are not in the asylum system already? Why have they not claimed asylum?"" A third boat containing 11 migrants was found by French authorities on Thursday As of 28 December, at least 221 people, including 14 children, had crossed the Channel in small boats since 3 November. Mr Collins added: ""We're quite good at spotting vessels approaching the UK and either bringing them in, escorting them in, or having Border Force agents waiting for them when they land. ""This is the busiest shopping lane in the world and it's probably the most closely monitored. But what I don't understand is why are we not doing more to stop the boats leaving France in the first place?"" Bridget Chapman, from Kent Refugee Action Network, said the UK paid to ""beef-up"" the security around Calais, including the putting up of a large fence to prevent people accessing trains and lorries. She said that had made people ""resort to other methods to get here"", adding: ""I expect people traffickers are exploiting people, saying, you know, things are going to tighten up after Brexit, you need to go now."" Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""The number of incidents over recent days is deeply concerning. ""Some of this is clearly facilitated by organised crime groups while other attempts appear to be opportunistic."" UK and France team to target border crime Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? She said UK authorities were working closely with their French counterparts in a recently-opened joint intelligence centre in Calais to target people smugglers. She reiterated that attempting to cross the Channel in a dinghy was ""extremely dangerous"" and warned that people were putting their lives at risk to do so. 27 December -Some 23 migrants, including three children, were detained in Kent aftercrossing the channel in small three boats 26 December -Three migrantsbrought ashore by Border Force 25 December -Forty migrants, including two children,crossed the Channel in five boats 15 December -Four children are among a group of11 people rescued off Dover.

Trump threatens to shut Mexican border,"Migrants from Honduras tried to enter the US illegally on Thursday by jumping a border fence Donald Trump has threatened to shut down the border with Mexico over illegal immigration if Congress fails to fund his proposed wall. ""Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border,"" the US president tweeted after nearly a week of deadlock in Washington over the federal budget. Confirming the threat to close the border was real, the White House said negotiations with Congress had stalled. The dispute has caused a partial US government shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are either on unpaid leave or continue to work but do not know when they will be paid. Both Congress chambers met for just a few minutes on Thursday but took no steps to end the closure. The House and Senate will now meet again on Monday. Later in the week, a new House will be sworn in, dominated by opposition Democrats who won the mid-term elections last month, but Mr Trump's Republicans will retain the Senate with a slightly larger majority. In October Mr Trump made a similar threatto close the southern US border when demanding action from Latin American governments to stop migrants, in what has become known as the caravan, trying to cross into the US illegally. ""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money,externalto finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" he tweeted on Friday. He is seeking $5bn (Â£4bn) to cover the cost of the wall but Democrats and some within Mr Trump's own party insist they will not approve it. Six things that could topple Trump's border wall Who pays for Donald Trump's wall? Mr Trump argued on Friday that the US had lost out to Mexico by $75bn a year underthe North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which he replaced with a new deal with Mexico and Canada last month.

The president's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, confirmed that the Trump administration was willing to shut down the southern border. He said negotiations with Congress had ""completely shut down"" and suggested the Democrats were more interested in seeing Nancy Pelosi elected speaker of the House than they were in the border. Thousands of desperate migrants from Central American states arrived at the Mexican side of the border in recent weeks in the hope of claiming asylum in the US. Faced with a long wait to be processed, some have tried to cross the border illegally and migrants could be seen jumping frontier fences again this week. The family of Felipe Alonzo-Gomez back in Guatemala arranged photos of the dead boy to mourn him Two child migrants from Guatemala died in the custody of US Customs and Border Patrol agents this month, and critics say care for  migrant families and detention conditions are inadequate and unacceptable. The agony over an American dream US to investigate child migrantâs death What is the migrant caravan heading to US? US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is to see detention conditions at first hand on a visit to the border on Friday. Ms Nielsen has called the latest death, that of eight-year-old Felipe Alonzo-Gomez on Christmas Eve, a ""deeply concerning and heartbreaking"" tragedy. The shutdown is likely to drag on into the new year as Mr Trump refuses to sign the wider federal spending package. This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" His opponents accuse him of exaggerating the issue of immigration for political gain, and argue that there are better forms of border security than a wall. The situation has added to concerns over the outlook for the US economy in 2019, leading the stock market on a rollercoaster ride in recent days. US stock markets rally after slide Ten consequences of the 2013 shutdown Nine of 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice began partially shutting down after funding for them lapsed at midnight (05:00 GMT) last Saturday. In practice, this means that: Customs and border staffwill keep working, although their pay will be delayed.Airportswill continue operating. About 80% ofNational Parksemployees will be sent home, and parks could close - although some may stay open with limited staff and facilities. About 90% ofhousing departmentworkers will take unpaid leave, which could delay loan processing and approvals. Most of theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) will be sent on unpaid leave, including those who assist taxpayers with queries. The Food and Drug Administration will pause routine inspections but ""continue vital activities"". The remaining 75% of the federal government is fully funded until September 2019 - so the defence, veterans affairs, labour and education departments are not affected. The Republicans do indeed control both chambers of the outgoing Congress and the budget was passed by the House this month by 217 votes to 185. However, President Trump needed to find 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate, where the Republicans currently only have 51 seats. In the new Congress being sworn in on 3 January, the Democrats will have 235 seats in the House to 199 for the Republicans, while Mr Trump's party will have 53 in the Senate.

What happened to Stormzy?," Under a single light, with water cascading from above, Stormzy looked dramatic. The Brit Awards performance at the O2 Arena in February had started serenely - a gospel song from Gang Signs & Prayer, backed by a balaclava-clad choir, their faces lit up in the darkness. Stormzy smiled as he sang the words: I said a prayer this morning, I prayed I would find a way, to another day, I was so afraid, till you came and saved me. But the beat, and Stormzy’s expression, soon changed. Taking off his top, he stood directly under the spotlight. Yo, Theresa May where's that money for Grenfell? What you thought we just forgot about Grenfell? You criminals - and you got the cheek to call us savages. You should do some jail time, you should pay some damages. We should burn your house down and see if you can manage this. Stormzy had revealed what he’d planned to say only to his producer, his sound engineer, and a couple of close friends. During rehearsals, as Brit executives and producers watched, he’d used a dummy lyric to throw them off the scent. Downing Street shot back the next day, defending the government’s actions and saying millions had been committed to the community. The authorities’ slow response to the fire at Grenfell Tower in June 2017, which killed 72 people, and the conditions that led to the blaze, had already been criticised by a number of rappers. The rapper Lowkey said the burned-out building made a sort of violence, that is usually invisible, suddenly visible. Musician and author Akala was more blunt.  “The people who died and lost their homes, this happened to them because they are poor,” he told Channel 4 News. Stormzy’s Brits rap came after he was challenged by a guy from Ladbroke Grove called Riz, he later revealed at the launch of his book, Rise Up: The #Merky Story So Far. Stormzy said he visited Grenfell with Riz and met some of the affected families. “It proper dawned on me at that point. I was like, surely man can do something with whatever platform man’s got to ensure something happens?” When Stormzy rapped about Grenfell, he seemed to get a response. In the months that followed, he was mentioned in Parliament. Some felt he had helped influence Theresa May’s decision to appoint a more diverse panel for the Grenfell Inquiry - after encouraging his supporters to sign a petition. Stormzy himself didn’t want to exaggerate his impact. “All we've done is... say words. In terms of actually making change and making something happen, I wasn't quite convinced,” he told Radio 1 Newsbeat. “Until the people in that situation fully feel like they've received their justice, then I'm not too sure about all of that.” But the Brits moment was still one of the most pivotal in Stormzy’s career. Large sections of the country, who had previously either paid no notice or pigeonholed him, sat up and watched. Stormzy’s music resonates for poor working-class people, says Spotify’s Head of Editorial Austin Daboh. “Whether you’re a kid in a council estate in Toxteth in Liverpool, an Asian kid in an estate in Bradford, or a young black south London teenager, you can all relate.” Now Stormzy was calling out the prime minister at an awards show. He looked supremely comfortable. Young black men from south London aren’t supposed to feel that kind of confidence. The Brits was just the first example in 2018 of Stormzy going to places he wasn’t supposed to go, and doing things he wasn’t supposed to do. When tourists get on the London Underground, they could be forgiven for thinking there’s not much going on in the south of the city. Some Tube maps don’t even show Brixton. For Stormzy though, growing up as Michael Omari, there was nothing north of Brixton. “You see where the 109 starts and it finishes? That was the world. That was the whole world,” Stormzy said at the launch of his book Rise Up. The 109 bus begins not far from East Croydon train station, and heads through Thornton Heath, Streatham, and into Brixton. Get on and you’ll go past a Harris Academy school like the one Stormzy went to, one of several dotted around south London. Streatham Common is a rare bit of greenery on the route, before it terminates a couple of minutes walk from Brixton Academy - just past the famed Electric Avenue. “I didn’t know nothing outside of that,” Stormzy said. He grew up in Thornton Heath, an unremarkable looking part of Croydon. On its High Street you’ll find a Subway sandwich shop, a Poundland discount store, a few halal butchers, betting shops, and Caribbean, Chinese and African restaurants. If you’ve never been there, Stormzy’s debut album Gang Signs & Prayer might be the easiest way to imagine it. South London had little representation during grime’s early years. The genre’s pioneers hailed from east. “For me, Bow E3 was the promised land,” Stormzy said in Rise Up. In recent years though, south London has been represented faithfully by an array of artists across various urban genres. Peckham’s Giggs kicked down the doors in the mid 2000s, paving the way for the likes of Krept and Konan, Bonkaz, and Stormzy himself. Up the road from Stormzy, P Money helped lead a slew of MCs from Lewisham, while Brixton’s Sneakbo is only recently getting credit for laying the foundations of the Afro-swing/Afro-bashment sound that’s taken over airwaves this year. For Stormzy, Krept and Konan’s success was a turning point. They gained popularity quickly after the release of their first mixtape, Redrum, in 2009. Krept and Konan Their lyrics were the kind that have led to scare stories about drill music in 2018 - they reflected the violence they’d witnessed around them. But their emphasis on wordplay made them stand out. Their lyrics became a fixture in many Blackberry Messenger and MSN screen names, and their songs flew from phone to phone in schools in and around London. They achieved mainstream success, winning Mobo and BET awards for their work. South London was finding its voice. Stormzy (centre) performs on stage at Red Bull Culture Clash at Earls Court, London, on 30 October 2014 Michael Omari wasn’t always destined to be Stormzy. But whatever he chose to do in life, he was going to be good at it. “He was always asking the right and sometimes difficult questions, he was always trying to work out the pieces to the puzzle,” says Austin Daboh, who as head of music at 1Xtra brought Stormzy into the station early in his career. “There’s just a common theme that runs through a lot of successful people… they turn up on time, they’re polite, they understand the mechanics of the business that they’re working in. “He's just got that same work ethic that all A-list stars have.” Before becoming a musician he’d been, at various times, the student at the Harris Academy with the best GCSE grades, an Oxford University prospect and an engineering apprentice. He got six A*s, three As and three Bs at GCSE. “Being an excellent young black boy today, in this world, is defying the odds. I think excellence is something to strive for. I want to make my friends proud, and I want to make my family proud. And I know I can do that if I’m excellent,” he said in Rise Up. During Stormzy’s engineering apprenticeship, at college in Leamington Spa with 17 other kids, only one knew he wanted to become an MC. “I was literally like Batman - engineer by day, and MC by night,” he said at his book launch. When half-term came, and Stormzy returned to Croydon, he had an idea. “We had one week of half-term, and I was like ‘Oh, I’ll do a mixtape in one week…’ “And then I was like ‘ah, how many hours are in a week?’” The mixtape 168 ended up being his first full release, and earned him some hype back home. But there was an internal conflict between whether to chase his dreams in music or accept that he was on a path to a steady job. His show on Reprezent Radio in Brixton was clashing with his work - he was going to have to make a decision. “When I left work I didn’t tell anyone apart from my sister. I was living at home and I’d just moved back from the apprenticeship, and I know my mum was thinking, ‘Yo, what are you doing, you’re not working?’,” Stormzy said in Rise Up. Stormzy credits his mum, Abigail, as being the foundation of his Christian faith. And the faith she had in her son at that time was definitely repaid. He often mentions her as someone who always held the family up and always had a smile on her face. In his Brits freestyle he said he was “raised up by black girl magic” - his two sisters and Abigail. “The Ghanaian spirit in general, I believe, is pretty humble and hard working,” says Twin B, who is head of A&R at Atlantic Records UK, and British Ghanaian like Stormzy. “There’s a common thread of mums who have been out working three jobs and dads who have been doing the same. “That humble and hardworking spirit is something that runs through to a lot of people, Stormzy included.” This portrait of Stormzy and his mother Abigail was taken by Olivia Rose and is on display at the National Portrait Gallery This portrait of Stormzy and his mother Abigail was taken by Olivia Rose and is on display at the National Portrait Gallery Twin went to one of Stormzy’s first ever live shows, at a club called Gorilla in Manchester. The show was “sort of split in two, there was a DJ and a band, and some of it worked and some of it didn’t”. Twin wanted to chat with Stormzy afterwards to go through some feedback. “But he was stood with the musical director for about an hour going through it, asking questions and trying to perfect it. “I remember being like, ‘Wow, this guy is taking this so seriously’.” And then there’s Smoky Mike - a name the people around Stormzy have for the person who comes out when he gets angry or tells them off, when he wants high standards. His success happened quickly but with hard work. Stormzy had uploaded a freestyle to YouTube titled Wickedskengman [part 1] in 2013 - before he’d left his job. It showcased Stormzy’s trademark cheekiness and charm - there are 15 seconds where he starts to talk, ends up laughing, and starts again, before actually getting into the rap. Wickedskengman [part 2] dropped three months later, in early 2014. Twin saw the videos before he met Stormzy. “This guy was using everything that everyone loved about grime: the DIY ethic, in terms of making his own video, the funny lyrics - but the hardness to it - the street edge. It being captivating, it being energetic.” Then there was Know Me From - which was shot in one take walking through Croydon, with a cameo from mum Abigail - and Shut Up. That video - already with more than 83 million YouTube views - was filmed at South Norwood Lake, with Stormzy in a signature Adidas tracksuit. This one was bright red. It came after Kanye West invited a number of grime artists - including Stormzy - to join him on stage during his 2015 Brits performance. Kanye stood on stage with what felt like the whole of the grime scene behind him, hooded, clothed in black, with flames shooting above them. Watch the video back on YouTube and you can spot Novelist, Frisco, Skepta, Jammer and plenty more. It felt like grime, historically frozen out of awards ceremonies, had invaded. The friends introduced in the Wickedskengman series of freestyles, and in the video for Shut Up, accompanied Stormzy everywhere. “You’ve only got to look at some of his earlier career choices to see that he’s all about representation,” Austin Daboh says. “Whether that be him deciding not to go with an established manager from the old school music industry and choosing one of his close friends, which was definitely a diverse choice. “Whether that be you looking at the team around him and seeing that whether it be white or black, you’ve got Akua who’s female, you’ve got Rachel who’s female - you’ve got people around him that represent a whole heap of diverse choices in staff members. “And then you then look at the projects he’s put together... it’s all about representation.” Cause when I see Hus merking I feel the vibe. I see my people on the telly I feel alive. Jourdan Dunn up on those billboards I feel the pride. And Dan Kaluuya won the Bafta I could have cried. Grenfell got the headlines the day after the Brits but the rest of Stormzy’s rap showed what his 2018 was going to be about. After ridiculing the Daily Mail, Stormzy then name-checked: J Hus, a fellow best album nominee, Jourdan Dunn, the first black British model to make Forbes’s top-earning models list, and Daniel Kaluuya, Bafta’s 2018 Rising Star. Stormzy wanted to seek out talent. In July, he announced a deal with Penguin Random House to create an imprint called #Merky, aiming to help talented authors from backgrounds similar to his own who might otherwise struggle to get published. And in August, he made headlines after agreeing a scholarship in partnership with Cambridge University to fund two black students. He told Newsbeat that black students were “heavily under-represented in the top universities”. ""It’s so important for black students, especially, to be aware that it can 100% be an option to attend a university of this calibre.” He said that “as much as there’s been progress made, there’s still a long way to go”. The rapper said that at one stage, it looked like he could’ve been on his way to a Cambridge or an Oxford. ""But that didn’t happen for myself... so hopefully there’s another young black student out there that can have that opportunity through my scholarship."" Months later he said that the University of Oxford had rejected his scholarship idea, although Oxford denies ever receiving or turning down any proposal. Weeks before the Cambridge announcement Stormzy had turned 25 and celebrated in style. His Team Merky partnered with Spotify to take 260 of his fans on a surprise journey to Spain, along with some famous faces. It included a barbecue, a party and a performance. “It was proper mad,” says 23-year-old Olivia, from London. “It wasn’t like the VIPs were cordoned off, everyone was mingling with each other.” Stormzy’s 2018 birthday celebrations: “Proper mad” Olivia says she had lunch with Lethal Bizzle and Krept.  “When I went back to work the next day I spent the whole day thinking, ‘Did that even happen?’ “Stormzy’s only 25. I’ve got a brother the same age. “It showed Stormzy as a human being. You can always think that these people are big personalities, not even human, but seeing him interact with his fans and his friends showed me he’s basically the same as my brother - a standard 25-year-old black man, as to how open and friendly he was.” The first book to be published under #Merky’s deal with Penguin was released in November. Rise Up charts the journey of Stormzy and his team, and was edited and co-written by Jude Yawson. Stormzy got in touch with Jude, who’s also from south London, in 2014 after reading something he’d written about the rapper online. Stormzy mentioned that they should work on something together in the future. “Then in January he just appeared out of the blue, in my DMs again, and was like ‘Yo, I’m gonna put you in contact with Akua - my brand manager - and we’ll get things underway,” Jude told Newsbeat. Stormzy wanted to help young writers. “I thought to myself, ‘I’m in a position where I could create something that helps them’ - and that’s what I’m doing,"" he said. Next up for #Merky Books is Taking Up Space, written by Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi. The Cambridge alumni have written a book “for any black girl going to university”, Chelsea told Newsbeat. At uni, Chelsea says she realised a distinction between being a student and being a black student. “You’re there, you’re fighting for your rights, there are things that you have to face on a day-to-day basis - microaggressions, sometimes blatant racism. “And I know that happens every day in society but the university environment, it compounds it, it makes everything really heightened.” The book combines conversations with former and current students. Chelsea says she hopes it starts a conversation about what can be done to include black students as well as just increasing numbers. Even after the whirl of 2018 it seems unlikely Stormzy will have a quiet period. “I want #Merky to be literature, I want it to be education, I want it to be engineering, architecture - I want #Merky to be a thing that goes way past music and past everything,” Stormzy said. “I want it to be a real hub of culture.” You wouldn’t bet against his ambitions. Next on the long list though is the second album, which Stormzy promises is “groundbreaking”. “I’m gonna get judged on my art, I’m gonna get judged on the merit of my musicality - giving a real body of work and getting judged on... the artistic merit of it.” Credits AuthorKameron Virk Photography creditsOlivia RoseGetty ImagesAlamyPress AssociationPenguin Random HouseYouTube Online productionBen Milne EditorFinlo Rohrer Built with ShorthandAll images subject to copyright"
Women and baby killed in Iceland crash,"The accident took place on a 200-300 metre bridge over the area of NÃºpsvÃ¶tn on Iceland's ring road The three British tourists killed in a car crash in Iceland were two women in their 30s and a baby girl from London, police have confirmed. The women are believed to be sisters-in-law Rajshree and Khushboo Laturia. The baby is understood to be Rajshree's daughter Shreeprabha, born this year. Their names have not yet been officially released by police. The victims were travelling in a 4x4 on Thursdaywhen it crashedthrough the barrier of a bridge. The car, a Toyota Land Cruiser, fell eight metres onto the river bank below. Four other people - the women's husbands Shreeraj and Supreme Laturia, and two children aged seven and nine - were all in the car at the time. They were airlifted to hospital with serious injuries. The two families were on holiday together. They are of Indian heritage, and theIndian Ambassador to Iceland,externalsaid relatives from India would be travelling to Iceland. The accident happened at around 9:30 GMT on Thursday on Iceland's national ring road - also known as Route 1 - in an area called NÃºpsvÃ¶tn, between the town of KirkjubÃ¦jarklaustur and Skaftafell. The area is a popular destination for tourists, and the families were heading east on the road towards the VatnajÃ¶kull National Park - which is home to the largest glacier in Europe as well as waterfalls and mountains. Police have not officially named the people involved. In a statement on Friday, police said tests had shown the driver of the car had not been drinking alcohol and the baby who died was travelling in a car seat. ""The cause of the accident is unknown and under investigation by the police and the investigative committee for transport accidents,"" officers added. ""The car was driven to the east, along the Sudurlandsvegur road, and seems to have turned on the bridge with the result that it went on top of the railing of the bridge, to the right, following it for a short distance and then turned over off the rail and the bridge. ""There, the car fell down on the ground beneath the bridge."" Chief Superintendent Sveinn Kristjan Runarsson said the road was not thought to have been icy, but humidity could have made the bridge's surface - which is made of steel - slippery. A police car blocks off part of Route 1 on Thursday One of the first people on the scene was tour guide Adolf Erlingsson, who told BBC News he believed the driver had lost control. Describing the bank that the car fell down onto, Mr Erlingsson said: ""It's kind of sandy, there's no rivers so it wasn't submerged in water. It just landed there on a sandy bottom and flipped over and was totally destroyed,"" he said. He added that he got out of his van and went to see if he could help emergency services. ""The car was a total wreck. When I got there four people were out of the car, one of them deceased. Then there were three people trapped in the car. ""The driver was alive and trapped more or less under the dashboard. We were trying to get the people out of the car and helping them, it was a very difficult situation."" The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office previously said it was providing assistance.

Trump threatens to shut Mexican borderThe US leader is locked in a dispute with Congress over funding for his proposed wall.US & Canada,"Migrants from Honduras tried to enter the US illegally on Thursday by jumping a border fence Donald Trump has threatened to shut down the border with Mexico over illegal immigration if Congress fails to fund his proposed wall. ""Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border,"" the US president tweeted after nearly a week of deadlock in Washington over the federal budget. Confirming the threat to close the border was real, the White House said negotiations with Congress had stalled. The dispute has caused a partial US government shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are either on unpaid leave or continue to work but do not know when they will be paid. Both Congress chambers met for just a few minutes on Thursday but took no steps to end the closure. The House and Senate will now meet again on Monday. Later in the week, a new House will be sworn in, dominated by opposition Democrats who won the mid-term elections last month, but Mr Trump's Republicans will retain the Senate with a slightly larger majority. In October Mr Trump made a similar threatto close the southern US border when demanding action from Latin American governments to stop migrants, in what has become known as the caravan, trying to cross into the US illegally. ""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money,externalto finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" he tweeted on Friday. He is seeking $5bn (Â£4bn) to cover the cost of the wall but Democrats and some within Mr Trump's own party insist they will not approve it. Six things that could topple Trump's border wall Who pays for Donald Trump's wall? Mr Trump argued on Friday that the US had lost out to Mexico by $75bn a year underthe North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which he replaced with a new deal with Mexico and Canada last month.

The president's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, confirmed that the Trump administration was willing to shut down the southern border. He said negotiations with Congress had ""completely shut down"" and suggested the Democrats were more interested in seeing Nancy Pelosi elected speaker of the House than they were in the border. Thousands of desperate migrants from Central American states arrived at the Mexican side of the border in recent weeks in the hope of claiming asylum in the US. Faced with a long wait to be processed, some have tried to cross the border illegally and migrants could be seen jumping frontier fences again this week. The family of Felipe Alonzo-Gomez back in Guatemala arranged photos of the dead boy to mourn him Two child migrants from Guatemala died in the custody of US Customs and Border Patrol agents this month, and critics say care for  migrant families and detention conditions are inadequate and unacceptable. The agony over an American dream US to investigate child migrantâs death What is the migrant caravan heading to US? US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is to see detention conditions at first hand on a visit to the border on Friday. Ms Nielsen has called the latest death, that of eight-year-old Felipe Alonzo-Gomez on Christmas Eve, a ""deeply concerning and heartbreaking"" tragedy. The shutdown is likely to drag on into the new year as Mr Trump refuses to sign the wider federal spending package. This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" His opponents accuse him of exaggerating the issue of immigration for political gain, and argue that there are better forms of border security than a wall. The situation has added to concerns over the outlook for the US economy in 2019, leading the stock market on a rollercoaster ride in recent days. US stock markets rally after slide Ten consequences of the 2013 shutdown Nine of 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice began partially shutting down after funding for them lapsed at midnight (05:00 GMT) last Saturday. In practice, this means that: Customs and border staffwill keep working, although their pay will be delayed.Airportswill continue operating. About 80% ofNational Parksemployees will be sent home, and parks could close - although some may stay open with limited staff and facilities. About 90% ofhousing departmentworkers will take unpaid leave, which could delay loan processing and approvals. Most of theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) will be sent on unpaid leave, including those who assist taxpayers with queries. The Food and Drug Administration will pause routine inspections but ""continue vital activities"". The remaining 75% of the federal government is fully funded until September 2019 - so the defence, veterans affairs, labour and education departments are not affected. The Republicans do indeed control both chambers of the outgoing Congress and the budget was passed by the House this month by 217 votes to 185. However, President Trump needed to find 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate, where the Republicans currently only have 51 seats. In the new Congress being sworn in on 3 January, the Democrats will have 235 seats in the House to 199 for the Republicans, while Mr Trump's party will have 53 in the Senate.

"China accuses UK of 'pride and prejudice'Beijing was responding to claims it might use Huawei's 5G kit to act ""in a malign way"".Technology","China has accused the UK of ""deep-rooted pride and prejudice"" over security fears raised about Huawei. The Chinese company's chairman has alsocomplained of his firm's,external""incredibly unfair treatment"" abroad. In recent weeks,the UK's Defence Secretaryandchief of MI6have been among those to warn that use of Huawei's 5G kit poses risks that need fuller consideration. Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and Japan have also flagged concerns. Experts have warned that the Chinese government could compel the company to disrupt telecom networks that use its equipment or spy on their customers. But Huawei denies it would ever do so, noting that such action would undermine its business. Last week, it invited the media to visit its 5G and cyber-security research labs in Dongguan, Guangdong as part of efforts to counter criticism. 'Deep concerns' over Huawei's role in UK 5G upgrade Huawei's kit removed from emergency services 4G network Trump could intervene in case of bailed Huawei executive Huawei: Why has UK not blocked Chinese firm's 5G kit? Many of Huawei's clients opt for its products over rivals, such as Nokia and Ericsson, on both cost and technical grounds. In addition, its smartphones have proven popular with the public. Huawei recently revealed it had shipped more than 200 million handsets in 2018, placing it second only to Samsung in terms of market share. Huawei has just announced a new version of its P Smart phone with an edge-to-edge display ""We are ahead of others in domains like wireless, optical, data communications, and smart devices,"" wrote chairman Guo Ping in a New Year's message shared online. ""For 5G markets that choose to not work with Huawei - they will be like an NBA [National Basketball Association] game without star players: the game will go on, but with less deftness, flair, and expertise."" Beijing's criticism of the UK was published in the Global Times,an English-language government newspaper,external. It said Ministry of National Defence spokesman Wu Qian had told a press conference that suggestions the Chinese government might compromise Huawei's technologies were ""groundless"". It said Wu's comment was made in reaction to UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson saying earlier this week that: ""We've got to recognise the fact, as has been recently exposed, that the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way."" Having made play on a Jane Austen novel title, the newspaper also referenced another popular phrase to offer advice to Huawei, telling it to ""calm down and carry on""in a separate editorial,external.

The councils trying to save the High Street,"Can councils rejuvenate failing shopping centres? Local councils have spent more than Â£800m on the purchase of UK shopping centres over the last three years. In many struggling town centres, these big properties have become something of an unloved asset by investors. Buyers are thin on the ground. But councils have been stepping in and acquiring them. According to the commercial property consultancy Knight Frank, since 2016, councils have snapped up 26 shopping malls - 10 this year alone. ""As traditional buyers have shied away from retail, councils have picked up their activity to become the most active single group buying shopping centres, with nearly one in every three that has sold in 2018 being acquired by a council, within their boroughs,"" says Mark Smith, a partner at the firm. ""Their activity has been spread across England, with the uniting factor being the desire to effect change."" Retail crisis forces hundreds of closures How do we shop now? Bolton Council is one of them. It spent more than Â£14m this year to gain control of Crompton Place, a 1960s-style shopping centre along with its car park covering more than 280,000 sq ft. ""It was a big button to press, but I think it's money well spent,"" says Councillor Ebrahim Adia, Deputy Leader of Bolton Borough Council. ""We recognise that Bolton town centre is in a bit of a decline. We've taken the view that the council has a big responsibility to make sure that we help rejuvenate it. Wigan Council bought the Galleries Shopping Centre in March ""The shopping centre is strategically very important, right opposite the town hall and I think residents expect us to do whatever it takes to ensure we have a viable town centre."" Crompton Place has seen better days. There's an empty BHS at the main entrance. New Look recently moved to a new location and the gaps are getting harder to fill. The council has now lined up a private consortium to completely redevelop the site. It plans to broaden its use, reducing the number of shops and putting in place residential and leisure units in the hope that this will bring more people into town. So where's the money coming from? The council isn't using council tax or money from existing budgets, which have already been slashed by some Â£155m over the last seven years. It's borrowed the money. Like other authorities, it's able to secure loans at far cheaper rates than the private sector. Councils have been pouring record amounts of money into all sorts of commercial property, to generate new sources of income to help fund services. Bolton has borrowed a total of Â£100m for its town centre fund as part of a wider Â£1bn plan to regenerate the town centre. Councils have recently been issued a warning about the growing scale of these investments. Surrey Heath Council has bought the freehold of a House of Fraser store, among other retail purchases. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy says councils shouldn't expose public funds to ""unnecessary or un-quantified risk"". Bolton Council says it's confident it will get its money back on the shopping centre and that it's got a good deal. Crompton Place had been valued at Â£83m in 2007, when property prices were at their peak. In the boom times shopping centres were very popular with investors and were frequently bought and sold. Prices collapsed after the recession and have never fully recovered. They're dropping in value once again. Figures from the real estate investment data provider, MSCI, reveal there's been a fall in shopping centre property values of 7.9% since 2015, after all the associated costs of running them have been taken into account. Putting it another way, they're now worth nearly Â£4.5bn less than they were. In-town shopping centres have seen the biggest falls. Transactions have hit a record low for 2018. Wigan Council bought the struggling Galleries Shopping Centre for Â£8m in March, more than 90% less than it was worth in 2006 when it was traded for Â£83m. It sounds like a bargain price but have councils bitten off more than they can chew? Surrey Heath Council has been one of the most active buyers. It spent Â£86m on Camberley's main shopping centre. It then went on to spend Â£17.6m buying the freehold for House of Fraser next door, 18 months before it collapsed into administration. The shop's still trading but it could've bought the property for a lot less now. ""Clearly there's always a risk and if councils are buying cheap property to try to make a quick profit, that's not the right motivation,"" says Mark Williams, president of Revo, the retail property body. ""But if it's being done in order to regenerate their towns, to make them better places, to create employment and make them fit for their residents then that definitely is the right thing to do."" ""The private sector can't take that long-term view because in many struggling locations, the projects simply aren't commercially viable. We need councils to kick start these developments, to help bridge the funding gap and bring private investors in."" That plan is already underway in Bolton. ""We bought this as a temporary investment. We needed to give the private sector the confidence that we're a local authority willing to have some skin in the game,"" says Councillor Adia. ""By buying this site and partnering up with the private sector we will get the chance to do exactly what we want and direct the regeneration that will take place here in the future."" He and his fellow councillors believe the sums add up, although it will take time to see the full results.

Angelina Jolie hints at move into politics,"This video can not be played Could Angelina Jolie have a future in politics? Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie has hinted that she is considering a move into politics in the future. In an interview on theBBC's Today programme, she said she would have dismissed this 20 years ago but would now go where she was needed. Jolie, who is a special envoy to the UN Refugee Agency, was the guest editor of the Today programme on Friday. She is an active campaigner on a range of issues, including refugees, sexual violence and conservation. In a wide-ranging interview with presenter Justin Webb, she discussed US politics, social media, sexual violence and the global refugee crisis. When asked whether she would consider getting involved in politics, she said: ""If you asked me 20 years ago, I would've laughed... I always say I'll go where I'm needed, I don't know if I'm fit for politicsâ¦ but then I've also joked that I don't know if I have a skeleton left in my closet"". ""I'm also able to work with governments and I'm also able to work with militaries, and so I sit in a very interesting place of being able to get a lot done."" Jolie joins BBC Radio for Christmas Berry and Jolie to edit Womanâs Hour She added that ""for now"", she would stay quiet. When Webb suggested that meant she could be on the list of 30 to 40 Democrats running for the party's presidential nomination, she did not say no, replying ""thank you"". Jolie is one of a range of guest editors, including David Dimbleby and Martha Lane Fox, who are taking charge of the programme between 22 December to 1 January. She also discussed the difficulties of monitoring her children's social media activities, highlighting that like ""most parents"", she cannot control everything they are exposed to. ""There are certain realities to teenagers and also our generation doesn't understand half of what they are doing with their tech so they can get around us pretty easy"", she said. She added that none of her children have asked to join Facebook, and she herself is not a member. ""We're the last family that hasn't gone on Facebook!"" she said. This video can not be played The BBC spoke to Angelina Jolie about her film on the Cambodia genocide, First They Killed My Father, back in 2017 Jolie is also working with the BBC on a new weekly children's news programme, Our World, which will be piloted in the new year. She will serve as executive producer on the show, aimed at seven to 12-year-olds, which hopes to engage children with international news, focusing on subjects like tech, the environment and social media. ""As a mother, I'm so happy I will be able to sit and watch with my children and know they're getting a real international sense of the world,"" she said.

The blue colour comes from the way electricity passes through air, correspondents say. Electrical energy will knock electrons off atoms in the gases that make up the air. When these electrons recombine with the excited atoms, returning them to their starting energy state, light is emitted. The colour of the light emitted depends on the type of atoms involved. A blue colour is associated with oxygen atoms; pink/purple colours are associated with nitrogen atoms. Oxygen and nitrogen are the gases that dominate the air we breathe.

Syrian army 'takes control' of key cityThe government responds to a call for help from Kurdish forces trying to repel a Turkish offensive.Middle East,"Forces from the US-led coalition against IS are also present in Manbij The Syrian army has entered the key northern city of Manbij for the first time in six years, an army spokesman has said. However the US-led coalition operating in the area said it had not seen military changes inside Manbij. A US official and a UK-based monitoring group said Syrian troops had deployed in the area around the city. US-backed Kurds withdrew and invited Syrian forces to replace them amid fears that Turkish troops would attack. Turkey considers the US-backed Kurdish YPG forces to be part of a terrorist group. The Kurds' request to the Syrian government followed the shock announcement that all US troops are to withdraw from Syria. President Donald Trump announced the pullout of some 2,000 troops last week, asserting that the Islamic State group (IS) had been defeated. Why the battle for northern Syria matters Who are the Kurds Why is there a war in Syria? But that claim has been disputed by important allies who say the move could lead to a resurgence of IS. The Syrian army said it had raised a flag in Manbij. In a televised statement, a spokesman said the troops were there to ""crush terrorism and defeat all invaders and occupiers"". However a US official told Reuters that US troops had not changed their positions in Manbij and dozens still remained. The official said they had seen Syrian forces on the outskirts of the city but not inside it. The US-led coalition against the Islamic State group said reports of changes to military forces in the city were ""incorrect"". Allow Twitter content?

Nura al-Hamed, deputy head of the Manbij local authority, told AFP that the Syrian army deployment would ""not enter the city of Manbij itself but will deploy on the demarcation line"" with Turkish-backed Syrian rebels. US and French coalition forces in the area remained at their positions and were continuing to conduct patrols, Ms Hamed told AFP. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are in the vicinity of Manbij Russia, which has been fighting on the side of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since 2015, said the arrival of Syrian government troops would ""help stabilise the situation"". ""The enlargement of the zone under the control of government forces... is without doubt a positive trend,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. By Martin Patience, Middle East Correspondent, BBC News The consequences of President Trump's surprise announcement to withdraw all US troops from Syria are now being seen on the ground. Manbij is a strategically important town in northern Syria that until today was under the control of US-backed Kurdish forces. The Kurds - who led the fight against IS - see Mr Trump's decision as a betrayal. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? Without the support of the Americans, Kurdish leaders are now being forced to choose what they regard as the least bad option. They will be hoping that the presence of the Syrian government army - which is backed by Russia and Iran - will deter Turkey from launching an attack. Turkey has been intensifying its military activity near positions held by Kurdish fighters since President Trump's withdrawal announcement on 19 December. US soldiers have been working closely with Kurdish forces who form part of an alliance - the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - in the battle against IS. But this policy has infuriated Turkey, which is battling the militia in the nearby city of Afrin. Turkish forces are also present near Manbij It also says it is frustrated over what it sees as delays toa deal agreed with the US to clear Manbij of Kurdish fighters. The deal over the city, which lies to the west of the Euphrates river, was agreed in February in a bid to stabilise the region. The US also has soldiers in Manbij, which was taken from IS by forces led by the Kurdish YPG in 2016. Tensions in the region have risen in recent weeks, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to launch a new offensive against the Kurds. Turkey has launched two previous offensives against the Kurds in Syria since 2016. Trump troop pullout raises questions After the caliphate: What next for IS? Mr Erdogan wants to prevent the Kurds from consolidating their hold on Syrian territory and forming an autonomous region on Turkey's border. Turkey considers the militia to be an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in south-eastern Turkey for three decades.

World's rarest bird gets new homeA species of duck thought to have been wiped out a decade ago is re-released at a lake in Madagascar.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Conservationists hope to save a species of duck called the Madagascar pochard from extinction The rarest bird in the world - a species of duck called the Madagascar pochard - has been given a new home in time for the new year. An international team of researchers released 21 of the birds at a lake in the north of Madagascar. It is a step towards the recovery of a species that just over a decade ago was thought to be extinct. Rescuing the species could also be a first step inprotecting Madagascar's threatened wetlands,external. When it wasn't seen for 15 years, the Madagascar pochard was believed to have been wiped out completely. Then a tiny group of the birds was rediscovered in 2006 at one remote lake. These were the last 25 Madagascar pochards on the planet. The captive-bred pochards are now settling in to their new home Wetland habitats in the country have been so polluted and damaged that these few remaining birds had been forced into this last untouched area. But, as Rob Shaw, head of conservation programmes at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) explained to BBC News, they were only ""clinging on to existence in a place not really suited to them"". Their last pristine refuge was too deep and too cold for the pochards to thrive. ""The threats that they face across the rest of Madagascar - and why they've been wiped out so extensively - are vast,"" explained Rob Shaw. ""They range from sedimentation, invasive species, pollution, poor agricultural practises - a whole suite of problems that create the perfect storm making it very difficult for a species like the Madagascar pochard to survive."" Ten new plants discovered this year Nuns save sacred species from extinction Birds captured for their tuneful voices Breeding the ducks in captivity has been key In a painstaking effort - it has taken more than a decade of work. The international team, which included WWT, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, The Peregrine Fund and the Government of Madagascar, rescued a clutch of pochard eggs and raised them in captivity. Floating aviaries have been installed at Lake Sofia to protect the ducks They then scoured Madagascar for the best site to bring the captive-bred birds back to the wild, settling on Lake Sofia in the north of the country. The team has worked closely with the local communities around the lake that rely on its water, fish and plants, as WWT's Nigel Jarrett explained: ""It takes a village to raise a child, so the old African proverb goes - but in this case it has taken a village to raise a duck. We have been preparing for this moment for over a decade. ""Working with local communities to solve the issues which were driving this bird to extinction has been essential to giving the pochard a chance of survival."" The team hopes that making this reintroduction a success - and bringing back a bird that was on the very brink of extinction -  will provide a powerful example, not just for how to save the most threatened species but how communities can support both people and wildlife in such valuable habitats, even in areas of significant poverty.

Spam fritters caused Dame Vera Lynn row,"Dame Vera Lynn threatened to pull out of events for the D-Day anniversary in 1994 when sandcastle building and Spam fritter cooking contests were planned. Newly-released National Archives files show the contests were scrapped after veterans, and Forces' Sweetheart Dame Vera, said they would be inappropriate. The event to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1944 Normandy Landings still ran into trouble, the documents reveal. Criticisms included ""uninspiring"" hymns and problems caused by the weather. Veterans groups had complained beforehand that the government had got the tone wrong by planning ""trivial entertainment""rather than sombre reflection.,external Spam fritters  - made by battering and deep frying the pink luncheon meat that was sold in cans - became a food staple for many people during the rationing of the world war.. But as Spam had become a butt of many jokes in the subsequent decades -from Monty Python among others-  the idea of reviving it for the event in 1994 proved divisive. In the end, the government's National Heritage secretary met veterans to work out a solution. In a document called D-Day Post Mortem, principal private secretary Alex Allan wrote to then Prime Minister John Major that there were ""inevitably some points to learn from"", even though the events ""went splendidly"" in the end. The decision to make foreign heads of state and their spouses walk up stairs to a grand dinner at Portsmouth Guildhall was described as ""undignified"". Mr Allan said of the entrance to the Guildhall: ""I understand the desire to keep the television pictures, but it was pretty undignified for the wives to have to walk up the steps clutching their skirts and their hair in the very strong winds."" It was also noted that the hymns chosen for the Drumhead service were not ""ones that people could sing with gusto"". And there were issues with the order of arrivals, with South Africa ""a bit fed up"" at not being invited to events and the Canadians finding it ""pretty frustrating"" to be next to last in protocol order. When John Major's aides were planning the following year's VE and VJ Day commemorations, the D-Day events were fresh in their minds. In a document about those events, the then-prime minister's press secretary, Christopher Meyer, wrote: ""We would have to be utterly sure there was no danger of a Spam fritter-type rebound (eg Vera Lynn causing trouble).""

BBC axes Film programme after 47 years,"Between them, Claudia Winkleman, Jonathan Ross and Barry Norman hosted the show for 44 years The BBC has confirmed it will not broadcast its long-running Film... series next year. The programme first aired in 1971 and has since been fronted by Barry Norman, Jonathan Ross and Claudia Winkleman. ""In 2019 we will be creating an enhanced offer for lovers of film both on television and online,"" the corporation told BBC News. ""We're still working through the details and will have more news about what this will look like soon."" Film's title has changed annually since it launched, to reflect the year in which it was being broadcast. It began in 1971, airing only in the South East area of the UK, with rotating guest presenters including Joan Bakewell. The following year it expanded and was broadcast to the whole country, with Norman its first permanent host. Edith Bowman, Charlie Brooker and Clara Amfo have guest hosted Film since Winkleman left Winkleman, the show's most recent regular host,left the show in 2016, and the programme has since been fronted by various guest presenters including Edith Bowman, Clara Amfo and Charlie Brooker. But its profile was at its highest in the 26 years when it was hosted by Norman, who was such a well-known TV presence that he was caricatured as a puppet on Spitting Image. He also had a catchphrase - ""And why not?"" - invented for him by impressionist Rory Bremner. It was a time when Norman combined his incisive reviews of the week's releases with on-set reports of future releases and interviews with Hollywood's biggest names. In 2014,he named Jamie Lee Curtis, Martin Scorsese, Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney,externalas four of his favourite interviewees during his time on the show. But even when the programme was at its height, fixed in a regular time slot, it did not appear on TV throughout the year - which meant that some major releases (particularly summer blockbusters) only got a summary review from Norman when the programme returned from its annual mid-year break. The BBC said in a statement that its new plan to cover film from now on would fix that anomaly, offering ""a more consistent approach across the year"".

HMV: The rise and fall of a music icon,"The HMV Store opening luncheon in July 1921 with Sir Edward Elgar (sixth from left) It was on 20 July 1921 that British composer Sir Edward Elgar opened the doors of a new shop at 363 Oxford Street, named ""His Master's Voice"". But the history of the brand that became known as HMV reaches back to the introduction of the gramophone in the 1890s. HMV on brink of second collapse The inventor of the music player, Emile Berliner, got help from William Barry Owen and Trevor Williams to record and manufacture records for his devices, and the trio set up the Gramophone Company in 1898. Once formed, the outfit focused on creating records and players in its factory in Hayes and distributing them to independent shops around the country. But to make them stand out, an iconic logo was needed. Owen bought a painting entitled ""His Master's Voice"" in 1899 from the artist Francis Barruad, featuring Nipper the Dog staring into an Edison cylinder phonograph. The original logo for His Master's Voice, inspired by a painting of Nipper the Dog He asked the painter to substitute it with a gramophone and a year later the company had gained the rights to the picture and what was to become one of the most recognisable brands in music. It became their official trademark in 1909 and while the Gramophone Company was never officially called His Master's Voice Company, the famous pooch on the records meant it was how the public knew them. As a result, it was a natural choice of name for their first store. A couple looking at radios in the window of HMV in 1937 The shop at 363 Oxford Street was destroyed by fire in 1937 and a temporary shop was set up on Bond Street until its reopening in 1939 - with the addition of an air-raid shelter for World War Two. Despite the horror of the war, music lived on, with patriotic songs becoming popular throughout the 1930s and 1940s. HMV also introduced listening posts so customers could come in and listen to records before they took them home - an initiative replicated across the industry. A woman at the first listening booths in HMV in the 1930s Come the 1950s, the world was set to be shaken with a more positive force, as pop music exploded. More than 280 million singles were sold through the decade in the UK and HMV became a magnet for music lovers. These included as Cliff Richard, who cut a demo in the shop's studios and then secured a deal with the shop's parent company EMI, and Brian Epstein, who wanted to do the same for a then-unknown act, The Beatles. Revamped listening posts in 1953 By 1966, HMV began to expand, first in London and then through the rest of the country. In just six years, it doubled in size and became the UK's largest music retailer. The 1970s saw rivals come to bite at its heels. Our Price grew from its humble beginnings in London's Finchley Road, specialising in cassettes and eight tracks, to takeover as the country's second-biggest music seller after Woolworths, and Richard Branson opened his flagship Virgin Megastores a stone's throw from HMV on Oxford Street in 1976. Shoppers browsing and buying in HMV in 1976 But come the 1980s, with the introduction of the compact disc and a 50,000ft flagship store opening in a new Oxford Street premises, HMV was back in the game. The chain was at the heart of the invention of in-store appearances by the biggest acts of the day. Paul McCartney, Michael Jackson, Madonna, David Bowie and Kate Bush were just some of the multi-million selling artists to grace its stores, signing CDs and playing exclusive sets for those who managed to squeeze in between the record racks. David Bowie launching an album at HMV The 1990s saw more growth in sales for HMV and more expansion as the rise of grunge and hip hop dominated the charts. The chain opened its 100th store in 1997 and McCartney returned to Oxford Street to re-launch its flagship, with more than 5,000 people turning up to watch. And as the DVD format rose in popularity, HMV jumped onboard, helping the company expand to more than 200 stores by 2004. In the 2000s, more stars continued to flock to the shops to sell their wares, including Beyonce, Amy Winehouse and Lady Gaga. Amy Winehouse poses for photos outside HMV Oxford Street in 2004 But along with new music, it was the decade that saw the launch of Apple's iPod, and the digital revolution had begun. After a raft of acquisitions by HMV, buying out smaller chains like Fopp and its rival Zavvi, as well as entering the live music business with Mean Fiddler, things took a turn. The year after digital music revenues overtook sales of physical formats for the first time in 2012, HMV appointed Deloitte as company administrators and suspended shares. Little Mix launching an album in HMV Loyal fans of the shops breathed a sigh of relief as Hilco, a firm that specialises in restructuring, took over the company and its 141 stores in a deal worth Â£50m. HMV was to live another day, and despite closing its major store on Oxford Street, it returned to its original home at number 363 in October 2013, reinstating its retro signage and welcoming more acts, such as Stormzy and Kylie. The retro signage was reinstalled when HMV moved back to its original flagship store in 2013 But it was still being hit hard by the expansion of online shopping, the creation of streaming services and the cold hard fact that fewer people were buying physical formats. Just days after the Christmas festivities of 2018, the retailer was poised to go into administration again - with more than 120 stores and 2,200 staff at risk. After a bidding war, it was announced that some of the stores will be saved by the Canadian entrepreneur, Doug Putman, Despite the rescue, fears over the long term future of the famous HMV brand are unlikely to go away.

Row over Dubai 'missing' princess meeting,"Sheikha Latifa was photographed alongside Mary Robinson, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Former UN rights chief Mary Robinson has been accused of supporting the emirate of Dubai's version of events over a princess who was feared missing. Mrs Robinson, who recently met Sheikha Latifa, daughter of Dubai's ruler, said she was a ""troubled young woman"". She told the BBC the princess regretted making a video in which she alleged confinement and torture. Radha Stirling, head of the rights group Detained in Dubai, said questions remained about the princess's welfare. ""Anyone familiar with Princess Latifa's story who listened to the BBC Radio interview today with Mary Robinson will be astonished at the extent to which Mrs Robinson appeared to be reciting almost verbatim from Dubai's script,"" she said. Images of 'missing' Dubai princess released Call for clarity on status of Sheikha Latifa ""What we heard today was Mary Robinson essentially reciting for BBC Radio listeners the content of the statement issued by the Dubai ruler's court."" She added: ""This meeting in no way satisfies me that she [Sheikha Latifa] is free from the abuse that she told me she had suffered for years."" Sheikha Latifa, the daughter of the emirate's ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is said to have tried to flee abroad in March in order to live a freer life. But campaigners say the luxury yacht she was fleeing on was intercepted off India, and she was forcibly returned to Dubai, one of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A video emerged - filmed following an earlier escape attempt - in which the princess said she and her family ""did not have freedom of choice"" in their lives. She also alleged she had been imprisoned for three years and tortured on her return. This video can not be played What happened to Dubai's Sheikha Latifa? The UAE denied the reports, and said Sheikha Latifa had been living at home with her family. But when the princess was not heard of for months, international human rights groups asked the authorities to prove her safety. On Monday, the UAE foreign ministry said it had sent a communiquÃ© regarding Sheikha Latifa to the UN human rights office. It released images showing Sheikha Latifa alongside Mary Robinson, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and former president of Ireland, and were purportedly taken on 15 December in Dubai. Mrs Robinson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she had been invited by Princess Haya, wife of Dubai's ruler, to ""help with a family dilemma"". ""The dilemma was that Latifa is vulnerable, she's troubled. She made a video that she now regrets and she planned an escape, or what was part of a plan of escape,"" Mrs Robinson said. ""I had lunch with her. She's a very likeable young woman but clearly troubled, clearly needs the medical care that she is receiving."" Mrs Robinson said the princess was suffering from ""a serious medical situation"" and receiving psychiatric care, but did not give further details. She said her family didn't want her to ""endure any more publicity"". The group Detained in Dubai legally represents two people who say they were attacked and abducted while trying to help the princess escape. Ms Stirling said Mrs Robinson ""had nothing to say"" about the accusations Sheikha Latifa had made against her father. ""She said nothing about Latifa having planned her escape for nearly a decade, nor anything about her previous escape attempt,"" she said. ""She said nothing about the illegal raid of Latifa's boat in international waters, and the fact that she was screaming for asylum and begging to not be returned to the UAE. Mrs Robinson simply repeated again and again from the official Dubai statement that Latifa is in the 'loving care of her family' and that the whole issue is nothing more than a 'family matter'."" Another rights group, Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers, also said it was concerned by Mrs Robinson's comments. ""Mrs Robinson appears to have spent a couple of hours with Sheikha Latifa, and despite having no formal medical or psychiatric training, has somehow diagnosed her condition and concluded that she is receiving appropriate treatment. It is unclear on what basis Mrs Robinson considers herself qualified to do so,"" it said in a statement.

China accuses UK of 'pride and prejudice',"China has accused the UK of ""deep-rooted pride and prejudice"" over security fears raised about Huawei. The Chinese company's chairman has alsocomplained of his firm's,external""incredibly unfair treatment"" abroad. In recent weeks,the UK's Defence Secretaryandchief of MI6have been among those to warn that use of Huawei's 5G kit poses risks that need fuller consideration. Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and Japan have also flagged concerns. Experts have warned that the Chinese government could compel the company to disrupt telecom networks that use its equipment or spy on their customers. But Huawei denies it would ever do so, noting that such action would undermine its business. Last week, it invited the media to visit its 5G and cyber-security research labs in Dongguan, Guangdong as part of efforts to counter criticism. 'Deep concerns' over Huawei's role in UK 5G upgrade Huawei's kit removed from emergency services 4G network Trump could intervene in case of bailed Huawei executive Huawei: Why has UK not blocked Chinese firm's 5G kit? Many of Huawei's clients opt for its products over rivals, such as Nokia and Ericsson, on both cost and technical grounds. In addition, its smartphones have proven popular with the public. Huawei recently revealed it had shipped more than 200 million handsets in 2018, placing it second only to Samsung in terms of market share. Huawei has just announced a new version of its P Smart phone with an edge-to-edge display ""We are ahead of others in domains like wireless, optical, data communications, and smart devices,"" wrote chairman Guo Ping in a New Year's message shared online. ""For 5G markets that choose to not work with Huawei - they will be like an NBA [National Basketball Association] game without star players: the game will go on, but with less deftness, flair, and expertise."" Beijing's criticism of the UK was published in the Global Times,an English-language government newspaper,external. It said Ministry of National Defence spokesman Wu Qian had told a press conference that suggestions the Chinese government might compromise Huawei's technologies were ""groundless"". It said Wu's comment was made in reaction to UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson saying earlier this week that: ""We've got to recognise the fact, as has been recently exposed, that the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way."" Having made play on a Jane Austen novel title, the newspaper also referenced another popular phrase to offer advice to Huawei, telling it to ""calm down and carry on""in a separate editorial,external.

"Recall MPs for Brexit vote, Corbyn urges","Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has urged the prime minister to cut short MPs' Christmas break to allow for an earlier vote on her Brexit deal. MPs are due back in the Commons on 7 January, and Theresa May has said the vote on the EU withdrawal agreement will take place the following week. However, in aninterview with the Independent,externalwebsite, Mr Corbyn said it must happen ""as soon as possible"". A Downing Street source told the Press Association it was a ""silly demand"". The vote on thewithdrawal agreementnegotiated by the PM with Brussels had been due to take place on 11 December. It was postponed by the PM when, after three days of debate, it became clear it would be ""rejected by a significant margin"". Met Police chief warns over no-deal Brexit Commons veto urged for Brexit trade deals Brexit: A really simple guide There was widespread anger among opposition parties when Mrs May told MPs they would not vote until mid-January. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. Mr Corbyn told the Independent: ""What I suspect is that it's a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea."" Ministers and the opposition alike argue that leaving without a deal would hit the UK economy badly. Official analysis published in November suggestedthat although output would continue to expand after a no-deal exit, growth would be 9.3% lower over a period of 15 years than would have otherwise been the case if the UK remained in the EU. The government has stepped up its planning for that scenario, while theEU revealed its contingenciesbefore Christmas. Pressed on whether he believed Mrs May should recall Parliament a week early, on 2 January, Mr Corbyn said it was ""in her hands"". ""I want us to have a vote as soon as possible, that's what I've been saying for the past two weeks, and if that means recalling Parliament to have the vote let's have it,"" he said. Please upgrade your browser Responding to the article, a Downing Street source was quoted by PA as saying: ""Instead of making silly demands, Jeremy Corbyn should be honest with voters that he has no alternative plan and only intends to frustrate Brexit, ultimately betraying the referendum result."" Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said a ""version"" of Theresa May's agreement with the EU can get through Parliament but that MPs who have threatened to vote against it will need further reassurances about the Northern Irish backstop. ""We can get this through, we absolutely can,"" he told Radio 4's Today. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The best thing is to put our heads down and make sure we have a version of this agreement that we can through Parliament."" The backstop is the plan aimed at avoiding the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - but many MPs fear it will leave the UK tied indefinitely to EU rules and split Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Concerns over the Irish border were solvable, Mr Hunt insisted, if the EU was willing to spell out in more detail how and when the backstop, if it were to come into force, would cease to apply. ""The EU has agreed that the backstop is temporary and what we need them to do is define what temporary is,"" he said. ""Because if it is temporary then Parliament can live with that, but you need to show us.""

Has it been the worst November for retailers?,"Mike Ashley, founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, has said that November was the worst month for retailers ""in living memory"". His comments came in a letter to the boss of Debenhams, of which Sports Direct is a big shareholder, which was revealed by the Telegraph. Allow Twitter content?

It was made before the official figures were released but his company also owns House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and more than a quarter of French Connection, so he should have a good idea of what is happening on the High Street. It's hard to know which measure to go for but the sales volume measure is probably a good place to start. This is a measure of how much was bought in the month, adjusted to exclude the effect of changing prices, which means that inflation should not affect it. It is also seasonally adjusted, which is important because the retailers who respond to the survey are not actually asked about calendar months. The research covers a four-week period, then another four-week period and then a five-week period. The responses are then adjusted to reflect calendar months, which means that important days for shopping such as bank holidays or, in the case of November, the period around Black Friday, would sometimes end up in the wrong month without seasonal adjustment. On this measure, this November was better than last November and indeed all other Novembers since records began. The latest figures from the ONS,externalalso estimate that the actual amount spent at retailers in November was up 5% on November last year, which is well above the 2.3% inflation rateannounced on Wednesday,external. So the official figures certainly don't back up Mike Ashley's claim. But is that a fair reflection of what has been going on on the High Street? Shops on the High Street have been feeling the competition from online retailers, which have been taking more and more of the retail spend for the past decade. Last month, for the first time, online sales accounted for more than 20% of total retail spend for the first time. In its weekly sales update on 27 November, John Lewis & Partners said that sales over the week of Black Friday had been the ""biggest in its history"" - although big volumes were partly driven by price-matching activity, which reduces profits for the store. But some researchers said that increasing online activity had hit other High Street chains harder. The headline official figures also do not reflect the costs faced by retailers. So, for example, in order to achieve these sales, a retailer may have had to double its staff, cut prices and open loads of extra stores. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, told BBC News: ""It's important to remember a lot of the sales seen in November were heavily discounted, to the detriment of retailers. ""Pair that with rising operating costs due to increasing business rates and labour costs with the increase of the National Living Wage and the minimum wage, and you often see sales growth being outstripped by operating costs."" The official figures also suggested that it had been a better month for smaller retailers than the big chains that Mr Ashley operates. ""ONS figures suggest that while large retailers (both online and offline) had a dismal November, Christmas apparently came early for small businesses,"" said Rachel Lund, from the British Retail Consortium. She pointed to figures suggesting that sales among small retailers had been up more than 13% compared with the previous November, while sales for large businesses had risen less than 2%. Another indication of how difficult things have been on the High Street comes fromthe retail analysts Springboard,external, who said the number of people out shopping in the UK in November had dropped to its lowest level since the 2008 recession. Footfall fell by 3.2% in November, which was a steep decrease in comparison with growth of 0.2% seen last November. The group tracks the number of shoppers visiting UK High Streets, shopping centres and retail parks. Diane Wehrle, Springboard's marketing and insights director, said: ""These figures are the worst footfall figures that Springboard has recorded since the recession - and we're not actually in recession. ""It's clear that something significant is happening out there in consumer demand. It has really railed back this year."" The company warned that more High Street chains could collapse in January, as shoppers who would previously have gone into a shop make their purchases online instead. It has certainly been a bad year for many retailers, with the collapse of High Street chains such as Maplin, Mothercare having to restructure and close many of its stores and a series of profits warnings. With figures up to the end of November, it has so far been the worst year for store closures since 2012. In addition to High Street names such as Poundworld and House of Fraser (which was bought out by Sports Direct), there have also been signs of challenges for online retailers. The online fashion retailerAsos has warnedof weak profits this financial year, after ""unprecedented"" discounting hit its trading in November. So while November's retail sales figures were better than expected, behind the figures there are signs of considerable challenges for High Street shops.

HMV on brink of second collapse,"Music retailer HMV has confirmed it is calling in KPMG as administrators. The move, the second in six years, involves 2,200 staff at 125 stores. Owners Hilco, which took the company out of its first administration in 2013, blamed a ""tsunami"" of retail challenges, including business rate levels and the move to digital. It said the stores would continue to trade while negotiations were held with major suppliers and it looked for buyers. The rise and fall of a music icon Did streaming finish off HMV? The councils trying to save the high street Boxing Day sales attracting fewer shoppers Retail theatre responds to high street downturn The Darkness performing at HMV's Oxford Street store Paul McGowan, executive chairman of HMV and its owner Hilco Capital, said: ""Even an exceptionally well-run and much-loved business such as HMV cannot withstand the tsunami of challenges facing UK retailers over the last 12 months on top of such a dramatic change in consumer behaviour in the entertainment market."" He pointed out HMV sold 31% of all physical music in the UK in 2018 and 23% of all DVDs and Blu-rays, with its market share growing month by month throughout the year. But he added that the industry consensus was that the market would fall by another 17% during 2019 and therefore it would not be possible to continue to trade the business.

BBC Money Box presenter and financial journalist Paul Lewis has advised people to use any HMV gift cards immediately. According to consumer publication Which?, whether vouchers and returns will be accepted following administrationdepends on the administrators,external. Their role is to ""try and save the company"", and in doing so, they ""may take the decision not to accept returns"". Hilco's ownership saw HMV host live events in store, with musicians including Kylie Minogue, Stormzy and The Darkness. Digital music revenue overtook sales of physical formats like CDs and records for the first time in 2012. Since then, online shopping, downloads and streaming provided by platforms such as Amazon, Spotify and Netflix, have continued to eat into sales of physical music. Julie Palmer, partner at business consultancy Begbies Traynor, said the fall of HMV had been ""coming for many years"". She added: ""It has been revealed that the business turnaround has been built on a bed of sand rather than rocks."" With video and music still its main sources of revenue, HMV was always likely to be one of the retailers struggling to make it through the Christmas holidays. But this is about more than a struggle to adapt to changing consumer habits. In millions of households, watching a movie now means turning to Netflix rather than selecting a DVD, andlistening to music means streaming it from Spotifyinstead of heading up to the attic to hunt through old CDs. HMV faced the same pressures of low consumer confidence, high rents and a lacklustre Christmas that have put other high street names in danger. And don't be surprised if this is not the end of the story. The Entertainment Retailers Association points out that when you tot up music, video and games there is still a market of nearly Â£2bn worth of physical products. Big releases such as The Greatest Showman, Ed Sheeran and Adele have still attracted millions who want to own a physical copy. So maybe there is another turnaround specialist out there to keep the HMV name alive into its second century. Richard Lim, Chief Executive, Retail Economics, said HMV's situation came amid a weak retailing climate. ""Poor Christmas trading has claimed its first victim,"" he said. But the chief executive of the Entertainment Retailers Association, Kim Bayley, said there was hope. ""What is clear is that following its first move into administration in 2013, HMV has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround and it is conceivable that this will happen again. ""The fact is the physical entertainment market is still worth up to Â£2bn a year so there is plenty of business there."" While Christmas is normally a time of higher revenues for retailers, the number of shoppers hitting the post-Christmas salesdipped this year. Britain's shops have also faced uncertainty over Brexit, which sparked a fall in the pound and therefore raised the price of imported goods, as well as rising labour costs, higher business property taxes and unseasonably warm weather.

'Half a million' potholes reported last year,"Cyclist Martyn Uzzell and his wife Kate on their wedding day Martyn Uzzell was on the latest leg of a charity bike ride when he hit a pothole and was thrown into the path of a car. He died instantly. He was cycling from Land's End to John O'Groats with his brother-in-law and a friend - all three of them experienced cyclists. Since his death in 2011, his widow Kate has been campaigning for better road inspections. However, the RAC claims ""shocking"" new figures prove road conditions are worsening. New research has revealed more than half a million potholes were reported by members of the public to local authorities for repair last year. The data was obtained from Freedom of Information requests to the 212 councils responsible for roads in Great Britain, of which 161 authorities provided comparable figures. Storms blamed as pothole claims double Road-repairing drone idea for potholes Pothole photos: Your pictures of crumbling roads Kate, from North Somerset, said the pothole that killed her husband had been reported to the local council twice by a police officer and by their own inspection team. ""The local authority didn't take any action,"" she said. ""And the consequences of their inaction was the death of Martyn, devastation for his family and friends, and our future was stolen."" The A-road that they were cycling on was generally in good condition and was far better than others they had faced. After spotting a pothole around a drain, Martyn's brother-in-law called back to warn the others. But for Martyn it was too late. ""The first I knew was two police officers turned up at my work,"" Kate recalled. ""They turned up and they obviously said that Martyn had been killed. ""They couldn't tell me what had happened to my brother. He couldn't speak when he got home. He was so traumatised by it."" Kate had been planning a surprise trip to Scotland to watch the three of them cross the finish line. She said that people don't realise the threat that potholes can pose and said the latest figures were ""upsetting"". ""What is dangerous to a cyclist can be perfectly safe for a motor vehicle."" The government said it was spending Â£6.5bn on road repairs from 2015-2021. Drivers breaking down after hitting potholes is at a three year high More than 512,000 potholes were reported to the 161 local authorities, up 44% on the 2015 figure of 356,000 potholes from 152 councils, the RAC said. Extrapolating the numbers to take account of councils unable to provide data, the RAC believes the increase in reports over two years is 33%. As well as being a danger to road users, potholes also caused problems to vehicles. Among the most common were damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels. Earlier this year, drivers breaking down after hitting potholes reached a three-year high, according to the RAC. RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: ""Perhaps motorists are more inclined to report pothole defects than they were a few years ago, but we believe the sheer size of the increase is further proof the condition of our roads is worsening."" He added the figures were ""just the tip of the iceberg"" as thousands of potholes go unreported every year. One in five local roads in England and Wales is in a poor condition and the frequency of road resurfacing has declined, according to the Asphalt Industry Alliance. This video can not be played Why do we have so many potholes? In October's budget, Chancellor Philip Hammondannounced an extra Â£420m of funding for councils to tackle potholes, on top of an existing fund of almost Â£300m.

'Half a million' potholes reported last yearThe RAC says the rise in the number of reports to councils proves road conditions are worsening.UK,"Cyclist Martyn Uzzell and his wife Kate on their wedding day Martyn Uzzell was on the latest leg of a charity bike ride when he hit a pothole and was thrown into the path of a car. He died instantly. He was cycling from Land's End to John O'Groats with his brother-in-law and a friend - all three of them experienced cyclists. Since his death in 2011, his widow Kate has been campaigning for better road inspections. However, the RAC claims ""shocking"" new figures prove road conditions are worsening. New research has revealed more than half a million potholes were reported by members of the public to local authorities for repair last year. The data was obtained from Freedom of Information requests to the 212 councils responsible for roads in Great Britain, of which 161 authorities provided comparable figures. Storms blamed as pothole claims double Road-repairing drone idea for potholes Pothole photos: Your pictures of crumbling roads Kate, from North Somerset, said the pothole that killed her husband had been reported to the local council twice by a police officer and by their own inspection team. ""The local authority didn't take any action,"" she said. ""And the consequences of their inaction was the death of Martyn, devastation for his family and friends, and our future was stolen."" The A-road that they were cycling on was generally in good condition and was far better than others they had faced. After spotting a pothole around a drain, Martyn's brother-in-law called back to warn the others. But for Martyn it was too late. ""The first I knew was two police officers turned up at my work,"" Kate recalled. ""They turned up and they obviously said that Martyn had been killed. ""They couldn't tell me what had happened to my brother. He couldn't speak when he got home. He was so traumatised by it."" Kate had been planning a surprise trip to Scotland to watch the three of them cross the finish line. She said that people don't realise the threat that potholes can pose and said the latest figures were ""upsetting"". ""What is dangerous to a cyclist can be perfectly safe for a motor vehicle."" The government said it was spending Â£6.5bn on road repairs from 2015-2021. Drivers breaking down after hitting potholes is at a three year high More than 512,000 potholes were reported to the 161 local authorities, up 44% on the 2015 figure of 356,000 potholes from 152 councils, the RAC said. Extrapolating the numbers to take account of councils unable to provide data, the RAC believes the increase in reports over two years is 33%. As well as being a danger to road users, potholes also caused problems to vehicles. Among the most common were damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels. Earlier this year, drivers breaking down after hitting potholes reached a three-year high, according to the RAC. RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: ""Perhaps motorists are more inclined to report pothole defects than they were a few years ago, but we believe the sheer size of the increase is further proof the condition of our roads is worsening."" He added the figures were ""just the tip of the iceberg"" as thousands of potholes go unreported every year. One in five local roads in England and Wales is in a poor condition and the frequency of road resurfacing has declined, according to the Asphalt Industry Alliance. This video can not be played Why do we have so many potholes? In October's budget, Chancellor Philip Hammondannounced an extra Â£420m of funding for councils to tackle potholes, on top of an existing fund of almost Â£300m. Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's (LGA) transport spokesman said councils were fixing a pothole every 21 seconds but needed more funding to ""embark on the widespread improvement of our roads that is desperately needed"".

Angelina Jolie hints at move into politicsThe actress and UN special envoy told the BBC she would go where she was needed.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Could Angelina Jolie have a future in politics? Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie has hinted that she is considering a move into politics in the future. In an interview on theBBC's Today programme, she said she would have dismissed this 20 years ago but would now go where she was needed. Jolie, who is a special envoy to the UN Refugee Agency, was the guest editor of the Today programme on Friday. She is an active campaigner on a range of issues, including refugees, sexual violence and conservation. In a wide-ranging interview with presenter Justin Webb, she discussed US politics, social media, sexual violence and the global refugee crisis. When asked whether she would consider getting involved in politics, she said: ""If you asked me 20 years ago, I would've laughed... I always say I'll go where I'm needed, I don't know if I'm fit for politicsâ¦ but then I've also joked that I don't know if I have a skeleton left in my closet"". ""I'm also able to work with governments and I'm also able to work with militaries, and so I sit in a very interesting place of being able to get a lot done."" Jolie joins BBC Radio for Christmas Berry and Jolie to edit Womanâs Hour She added that ""for now"", she would stay quiet. When Webb suggested that meant she could be on the list of 30 to 40 Democrats running for the party's presidential nomination, she did not say no, replying ""thank you"". Jolie is one of a range of guest editors, including David Dimbleby and Martha Lane Fox, who are taking charge of the programme between 22 December to 1 January. She also discussed the difficulties of monitoring her children's social media activities, highlighting that like ""most parents"", she cannot control everything they are exposed to. ""There are certain realities to teenagers and also our generation doesn't understand half of what they are doing with their tech so they can get around us pretty easy"", she said. She added that none of her children have asked to join Facebook, and she herself is not a member. ""We're the last family that hasn't gone on Facebook!"" she said.

Missing cruise worker search suspended,"Arron Hough was last seen in the early hours of Christmas Day The US Coast Guard has suspended its search for a British cruise ship entertainer believed to have gone overboard on Christmas Day. Arron Hough, 20, went missing from the Harmony of the Seas when it was 267 miles north-west of Puerto Rico. The alarm was raised when Mr Hough, from Sunderland, failed to report for work on Tuesday. The coast guard halted the search after two days, describing it as a ""difficult decision"". Royal Caribbean, which operates the ship, said the last CCTV footage of Mr Hough showed him heading on to the ship's deck at about 04:00 local time. When staff realised he was missing later that day,the US Coast Guard was alerted. Three aircraft and a ship covered more than 3,700 sq miles looking for Mr Hough before the search was called off, the coast guard said. Harmony Of The Seas is on a seven-night tour of the Caribbean A spokesman for the US Coastguard, Jonathan Lally, said when Mr Hough is believed to have entered the sea, the water was relatively warm and visibility for a search was good. He said: ""From the time we got the initial report the sea temperature was 81F (27C) and the air temperature was was 71F (21C). ""We also had 10 miles of visibility which is pretty clear. We factor in a lot of things such as sea temperature and wave height."" He added: ""There are cases when a person has survived for days in the water."" Mr Lally said suspending a search was ""one of the most difficult decisions we have to make as first responders, and it is never made lightly"". He added: ""Anytime we go out on a search and rescue there is always that hope that we are going to bring someone back and reunite them with friends and family. ""We've been in contact with members of Mr Hough's family throughout our search efforts and know this is a very difficult and painful time for them. Mr Hough attended London drama school Urdang Academy, which posted amessage on Twitter on Wednesday,externalsaying it was ""praying"" for the entertainer and his family. His talent agency, Russell Smith Associates, tweeted in July that Mr Hough would be joining the cast of Grease The Musical. Harmony Of The Seas is on a seven-night tour that left Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on 23 December, calling at St Maarten, San Juan, Puerto Rico and Haiti.

Commons veto urged for Brexit trade deals,"Parliament must be given a veto over any trade deals the UK signs after Brexit, a committee of MPs has urged. Ministers hope to begin negotiating deals with key partners once the UK leaves the EU in March and start implementing them from 2021 onwards. The International Trade Committee said MPs must have a ""meaningful role"" in ratifying deals, with scrutiny at an early stage and a decisive final vote. The government is not obliged to give Parliament a vote on treaties it signs. However, ministers bowed to pressure and agreed to give MPs a vote on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU which, if the Commons approves it next month, will take the form of a treaty. Brexit: A really simple guide What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? Theresa May faces an uphill struggle getting the agreement through the Commons, having postponed the crucial vote earlier this month in the face of what looked like a heavy defeat. Many Tory MPs are concerned that the agreement will keep the UK indefinitely tied to EU rules and regulations, and hamper its ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US and Canada. US President Donald Trump has questioned the value of a future trade deal with the UK if it is not able to alter its tariffs and regulations. But, at the same time, campaigners have warned that the UK may be forced to water down food safety, consumer protection and environmental standards to reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners. MPs are calling for Parliament to be given an enhanced role in considering future trade agreements once the UK regains the power to negotiate its own deals. The cross-party committee is urging the government to operate from a ""presumption of transparency rather than secrecy"" in negotiating the UK's post-Brexit trade policy. Its new report suggests MPs debate a substantive, amendable motion before negotiations are under way, once the government has agreed an outline approach - allowing Parliament to express its ""concerns or objections"", and lowering the risk of it rejecting eventual negotiated agreements. The committee also recommends that the government hold regular consultations with interested parties, such as businesses, to enable them to share their opinions while the devolved administrations should have a statutory role in the process. Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal? The SNP's Angus MacNeil, who chairs the committee, said the government's current plans for Parliamentary input were ""characteristically vague"". ""Our report makes an unequivocal argument for transparency over secrecy, consultation over concealment, and parliamentary debate over simple rubber-stamping,"" he said. ""If the proper processes and protections are not put in place from the outset, the government may fail to realise the UK-wide post-Brexit benefits it has gone to such lengths to promote."" A Department for International Trade spokesperson said it had been ""very clear that we will not lower food standards as part of any new free trade agreement"".

US budget impasse over Trump wall drags on,"The National Archives building in Washington has been shut down by the dispute A partial US government shutdown is likely to continue into next week amid an impasse over funding for President Trump's proposed Mexico border wall. Both Congress chambers met for just a few minutes on Thursday but took no steps to end the closure. The House and Senate will now meet again on Monday. Many lawmakers did not return to Washington for the sessions. Whether or not to fund the wall is the issue holding up the passing of a government funding budget. Both sides now seem to accept that the dispute will continue into 2019. The funding dispute has left hundreds of thousands of federal employees either on unpaid leave or not knowing when they will get paid. Six things that could topple Trump's border wall Who pays for Donald Trump's wall? Mr Trump says he will not compromise on his demands for funding to build a border wall between the US and Mexico to tackle illegal immigration. This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" He is refusing to sign a wider spending package, forcing large parts of the government to shut down. But opposition Democrats - who take over the House of Representatives in January - and some within Mr Trump's party, the Republicans, insist they won't give the president the $5bn he says he needs.

The situation has added to concerns over the outlook for the US economy in 2019, leading the stock market on a rollercoaster ride in recent days. US stock markets rally after slide His Republican Party controls both chambers of the outgoing Congress and the budget was indeed passed by the House on Thursday by 217 votes to 185. However, he needs to find 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate, where the Republicans currently have 51, so he needs to enlist the support of Democrats there. Ten consequences of the 2013 shutdown Nine of 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice began partially shutting down after funding for them lapsed at midnight (05:00 GMT) last Saturday. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to work unpaid or are furloughed, a kind of temporary leave. In practice, this means that: Customs and border staffwill keep working, although their pay will be delayed.Airportswill continue operating. About 80% ofNational Parksemployees will be sent home, and parks could close - although some may stay open with limited staff and facilities. About 90% ofhousing departmentworkers will take unpaid leave, which could delay loan processing and approvals. Most of theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) will be sent on unpaid leave, including those who assist taxpayers with queries. The Food and Drug Administration will pause routine inspections but ""continue vital activities"". The remaining 75% of the federal government is fully funded until September 2019 - so the defence, veterans affairs, labour and education departments are not affected.

Michelle Obama 'most admired woman in US',"Michelle Obama finished second to Hillary Clinton three times Former US first lady Michelle Obama has ended Hillary Clinton's 17-year run as America's most admired woman.

BBC axes Film programme after 48 years,"Between them, Claudia Winkleman, Jonathan Ross and Barry Norman hosted the show for 44 years The BBC has confirmed it will not broadcast its long-running Film... series next year. The programme first aired in 1971 and has since been fronted by Barry Norman, Jonathan Ross and Claudia Winkleman. ""In 2019 we will be creating an enhanced offer for lovers of film both on television and online,"" the corporation told BBC News. ""We're still working through the details and will have more news about what this will look like soon."" Film's title has changed annually since it launched, to reflect the year in which it was being broadcast. It began in 1971, airing only in the South East area of the UK, with rotating guest presenters including Joan Bakewell. The following year it expanded and was broadcast to the whole country, with Norman its first permanent host. Edith Bowman, Charlie Brooker and Clara Amfo have guest hosted Film since Winkleman left Winkleman, the show's most recent regular host,left the show in 2016, and the programme has since been fronted by various guest presenters including Edith Bowman, Clara Amfo and Charlie Brooker. But its profile was at its highest in the 26 years when it was hosted by Norman, who was such a well-known TV presence that he was caricatured as a puppet on Spitting Image. He also had a catchphrase - ""And why not?"" - invented for him by impressionist Rory Bremner. It was a time when Norman combined his incisive reviews of the week's releases with on-set reports of future releases and interviews with Hollywood's biggest names. In 2014,he named Jamie Lee Curtis, Martin Scorsese, Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney,externalas four of his favourite interviewees during his time on the show. But even when the programme was at its height, fixed in a regular time slot, it did not appear on TV throughout the year - which meant that some major releases (particularly summer blockbusters) only got a summary review from Norman when the programme returned from its annual mid-year break. The BBC said in a statement that its new plan to cover film from now on would fix that anomaly, offering ""a more consistent approach across the year"".

What happened when Thatcher met Gazza,"Margaret Thatcher praised England's 1990 World Cup football squad for not diving when she met them after the tournament, released files show. The then PM invited the players to No 10 after they reached the semi-finals, losing on penalties to West Germany. And she praised them for not resorting to play-acting, saying: ""Unlike other teams, our players did not immediately seek the Oscar for best actor."" The comment was revealed in a speech note released by the National Archives. The team's visit to Downing Street came after an uplifting summer for England fans at the end of a decade repeatedly blemished by hooliganism - and an era in which Mrs Thatcher had often been critical of football and its authorities. How Italia 90 changed England National Archives: Vera Lynn 'Spam fritters' row English clubs had been banned from playing in European competitions, following Liverpool fans' involvement in the Heysel Stadium disaster that cost 39 lives. Mrs Thatcher had wanted to introduce an ID card system that would have meant only registered fans could attend matches, while the government had even considered withdrawing from Italia 90 amid fears it would provide a ""natural focus"" for violence. The idea was dismissed and Bobby Robson's team went on to top their group, beating Belgium and Cameroon en route to the semi-final. A 23-year-old Paul Gascoigne was propelled to international stardom in the process. And the files released from the National Archive in Kew, West London, suggest aides saw the PR value in being associated with what turned out to be a successful tournament. Mrs Thatcher's private secretary Dominic Morris advised allowing her speech to be filmed ""since it would help promote the image that you are not anti-football (but simply anti-hooliganism)"",  the documents show. The draft speaking notes show she wanted to congratulate the team for winning the Fifa Fair Play Trophy and note the players were often first to ""stretch out the hand of friendship to the opposing team player"". According to the draft speech, she said: ""We all noticed too that when an England player was brought down, unlike other teams, our players did not immediately seek the Oscar for best actor for impersonating the death scene from Richard III. ""You got on calmly with the game and always accepted the referee's decisions without demur.""

Stormzy's big year," Under a single light, with water cascading from above, Stormzy looked dramatic. The Brit Awards performance at the O2 Arena in February had started serenely - a gospel song from Gang Signs & Prayer, backed by a balaclava-clad choir, their faces lit up in the darkness. Stormzy smiled as he sang the words: I said a prayer this morning, I prayed I would find a way, to another day, I was so afraid, till you came and saved me. But the beat, and Stormzy’s expression, soon changed. Taking off his top, he stood directly under the spotlight. Yo, Theresa May where's that money for Grenfell? What you thought we just forgot about Grenfell? You criminals - and you got the cheek to call us savages. You should do some jail time, you should pay some damages. We should burn your house down and see if you can manage this. Stormzy had revealed what he’d planned to say only to his producer, his sound engineer, and a couple of close friends. During rehearsals, as Brit executives and producers watched, he’d used a dummy lyric to throw them off the scent. Downing Street shot back the next day, defending the government’s actions and saying millions had been committed to the community. The authorities’ slow response to the fire at Grenfell Tower in June 2017, which killed 72 people, and the conditions that led to the blaze, had already been criticised by a number of rappers. The rapper Lowkey said the burned-out building made a sort of violence, that is usually invisible, suddenly visible. Musician and author Akala was more blunt.  “The people who died and lost their homes, this happened to them because they are poor,” he told Channel 4 News. Stormzy’s Brits rap came after he was challenged by a guy from Ladbroke Grove called Riz, he later revealed at the launch of his book, Rise Up: The #Merky Story So Far. Stormzy said he visited Grenfell with Riz and met some of the affected families. “It proper dawned on me at that point. I was like, surely man can do something with whatever platform man’s got to ensure something happens?” When Stormzy rapped about Grenfell, he seemed to get a response. In the months that followed, he was mentioned in Parliament. Some felt he had helped influence Theresa May’s decision to appoint a more diverse panel for the Grenfell Inquiry - after encouraging his supporters to sign a petition. Stormzy himself didn’t want to exaggerate his impact. “All we've done is... say words. In terms of actually making change and making something happen, I wasn't quite convinced,” he told Radio 1 Newsbeat. “Until the people in that situation fully feel like they've received their justice, then I'm not too sure about all of that.” But the Brits moment was still one of the most pivotal in Stormzy’s career. Large sections of the country, who had previously either paid no notice or pigeonholed him, sat up and watched. Stormzy’s music resonates for poor working-class people, says Spotify’s Head of Editorial Austin Daboh. “Whether you’re a kid in a council estate in Toxteth in Liverpool, an Asian kid in an estate in Bradford, or a young black south London teenager, you can all relate.” Now Stormzy was calling out the prime minister at an awards show. He looked supremely comfortable. Young black men from south London aren’t supposed to feel that kind of confidence. The Brits was just the first example in 2018 of Stormzy going to places he wasn’t supposed to go, and doing things he wasn’t supposed to do. When tourists get on the London Underground, they could be forgiven for thinking there’s not much going on in the south of the city. Some Tube maps don’t even show Brixton. For Stormzy though, growing up as Michael Omari, there was nothing north of Brixton. “You see where the 109 starts and it finishes? That was the world. That was the whole world,” Stormzy said at the launch of his book Rise Up. The 109 bus begins not far from East Croydon train station, and heads through Thornton Heath, Streatham, and into Brixton. Get on and you’ll go past a Harris Academy school like the one Stormzy went to, one of several dotted around south London. Streatham Common is a rare bit of greenery on the route, before it terminates a couple of minutes walk from Brixton Academy - just past the famed Electric Avenue. “I didn’t know nothing outside of that,” Stormzy said. He grew up in Thornton Heath, an unremarkable looking part of Croydon. On its High Street you’ll find a Subway sandwich shop, a Poundland discount store, a few halal butchers, betting shops, and Caribbean, Chinese and African restaurants. If you’ve never been there, Stormzy’s debut album Gang Signs & Prayer might be the easiest way to imagine it. South London had little representation during grime’s early years. The genre’s pioneers hailed from east. “For me, Bow E3 was the promised land,” Stormzy said in Rise Up. In recent years though, south London has been represented faithfully by an array of artists across various urban genres. Peckham’s Giggs kicked down the doors in the mid 2000s, paving the way for the likes of Krept and Konan, Bonkaz, and Stormzy himself. Up the road from Stormzy, P Money helped lead a slew of MCs from Lewisham, while Brixton’s Sneakbo is only recently getting credit for laying the foundations of the Afro-swing/Afro-bashment sound that’s taken over airwaves this year. For Stormzy, Krept and Konan’s success was a turning point. They gained popularity quickly after the release of their first mixtape, Redrum, in 2009. Krept and Konan Their lyrics were the kind that have led to scare stories about drill music in 2018 - they reflected the violence they’d witnessed around them. But their emphasis on wordplay made them stand out. Their lyrics became a fixture in many Blackberry Messenger and MSN screen names, and their songs flew from phone to phone in schools in and around London. They achieved mainstream success, winning Mobo and BET awards for their work. South London was finding its voice. Stormzy (centre) performs on stage at Red Bull Culture Clash at Earls Court, London, on 30 October 2014 Michael Omari wasn’t always destined to be Stormzy. But whatever he chose to do in life, he was going to be good at it. “He was always asking the right and sometimes difficult questions, he was always trying to work out the pieces to the puzzle,” says Austin Daboh, who as head of music at 1Xtra brought Stormzy into the station early in his career. “There’s just a common theme that runs through a lot of successful people… they turn up on time, they’re polite, they understand the mechanics of the business that they’re working in. “He's just got that same work ethic that all A-list stars have.” Before becoming a musician he’d been, at various times, the student at the Harris Academy with the best GCSE grades, an Oxford University prospect and an engineering apprentice. He got six A*s, three As and three Bs at GCSE. “Being an excellent young black boy today, in this world, is defying the odds. I think excellence is something to strive for. I want to make my friends proud, and I want to make my family proud. And I know I can do that if I’m excellent,” he said in Rise Up. During Stormzy’s engineering apprenticeship, at college in Leamington Spa with 17 other kids, only one knew he wanted to become an MC. “I was literally like Batman - engineer by day, and MC by night,” he said at his book launch. When half-term came, and Stormzy returned to Croydon, he had an idea. “We had one week of half-term, and I was like ‘Oh, I’ll do a mixtape in one week…’ “And then I was like ‘ah, how many hours are in a week?’” The mixtape 168 ended up being his first full release, and earned him some hype back home. But there was an internal conflict between whether to chase his dreams in music or accept that he was on a path to a steady job. His show on Reprezent Radio in Brixton was clashing with his work - he was going to have to make a decision. “When I left work I didn’t tell anyone apart from my sister. I was living at home and I’d just moved back from the apprenticeship, and I know my mum was thinking, ‘Yo, what are you doing, you’re not working?’,” Stormzy said in Rise Up. Stormzy credits his mum, Abigail, as being the foundation of his Christian faith. And the faith she had in her son at that time was definitely repaid. He often mentions her as someone who always held the family up and always had a smile on her face. In his Brits freestyle he said he was “raised up by black girl magic” - his two sisters and Abigail. “The Ghanaian spirit in general, I believe, is pretty humble and hard working,” says Twin B, who is head of A&R at Atlantic Records UK, and British Ghanaian like Stormzy. “There’s a common thread of mums who have been out working three jobs and dads who have been doing the same. “That humble and hardworking spirit is something that runs through to a lot of people, Stormzy included.” This portrait of Stormzy and his mother Abigail was taken by Olivia Rose and is on display at the National Portrait Gallery This portrait of Stormzy and his mother Abigail was taken by Olivia Rose and is on display at the National Portrait Gallery Twin went to one of Stormzy’s first ever live shows, at a club called Gorilla in Manchester. The show was “sort of split in two, there was a DJ and a band, and some of it worked and some of it didn’t”. Twin wanted to chat with Stormzy afterwards to go through some feedback. “But he was stood with the musical director for about an hour going through it, asking questions and trying to perfect it. “I remember being like, ‘Wow, this guy is taking this so seriously’.” And then there’s Smoky Mike - a name the people around Stormzy have for the person who comes out when he gets angry or tells them off, when he wants high standards. His success happened quickly but with hard work. Stormzy had uploaded a freestyle to YouTube titled Wickedskengman [part 1] in 2013 - before he’d left his job. It showcased Stormzy’s trademark cheekiness and charm - there are 15 seconds where he starts to talk, ends up laughing, and starts again, before actually getting into the rap. Wickedskengman [part 2] dropped three months later, in early 2014. Twin saw the videos before he met Stormzy. “This guy was using everything that everyone loved about grime: the DIY ethic, in terms of making his own video, the funny lyrics - but the hardness to it - the street edge. It being captivating, it being energetic.” Then there was Know Me From - which was shot in one take walking through Croydon, with a cameo from mum Abigail - and Shut Up. That video - already with more than 83 million YouTube views - was filmed at South Norwood Lake, with Stormzy in a signature Adidas tracksuit. This one was bright red. It came after Kanye West invited a number of grime artists - including Stormzy - to join him on stage during his 2015 Brits performance. Kanye stood on stage with what felt like the whole of the grime scene behind him, hooded, clothed in black, with flames shooting above them. Watch the video back on YouTube and you can spot Novelist, Frisco, Skepta, Jammer and plenty more. It felt like grime, historically frozen out of awards ceremonies, had invaded. The friends introduced in the Wickedskengman series of freestyles, and in the video for Shut Up, accompanied Stormzy everywhere. “You’ve only got to look at some of his earlier career choices to see that he’s all about representation,” Austin Daboh says. “Whether that be him deciding not to go with an established manager from the old school music industry and choosing one of his close friends, which was definitely a diverse choice. “Whether that be you looking at the team around him and seeing that whether it be white or black, you’ve got Akua who’s female, you’ve got Rachel who’s female - you’ve got people around him that represent a whole heap of diverse choices in staff members. “And then you then look at the projects he’s put together... it’s all about representation.” Cause when I see Hus merking I feel the vibe. I see my people on the telly I feel alive. Jourdan Dunn up on those billboards I feel the pride. And Dan Kaluuya won the Bafta I could have cried. Grenfell got the headlines the day after the Brits but the rest of Stormzy’s rap showed what his 2018 was going to be about. After ridiculing the Daily Mail, Stormzy then name-checked: J Hus, a fellow best album nominee, Jourdan Dunn, the first black British model to make Forbes’s top-earning models list, and Daniel Kaluuya, Bafta’s 2018 Rising Star. Stormzy wanted to seek out talent. In July, he announced a deal with Penguin Random House to create an imprint called #Merky, aiming to help talented authors from backgrounds similar to his own who might otherwise struggle to get published. And in August, he made headlines after agreeing a scholarship in partnership with Cambridge University to fund two black students. He told Newsbeat that black students were “heavily under-represented in the top universities”. ""It’s so important for black students, especially, to be aware that it can 100% be an option to attend a university of this calibre.” He said that “as much as there’s been progress made, there’s still a long way to go”. The rapper said that at one stage, it looked like he could’ve been on his way to a Cambridge or an Oxford. ""But that didn’t happen for myself... so hopefully there’s another young black student out there that can have that opportunity through my scholarship."" Months later he said that the University of Oxford had rejected his scholarship idea, although Oxford denies ever receiving or turning down any proposal. Weeks before the Cambridge announcement Stormzy had turned 25 and celebrated in style. His Team Merky partnered with Spotify to take 260 of his fans on a surprise journey to Spain, along with some famous faces. It included a barbecue, a party and a performance. “It was proper mad,” says 23-year-old Olivia, from London. “It wasn’t like the VIPs were cordoned off, everyone was mingling with each other.” Stormzy’s 2018 birthday celebrations: “Proper mad” Olivia says she had lunch with Lethal Bizzle and Krept.  “When I went back to work the next day I spent the whole day thinking, ‘Did that even happen?’ “Stormzy’s only 25. I’ve got a brother the same age. “It showed Stormzy as a human being. You can always think that these people are big personalities, not even human, but seeing him interact with his fans and his friends showed me he’s basically the same as my brother - a standard 25-year-old black man, as to how open and friendly he was.” The first book to be published under #Merky’s deal with Penguin was released in November. Rise Up charts the journey of Stormzy and his team, and was edited and co-written by Jude Yawson. Stormzy got in touch with Jude, who’s also from south London, in 2014 after reading something he’d written about the rapper online. Stormzy mentioned that they should work on something together in the future. “Then in January he just appeared out of the blue, in my DMs again, and was like ‘Yo, I’m gonna put you in contact with Akua - my brand manager - and we’ll get things underway,” Jude told Newsbeat. Stormzy wanted to help young writers. “I thought to myself, ‘I’m in a position where I could create something that helps them’ - and that’s what I’m doing,"" he said. Next up for #Merky Books is Taking Up Space, written by Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi. The Cambridge alumni have written a book “for any black girl going to university”, Chelsea told Newsbeat. At uni, Chelsea says she realised a distinction between being a student and being a black student. “You’re there, you’re fighting for your rights, there are things that you have to face on a day-to-day basis - microaggressions, sometimes blatant racism. “And I know that happens every day in society but the university environment, it compounds it, it makes everything really heightened.” The book combines conversations with former and current students. Chelsea says she hopes it starts a conversation about what can be done to include black students as well as just increasing numbers. Even after the whirl of 2018 it seems unlikely Stormzy will have a quiet period. “I want #Merky to be literature, I want it to be education, I want it to be engineering, architecture - I want #Merky to be a thing that goes way past music and past everything,” Stormzy said. “I want it to be a real hub of culture.” You wouldn’t bet against his ambitions. Next on the long list though is the second album, which Stormzy promises is “groundbreaking”. “I’m gonna get judged on my art, I’m gonna get judged on the merit of my musicality - giving a real body of work and getting judged on... the artistic merit of it.” Credits AuthorKameron Virk Photography creditsOlivia RoseGetty ImagesAlamyPress AssociationPenguin Random HouseYouTube Online productionBen Milne EditorFinlo Rohrer Built with ShorthandAll images subject to copyright"
Three Britons killed in Iceland crash,"Three British tourists, including a young child, have died after their vehicle crashed while crossing a bridge in Iceland. The vehicle - a 4x4 - was carrying seven British people when the accident happened at around 9:30 GMT on Thursday, Icelandic Police said. The other four passengers in the car were critically injured and airlifted to hospital, police said. Two of those seriously injured are children aged between seven and nine. The Toyota Land Cruiser crashed through a railing on a one-lane bridge in southern Iceland. It then fell around eight metres onto a sandy river bank. The accident happened in an area called NÃºpsvÃ¶tn on Iceland's ring road between the town of KirkjubÃ¦jarklaustur and area of Skaftafell, which is part of the VatnajÃ¶kull National Park beauty spot. Sveinn Kristjan Runarsson, Chief Superintendent of south Iceland Police said police have not yet been able to talk to the injured passengers - who are now in hospital in Iceland's capital Reykjavik - about what happened. The group involved in the crash are from two British families. Police said it is not thought the road was icy, but humidity could have made the bridge's surface - which is made of steel - slippery. One of the first people on the scene was tour guide Adolf Erlingsson, who told BBC News he believed the driver had lost control. The accident took place on a 200-300 metre bridge over the area of NÃºpsvÃ¶tn on Iceland's ring road Mr Erlingsson said the car ""went through the railing and crashed down onto the bank"". ""It's kind of sandy, there's no rivers so it wasn't submerged in water. It just landed there on a sandy bottom and flipped over and was totally destroyed,"" he said. He added that he got out of his van and went to see if he could help. ""The car was a total wreck. When I got there four people were out of the car, one of them deceased. Then there were three people trapped in the car. ""The driver was alive and trapped more or less under the dashboard. We were trying to get the people out of the car and helping them, it was a very difficult situation."" A police car blocks off part of Route 1 - Iceland's main ring road around the country He said he spoke to some passengers who were ""semi-conscious"", adding: ""I tried to talk a bit to the driver to calm him down."" According to BBC correspondent Ben Ando, the 4x4 has been recovered and will be transported to the town of Selfoss where the bodies of two of the occupants will be taken out of the wrecked car. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We are supporting the family of several British nationals who were involved in a road traffic accident in Iceland and are in close contact with the Icelandic authorities."" Iceland's national ring road, also known as Route 1, is popular among tourists. The accident happened near Skaftafell in the south-east, which is made up of mountains, glaciers, waterfalls and beaches.

Clinical waste firm breached warnings,"Staff at the firm's base in Shotts were told on Thursday morning they were being made redundant Inspectors found a string of environmental breaches at a clinical waste firm which made all of its staff redundant. Healthcare Environmental Services (HES)told workers they were losing their jobsafter it was embroiled in a waste stockpiling scandal. Environmental regulators inspected HES sites in Dundee and Shotts this week. They found both were failing to comply with enforcement notices over the proper storage of waste. One former worker said the North Lanarkshire waste processing and incineration plant was at capacity. They said: ""Stuff has been stacking up for weeks, it is mostly from third party contracts so I am not surprised Sepa has been back round. I don't know what happens to it now but if it sits there for weeks or months then there will be issues with smells and the like."" In September, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) flagged up issues at a waste transfer station in Dundee and the plant in Shotts resulting in enforcement notices being issued. Further notices relating to the storage of waste were issued earlier this month and inspections this week revealed these had not been complied with. This video can not be played One worker who came out of the meeting said staff were crying after being told they were being made redundant In a letter given to employees on Thursday morning, managing director Garry Pettigrew said the firm had ceased trading due to circumstances ""outwith our control"". About 150 people are employed at the firm's base in Shotts, and almost 400 at depots throughout the UK. Employees had earlier been sent text messages warning them they might not be paid this week, with HES claiming its bank had refused to release funds. They were then called to meetings, where they were handed redundancy notices. NHS waste firm: Questions and answers Healthcare Environmental Services' future in doubt NHS scandal firm has been 'villified' says boss The letter said: ""I write to you to inform you that your position in the company will be made redundant with immediate effect. ""I apologise that there have been no previous consultations on this matter, however there are unforeseen circumstances that have proven to be outwith our control."" It said the company had been ""exploring all avenues, both politically and commercially, through enterprise schemes and sales of parts and the whole of the business to try to secure the future of the employees and the company"". But it added: ""We have been given no assistance at any time, from the politicians or enterprise bodies in England or Scotland, we have been unable to resolve matters, and accordingly the company will cease trading on December 27, 2018."" An employee told the BBC waste was piling up at the depot The company had responsibility for disposing of clinical waste from every hospital, GP's surgery, dental practice and pharmacy in Scotland. But it lost 17 contracts with NHS trusts in England earlier this year as a criminal inquiry was launched into a build up of waste at some of its depots. HES has claimed its reputation was destroyed by the UK government, and said a shortage of incinerators rather than its actions was to blame for the problems. Earlier this month the firm was also informed it would lose its NHS Scotland contract in April of next year, and subsequently saidits banking facilities had been cut off. Redundancy notices were handed to staff during meetings on Thursday morning Speaking as he left the Shotts base, worker Gary Hawthorn said:  ""We knew it was coming, the writing has been on the wall for the past four months and they are still in denial saying it is not their fault, it is everybody else's. ""Gutted really, a lot of time and effort, a lot of overtime, expecting wages to arrive and they don't arrive, that puts our families in a position now."" On 12 DecemberNational Services Scotland (NSS) said it had taken responsibility for wastefrom every hospital, GP surgery, dental practice and pharmacy to cope with a potential backlog of clinical waste after HES withdrew its service. The Scottish government said it had contacted HES and offered to provide support to employees through its initiative for responding to redundancy situations, Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (Pace). Business Minister Jamie Hepburn added: ""After previously not engaging with this offer of support we hope that the company will now do so to assist their employees."" A spokeswoman for NHS National Services Scotland (NSS) said contingency measures were in place to collect waste previously collected by HES. A spokeswoman for the Department for Health and Social Care in England said HES had ""made a number of unfounded allegations against the government which are completely untrue"". A Sepa spokesman said: ""Sepa is continuing to robustly regulate and monitor the two HES sites in Dundee and Shotts to ensure the environment and communities remain safeguarded. ""Following the issue of two enforcement notices in September, Sepa served further enforcement notices on HES earlier this month. These are to ensure each facility complies with permit conditions for the storage of waste. ""Inspections by Sepa this week have established that HES has not fully met the requirements of our latest enforcement notices, and Sepa is continuing to robustly regulate the company."" The spokesman said if HES entered into liquidation then responsibility for complying with the enforcement notice would fall to any insolvency practitioner appointed. The BBC has approached HES for a comment. Clinical waste staff 'gutted' over job losses.

What happened when Thatcher met GazzaMargaret Thatcher once praised England's 1990 World Cup stars for not diving - unlike their opponents.UK,"Margaret Thatcher praised England's 1990 World Cup football squad for not diving when she met them after the tournament, released files show. The then PM invited the players to No 10 after they reached the semi-finals, losing on penalties to West Germany. And she praised them for not resorting to play-acting, saying: ""Unlike other teams, our players did not immediately seek the Oscar for best actor."" The comment was revealed in a speech note released by the National Archives. The team's visit to Downing Street came after an uplifting summer for England fans at the end of a decade repeatedly blemished by hooliganism - and an era in which Mrs Thatcher had often been critical of football and its authorities. How Italia 90 changed England National Archives: Vera Lynn 'Spam fritters' row English clubs had been banned from playing in European competitions, following Liverpool fans' involvement in the Heysel Stadium disaster that cost 39 lives. Mrs Thatcher had wanted to introduce an ID card system that would have meant only registered fans could attend matches, while the government had even considered withdrawing from Italia 90 amid fears it would provide a ""natural focus"" for violence. The idea was dismissed and Bobby Robson's team went on to top their group, beating Belgium and Cameroon en route to the semi-final. A 23-year-old Paul Gascoigne was propelled to international stardom in the process. And the files released from the National Archive in Kew, West London, suggest aides saw the PR value in being associated with what turned out to be a successful tournament. Mrs Thatcher's private secretary Dominic Morris advised allowing her speech to be filmed ""since it would help promote the image that you are not anti-football (but simply anti-hooliganism)"",  the documents show. The draft speaking notes show she wanted to congratulate the team for winning the Fifa Fair Play Trophy and note the players were often first to ""stretch out the hand of friendship to the opposing team player"". According to the draft speech, she said: ""We all noticed too that when an England player was brought down, unlike other teams, our players did not immediately seek the Oscar for best actor for impersonating the death scene from Richard III. ""You got on calmly with the game and always accepted the referee's decisions without demur.""

"Commons veto urged for Brexit trade dealsMPs say they must be able to properly scrutinise post-Brexit deals, not merely ""rubber-stamp"" them.UK Politics","Parliament must be given a veto over any trade deals the UK signs after Brexit, a committee of MPs has urged. Ministers hope to begin negotiating deals with key partners once the UK leaves the EU in March and start implementing them from 2021 onwards. The International Trade Committee said MPs must have a ""meaningful role"" in ratifying deals, with scrutiny at an early stage and a decisive final vote. The government is not obliged to give Parliament a vote on treaties it signs. However, ministers bowed to pressure and agreed to give MPs a vote on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU which, if the Commons approves it next month, will take the form of a treaty. Brexit: A really simple guide What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? Theresa May faces an uphill struggle getting the agreement through the Commons, having postponed the crucial vote earlier this month in the face of what looked like a heavy defeat. Many Tory MPs are concerned that the agreement will keep the UK indefinitely tied to EU rules and regulations, and hamper its ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US and Canada. US President Donald Trump has questioned the value of a future trade deal with the UK if it is not able to alter its tariffs and regulations. But, at the same time, campaigners have warned that the UK may be forced to water down food safety, consumer protection and environmental standards to reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners. MPs are calling for Parliament to be given an enhanced role in considering future trade agreements once the UK regains the power to negotiate its own deals. The cross-party committee is urging the government to operate from a ""presumption of transparency rather than secrecy"" in negotiating the UK's post-Brexit trade policy. Its new report suggests MPs debate a substantive, amendable motion before negotiations are under way, once the government has agreed an outline approach - allowing Parliament to express its ""concerns or objections"", and lowering the risk of it rejecting eventual negotiated agreements. The committee also recommends that the government hold regular consultations with interested parties, such as businesses, to enable them to share their opinions while the devolved administrations should have a statutory role in the process. Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal? The SNP's Angus MacNeil, who chairs the committee, said the government's current plans for Parliamentary input were ""characteristically vague"". ""Our report makes an unequivocal argument for transparency over secrecy, consultation over concealment, and parliamentary debate over simple rubber-stamping,"" he said. ""If the proper processes and protections are not put in place from the outset, the government may fail to realise the UK-wide post-Brexit benefits it has gone to such lengths to promote."" A Department for International Trade spokesperson said it had been ""very clear that we will not lower food standards as part of any new free trade agreement"".

Europe theme for Edinburgh Hogmanay events,"The Torchlight Procession marks the beginning of Edinburgh's Hogmanay events Edinburgh Hogmanay revellers have been warned by police not to use drones to film the street celebrations. Officers will be patrolling ""known locations"" where the small aircraft could be flown. Ch Supt Kenny MacDonald said ensuring the safety of the thousands expected to see in the New Year was vital. Hogmanay events are being kicked off on Sunday with pipe, drum and dance bands leading the annual Torchlight Procession. Other highlights over the three days include the famous Street Party, the Concert in the Gardens and a ceilidh in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle. Writers pen 'love letters to Europe' Go-ahead for Edinburgh's festive events Franz Ferdinand to headline Hogmanay party More than 160,000 people are expected to descend on Scotland's capital for the various outdoor gatherings. It is illegal for unmanned aircraft to be flown within 150m (492ft) of a congested area or a large group of people. To comply with that rule, a no-fly zone is in force during the Hogmanay celebrations. In the UK, legislation came into force in July, making it illegal to fly a drone within 1km (0.62 miles) of an airport. It is also illegal to fly a drone higher than 400ft (120m). Before the Christmas holiday drone activity led to flights to and from London's Gatwick Airport being grounded. About 1,000 flights were affected during the airport's 36 hours of chaos. Ch Supt MacDonald told BBC Scotland: ""Our position remains the same as it has done in previous years where there is a no fly zone in place for both the torchlight event and the street party and that is really about public safety to make sure there are no drones flying over particularly crowded areas of the event. ""Legally they [drone operators] would be committing an offence. We have observers in place both for crowd dynamics but they will also be looking out for drones and we also have officers who will be patrolling known locations where potentially drones could be flown from."" Scottish band Franz Ferdinand will headline the Concert in the Gardens Organisers are hoping the festivities will be be problem-free. Thousands are expected to be entertained by Scottish singer Stephanie Cheape who will headline the finale of the Torchlight Procession, ahead of fireworks from Calton Hill at 21:00. Other events include; Marking the end of Scotland's Year of the Young People, with 14 wicker sculptures created by young people forming apart of a flaming outline of Scotland created by torchbearers in Holyrood Park. Franz Ferdinand headlining the Concert in the Gardens on Hogmanay while DJs The Mac Twins will host the Street Party event. The annual Loony Dook will see brave bathers charge into the Firth of Forth on New Year's Day. The Message from the Skies event will also be held on 1 January. To mark the year of Brexit, six Scottish writers were asked to each write a love letter to Europe with these then projected onto iconic buildings and landmarks around Edinburgh animated by a range of different composers and projection artists. The Mac Twins are hosting the Street Party Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam, directors of Edinburgh's Hogmanay said: ""The Torchlight Procession is an iconic event in Scotland's annual calendar enjoyed by tens of thousands of people as the opening of Edinburgh's Hogmanay. ""After last year's successful change of route to weave through the Old Town and its blazing finale celebrating the voice of Scotland's young people we are thrilled that this year's procession culminates in the torchbearers creating the outline of Scotland with sculptures chosen by Scotland's young people at the heart of the display, marking the end of its highly successful Year of Young People. ""This year's Edinburgh's Hogmanay has a fantastic line-up of events for young and old under the banner We Love You, a celebration of Scotland's long-standing cultural ties with Europe. ""From our Concert in the Gardens headliner Franz Ferdinand to Carlos Nunez at the McEwan Hall, Massaoke at Bairns Afore to Gerry Cinnamon and Snap! at the Street Party, and the Loony Dook to our six writers creating love letters to Europe in Message from the Skies across the city, the programme is diverse, exciting and fresh.""

Restrictive job adverts 'put women off',"Liv Garfield, of Severn Trent, is the youngest female CEO of one of the top 100 businesses in the UK Women are put off from applying for jobs in male dominated industries because of ""restrictive"" application forms, a top business chief has said. Severn Trent chief executive Liv Garfield, one of the UK's youngest female CEOs, said some women were not applying for roles because of ""must have"" skills lists. She said companies needed more female trailblazers. Her firm ""blind marks"" CVs - removing applicants' names, race or sex. Campaigners say large companies in male-dominated industries such as water, rail and construction have become increasingly aware that asking for specific experience in that sector reduces the number of women candidates for roles. Ms Garfield said businesses could make simple changes to recruitment processes to create more diverse workplaces - which would increase skill sets in the process. Severn Trent has 87,000 water customers across mid and north Wales under its Hafren Dyfrdwy brand. 'More women needed in top roles' in Wales Women 'half as likely' to start a business The women who want to work in a male prison Jobs for the boys? The top roles women have never had Its job adverts focus on asking for skills gained from a variety of sectors and activities outside work to attract a more diverse range of candidates - rather than a list of ""must have"" specific skills. ""Often lots of women don't have the confidence to think, 'do I match all of those boxes?',"" said Ms Garfield, who moved from Openreach to Severn Trent in 2014. ""If they don't match all the boxes, they immediately, almost, don't apply - they cross themselves off the list."" With 50% of Severn Trent's customers being women, she said it was vital there were more female role models in traditionally male-dominated sectors such as the water industry. ""If people can see that somebody has walked in those footprints or they can look up and see there is a role model there, it often gives people confidence. ""It's not that they couldn't have done it, it's just tricky being a trailblazer,"" she said. Jane Simpson, the first female chief engineer of UK rail industry, said work was still needed to attract women to male-dominated industries Ms Garfield's comments were echoed by fellow colleague Jane Simpson - who, in 2015, became the UK's first female chief engineer of railways. ""I do believe that what you see is what you can be,"" said Ms Simpson, who left school at 16 and did her degree while working as an apprentice before doing a masters degree. She moved to Severn Trent about two years ago, and is the company's head of capital delivery. Ms Simpson said when she worked with Network Rail the firm changed its website and adverts to attract more women and young people to roles. But she said there were still challenges to get more women into construction jobs. ""If you see a female engineer with children... you are more likely to join that organisation and be that woman,"" she added. 'Outdated ideas' keeping women out of building industry The women shaping Wales' digital future Wales' 5G advisory group criticised for being all men Gender equality charity Chwarae Teg has been working with companies, particularly in construction, to help promote greater diversity in the workplace. ""Very often they realise they've got a problem but they don't understand why because they don't feel they've ever done anything to put women off,"" said Helen Antoniazzi from the charity. Family-owned business Miles Hire has changed its job adverts and has seen an uplift in the number of women applying In south Wales, family-run plant hire business Miles Hire has been working with Chwarae Teg to attract more women to its roles. Before the changes, 90% of job applicants for roles were male. Owner Ryan Miles said that figure was now split 50-50 between both sexes. ""We changed a lot of the wording in the description of the jobs to make it more appealing to all candidates,"" Mr Miles said. ""We changed the silhouette to make it both male and female in the job applications, and that seemed to work very well to bring in different types of candidates.""

Clinical waste firm breached warningsHealthcare Environmental Services fails to comply with enforcement notices at two of its Scottish plants.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Staff at the firm's base in Shotts were told on Thursday morning they were being made redundant Inspectors found a string of environmental breaches at a clinical waste firm which made all of its staff redundant. Healthcare Environmental Services (HES)told workers they were losing their jobsafter it was embroiled in a waste stockpiling scandal. Environmental regulators inspected HES sites in Dundee and Shotts this week. They found both were failing to comply with enforcement notices over the proper storage of waste. One former worker said the North Lanarkshire waste processing and incineration plant was at capacity. They said: ""Stuff has been stacking up for weeks, it is mostly from third party contracts so I am not surprised Sepa has been back round. I don't know what happens to it now but if it sits there for weeks or months then there will be issues with smells and the like."" In September, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) flagged up issues at a waste transfer station in Dundee and the plant in Shotts resulting in enforcement notices being issued. Further notices relating to the storage of waste were issued earlier this month and inspections this week revealed these had not been complied with. This video can not be played One worker who came out of the meeting said staff were crying after being told they were being made redundant In a letter given to employees on Thursday morning, managing director Garry Pettigrew said the firm had ceased trading due to circumstances ""outwith our control"". About 150 people are employed at the firm's base in Shotts, and almost 400 at depots throughout the UK. Employees had earlier been sent text messages warning them they might not be paid this week, with HES claiming its bank had refused to release funds. They were then called to meetings, where they were handed redundancy notices. NHS waste firm: Questions and answers Healthcare Environmental Services' future in doubt NHS scandal firm has been 'villified' says boss The letter said: ""I write to you to inform you that your position in the company will be made redundant with immediate effect. ""I apologise that there have been no previous consultations on this matter, however there are unforeseen circumstances that have proven to be outwith our control."" It said the company had been ""exploring all avenues, both politically and commercially, through enterprise schemes and sales of parts and the whole of the business to try to secure the future of the employees and the company"". But it added: ""We have been given no assistance at any time, from the politicians or enterprise bodies in England or Scotland, we have been unable to resolve matters, and accordingly the company will cease trading on December 27, 2018."" An employee told the BBC waste was piling up at the depot The company had responsibility for disposing of clinical waste from every hospital, GP's surgery, dental practice and pharmacy in Scotland. But it lost 17 contracts with NHS trusts in England earlier this year as a criminal inquiry was launched into a build up of waste at some of its depots. HES has claimed its reputation was destroyed by the UK government, and said a shortage of incinerators rather than its actions was to blame for the problems. Earlier this month the firm was also informed it would lose its NHS Scotland contract in April of next year, and subsequently saidits banking facilities had been cut off. Redundancy notices were handed to staff during meetings on Thursday morning Speaking as he left the Shotts base, worker Gary Hawthorn said:  ""We knew it was coming, the writing has been on the wall for the past four months and they are still in denial saying it is not their fault, it is everybody else's. ""Gutted really, a lot of time and effort, a lot of overtime, expecting wages to arrive and they don't arrive, that puts our families in a position now."" On 12 DecemberNational Services Scotland (NSS) said it had taken responsibility for wastefrom every hospital, GP surgery, dental practice and pharmacy to cope with a potential backlog of clinical waste after HES withdrew its service. The Scottish government said it had contacted HES and offered to provide support to employees through its initiative for responding to redundancy situations, Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (Pace). Business Minister Jamie Hepburn added: ""After previously not engaging with this offer of support we hope that the company will now do so to assist their employees."" A spokeswoman for NHS National Services Scotland (NSS) said contingency measures were in place to collect waste previously collected by HES. A spokeswoman for the Department for Health and Social Care in England said HES had ""made a number of unfounded allegations against the government which are completely untrue"". A Sepa spokesman said: ""Sepa is continuing to robustly regulate and monitor the two HES sites in Dundee and Shotts to ensure the environment and communities remain safeguarded. ""Following the issue of two enforcement notices in September, Sepa served further enforcement notices on HES earlier this month. These are to ensure each facility complies with permit conditions for the storage of waste. ""Inspections by Sepa this week have established that HES has not fully met the requirements of our latest enforcement notices, and Sepa is continuing to robustly regulate the company."" The spokesman said if HES entered into liquidation then responsibility for complying with the enforcement notice would fall to any insolvency practitioner appointed. The BBC has approached HES for a comment. Clinical waste staff 'gutted' over job losses.

US budget impasse over Trump wall drags onBoth chambers of congress adjourn within minutes of opening their sessions on the disputed budget.US & Canada,"The National Archives building in Washington has been shut down by the dispute A partial US government shutdown is likely to continue into next week amid an impasse over funding for President Trump's proposed Mexico border wall. Both Congress chambers met for just a few minutes on Thursday but took no steps to end the closure. The House and Senate will now meet again on Monday. Many lawmakers did not return to Washington for the sessions. Whether or not to fund the wall is the issue holding up the passing of a government funding budget. Both sides now seem to accept that the dispute will continue into 2019. The funding dispute has left hundreds of thousands of federal employees either on unpaid leave or not knowing when they will get paid. Six things that could topple Trump's border wall Who pays for Donald Trump's wall? Mr Trump says he will not compromise on his demands for funding to build a border wall between the US and Mexico to tackle illegal immigration. This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" He is refusing to sign a wider spending package, forcing large parts of the government to shut down. But opposition Democrats - who take over the House of Representatives in January - and some within Mr Trump's party, the Republicans, insist they won't give the president the $5bn he says he needs.
