The path from violent crime to killer,"Westminster attacker Khalid Masood had a history of violence, but how typical is his past of those who go on to carry out acts of terror? Masood, 52, who has been claimed by so-called Islamic State as a ""soldier of the Caliphate"", had spent time in prison for offences including violent assaults and possession of offensive weapons. In one instance, when in his mid-30s, Masood slashed a man's face with a knife following an argument in a pub, for which he served two years. While this criminal past may contradict stereotypes of those involved in religious extremism, Masood is only the latest manifestation of a criminal-turned-jihadist. Throughout Europe, there has been a pattern of criminals being drawn to violent jihad. Those who travel to Syria as foreign fighters are typically already known to police for something other than extremism. Khalid Masood had been jailed for violent crimes In Germany, two-thirds of foreign fighters had criminal records and more than half of those from Belgium and the Netherlands had a similar background. Among perpetrators of terrorist attacks, criminal pasts are also common. Berlin Christmas market attacker Anis Amrihad convictions for theft and violence, and had sold cocaine in the months before the attack. Among theperpetrators of the November 2015 Paris attacks, a number had previous convictions for robberies and drug dealing. This is no mere coincidence, as the extremist narrative often resonates with criminals. What we know about attacker Khalid Masood Who were the victims of the attack? More stories on the attack and aftermath,external At the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) in King's College London, we recently published a report analysing the criminal backgrounds of European jihadists and found their radicalisation is often linked to their criminality. Indeed, jihadism is sometimes used to legitimise further crime against ""non-believers"", with some extremists stating that crime and violence is permissible when living in the West. They also claim that jihadism offers redemption from previous sins, the search for which typically comes after a period of crisis in the perpetrators' lives. That crisis is often prompted by criminality - such as being imprisoned - but it need not be. Masood crashed his car into railings outside Parliament However, it is striking that Masood does not fit the typical profile of a criminal-turned-jihadist, simply due to his age of 52. Older jihadists are usually more involved in extremist support networks - as radicalisers and recruiters, rather than as attackers. While Theresa May said Masood had been investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism, he was considered a peripheral figure and was not part of current investigations into extremism. In one crucial respect, however, Masood does fit the picture of the criminals-turned-jihadists that we have examined - he was familiar with violence. If a terrorist has a criminal background, it is very often a violent one. Stabbings, assaults, and violent behaviour are recurrent patterns amongst perpetrators of terrorist attacks with existing criminal records. This violent group is disproportionately represented when compared with those convicted of non-violent crimes. For Masood, this familiarity with personal violence may have made the ""jump"" into ideologically motivated violence that much smaller than it would otherwise have been.

IS leaves trail of destruction in Palmyra,"This video can not be played Lyse Doucet surveys the damage to Palmyra's Roman-era theatre Fariha remembers the exact moment when Islamic State fighters shattered her life in Palmyra. ""It was a quarter to five in the morning. We were asleep and heard a knock on the door,"" she tells me as we sit on thin, grey mattresses in an abandoned school in Homs, 160km (99 miles) from her home. This makeshift shelter, in the ruins of a Homs neighbourhood, is a refuge for her and five children, as well as 29 other families, who fled the brutal rule of so-called Islamic State (IS). ""They shouted at me to cover myself then entered my house, weapons in hand, and took away my husband and niece,"" she recalls as her little ones huddle close, listening, wide-eyed and silent. Her 15-year-old nephew and her brother-in-law were also taken at that fateful time when IS first stormed Palmyra in 2015. They had their throats cut. ""They killed a lot of young men,"" Fariha adds, in her softly-spoken story of unspeakable savagery. As IS loses ground in northern Syria, more and more gruesome accounts are emerging of their catalogue of crimes. IS militants have destroyed large parts of the historic site Damage to the Roman-era theatre is clear to see Families like Fariha's suffered twice over when IS lost, and then recaptured, the Roman ruins of Palmyra and the adjacent city. Now, after a second occupation, lasting only three months, the area was seized a few weeks ago by Syrian forces, bolstered by the blistering firepower of their Russian and Iranian allies. Palmyra's deserted buildings now yield evidence of its dark chapter. In the blackened basement of one villa, Syrian soldiers show us what they describe as a makeshift court room. Lyse Doucet examines Islamic State paperwork condemning people to death Mounds of blue files strewn across the floor are a measure of IS's scales of justice. On one file after another, there's the same small word scribbled in Arabic: ""qatl"" - executed. It was the fate of a woman named Farizha for ""spreading corruption on earth"". Marwan met the same end for ""turning from Islam"". Others faced floggings or fines. Two men, both named Ahmed, were sentenced to be ""thrown off the top of a building"". No reason is listed on their joint file. A sheet of paper taped outside the door, stamped with an IS seal of authority, notifies ""everyone who lives in this state that they must enrol in a course to learn about Sharia law"". ""Everyone who doesn't will be punished."" IS rule is over here. But with homes destroyed, and without electricity or water, Palmyra still isn't a place fit to live in, or safe to return to. Now both ancient and modern Palmyra are ruins. The modern part of Palmyra is also in ruins What was once a vibrant community of 75,000 is now an eerie ghost town. Charred buildings peppered with bullet marks and gaping holes scar every street. People fled not just IS persecution but an urban battlefield including ferocious bombardment by Syrian and Russian warplanes, which flattened multi-storey buildings into stacks of concrete pancakes. Palmyra's pain did not start or end with IS occupation. Its prison, known by the city's Arabic name Tadmur, was a symbol of torture and summary executions long before Syria's uprising began six years ago. Syrian soldiers now go house-to-house searching for explosives and booby traps. Russian troops, camped on the outskirts of the city, are helping to demine the area. The site of the ancient Roman city nearby stands as a stark tribute to Palmyra's survival. Despite the destruction of iconic structures such as the 2,000-year-old Arch of Triumph, Palmyra's elegant colonnaded street and striking symmetrical designs are still breathtaking. The legacy of IS in Palmyra casts a long shadow IS's return had bestowed a second chance to destroy more precious world heritage, but much of these monumental ruins still stand. The circular Roman theatre was their prime target in January. Its imposing centrepiece, a carved facade, was smashed, leaving a jumble of jagged stone boulders on its ancient stage. ""This was their revenge for the concerts staged here by Russia's Red Army Orchestra as well as Syrian orchestras,"" explains a government official, who accompanies us to the site. A dusty pile of glass candle holders wrapped in netting, and red plastic roses caked with dirt, are still tucked in some corners - mementos of the triumphal events in May 2016 when IS was defeated here the first time. There is still evidence of the celebrations after the first defeat of IS ""Recapturing Palmyra the second time was relatively easy,"" says Syrian officer Colonel Malik who fought in both rounds. ""The battles were more ferocious the first time."" Palmyra last fell into IS hands in December as the Syrian military was distracted by the last stages of the brutal battle for Aleppo and IS's ranks were reinforced by fighters fleeing frontlines in Mosul, crossing the border from neighbouring Iraq. ""I don't think we face the threat of losing Palmyra again,"" Colonel Malik tells me confidently as we stand outside the walls of the grand theatre. ""We've retaken the military airport nearby and the mountains, a space of nearly 70 sq km in less than a month, which proves IS is weakening now."" But harder battles, including an assault on IS's self-declared capital in Raqqa, still lie ahead. Confronting IS in their Syrian lair, closer to the Turkish and Iraqi borders, takes the fight onto messier and potentially dangerous political turf. Hundreds of American special forces, backed up artillery and airpower, recently moved into this theatre of war to bolster an array of Syrian Kurdish forces, as well as Arab fighters. Turkish troops are already on the battlefield, playing key roles over the past year in attacks on other IS-held towns. All these commands face a common enemy, but also deep seated rivalries and shifting alliances. The new US administration is still weighing how to balance a vital relationship with Turkey's President Erdogan while still making use of valuable Syrian Kurdish fighters Turkey sees as its enemy. Turkey moved closer to Russia over the past year, but they're still on opposite sides of this war with Ankara insisting President Assad's continuing rule is what's fuelling this conflict. The biggest question is whether President Trump's team, for whom fighting IS is the main goal, will now co-ordinate with Russia, which would end up strengthening President Assad's axis including Iran. ""The Syrian government's decision is to take back every inch of Syrian soil,"" insists Col Malik. ""Those criminals who infiltrated our country were supported by foreign countries like the US and the UK,"" he says, repeating the government's refrain that all rebel groups are creations of Western and Arab states. ""They're supporting, not fighting IS."" The same accusation is levelled against President Bashar al-Assad by the Syrian opposition and its allies who charge him with turning a blind eye to IS's advance to bolster his narrative that this is a global war against terrorism, not a fight for political change. The days of IS occupation may be counted, but its legacy casts a long shadow over a punishing war whose end is still nowhere in sight. Palmyra damage revealed by drone.

EU 'not in hostile mood' as Brexit talks beckon,"This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker: EU will negotiate in 'friendly and fair way' ""It's like musicians in their bow-ties playing on board the Titanic,"" remarked a friend of mine as I was talking to them about the EU's 60th anniversary celebrations in Rome. A mild exaggeration, shall we say - but the image sticks in my mind. Because as the leaders of the EU's 27 countries clink champagne glasses in plush, security-tight surroundings on Saturday - all is not well in the Europe outside their gates: youth unemployment persists (especially in the south), terror attacks, illegal migration, inequalities in the Eurozone, Brexit and a tide of anti-establishment populist nationalism across much of the bloc. To name a few of the challenges. Not to mention ""strongmen"" Presidents Trump, Putin and Erdogan who all eye the EU with suspicion and some animosity. ""Yes,"" conceded European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker to me in an exclusive interview. ""We are not in the best form and shape we could be in."" But, he insisted, the EU was still young, adding that what the bloc had achieved in six decades was remarkable - Europe is now a continent of stability and peace. But that was the vision, the goal after World War Two, I countered. Surely there's a need for a new vision? Something to capture the public imagination. To re-enchant the disenchanted? The EU marks its birthday on Saturday, while the UK will trigger Article 50 on Wednesday Mr Juncker recently published a White Paper on the future of the EU. where he explored five different scenarios - from increased union to paring pooled powers back to the common market only. In between, he breathes life into the old idea of a ""two-speed Europe"" - where some countries share more sovereignty for example over defence or migration, while others opt out. That proposal appears to be the most popular amongst politicians and civil servants, but to me it sounds like an open admission that there is, in fact, no common EU vision - with everyone doing different things at different times. All this at a very sensitive moment - when one of the EU's biggest and most influential members, the UK, is about to walk out of the door. And unity amongst the remaining 27 countries is key for Brussels - to prove to the outside world that the EU still stands strong. Theresa May's absence at the 60th birthday bash on Saturday will be screamingly noticeable. ""Of course we will miss her,"" President Juncker told me. ""I am everything but in a hostile mood with Britain. Britain is part of Europe, and I hope to have a friendly relationship with the UK over the next decades."" This video can not be played Brexit divorce: 'conscious uncoupling' or bitter breakup? Well, that of course will depend on what kind of future relationship the UK and EU can hammer out during Brexit negotiations. I wondered how the EU would balance the competing desires to keep the UK close yet not give it too good a deal so as to avoid the risk of other EU countries walking away? Mr Juncker admitted he did not want any more ""exits"": Nexit, Oexit, Dexit, Frexit or otherwise. That would be the end, he said, if three, four or five more countries left. The EU would collapse. But he doesn't believe that will happen. The EU and the Commission, he said, would negotiate with the UK in a friendly way - fair but never naive. Interesting choice of adverbs there. Echoed precisely in a speech delivered on Thursday by the EU's chief Brexit negotiator - Commission man Michel Barnier. ""Not naive""â¦ Now, does that refer to talk of the UK aiming to cosy up to individual EU countries (like the Baltic nations with promises of security co-operation) to cajole them into pressing for a good trade deal for Britain? Or does it perhaps allude to the government rejecting the idea of an ""exit bill"" as part of the EU divorce? It's an invoice that Mr Juncker insists must be paid. ""You cannot pretend you were never a member of the union,"" he practically spluttered. ""The British government and parliament took on certain commitments as EU members and they must be honoured. This isn't a punishment or sanctions against the UK."" Despite mutterings about the Commission drawing up a Â£50bn ($63bn) bill, Mr Juncker said the precise amount remained to be ""scientifically calculated."" But one thing he insisted that could not be haggled over was the fate of the 4.5 million EU citizens living in the UK and British citizens currently living across the EU. President Juncker said no-one had a right to eject them from their homes and jobs. ""This is not about bargaining,"" he insisted. ""This is about respecting human dignity."" As they  mark the EU's anniversary on Saturday, the bloc's remaining leaders will look with furrowed brows towards the future. But they may well take heart in a new trend emerging. While populist nationalist, anti-establishment candidates enjoy strong followings, at the same time unashamed Europhiles like the youthful leader of the Netherlands Green party, the French presidential hopeful Emmanuel Macron and the German candidate for Chancellor Martin Schulz resonate with the large sections of the public too. But Mr Juncker and others I've spoken to in the lead-up to the EU's anniversary, like his Vice-President Frans Timmermans and Antonio Tajani, the new President of the European Parliamant, all believe this is no time for complacency. In just a few days' time Britain will deliver a letter to Brussels, officially triggering the countdown to Brexit. How will Mr Juncker feel that day, I asked. ""Sad,"" he replied. ""It's a tragedy. ""A failure and a tragedy."" EU abuzz ahead of two key dates Brexit: The Divorce Papers. Video, 00:01:36Brexit: The Divorce Papers May to trigger Brexit process next week What is Article 50?

The adopted girl claimed by 50 birth families,"Jenna Cook puts up a poster to try and find her birth family When Jenna Cook went back to China at the age of 20 to search for her birth parents, she knew she was unlikely to succeed. What she didn't expect was that she would meet dozens of families who desperately hoped she was their lost child. Near a busy bus station in the Chinese city of Wuhan, on 24 March 1992, someone left a baby to be found. It's quite likely that they watched and waited from a safe distance until the girl was spotted. She was picked up and taken to the Wuhan Children Welfare House, close by. There she was given a name, Xia Huasi, meaning ""China's"", and assigned a birth date chosen at random by the director of the home. China's one-child policy meant that families faced heavy fines for having too many children. But it was also - and still is - illegal to give up unwanted children. There was no formal adoption process. But just days later China passed a law allowing foreign nationals to adopt, and at the end of June an American primary school teacher, Margaret Cook, came to collect Xia Huasi. She renamed her Jenna and took her home to Massachusetts. Jenna was one of the first wave of about 200 Chinese babies to go to American families. Many others followed - an estimated 80,000, mostly girls, have now gone to live in the US, and an additional 40,000 to the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. Jenna always knew that she was adopted. ""We would talk about adoption just like we would talk about what's for dinner. It never felt like something that was a big deal,"" she says. Nevertheless, she sometimes wondered where she came from. ""Even just looking at your own belly button, you think to yourself: 'Oh, I used to be attached to another human being. That's the body I came from, but who is that? Does that person even really exist?' It all seems so abstract. It sometimes just feels like you appeared on the planet. ""Most people are just born into the families they're born into and they never think twice about it. Whereas for adopted people there is always this possibility of another life."" Jenna and her adoptive mother, Margaret Cook Listen to Jenna Cookspeaking toOutlookon the BBC World Service Get the Outlook podcast Jenna and her sister, who was also adopted from China, grew up in an area where very few people looked like them. Their mother, Margaret, did what she could to maintain a connection to her daughters' country of origin - the girls learned Mandarin at school and they socialised with other families like theirs. When Jenna was a teenager she was one of four Chinese adoptees to feature in the acclaimed 2011 documentary,Somewhere Between,external. Director Linda Goldstein Knowlton had adopted a baby from China herself and wanted to document the lives of these young women - drawing the title from something Jenna said: ""I don't think that I could ever consider myself fully Chinese or fully American - I'm always going to be sort of somewhere between."" The 15-year-old Jenna captured in the film is a hard-working, high-achieving A-grade student. She is successful and loved, but haunted by a nagging doubt. Why did her parents give her up? Had she done something wrong? It's partly what drives her to be a perfectionist. In a moving moment in the film, Jenna speaks at an event for prospective adoptive parents and breaks down when she is asked how she feels about the word ""abandoned"". ""There's definitely a part of me that wishes I'd never heard the word 'abandonment',"" she says. Over the course of the film, Jenna delves deeper into her past and ends up volunteering for summer work at the very Chinese orphanage that took her in as a baby. Jenna Cook visits the orphanage where she stayed in 1992 Not all of the participants in Somewhere Between have a desire to return to China or find their birth families. In any case, adoptees are warned that attempts to trace birth families are unlikely to succeed. There is often very little information available, as birth families had to hide their identities for fear of punishment. And the records that existed in the 90s, when international adoption began, were badly kept. Add to this the sheer size and population of the country and it is a daunting task. But miracles do happen. Haley, one of the four girls featured in Somewhere Between, goes back to the village where she was found. While putting up posters she is recognised by a woman who immediately runs to fetch her family. The next thing Haley knows, she is being hugged and kissed by a man who says he is her father. An emotional family reunion follows in which Haley meets her mother and sisters - surprisingly, she has more than one. Everyone looks shell-shocked by the experience. In the West, adoptees searching for their birth parents can usually afford to take things slowly. But international adoptees don't have that luxury. They can probably only afford one such trip in their lives, says Bea Evans from the specialist company, Adoptive Family Travel. For more than 20 years she and her colleagues have taken internationally adopted children and their families to 18 countries including China, Guatemala, India and Korea (the Korean War led to the first wave of international adoptees in the US). ""Almost all international adoption has started in response to some kind of upheaval, whether it was political or financial or a policy like China's one-child policy,"" she says. The company organises visits to orphanages - or social welfare institutes, as they are known in China - and occasionally assists with family searches and reunions. Evans says there is an increasing amount of ""search and reunion"" taking place in South Korea. Could this also take off in China? ""I do wonder what will happen as more and more young [Chinese] women get to that age where they are saying: 'We want more information,'"" she says. The documentary maker Changfu Chang, who specialisesin Chinese adoption stories,external, hears about successful searches almost every month. So how does he explain it? ""Chinese society is a connected society, you do not really have many secrets,"" he says. ""As long as you get into that particular village or neighbourhood or community others will help to provide that information."" But Jenna was found near Hongji long-distance bus station, where 12,000 travellers arrive in Wuhan from all over the countryside every day. This made the search particularly challenging. A busy day at the bus station in Wuhan When she was 20 and studying at Yale University, Jenna was given a grant to travel to China to begin her own search. It was partly an academic exercise - she hoped her experience could help some of her fellow 80,000 Chinese adoptees in the US. But of course it was also deeply personal, and she asked her adoptive mother, Margaret, to accompany her. Jenna had printed flyers with pictures of herself at different ages and what little she knew about the circumstances in which she was found. She began handing them out to people in the streets of Wuhan, many of whom shared their own experiences. ""Oh, I had a neighbour once who had a daughter in a similar situation,"" they told her. Or ""I had a cousin who once gave up their child but I don't remember if it was in '92 or '93."" Jenna found this fascinating. ""I was pretty amazed that people were even paying attention to me, because I felt like I'm just one story in a huge migration of children from China,"" she says. ""I felt like I was just one raindrop in the puddle."" But people were interested in her story, and a week after she arrived an article about her search appeared in the local paper. It was short and tucked away on page five, but the headline tugged at the heartstrings: ""Dad, Mom: I really hope that I can give you a hug. Thank you for bringing me into this world."" It had a huge impact. In the weeks following the publication of that article on 25 May 2012, Jenna's search went viral. Hundreds of messages started coming in via social media. ""Their reactions were really polarised,"" says Jenna. Some people said: ""This is fantastic that you're searching and I hope that you're able to find your parents and that your dream comes true."" Others would say things like: ""This is such a big mistake, you're wasting your time and energy."" And: ""You're so ungrateful to your American family, you need to go back to America right away."" Among the tide of messages there were genuine responses from people who thought they might be Jenna's parents. She narrowed it down to 50 birth families, each of which had left a baby on the same street in Wuhan in March 1992. The implications of this are vast, says Jenna. What about other streets in the same month? What about other months? What about other years? What about the families who chose not to come forward? When she spoke to people who had worked at the bus station at the time, they said babies had often been left there. But as well as being shocked by the sheer numbers, Jenna was surprised they were willing to come forward. After all, it is against the law to abandon a child - and after the publication of the newspaper article Chinese television had started filming her search. ""Here are these people who have technically committed a crime and they're willing to come forward on national television. It was just unthinkable,"" she says. The article about Jenna in the Chutian Metropolis Daily Jenna and her mother arranged to meet the 50 families they thought could be a match. Some mothers and fathers came alone, but others brought the entire family, including grandparents. What surprised Jenna was that, far from being one-child families, often they had more than one daughter. What tended to happen was that they would keep their first daughter, and try again for a son. With each child they would incur penalties. Eventually, after having several daughters, they would decide to give one up, in the hope of saving a place in their family for a son. Jenna initially approached the meetings from an academic standpoint. She told herself she was there to collect stories. ""If I had gone into every meeting thinking: 'Maybe this is the one,' I would have been totally exhausted by the end of the day,"" she says. But she still had to steel herself. ""Especially for the first few meetings I was really nervous,"" says Jenna. ""I was really worried about what they would think of me. I was really worried that maybe I had done something wrong, and that was why they had abandoned me - I worried that they would be angry at me."" Jenna thinks this is because she had unconsciously absorbed some of the prejudices that surround the issue. ""In the US there is this dominant narrative that the reason why Chinese parents abandon children is because they don't like girls, and maybe they don't even remember them,"" she says. But she found this not to be the case at all. ""They all remembered their babies forever - it was this experience that they really regret and that they would never forget."" One woman brought a piece of delicate red-and-blue cloth that she had carefully kept - it was the material she had made her baby's suit out of. ""She had kept these scraps for 20 years like a memory of her daughter. And she always dreamed that when they would meet her daughter would have the clothes and she would have the scraps - kind of like a lock and key."" Sadly, Jenna did not recognise the material. ""I just remember shaking my head, I had never seen it. And the poor mother just collapsed. She was so devastated."" Another man she met, a long-distance bus driver, had spent a lot of time searching for his daughter. Whenever his bus route took him into the city he would go back to the area where they had left their baby and ask for her. They had left her with a note so she would grow up knowing her name. Each family approached Jenna as if she were their daughter. For a brief moment, they represented the other's missing part. One mother even began brushing Jenna's hair. Mostly, they wanted to know if she was OK - like people emerging from a disaster and wondering if the other side had also survived, says Jenna. They would ask: ""Is your adopted mother good to you or does she hurt you? Does she give you enough food to eat?"" Jenna would reassure them that she was well looked-after. ""They would just be so happy to know that I hadn't been suffering all this time."" In turn, she asked them: ""Was it something about me that made you relinquish me long ago? If I had been more beautiful or if I had been more obedient and had cried less would that have changed your decision?"" And they were able to reassure her. ""The parents just remembered their baby girl in such a loving way,"" says Jenna. But there was also the business of verification. Having established that the facts matched, they would look for a physical resemblance - things like height, or foot-shape or hand-shape. Sometimes they would want to check for birth marks. Then, if they felt that there were enough similarities, they would go ahead with a DNA sample. In the end, 37 families opted to do DNA. Sadly, all of the tests came back negative.  It was a real blow. ""I think another reason why it was hard seeing all of the negative DNA results come back was because I sure wished I could be the daughter to every one of those families,"" says Jenna. ""To be the person that could help relieve their suffering - who wouldn't want to be that person?"" Despite this, Jenna feels the experience has helped her. ""Before, there was always a small part of me that felt like there was something I could have done 20 years ago to have changed my fate and then I wouldn't have been relinquished by my family,"" she says. ""But after meeting the birth parents I realised it was really out of my control."" As an academic, it has changed her outlook completely.  ""It's a totally different experience to read in a history textbook about the one-child policy and read that parents abandoned their children or committed infanticide,"" she says. ""But to meet people who have really lived that experience, and to see their great regret, and their great love for this baby - it's just something that's indescribable."" Jenna spent last summer working in China, but is no longer actively searching. ""I would love to have the chance to reunite with my birth family someday,"" she says.

Who dares to piggyback on Kim Jong-un?,"The officer appeared to be overcome with emotion as he climbed onto his leader's back North Korea's test of a rocket engine last weekend was accompanied by the usual state media propaganda - but one image of its leader celebrating stood out in particular. What is the likely explanation? Theengine testwas claimed to be a success, a ""new birth"" for North Korea's rocket industry. Kim Jong-un was certainly happy. In pictures released by state news agency KCNA, he was seen watching the missile from afar; grinning in a control centre; shaking hands with jubilant officers - then, giving an elderly man a piggyback. Who would leap onto the back of a dictator such as this, and why? Observers say the mysterious man is not a known figure in North Korean politics. He is thought to have played a key role in the engine test, and most likely interacted with Mr Kim previously. North Korean observer Michael Madden says his uniform's insignias indicate he is a mid-level officer of the KPA Strategic Force, which is in charge of missile forces used for offensive attacks. While the image was almost certainly stage-managed, ""it wasn't completely machinated or fabricated"", says Mr Madden, who is with the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University. ""It was more a signal of allowance and encouragement than something completely machinated by an image maker."" North Korean propaganda films have in the past shown citizens being allowed to approach Mr Kim. The main purpose of the picture would be to burnish Mr Kim's domestic image as a jovial man of the people. While Mr Kim tries to project a ""recalcitrant and uncompromising"" image internationally, at home ""it is a different story"", notes Professor Jae-Cheon Lim, of the Korea University in Seoul. ""We know he is very strict with elites when they don't obey his orders. But in general towards the people his propaganda image is friendly and convivial."" In another photo released by KCNA, the same officer was seen embracing Kim It stands in stark contrast to his predecessors, who sought to be feared more than loved. ""Nobody would dare piggyback his father or even his grandfather,"" says Mr Madden. Kim Jong-un, North Korea's supreme commander Can North Korea's nuclear expansion be stopped? What can the outside world do about North Korea? Why is Kim Jong-un always surrounded by people taking notes? ""But this fits into the image [Kim] Jong-un has tried to cultivate -  that he is more open, on an interpersonal basis, than his father. ""It conveys a certain sense of political confidence in his rule and leadership of the country.  If he didn't feel secure, then he wouldn't allow these images to be disseminated - he would need to appear distant and cold."" Mr Kim was also photographed joking and laughing at the engine test site The image also suggests that Mr Kim is, for now, in good health. He was spotted limping and using a cane in 2014, leading to speculation that he had gout, and limping again as recently as late 2016. Piggybacking after a win may be more commonly seen on football pitches rather than in North Korean propaganda pictures, but Mr Kim is known for taking a sports management approach to his weapons development programmes. ""When a test is conducted, civilian and military personnel [are told they] should regard it as a sports competition - they win some, and lose some,"" says Mr Madden. ""They won't 'win' or meet technical specifications all the time, and when they 'lose' they study their performance and what happened."" But for all its contrived spontaneity, it does not mean that Mr Kim is not genuinely happy in the photo. Prof Lim points out that he had good reason to celebrate, with an apparently successful rocket engine test putting him one step closer towards his nuclear goals - and sealing his legacy. ""In the propaganda annals, his grandfather was the liberator of Korea through its anti-Japanese guerrilla war. His father succeeded in maintaining the regime even under economic poverty. ""But Kim Jong-un became leader quickly and has no significant achievements to point to so far. ""If North Korea becomes a nuclear state, it becomes his achievement."" Why is Kim Jong-un always surrounded by people taking notes? N Korea 'holds high-thrust engine test' Can North Korea's nuclear bid be stopped?

Trump voter's husband faces deportation,"A rally for two young people detained by immigration officials in Vermont The Trump Administration's immigration enforcement priorities have revived deportation orders ignored during the Obama Administration. On Monday, Mr Trump criticized local law enforcement agencies for refusing to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to detain and deport people living in the US illegally. The administration started publishing a weekly ""Declined Detainer Outcome Report"", which calls out local agencies that ignored orders to detain undocumented immigrants arrested for unrelated crimes. The report names the immigrants in question and lists ""crimes associated with those released individuals."" Despite promising to focus on violent criminals and gang members, President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration and his executive memo to the Department of Homeland Security empowers Ice to deport virtually anyone living in the US without documentation. Only one clear exception exists, for people with active Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) status. Here's a look at some of the most recent immigration cases across the US. Beristain, in blue, has been in the us for 19 years Roberto Beristain, 43 Detained: 6 February, from Granger, Indiana In 1998, Mr Beristain came to the US to visit an aunt and decided to stay. In 2000, he and his wife, a naturalised US citizen originally from Greece, accidentally crossed the Canadian border while sightseeing at Niagara Falls. When they crossed back into the US, border patrol agents detained Mr Beristain. A judge initially issued an order mandating that Mr Beristain voluntarily return to Mexico. When Beristain declined to leave, the order reverted to a final order. Instead Mr Beristain's lawyer convinced Ice agents to grant him leniency due to his family ties in the US and lack of criminal records. The agents helped Mr Beristain obtain a driver's licence, a work permit and a legal Social Security Number, and Mr Beristain went to work in the restaurant business. He is now co-owner of Eddie's Steak Shed in Granger, Indiana. Mr Beristain had to check in with Ice agents every year. This February, agents at the Indianapolis Ice office took him into custody. ""Trump says we're deporting bad hombres. Roberto is the farthest thing from a bad guy,"" said Jason Flora, who served as Mr Beristain's attorney until Saturday. ""You ask 100 people to paint a picture of a bad guy, not one would draw something remotely resembling Roberto."" His wife supported Mr Trump because of his immigration programmes, and thought her husband - a businessman and father - would be spared. ""We don't want to have cartels here, you don't want to have drugs in your high schools, you don't want killers next to you,"" Helen Beristain toldIndiana Public Media,externalearlier this year. ""You want to feel safe when you leave your house. I truly believe that. And this is why I voted for Mr Trump."" Because of the deportation order from 2000, Mr Beristain could be deported as early as Friday without a hearing before an immigration court. Henry Sanchez-Milian, 18 Arrested: 17 March, in Rockville, Maryland Police arrested Henry Sanchez-Milian and another undocumented teenager, Jose O Montano, 17, on charges of sexual assault after they allegedly trapped a fellow Rockville High School student in a school bathroom and raped her. Mr Montano is being charged as an adult. Immigration row over US school rape case Mr Sanchez-Milian has lived in the US for only eight months, after fleeing Guatemala. He had been awaiting a hearing with an immigration judge. Because he is considered a serious flight risk, he will likely remain in jail until a he's brought before a criminal court, said Montgomery County Assistant States Attorney Rebecca MacVittie. When an undocumented individual is convicted of a serious crime, standard procedure is to allow them to serve their prison sentence in the US and then transfer them to Ice custody to initiate the deportation process. It is unclear whether Mr Sanchez-Milian will be deported before a trial. Ice has issued an order for local law enforcement to keep him in custody. The case has been referenced by members of Mr Trump's administration as reason for  Mr Trump's ""crackdown"" on immigration. Gerardo Martinez-Morales, 52 Deported: 17 March, 2017, from Galveston, Texas Earlier this month, Mr Martinez-Morales was pulled over for a broken tail light, at which point officers identified him as an undocumented immigrant. He had lived in the US for nearly 20 years. He married a US citizen and has four American-born children under the age of 12. In 2004, Mr Martinez-Morales returned to Mexico to see family. Upon his return, he was arrested for crossing illegally at the Texas border, which set in motion his deportation order. Mr Martinez-Morales returned to the Houston area, and lived there without incident until this month. The Obama Administration's immigration priorities that allowed people living in the US illegally with no criminal record to stay in the US, even if they had a deportation order that predated 1 January 2014. Under the Trump administration, individual with a deportation order is a priority for removal. ""There has been a total change with this new administration,"" says Raed Gonzalez, Mr Martinze-Morales' attorney. ""This is a sharp shift in policy."" Mr Martinez-Morales was deported one week after his detention. Cesar Carrillo, 23,Enrique Balcazar, 24,Zully Palacios Rodriguez, 23 Detained:15 March and 17 March, in Burlington, Vermont Zully Palacios and Enrique Balcazar Mr Carrillo, Mr Balcazar and Ms Rodriguez are activists who belong to a Vermont-based immigration rights advocacy group called Migrant Justice. Ice agents arrested Mr Carrillo-Sanchez on Wednesday, as he was arriving to a court hearing for a misdemeanour charge at the Chittenden County courthouse. Two days later, Ice officials stopped a car that Mr Balcazar was driving, with Ms Rodriguez in the passenger seat, as they were leaving the Migrant Justice office. Both were detained by immigration officials, according to the organisation. Alex Carrillo (left) with daughter and wife at a rally to free Victor Diazz Members of Migrant Justice said that they view their detention as a sign that immigration officials are targeting activists and community leaders. Migrant Justice members have had run-ins with Ice in the past. Two other members, Victor Diaz and Miguel Alcudia, were detained last year, but were both released and had their deportation proceedings halted after public outcry. Mr Carrillo-Sanchez  and Mr Balcazar both immigrated to the US from Mexico. Ms Rodriguez is from Peru. Aaron Sarmiento-Sanchez, 35 Arrested: 17 March near Sells, Arizona Border Patrol agents from the Casa Grande Station in Arizona arrested Aaron Sarmiento-Sanchez for entering the US illegally. He had previously been deported in April 2013. When officers ran a background check on Mr Sarmiento-Sanchez, they found a 2006 conviction in Salinas, California, for ""lewd or lascivious acts with a child"". Mr Sarmiento-Sanchez was sentenced to six years in prison for that crime. Mr Sarmiento-Sanchez faces federal charges for re-entering the country illegally and will remain in detention until a judge rules on those criminal charges. See last week's report.

"New broom, new vroom? The future for Formula 1","Game faces on: The drivers are gearing up for the new season Much has changed in Formula 1 since Lewis Hamilton took the chequered flag at last year's season finale in Abu Dhabi. The reigning world champion, Nico Rosberg, haswalked off into the sunset. The cars have evolved, with new rules allowing them to become bigger, faster and more aggressive-looking. But the most significant transformation has taken place behind the scenes. Formula 1 isunder new ownership. Control has passed from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners to the US groupLiberty Media. As a result, former chief executive Bernie Ecclestone, the man who is credited with turning F1 into one of the world's most lucrative sports, has finally stepped down at the age of 86. The new chief executive is Chase Carey, a veteran of the US media industry and a former associate of Rupert Murdoch. He has already suggested thatF1 ""needs a fresh start"". So what might actually be changed? In commercial terms, Formula 1 is a curious beast. It is certainly lucrative. In 2015, its revenues reached $1.7bn, according to motorsport analysts Formula Money. Yet teams towards the back of the grid often struggle to make ends meet. Ferrari is well-funded under the current system Earlier this year, the Manor team finally closed down after several years of financial problems. Its collapse followed those of HRT and Caterham, who folded in 2012 and 2014 respectively. And even as revenues have been rising, TV audiences have been falling. The sport claimed 400 million viewers in 2016, down from a peak of 600 million in 2008. That may be partly due to a shift towards pay-TV in major markets such as the UK, Italy, France and Spain. Formula 1 is an expensive business: even the smallest teams employ about 200 people, and it costs at least $100m just to get on to the starting grid. Remaining there, however, is the biggest challenge. Small squads that don't win races and that don't get much television airtime often struggle to raise the sponsorship they need. And although roughly half of F1's revenues are distributed among the teams, they are not divided equally. Part of this is merit-based. The higher you finish in the World Championship, the more money you get. But some teams get extra bonuses, irrespective of how well they perform. Smaller teams like Sauber want to see F1 revenues distributed more evenly amongst the teams Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes and Williams all get extra funding. And Ferrari gets more than $60m simply for turning up, because of its place in the sport's heritage. The smaller teams think this is deeply unfair and argue that because in F1, success is heavily linked to financial resources, it distorts the competition. In 2015, the Sauber and Force India teamslodged a formal complaint,externalwith the European Commission. Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn says she hopes matters will change under Liberty Media. Talks so far, she says, have been ""very encouraging"". Although altering the way payments are made would inevitably mean some of the larger teams getting less, she thinks they will co-operate. ""Why shouldn't it happen?"" she says. ""The big teams know that the show has to be a healthy show. ""If viewing figures continue to go down and we don't have that 'aha effect', sponsorship will go down and they will suffer equally, probably more, because they need more money to keep their operations going."" Graeme Lowdon, a motor racing entrepreneur who helped to found the Manor team, agrees that a more level playing field is needed, ""What people want to see in F1 is a sport where skill is rewarded,"" he says. ""The sports that have grown in the past few years are the ones that are focused on parity, such as the NFL."" Nico Rosberg retired days after winning his first F1 world title Another area where change may be needed is in how F1 reaches out to its fanbase. In recent years, the sport has focused on maximising its revenues, but despite expanding into new markets, it has arguably failed to attract a new generation of enthusiasts. Races have been held in countries with little or no F1 heritage or established audiences, but where governments have proved willing to pay ever-higher sanctioning fees in exchange for the glamour associated with hosting a grand prix. At the same time, fewer events have been held in the sport's European heartlands, where organisers are less willing to pay more than $30m for the privilege. Liberty Media appears keen to reverse that trend and introduce new races in the United States, in an effort to broaden the sport's appeal. Chase Carey has taken over at the helm of Formula 1 That could mean getting rid of lucrative but controversial events like the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which Liberty Media's chief executive Greg Maffei recently said ""does nothing to build the long-term brand and health of the business"". However, according to Formula Money's Christian Sylt, that strategy may not work if F1 wants to keep its revenues at their current level. ""I do not believe there is a 'big ticket' alternative revenue stream to race hosting fees"", he says. But perhaps the biggest challenge of all is to bring in a new generation of enthusiasts. ""We need to do something to connect with younger fans,"" says Sauber's Monisha Kaltenborn. ""You know, we don't want people who are just 40-something watching the sport. We have to go into digital media and social media far more. ""That's not a question about instantly making money, but it's about positioning yourself towards young people, so that tomorrow they'll come and watch a race."" Can F1 under Liberty Media succeed in attracting younger fans? Former Jordan team commercial manager Ian Phillips puts it even more bluntly. ""At the moment Formula 1, it hurts me to say it, is just not that exciting,"" he says. The problem, he thinks, is cost. Champions Mercedes spend upwards of $400m a year on their cars, and other teams simply can't compete. So the racing becomes boring. ""I have a 13-year-old son who just watches the first lap, then he goes away,"" he says. So wealthy F1 may be - but if it can't attract the kids, it may well find itself overtaken by other, more appealing sports before long.

Victims of the Westminster terror attack,"(From left) PC Keith Palmer, Kurt Cochran and Aysha Frade all died in the attack A mother of two young daughters, a retired window cleaner and an American tourist celebrating 25 years of marriage were among the victims of a terror attack in the heart of London. Five people were killed when Khalid Masood drove his car into crowds on Westminster Bridge and then stabbed a policeman outside the Houses of Parliament on 22 March 2017. Here are their stories. John and Aysha Frade Aysha Frade had been walking across Westminster Bridge to pick up her two young daughters from school when she was killed. She had suffered head and chest injuries and died at the scene. The British national, 44, worked as a PA at a nearby independent sixth-form, DLD College London. Ms Frade's husband John said it caused the family ""excruciating pain to think of Aysha in the past tense"", saying she had been ""cruelly and brutally ripped away from us"". He said she was ""relaxed, fun to be around, laughing and smiling"" and had a smile that was like the sun ""popping out from behind a cloud"". ""Her spirit lives on in the eyes of her children,"" he added. Ms Frade's sister, Michelle, said: ""People cannot understand how this despicable act of futile atrocity has impacted on not only her families' lives but also herself. ""She will never be able to smile again or see her daughters grow up."" Principal Rachel Borland described her as ""a highly regarded and loved"" member of staff, adding: ""She will be deeply missed by all of us."" Her father was of Cypriot origin, while her mother was from the Galician town of Betanzos in Spain, where her two sisters run an English school, theVoz de Galicia,externalreported. Leslie Rhodes, from Clapham, south London, had been visiting St Thomas' Hospital when he was hit by the car driven by Masood. The 75-year-old retired window cleaner was taken to King's College Hospital but died the following day from a head injury. Mr Rhodes was one of three people to have died after being hit on Westminster Bridge His niece, Amanda Rhodes, said the family was ""devastated"" and ""incredibly angry"" about his death. She described him as ""placid, quiet, and kind"", adding that ""everyone loved him"" and he ""would do anything to help anyone who needed it"". Ms Rhodes said he loved his job as a window cleaner and would stop and enjoy tea with his customers before his retirement. She said: ""Les will be greatly missed by all his family and friends who loved him."" Friend Janine Roebuck said Mr Rhodes had been ""immensely proud"" of having cleaned the windows at Chartwell - the Kent home of Sir Winston Churchill - for ""many years"". ""He was exceptionally fit for a man of his age. I would turn around and he had bounded up the ladder like someone half his age,"" she said. Kurt Cochran's wife Melissa survived the attack but was left with a broken leg and rib Kurt Cochran, 54, from the US state of Utah, was in London as part of a holiday celebrating 25 years of marriage to Melissa, who was seriously injured in the attack. He died at the scene on Westminster Bridge from multiple injuries. CCTV footage of the attack, played at the inquest, showed the moment Mr Cochran saved his wife's life by pushing her away from the path of Masood's car before being hit by it himself. Melissa described her husband as ""my inspiration, my rock star, and most of all my hero"", adding: ""We wish everyone had Kurt's love and compassion for others."" She said: ""I was so lucky to have had 25 wonderful years with the man of my dreams. He made me laugh every single day. ""I cherish every single memory we made."" She said she was ""forever grateful"" for their time together, ""and especially his heroic actions on that day, saving my life"". It was the couple's first trip abroad. They were also visiting Melissa's parents, who work on a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mission, and had been due to return to the US the day after the attack. Mr Cochran owned Onion Street Studio, a sound-recording studio in his home state. His friend, Evan Mullaly, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was always happy-go-lucky, very passionate about his work in the music industry. ""The kind of guy who would give you the shirt off his back, a genuinely kind human being. It's a tragedy what happened."" Andreea Cristea was visiting London with her boyfriend Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea, 31, fell into the River Thames after being driven at by Masood as she walked across Westminster Bridge with her boyfriend, Andrei Burnaz. She died in hospital just over two weeks later. Her family described the interior designer as a ""lovely, enchanting and life-loving"" woman, who had a thriving business. She had written a note on what would turn out to be her final New Year's Eve, saying the coming year would be ""the best of my life"". ""I will have a wonderful man by my side, who will love and cherish me and with this man I will start a wonderful family,"" the note said. Her family said they had been ""hoping for a miracle"" when she was in hospital following the attack and told of their ""heartbreakingly sad"" loss when she died. ""All her dreams were shattered when she went on her final trip,"" they added in a statement. The couple were in London to celebrate Mr Burnaz's birthday and he had been planning to propose to Ms Cristea that day. PC Keith Palmer, 48, was killed as he tried to stop Masood outside the Houses of Parliament. He was an unarmed member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection squad, who had served in the Met for 15 years. PC Palmer, who had a young daughter, died at the scene after being stabbed in the chest. He had been wearing a body armour vest issued as routine to Metropolitan Police officers. In a statement issued shortly after his death, his family said that they were ""shocked and devastated"" and he would be remembered as ""a wonderful dad and husband"". ""A loving son, brother and uncle. A long-time supporter of Charlton FC. Dedicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous. A friend to everyone who knew him. ""He will be deeply missed. We love him so much."" His sister Angela said he joined the force because he wanted to ""make a difference"". She said: ""Keith died protecting strangers whilst doing his job and he will be remembered by many for his courage and bravery."" Chief Inspector Neil Sawyer said ""his brave actions that day did not surprise me"". ""While many would remember him for his ""brave actions"" and ""ultimate sacrifice"", Mr Sawyer added: ""To me and others he was our dear friend."" This video can not be played Conservative MP and former colleague James Cleverly's emotional tribute to PC Palmer His funeral was held at Southwark Cathedral, with thousands of police officers lining the route of the funeral cortege, starting at the Palace of Westminster. A fundraising appeal from the Metropolitan Police Federation in PC Palmer's memory has raised hundreds of thousands, with the money going to his family. In total, 50 people were injured in the Westminster attack. Among those injured were British and Irish citizens, as well as those from France, Greece, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Italy, China and South Korea. They included three French schoolchildren on a trip to London from St Joseph's School in Concarneau, Brittany, and four politics students from Edge Hill University in Ormskirk, Lancashire, who were on a visit to Parliament. Two police officers were among those treated in hospital.

Let them eat cake! The new approach for hospital food,"Serving cakes to patients in the afternoons was a welcome move at Kingston Hospital Patients at Kingston Hospital, in south-west London, used to say the food was a major disappointment. When patients were asked for feedback, the poor quality of hospital meals was mentioned more often than anything else. So Duncan Burton decided to do something about it - starting with the breakfasts. Out went the limp bread and plain cereals and in came scrambled eggs, toast, porridge and fruit during the week, with sausages and bacon on offer at the weekends. Despite the challenges of providing toasters around the hospital and not setting off fire alarms during the toasting process, he knew the extra hassle would be worth it. ""You can't have breakfast without toast,"" he says. ""It's more reflective of what people have in their own home."" Mr Burton, who is director of nursing and patient experience at the acute hospital, where there are about 520 beds, knew that good nutrition and appetising food was fundamental to patients' healing and recovery. He also knew it had an impact on general wellbeing. With a high proportion of elderly in-patients, including many with dementia, Duncan and his team started reworking the menu with them in mind. They were helped in their task by dieticians, caterers and patients themselves - but perhaps the most useful input came from hospital volunteers who sit with patients and help feed them. Finger food is an alternative to hot meals for any adult patients who want it They suggested finger food for those who wanted to eat only small amounts and for dementia patients because it was easier for them to eat. So instead of being faced with an off-putting plate of non-descript meat, veg and mash, they are now given small bite-sized items such as small sandwiches, grapes, cucumber sticks and quiche slices. That way, patients can eat a little and often, grazing throughout the day. Rather than being offered an orange or an apple, which can be awkward to get into, they are given apple slices or a soft satsuma. There are also new light meal options including homemade soups, omelettes, sandwiches and salads. And there's a recognition that patients may not want to eat only healthy food. ""You're not going to change people's eating habits when they are not feeling well,"" Mr Burton says. ""If you can get them to eat a piece of cake, then fine... at least it is some nutrition."" And the introduction of freshly baked cakes served to patients in the afternoon has been a triumph, particularly when the aroma reaches patients before the cakes do. As well as finger food, Kingston Hospital has brought in food packs for people who are discharged and live on their own. These packs contain milk, bread, butter and tea-bags - the basics that can help vulnerable and elderly people through the first day or so back at home. Duncan Burton helped to bring in a new-look menu for adults and children In maternity wards, a plate of hot food is on offer 24 hours a day ""because babies arrive at all times of the day and night"". The menu for children was revamped too, with the help of local school children and paediatric patients. Children are now offered a finger box of crackers, cheese, fruit, sandwiches, cucumber sticks and biscuits or a hot meal option from a choice of meatballs, tuna pasta bake, fish fingers and vegetable curry. There are still challenges however - providing more healthy food for more than 3,000 staff and contractors who work at the hospital is next on the list. The menu changes, which were first discussed in 2014, were achieved without any extra funding for food, but the meals are brought in and ""regenerated"" on site rather than being cooked freshly in hospital kitchens. And that's down to space - or the lack of it, Duncan Burton says. ""Some trusts do have that space, but it's not something we can do. ""Instead, catering staff are on site and are able to heat food up and serve it. Some fresh food is still made on site."" Kingston is not the only hospital in that position. In a recent report from the Campaign for Better Hospital Food, which surveyed 30 London hospitals, only 30% cooked all food freshly on site. The campaign group also said half of hospitals surveyed were failing to meet basic food standards set down by the NHS. But in this south-west London hospital, patient feedback shows little criticism of the food any more and there is evidence of a reduction in patients with pressure sores and ulcers - a sign that they are eating better and recovering more quickly.

Tales of deportation in Trump's America,"A rally for two young people detained by immigration officials in Vermont The Trump Administration's immigration enforcement priorities have revived deportation orders ignored during the Obama Administration. On Monday, Mr Trump criticized local law enforcement agencies for refusing to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to detain and deport people living in the US illegally. The administration started publishing a weekly ""Declined Detainer Outcome Report"", which calls out local agencies that ignored orders to detain undocumented immigrants arrested for unrelated crimes. The report names the immigrants in question and lists ""crimes associated with those released individuals."" Despite promising to focus on violent criminals and gang members, President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration and his executive memo to the Department of Homeland Security empowers Ice to deport virtually anyone living in the US without documentation. Only one clear exception exists, for people with active Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) status. Here's a look at some of the most recent immigration cases across the US. Beristain, in blue, has been in the us for 19 years Roberto Beristain, 43 Detained: 6 February, from Granger, Indiana In 1998, Mr Beristain came to the US to visit an aunt and decided to stay. In 2000, he and his wife, a naturalised US citizen originally from Greece, accidentally crossed the Canadian border while sightseeing at Niagara Falls. When they crossed back into the US, border patrol agents detained Mr Beristain. A judge initially issued an order mandating that Mr Beristain voluntarily return to Mexico. When Beristain declined to leave, the order reverted to a final order. Instead Mr Beristain's lawyer convinced Ice agents to grant him leniency due to his family ties in the US and lack of criminal records. The agents helped Mr Beristain obtain a driver's licence, a work permit and a legal Social Security Number, and Mr Beristain went to work in the restaurant business. He is now co-owner of Eddie's Steak Shed in Granger, Indiana. Mr Beristain had to check in with Ice agents every year. This February, agents at the Indianapolis Ice office took him into custody. ""Trump says we're deporting bad hombres. Roberto is the farthest thing from a bad guy,"" said Jason Flora, who served as Mr Beristain's attorney until Saturday. ""You ask 100 people to paint a picture of a bad guy, not one would draw something remotely resembling Roberto."" His wife supported Mr Trump because of his immigration programmes, and thought her husband - a businessman and father - would be spared. ""We don't want to have cartels here, you don't want to have drugs in your high schools, you don't want killers next to you,"" Helen Beristain toldIndiana Public Media,externalearlier this year. ""You want to feel safe when you leave your house. I truly believe that. And this is why I voted for Mr Trump."" Because of the deportation order from 2000, Mr Beristain could be deported as early as Friday without a hearing before an immigration court. Henry Sanchez-Milian, 18 Arrested: 17 March, in Rockville, Maryland Police arrested Henry Sanchez-Milian and another undocumented teenager, Jose O Montano, 17, on charges of sexual assault after they allegedly trapped a fellow Rockville High School student in a school bathroom and raped her. Mr Montano is being charged as an adult. Immigration row over US school rape case Mr Sanchez-Milian has lived in the US for only eight months, after fleeing Guatemala. He had been awaiting a hearing with an immigration judge. Because he is considered a serious flight risk, he will likely remain in jail until a he's brought before a criminal court, said Montgomery County Assistant States Attorney Rebecca MacVittie. When an undocumented individual is convicted of a serious crime, standard procedure is to allow them to serve their prison sentence in the US and then transfer them to Ice custody to initiate the deportation process. It is unclear whether Mr Sanchez-Milian will be deported before a trial. Ice has issued an order for local law enforcement to keep him in custody. The case has been referenced by members of Mr Trump's administration as reason for  Mr Trump's ""crackdown"" on immigration. Gerardo Martinez-Morales, 52 Deported: 17 March, 2017, from Galveston, Texas Earlier this month, Mr Martinez-Morales was pulled over for a broken tail light, at which point officers identified him as an undocumented immigrant. He had lived in the US for nearly 20 years. He married a US citizen and has four American-born children under the age of 12. In 2004, Mr Martinez-Morales returned to Mexico to see family. Upon his return, he was arrested for crossing illegally at the Texas border, which set in motion his deportation order. Mr Martinez-Morales returned to the Houston area, and lived there without incident until this month. The Obama Administration's immigration priorities that allowed people living in the US illegally with no criminal record to stay in the US, even if they had a deportation order that predated 1 January 2014. Under the Trump administration, individual with a deportation order is a priority for removal. ""There has been a total change with this new administration,"" says Raed Gonzalez, Mr Martinze-Morales' attorney. ""This is a sharp shift in policy."" Mr Martinez-Morales was deported one week after his detention. Cesar Carrillo, 23,Enrique Balcazar, 24,Zully Palacios Rodriguez, 23 Detained:15 March and 17 March, in Burlington, Vermont Zully Palacios and Enrique Balcazar Mr Carrillo, Mr Balcazar and Ms Rodriguez are activists who belong to a Vermont-based immigration rights advocacy group called Migrant Justice. Ice agents arrested Mr Carrillo-Sanchez on Wednesday, as he was arriving to a court hearing for a misdemeanour charge at the Chittenden County courthouse. Two days later, Ice officials stopped a car that Mr Balcazar was driving, with Ms Rodriguez in the passenger seat, as they were leaving the Migrant Justice office. Both were detained by immigration officials, according to the organisation. Alex Carrillo (left) with daughter and wife at a rally to free Victor Diazz Members of Migrant Justice said that they view their detention as a sign that immigration officials are targeting activists and community leaders. Migrant Justice members have had run-ins with Ice in the past. Two other members, Victor Diaz and Miguel Alcudia, were detained last year, but were both released and had their deportation proceedings halted after public outcry. Mr Carrillo-Sanchez  and Mr Balcazar both immigrated to the US from Mexico. Ms Rodriguez is from Peru. Aaron Sarmiento-Sanchez, 35 Arrested: 17 March near Sells, Arizona Border Patrol agents from the Casa Grande Station in Arizona arrested Aaron Sarmiento-Sanchez for entering the US illegally. He had previously been deported in April 2013. When officers ran a background check on Mr Sarmiento-Sanchez, they found a 2006 conviction in Salinas, California, for ""lewd or lascivious acts with a child"". Mr Sarmiento-Sanchez was sentenced to six years in prison for that crime. Mr Sarmiento-Sanchez faces federal charges for re-entering the country illegally and will remain in detention until a judge rules on those criminal charges. See last week's report.

Europa: Our best shot at finding alien life?,"Europa holds a vast, salty ocean beneath its fractured ice shell After two decades of development and ""heartbreak"", scientists are on the verge of sending missions to explore the ocean world of Europa. Could this be our best shot at finding life elsewhere in the Solar System? Orbiting the giant planet Jupiter is an icy world, just a little smaller than Earth's moon. From a distance, Europa appears to be etched with a nexus of dark streaks, like the product of a toddler's chaotic scribbling. Close up, these are revealed to be long linear cracks in the ice, many of which are filled with an unknown contaminant that scientists have dubbed the ""brown gunk"". Elsewhere, the surface is tortured and irregular, as if massive slabs of ice have drifted, spun and flipped over in slush. Jupiter's immense gravity helps generate tidal forces that repeatedly stretch and relax the moon. But the stresses that created Europa's smashed up terrain are best explained by the ice shell floating on an ocean of liquid water. ""The fact that there's liquid water underneath the surface which we know from previous missions, in particular from the magnetometer observations made by the Galileo spacecraft as it flew past [in the 1990s], makes it one of the most exciting potential targets to look for life,"" says Prof Andrew Coates ofUCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory,externalin Surrey, UK. Europa's dark, briny deep might extend 80-170km into the moon's interior, meaning it could be holding twice as much liquid water as there is in all of Earth's oceans. And while water is one vital prerequisite for life, Europa's ocean might have others - such as a source of chemical energy for microbes. Artwork: Europa Clipper will make at least 45 flybys of the jovian moon during its primary mission However, the ice shell that surrounds the ocean is thought to be tens of kilometres thick. On the face of it, this might make any notions of exploring Europa's watery depths seem like a far-off fantasy. Luckily, scientists think there are a number of ways for the ocean to communicate with the surface. For example, the physical process of heat transfer known as convection may cause warm blobs of ice located deep within the shell to travel upwards to the surface. So studying the moon's outer face could provide clues to what's going on far beneath it. Now, Nasa is priming two missions to explore this intriguing world. Both have been discussed here at the48th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) in Houston,external. The first is a flyby mission calledEuropa Clipper,externalthat would likely launch in 2022. The second is a lander mission that would follow a few years later. Dr Robert Pappalardo, from Nasa'sJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),external, is Clipper's project scientist. ""We're really trying to get at Europa's potential habitability, the ingredients for life: water, and whether there's chemical energy for life,"" he tells me. ""We do that by trying to understand the ocean and the ice shell, the composition and the geology. And mixed into those is the level of current activity at Europa."" Clipper carries a payload of nine instruments, including a camera that will image most of the surface; spectrometers to understand its composition; ice-penetrating radar to map the ice shell in three dimensions and find water beneath the ice shell; and a magnetometer to characterise the ocean. This video can not be played Prof Andrew Coates explains why Europa is a good place to look for life beyond Earth However, since the Galileo spacecraft provided evidence for an ocean in the 1990s, we've learned that Europa isn't one of a kind. ""One of the most amazing and significant discoveries of the past decade or so in planetary exploration is that you can't swing a dead cat in the outer Solar System without hitting an ocean world,"" says Clipper's programme scientist Curt Niebur, fromNasa headquarters,externalin Washington DC. At Saturn's moon Enceladus, for example, ice from a subsurface ocean gushes into space through fissures at the south pole. The saturnian satellite could also get a dedicated mission in the 2020s, but Dr Niebur believes Europa stands out: ""Europa is much larger than Enceladus and has more of everything: more geological activity, more water, more space for that water, more heat, more raw ingredients and more stability in its environment."" In Europa's rocky interior, heat is probably generated by tidal forces and by the decay of radioactive isotopes. Scientists think the heating may drive volcanic vents on the seafloor - an important point in favour of the moon's habitability, since terrestrial vent systems support a wide array of life forms. But there's something else that marks the moon out: its neighbourhood. Europa's orbital path takes it deep into Jupiter's powerful magnetic field, which traps and speeds up particles. The resulting belts of intense radiation fry spacecraft electronics, limiting the durations of missions to months or even weeks. That said, this radiation also drives reactions on Europa's surface, yielding chemicals called oxidants. On Earth, biology exploits the chemical reactions between oxidants and compounds known as reductants to supply the energy needed for life. Artwork (not to scale): Europa in cross-section, showing processes from the seafloor to the surface (Europa Lander Study 2016 Report) However, the oxidants made on the surface are only useful to Europan microbes if they can get down into the ocean. Fortunately, the process of convection that pushes warm blobs of ice upwards might also drive surface material down. Once in the ocean, oxidants could react with reductants made by seawater interacting with the rocky ocean floor. ""You need both poles of the battery,"" explains Robert Pappalardo. For scientists like Bob Pappalardo and Curt Niebur, the impending missions are the realisation of a two-decades-long dream. Since the first Europa mission concepts were drawn up in the late 1990s,one,externalpromising,externalproposal,externalafter another has been thwarted. During the noughties, the US and Europe even pooled resources on a mission that would have sent separate spacecraft to Europa and Jupiter's larger ice moon Ganymede. But the plan was cancelled amid budget cuts, with the European partevolving into the Juice mission.,external ""I don't think there's been a Europa mission over the past 18 years that I have not either had my fingers in or has not passed under my eye,"" says Curt Niebur. ""It's been a long road. The road to launch is always a rocky one, and it's always full of heartbreak. We've experienced that more than most on Europa."" Exploring Europa is costly - though no more so than other Nasa ""flagship"" missions such as Cassini or the Curiosity rover. Four views of Europa's surface from the Galileo mission, clockwise from top left: (1) disrupted ice crust in the Conamara region; (2) crustal plates, which are thought to have broken apart and ""rafted"" into new positions; (3) reddish bands; (4) an impact structure about the size of Hawaii There are inherent engineering challenges, such as operating within Jupiter's radiation belts. Spacecraft instruments need to be shielded with materials such as titanium metal but, says Dr Pappalardo, ""you can only shield them so much because they have to be able to see Europa"". So to keep Clipper safe, Nasa is going to stray from the rulebook somewhat. ""The assumption always was: Galileo flew past Europa, so the next mission has to be an orbiter. That's just how we do business,"" says Dr Niebur. But rather than orbit Europa, Clipper will instead reduce its exposure to mission-shortening radiation by orbiting Jupiter, and make at least 45 close flybys of the icy moon over three-and-a-half years. ""We realised we could avoid those technical challenges of orbiting Europa, make the mission much more achievable and still get the science we want if we fly past it a lot,"" says Clipper's programme scientist. The strength of sunlight near Europa is about a 30th of what it is at Earth. But Nasa decided it could power Clipper with solar panels rather than the radioactive generators some other outer planet missions have used. ""All those years of study forced us to burn away our pre-conceptions and get us to really focus on reality, not on our wish-list... to focus on the best science,"" says Curt Niebur. In 2011,a National Research Council report,externalre-stated the importance of exploring the icy moon. Even so, Nasa remained wary because of the cost. Artwork: Nasa's Europa lander could determine whether there was or is life on the jovian moon But the support on Capitol Hill has been pivotal. A Europa venture has bipartisan backing, and in Republican CongressmanJohn Culberson,external- the chair of the particular House Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over Nasa's budget - the mission has had a unique champion. The 60-year-old Texan lawmaker has been entranced by Europa ever since observing it through the Celestron 8 telescope he bought himself as a high school graduation present. Over the last four years, the subcommittee he chairshas channelled money to scientists working on Europa,external, even when the space agency's chief wasn't asking for it. Generous investment means that much more of the technical work has been completed on Clipper than is normal for a mission at its stage (phase B) in the Nasa project cycle. The lander is at an earlier stage of development, called pre-phase A, buta report on the mission's science value,externalwas discussedat a workshop,externalhere at the LPSC. The lander has received no funding in the President's 2018 budget request for Nasa. ButDr Jim Green,external, director of planetary science at the agency, tells me: ""That mission in particular is tremendously exciting, because it tells us the science we have to do from the surface of a moon that's really hard to get to. ""We still have quite the process to go through, do the due diligence, understanding the kind of measurements we need to make. Then we'll work with the administration in the future at the right time to see if, budgetarily, we can move forward with it."" This video can not be played Dr Geraint Jones explains how to punch through the hard icy surface of Europa Some innovative Europa lander concepts have been proposed over the last two decades, reflecting the scientific bounty to be had by touching down. Dr Geraint Jones of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory has worked on one concept called a penetrator. ""They haven't been flown in space before, but it's a really promising technology,"" he explains. A projectile deployed from a satellite hits the surface ""really hard, at about 300m/second, about 700 miles an hour"", exposing pristine ice for analysis by onboard instruments, which could be designed to withstand the impact. By contrast, Nasa's forthcoming lander would put down softly with the help of the Sky Crane technology used to drop the Curiosity rover safely on Mars in 2012. During the touchdown, it will use an autonomous landing system to detect and avoid surface hazards in real time. Clipper will provide the reconnaissance for a landing site. ""I like to think of it as finding that right oasis, where there might be water close to the surface. Maybe it's warm and maybe it has organic materials,"" says Bob Pappalardo. The landing craft would be equipped with a sensitive instrument payload and a counter-rotating saw to help get at fresher samples below the radiation-processed surface ice. ""The lander is all about hitting the freshest, most pristine sample possible. One way to do that is to dig deep, another way is going to where there is some kind of eruption on the surface - like a plume - that's dropping very fresh material onto the surface,"" says Curt Niebur. Artwork: The Hubble telescope has seen possible evidence of geysers on Europa Life teems around hydrothermal vents on Earth; but what's going on in the depths of Europa's ocean? In recent years, the Hubble telescope hasmade tentative observationsofplumes of water-iceerupting from beneath Europa, much as they do on Enceladus. But there's no point in the lander going to the site of a decades-old eruption; it would need to visit the location of a much more recent plume. So scientists need to understand what's controlling these geysers: for example, Clipper will determine whether the plumes are correlated with any hot spots on the surface. The lander's arm could even reach out to sample the mysterious ""brown gunk"" which might, according to one idea, represent radiation-baked sea salt. Earth's seas are teeming with life, so it can be hard for us to contemplate the prospect of a sterile, 100km-plus deep ocean on Europa. But the scientific threshold for detecting life is set very high. So will we be able to recognise alien life if it's there? ""The goal of the lander mission is not simply to detect life [to our satisfaction], but to convince everyone else that we have done so,"" Dr Niebur explains. ""It does no good for us to invest in this mission if all we create is scientific controversy."" Thus, the lander's science definition team came up with two ways to address this. First, any detection of life has to be based on multiple, independent lines of evidence from direct measurements. ""There's no silver bullet; you don't do one measurement and say: 'aha, eureka we've found it'. You look at the sum total,"" says Dr Niebur. Second, the scientists have come up with a framework to interpret those results, some of which might be positive, while others negative: ""It creates a decision tree that marches through all the different variables. Following all these different paths, the end result is: yes, we've found life, or no we haven't,"" he says. At the lander workshop here at the LPSC, Nasa's Kevin Hand described the process as ""biosignature bingo"". Now, the team will have to see if the scientific community is persuaded. Curt Niebur explains: ""I want to have that discussion now, today, years before we launch so that we can all be focused on analysing the data once we land."" Follow Paulon Twitter.,external .
