Russian 'cloud' over White House,"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin Throughout the confusion of Donald Trump's campaign and the chaotic events of his early days in the White House, one controversy has clung to the Trump team like glue: Russia. US intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. It is alleged that Russian hackers stole information linked to the campaign of his rival Hillary Clinton and passed it to Wikileaks so it could be released to undermine her. Congressional committees were set up to investigate the matter and, in March, then-FBI director James Comey confirmed the bureau had its own inquiry. President Trump sacked Mr Comey on 9 May, citing his reason as ""this Russia thing"", in a move that shocked Washington andfuelled claims of a cover-up. However, it did not halt the investigation. On 18 May, the department of justice appointed ex-FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to look into the matter. Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn resigned in February after failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington. In December, he pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his meetings with Mr Kislyak. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling the allegations a ""witch hunt"". It was back in May 2016 that the first reports emerged of hackers targeting the Democratic Party. Over the next two months, the reports suggested US intelligence agencies had traced the breaches back to Russian hackers. In July, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Wikileaks published 20,000 internal emails stolen by the hackers. US intelligence officials said they believed with ""high confidence"" that Russia was behind the operation, but the Trump campaign publicly refused to accept the findings. Instead, at a press conference, Mr Trump caused outrage by inviting Russian hackers to target Hillary Clinton's controversial personal email server, saying: ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"". About the same time the hacking scandal was beginning to unfold, Mr Trump's then campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was accused of accepting millions of dollars in cash for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and US, including dealings with an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives. Subsequently, further allegations were made in Ukraine about secret funds said to have been paid to Mr Manafort, and it has also been claimed that he secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to assist President Putin's political ends. Mr Manafort has denied both allegations. He was found guilty in August 2018 of eight counts of financial fraud and tax evasion crimes. In September 2018, he pleaded guilty to two remaining charges - and agreed to co-operate with the special counsel's investigation in exchange for a reduced jail sentence. This video can not be played Trump praises Putin's leadership In October, the US intelligence community released a unanimous statement formally accusing Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Mr Trump continued to argue against the finding, claiming in a presidential debate that it ""could be Russia, but it could also be China, it could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds"". The same day that the intelligence agencies released their findings, the explosive ""Access Hollywood"" recording emerged of Mr Trump's obscene remarks about women in 2005. An hour later, Wikileaks began dumping thousands more leaked Clinton emails. Mr Trump continued to refuse to acknowledge the consensus that Russia was behind the hack. In December, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security published a report of the US intelligence findings linking Russia to the hack. In response, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and levied new sanctions on Russia. The world awaited Mr Putin's response but he chose not retaliate. Mr Trump, by then the president-elect, sided with the Russian president, tweeting: ""Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"" Mr Putin's decision not to respond in kind struck many as a canny PR move, but reportedly set off suspicions among US intelligence officials that Russia was confident the sanctions would not last. The same month, Mr Trump picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state, arguably the most important job in the cabinet. The biggest hurdle for Mr Tillerson's confirmation? Close ties to Mr Putin. As CEO of the ExxonMobil oil company, Mr Tillerson cultivated a close personal relationship with the Russian leader, leading many to speculate on whether he was fit to serve as America's most senior diplomat. Mr Tillerson wassworn in as secretary of state on 2 February. In January, Buzzfeed published a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, which alleged that Moscow had compromising material on the then-president-elect, making him liable to blackmail. Among the various memos in the dossier was an allegation that Mr Trump had been recorded by Russian security services consorting with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel. Mr Trump dismissed the claims as fake news. CNN revealed that President Obama and President-elect Trump had been briefed on the existence of the dossier by intelligence officials, and Buzzfeed went one further, publishing the entire thing. In February, the most concrete and damaging Russia scandal finally surfaced, months after suspicions were raised among intelligence officials. Michael Flynn quit as national security adviser after 23 days US media reported that Mr Flynn had discussed the potential lifting of Mr Obama's Russia sanctions with the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, before Mr Trump took the reins of government. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy. He resigned as Mr Trump's national security adviser after 23 days on the job, saying he had ""inadvertently briefed the vice-president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador"" late last year. Since leaving the White House, the Pentagon has launched an investigation into whether he failed to disclose payments from Russian and Turkish lobbyists that he was given for speeches and consulting work. Who is Michael Flynn? Attorney General Jeff Sessions was being accused of lying at his confirmation hearing when he said he had had ""no communications with the Russians"" during the election campaign. It later emerged that he too had met Mr Kislyak - at a private meeting in September and as part of a group of ambassadors in July last year. The Alabama senator was one of the most prominent players in Mr Trump's bid to take the White House. But he says his meetings with Mr Kislyak were related to his role as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and had nothing to do with the election campaign. But Mr Sessions recused himself from the FBI investigation into the Russian hacking claims, an investigation he is overseeing. Two months into the Trump presidency, Mr Comey confirmed at a rare open hearing of the House Intelligence Committee that the agency was investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. It is an ""ongoing"" investigation that began in July 2016, he said. Mr Trump's controversial meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Mr Kislyak But on 9 May, Mr Comey was fired. The White House initially said it was over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails. But Mr Trump later said ""this Russia thing"" was a factor. On 10 May, Mr Trump met the Russian ambassador and foreign minister in the Oval Office. He told them firing Mr Comey had eased ""great pressure"",the New York Times reported,external. He also reportedlyshared with them highly-sensitive ""codeword"" materialrelating to terrorism and airline safety, sending more shockwaves through Washington. Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel a week later. In his much anticipated testimony before a Senate panel, Mr Comey said that Mr Trump had asked him to pledge his loyalty, confirming previous media reports about a January meeting between the pair. ""I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,"" Mr Trump said, according to Mr Comey's testimony. James Comey was ""terminated and removed from office"" by President Trump Mr Comey said: ""I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence."" Mr Comey also said Mr Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into Mr Flynn. ""[Trump] said: 'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' I replied only that 'he is a good guy.'"" But Mr Comey did confirm the president's account that he had told Mr Trump the FBI was not investigating him personally. He said he had kept written memos on his meetings and phone calls with the president, fearing Mr Trump might lie. He denied asking for Mr Comey's loyalty, although he added: ""I don't think it would be a bad question to ask."" The White House also denied that Mr Trump had asked for the Flynn inquiry to be dropped. Mr Trump has alsoquestioned the neutrality of Robert Mueller, saying the special counsel's friendship with Mr Comey is ""bothersome"". He has criticised the FBI on numerous occasions and, in one tweet, said the organisation's reputation was ""in tatters"". On9 July came newsof what was thought to be the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and members of President Trump's inner circle. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr, admitted meeting Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on 9 June 2016 at Trump Tower after being told that she had damaging material on Hillary Clinton. But he insisted the lawyer had provided ""no meaningful information"" in a meeting that also included the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Mr Manafort. Mr Trump Jr told the House Intelligence committee he discussed the Trump Tower meeting with his father once it became public in a New York Times report earlier this year, but he refused to provide details of their conversation, citing attorney-client privilege. September saw Facebook reveal it had discovered that politically charged advertising had been targeted at American voters during the 2016 campaign. The social network said it believed this had been paid for by Russians with links to the Kremlin. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said his company would share 3,000 Russia-linked political adverts with US investigators. The adverts did not support a specific candidate, Facebook said, but instead posted inflammatory information on hot topics such as immigration. Rival network Twitter said it had shut down about 200 accounts linked to a Russian misinformation campaign. President Trump responded to Facebook's revelations by saying the site had always been against him. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rejected his comments, saying his company did not take sides. In October 2017, Mr Manafort,who quit as Mr Trump's campaign chairman last August, was charged with conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine. The good news for Mr Trump was that these charges - of which he was later convicted - were not directly linked to the Russia investigation. But the bad news is that Mr Manafort later agreed to co-operate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. Paul Manafort ended up falling prey to the controversy his appointment was intended to stifle Another of his advisers, George Papadopoulos, admitted making false statements to FBI agents about his dealings with an unnamed overseas academic who allegedly informed him that the Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. The charges against Mr Papadopoulos were the first to be brought by Robert Mueller as part of the Russia investigation. Paul Manafort: The man who helped Trump win In December, Michael Flynn admitted making false statements to the FBI about meetings with the Russian ambassador, making him the most senior member of the administration to be indicted. He also revealed he was co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. A statement made by Mr Flynn to prosecutors appeared to implicate a more senior, though unnamed, Trump team official - indicating the direction in which Mr Mueller's investigation may be heading. Numerous US media outlets said the senior official now under the spotlight is Jared Kushner - Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law. Soon after Mr Flynn was charged, the president appeared to suggest that he had known Mr Flynn had lied about meetings with the Russian ambassador, contradicting his own account from the time - and prompting accusations that he obstructed justice. A White House lawyer later said he had written the tweet and that the controversial line had actually been an error.

Russia-Trump probe: Who's who?,"It was more gripping than any box set we could get our hands on. Over two years, the investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, delivered daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. In the end, 35 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered. This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?! It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season. Who was he?Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher,here's his life story. Key plot lineAs Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said. The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know? Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called ""a complete and total exoneration"". But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension. Who was he?He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine. Key plot lineHe was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker. Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while. He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later). After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison. In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Read more:The man who helped Trump win Who was he?The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians. Key plot lineDonald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is. The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton. This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting? What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought. Read more:Trump Jr's habit for making headlines DonaldTrumpconfounded his critics by winningthe presidency.But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix. The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come. Who was he?The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI. Key plot lineFlynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only ""simple things""). The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. At the end of Season Three, in December 2017,Flynn pleaded guiltyto making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed. With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle. Read more:Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn? Who was he?Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 wasthe Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot lineKislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots. The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place. Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a ""top spy and recruiter of spies"". Who was he?Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years. Key plot lineSessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings. When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation. That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign. That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist. Read more:An attorney general dogged by scandal This was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling. Who was she?A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an ""informant"" for Russia's prosecutor general. Key plot lineHers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign. While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges. That meeting would never have happened without... Who were they?Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough tosend each other birthday messages,external. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow. Key plot lineAgain in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting. An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the ""crown prosecutor"" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton. Are you keeping up? Read more:The tough-talking networker Who was he?He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot lineWhen Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House. Read more:Who is Rod Rosenstein? Who was he?Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard. Key plot lineAmid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him. In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave. Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose. Read more:The son-in-law with Trump's ear Who was he?A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric. Key plot lineRob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov. Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Read more:The Music Man with a love for hats Who was he?At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story. Key plot lineHe first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him. Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point. Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused. Read more:The FBI director who took centre stage Who was he?A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation. Key plot lineIn late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so. Read more:Why Papadopoulos case matters Who was he?The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands. Key plot lineSome characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as ""special counsel"" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI. There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office. There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series. After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four.The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...? Who was he?OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. Key plot lineA little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US. In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume. Read more:Seven key takeaways from indictment Who was he?The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him. Key plot lineCohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth. When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York. Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence. Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress. The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell. Who was he?A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: ""One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action."" Key plot lineStone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back. Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public. After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia. All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a ""witch-hunt"" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were ""a steaming plate of bull"".

How does inquiry affect Trump?,"On Monday morning Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates were charged with 12 counts of money laundering, undisclosed foreign lobbying, lying to government investigators, and various and sundry other serious-sounding offences. It turned out that wasn't the biggest news of the day. Indictments had been telegraphed since news reports on Friday evening mentioned they were signed, sealed and soon-to-be-delivered. Manafort's name was at the top of most lists of possible targets. It was the follow-up revelation from Robert Mueller's independent counsel team, however, that caught most of Washington by surprise. George Papadopoulos - hardly a household name - had pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators about his contacts with Russian nationals and connected individuals while he was serving as a foreign policy with the Trump campaign. Where the Manafort indictment was somewhat expected and covered business dealings prior to his time as head of the Trump campaign, the Papadopoulos news sits at the heart of Mr Mueller's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia. Here are three reasons why Papadopoulos is a key piece of the puzzle. And lest we give the Manafort case short shrift, here are three more reasons why it could end up being even more explosive. Per details of the indictment and plea agreement, Papadopoulos has revealed that he was in contact with individuals - a London professor, a female Russian national, a Russian foreign affairs ministry official - either directly or tangentially connected to the Russian government. He was passing along details of conversations he had to senior members of the Trump presidential campaign team including, reportedly, Manafort. At one point, a ""campaign supervisor"", responding to one of  Papadopoulos's emails, replied ""good work"". This video can not be played White House: ""Today's announcement has nothing to do with the president"" While not evidence of collusion, this is clear indication that the Russian government was seeking back channels to the Trump campaign - and were finding at least some success. The White House has diminished Papadopoulos's role within the campaign, noting he was an unpaid adviser and that his efforts to set up a senior-level meeting between the Trump team and Russian officials were rebuffed. Papadopoulos did have a sit-down conference on 31 March 2016, with Mr Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team. Candidate Trump also mentioned Papadopoulos, whom he called an ""excellent guy"", as an adviser in a21 March interview,externalwith the Washington Post. Papadopoulos may have been on the campaign periphery, but he was far from a total unknown. On April 26, 2016, Papadopoulos's professor contact told him he had just returned from Moscow and learned from ""high-level Russian government officials"" that they possessed ""dirt"" on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"". It's unclear from the indictment whether Papadopoulos passed this bit of information on to his campaign contacts, although it notes he ""continued to correspond"" with them. What is clear, however, is that there is now evidence that individuals with Russian government connections on two separate occasions tried to let the Trump campaign know that they had information they thought was damaging to the Democratic candidate. Papadopoulos was the first. The second was when the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, heard a similar line from his publicist-friend Rob Goldstone in June 2016. Trump Jr responded by writing ""if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer"". Later that month, Trump Jr, Manafort and Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met a group of Russian nationals. In July, embarrassing emails that were hacked from the Democratic National Committee were published by Wikileaks. In October, the contents of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's personal email inbox were released. It makes for an interesting timeline. If there's anyone in Trump's campaign circle with something to hide, they should be concerned that Papadopoulos was arrested back on 27 July. He struck a plea agreement with the Mueller team on 5 October. That was nearly four weeks ago and, according to the court documents, Papadopoulos has been co-operating with government investigators ever since. In fact, Mr Mueller told the relevant court he did not want the arrest made public because it would ""significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive co-operator"". So who has Papadopoulos spoken to since his arrest? And what sorts of topics could he have discussed? According to Dan Dale of the Toronto Star,external, a former prosecutor told him the term ""proactive co-operator"" can indicate someone who is willing to wear a wire tap. HotAir Blog goes through,externalan extended what-if scenario that envisions how Papadopoulos could go about surreptitiously gathering incriminating details from members of Trump's campaign inner circle. He could ask for their ""advice"" on how to disrupt Mr Mueller's investigation after disclosing that he had been arrested. ""Suddenly those people woke up this morning and realised they'd had conversations with Papadopoulos recently about how to throw Mueller off the trail and only now do they realise he's been in cahoots with Mueller for three months,"" the theory goes. ""Hoo boy."" Hoo boy, indeed. Donald Trump gives a thumbs up as his campaign manager Paul Manafort and daughter Ivanka look on during Trump's walk through at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland Even if, as Mr Trump writes ina tweet,external, Manafort's alleged illegal activities occurred ""years ago"", before he took a senior position in the Trump campaign, it still reflects poorly on the then-candidate's personnel choices. It was clear at the time Manafort came on board with Mr Trump that he had some questionable dealings in his past - including work for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians, Philippine ex-leader Ferdinand Marcos and a group with ties to Pakistani intelligence. Like many politicos in Mr Trump's orbit, Manafort was thrust into the campaign spotlight with little background vetting because more established hands wanted nothing to do with the upstart candidate's presidential efforts. The decision to run with Manafort, who was backed by Trump confidante Roger Stone, has come back to haunt his presidency. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair What is 'conspiracy against the United States'? Part of the case against Manafort - that he was operating as an undisclosed agent for a foreign government - echoes similar allegations made against another Trump associate, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Flynn resigned his White House post after revelations that he had lied about discussing US sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016. It was later disclosed that Flynn was also working for the Turkish government - something he didn't disclose on his relevant government forms. If Manafort can face charges for his Ukrainian involvement, Flynn may be in jeopardy as well. This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe Slate's Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Sternalso theorise,externalthat Mr Mueller's case against Manafort for financial misdeeds relating to foreign income could serve as a blueprint for a future case against Mr Trump's own business organisation, which also brings in a fair amount of revenue from foreign sources. ""This is an indictment that should terrify Trump in that it shadows and hints at his own unlawful conduct,"" they write. Mr Trump wasn't named in the Manafort indictment, but the message may have been sent nevertheless. Then there's the million-dollar question. If Manafort and Gates are each staring at double-digit prison terms if convicted, might they follow Papadopoulos's lead and seek to strike a deal with Mr Mueller in exchange for leniency? Papadopoulos, of course, is a figure from the edges of the Trump campaign. Manafort, for months, was at the heart of it. Mr Mueller and his veteran team of prosecutors know how to build a case against a large enterprise. Start with the easy targets, then offer a deal. Work your way up from the bottom. Reward those who co-operate early, and throw the book at the hold-outs. Turn the screws, and have your targets constantly looking over their shoulders. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? Manafort and Gates may have nothing to bargain with - the White House insists that there is nothing there.

Iran prisoner husband 'to speak to Johnson',"This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe, whose wife is in jail in Iran, wants to go there with Boris Johnson The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman being held in Iran, will speak to Boris Johnson tomorrow, he has told the BBC. He also wants to meet the foreign secretary in the coming days, he said. The BBC understands the Foreign Office agreed Mr Ratcliffe would meet Mr Johnson the week after next at a meeting with families involved in dual nationality cases. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was in Iran visiting family, is accused of spying. It is also understood the Foreign Office is reviewing Mr Radcliffe's latest request, made this morning on BBC Breakfast, to meet next week. He has also asked to join Mr Johnson on his next visit to Iran, which he says will hopefully be in the coming weeks.

Lebanon demands answers from Saudis,"President Michel Aoun (L) has expressed concern over the well-being of Saad al-Hariri (R) The Lebanese president has asked Saudi Arabia to clarify the situation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who announced his resignation in Riyadh. Michel Aoun has not accepted the shock resignation of a week ago, suggesting words attributed to Mr Hariri should be treated with caution. Iran and its Lebanese ally, the militant group Hezbollah, accuse Saudi Arabia of holding Mr Hariri hostage. The US has warned other countries not to use Lebanon for proxy conflicts. There is growing concern that Lebanon is becoming drawn into spiralling sectarian tensions between the region's biggest Shia Muslim power, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, which is mainly Sunni Muslim. Mr Hariri, a Sunni leader and businessman, was nominated to form Lebanon's government by Mr Aoun in November 2016. The announcement of his resignation on 4 November sent shockwaves through the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia: Who's siding with whom Lebanon caught in crosshairs of Saudi-Iran tension Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles ""The obscurity surrounding the condition of Prime Minister Saad Hariri since his resignation a week ago means that all positions and actions declared by him or attributed to him do not reflect the truth,"" President Aoun said. An unnamed senior Lebanese official, quoted by Reuters news agency, said President Aoun had told a group of foreign ambassadors on Friday that Mr Hariri had been ""kidnapped"" and should have immunity. However, the remarks have not been officially confirmed. French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian said on Friday that ""we think he's free to move and he has to make his own choices"". In his televised remarks from Riyadh a week ago, Mr Hariri said that he was stepping down because of an unspecified threat to his life. He accused Iran and Hezbollah, a Shia group, of taking over Lebanon and destabilising the wider region. He has not spoken publicly since then. ""We are all Saad,"" posters of the missing prime minister have appeared across Beirut On Friday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he had received assurances that Mr Hariri was free and he encouraged him to return to Lebanon. He expressed concern about how the crisis might affect the stability of Lebanon's fragile coalition, and warned countries in the region against using Lebanon as a ""venue for proxy conflicts"". Meanwhile, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah accused Saudi Arabia of declaring war on Lebanon. The international community has also weighed in on Mr Hariri's absence, with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warning that a new conflict in the region would have ""devastating consequences"". On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron paid an unscheduled visit to Saudi Arabia, to emphasise to Saudi leaders the importance of stability in Lebanon. He spoke to Mr Aoun by phone on Saturday. Mr Hariri (R) was seen meeting the Saudi king on Monday France has historical ties with Lebanon, as the former mandate power before independence. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies ordered their citizensin Lebanon on Thursday to leave the country immediately. Riyadh accused Iran of ""direct military aggression"", saying it had supplied a missile which it says was fired by Hezbollah at Riyadh from Yemen the same day as Mr Hariri's resignation.

Sky-watchers await Venus and Jupiter display,"Jupiter and Venus were photographed here above Brighton Pier Jupiter and Venus - the two brightest planets - have appeared together in the morning sky. The planetary conjunction was visible to the naked eye across much of the UK, with the time before dawn being the best to catch the spectacle. Experts said the planets were so close as to appear almost on top of each other. One astronomer said it would probably be ""decades rather than years"" before they appeared as close together. Watch: The dog that orbited the earth The astronaut who was told she would never go to space While the planets have been visible to the unaided eye, viewers with a telescope have also been able to see Jupiter's four Galilean moons.

Viewed from London, the planets began appearing shortly before 06:00 GMT with the conjunction occurring just after. Those on high ground with a clear view of the eastern horizon had the best chance of witnessing the planetary display. This image of the planetary display was captured by Alexandra Palace in London The planets were spotted here in the Merseyside skyline The conjunction of the planets looks like a bright star In 2004, the planet Venus could be seen crossing the Sun as a small black dot Mark Thompson, an astronomer and former presenter on the BBC show Stargazing Live, said conjunctions occur when planets line up in such a way that they appear from Earth to be next to each other - despite in this case being hundreds of millions of miles apart. Mr Thompson told the BBC the cloudy atmospheres of the two planets made them appear bright to the naked eye. He said the event was not uncommon - Venus and Jupiter appeared together in 2015 and 2016, also on 13 November - but it was much rarer for them to appear so close to each other. ""There have certainly been cases where they've been close in the sky but they've not been this close in recent years, certainly the last couple of planetary conjunctions. ""This is actually quite a good conjunction because they're so close, and over the next few years they'll pass each other and be close but not this closeâ¦ ""One as close as this, you're probably looking decades rather than years."" The conjunction can also be seen in countries in the mid-northern latitudes, including parts of the US. Those who missed the event will be able to see the two planets again on Tuesday morning, but they will not be as close together. According to Nasa, stargazers will be treated to another planetary pairing later this month, when Saturn will meet Mercury on the western horizon at dusk on 24 and 28 November.

'Selfie' Hitler removed from museumPictures shared on social media showed people grinning as they posed with the life-size model.8h8 hours agoAsia,"Pictures like these have provoked outrage across the globe A life-size model of Adolf Hitler used for ""selfies"" by visitors to an Indonesian museum has been removed. Pictures shared on social media show people grinning as they pose with the Nazi leader in front of an image of the gates of Auschwitz concentration camp. It was only when the international community reacted with outrage that the De ARCA Statue Art Museum realised it had caused any offence. The museum, in Jogjakarta, Java, said it had only wanted to educate. ""We don't want to attract outrage,"" the museum's operations manager, Jamie Misbah, told news agency AFP. Seventy years since Auschwitz liberated The Holocaust year by year Why did ordinary people commit atrocities in the Holocaust? Pictures on social media show numerous people posing with the fibreglass statue, including a group of young boys dressed in orange uniforms performing a Nazi salute. It has left many around the world sickened - even if, as the museum originally said, no visitor had actually complained. Rabbi Abraham Cooper, of Jewish human rights organisation The Simon Wiesenthal Center, told news agency AP: ""Everything about it is wrong. It's hard to find words for how contemptible it is. ""The background is disgusting. It mocks the victims who went in and never came out."" An estimated 1.1 million people, mainly European Jews, but also groups including Roma gypsies and Soviet prisoners-of-war, died at Auschwitz during the Holocaust. Some people have blamed a lack of education about the Holocaust on the lack of sensitivity, but Human Rights Watch researcher Andreas Harsono suggested it revealed anti-Jewish feeling in the world's most populous Muslim nation. The display, one of about 80 in the museum, came less than a year after a Nazi-themed cafe was shut down in Bandung, Java.

Ellen Page: Film director 'outed' meThe actress claims Brett Ratner outed her in public before she had fully realised she was gay.,"Ellen Page says Brett Ratner was homophobic and abusive Ellen Page is the latest actress to speak out against director and producer Brett Ratner. She claims he outed her in public before she herself had fully realised she was gay. She says it happened on the set of X Men: The Last Stand when she was 18 years old. The director has yet to respond to Ms Page's accusation. He has recently been accused of harassment, assault and rape - claims he denies. He is suing a former employee who says he forced himself on her. Ellen Page was 18 when she made X Men: The Last Stand Ms Page has written a lengthyFacebook post,external, which contains explicit language, describing what she says happened when the cast and crew met before filming started. She describes how the director pointed at her and told another woman she should sleep with her ""to make her realise she's gay"". The actress explains that she had not come out to herself at the stage: ""I knew I was gay, but did not know, so to speak."" She says she felt ""violated"" and that no-one spoke out to defend her. She describes it as a ""public, aggressive outing"" that left her feeling ashamed. Olivia Munn describes Brett Ratner is the ""bully at school who just won't quit"" Brett Ratner is one of the most successful film-makers in Hollywood and has produced or directed The Revenant, Jersey Boys and the Horrible Bosses movies. Six women including Natasha Henstridge and Olivia Munn have accused him of harassing them. His lawyer Martin Singer said: ""I have represented Mr Ratner for two decades, and no woman has ever made a claim against him for sexual misconduct or sexual harassment. ""No woman has ever requested or received any financial settlement from my client."" Newsbeat has tried to contact Mr Singer, but he has not replied. But Ms Page's account has been supported by one of her X Men co-stars, Anna Paquin. She tweeted:""I was there when that comment was made. I stand with you."",external Ms Page's post tells how she has been working since she was 10. She says she has met ""respectful collaborators"" during her career. But she also talks about abusers who ""want you to feel small, to make you insecure, to make you feel like you are indebted to them, or that your actions are to blame for their unwelcome advances"". She describes another director fondling her leg when she was 16 and telling her to ""make the move"" on him. She adds: ""I was sexually assaulted by a grip months later. I was asked by a director to sleep with a man in his late 20s and to tell them about it. I did not."" She also criticises people in Hollywood who know that people are being harassed and ""choose to look the other way"". Now she says there must be ""a long awaited reckoning"". She explains: ""I want to see these men have to face what they have done. I want them to not have power anymore. ""I want them to sit and think about who they are without their lawyers, their millions, their fancy cars, houses upon houses, their 'playboy' status and swagger."" She calls for other people to speak out, saying: ""You are breaking the silence. You are the revolution.""

Barcelona rally urges prisoners' releaseThree-quarters of a million people protest against Spain's detention of leading separatists.16m17 minutes agoEurope,"This video can not be played Huge pro-independence rally in Barcelona Three-quarters of a million people have rallied in Barcelona to protest against Spain's detention of Catalan independence leaders, police estimate. They shone phone torches in unison at sunset as calls were made to free eight regional ministers and two grassroots campaign leaders being held on remand. Some of the detainees will be included on the list of a Catalan separatist party at next month's snap election. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is to visit the city on Sunday. In another development, Barcelona's mayoress has condemned pro-independence leaders. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Basque leaders worry about Catalan chaos The Catalan parliament declared independence last month following an unrecognised referendum on independence from Spain. Madrid responded by dissolving the parliament and calling a regional election on 21 December. Since the crackdown by Madrid,Catalonia's sacked President Carles Puigdemont has gone into self-imposed exile in Belgium,  and his top allies have been prosecuted. A lawyer whose firm represents two of his imprisoned former ministers told BBC News their situation had been made worse by Mr Puigdemont's decision to flee. James Reynolds, BBC News, Barcelona The pro-independence movement has proven its ability to mobilise large numbers of demonstrators. Many came to this latest protest from small towns and villages in Catalonia - a sign of the movement's reach. Their immediate aim is to call for the release of the eight politicians and two activists remanded in custody on charges of sedition and rebellion. The authorities in Madrid insist that the case is purely a matter for the courts, but the detention of politicians and activists does have a political impact. Imprisonment may have served to increase their popularity. It may galvanise the pro-independence movement as the regional election approaches. The pro-independence camp wants to win a clear parliamentary majority. That would allow their side to have another go at trying to break away from Spain. But the pro-union camp, which represents the other half of Catalan society, will also campaign vigorously. Protesters marched behind a banner declaring ""We are a republic"" and carried placards declaring the 10 detainees political prisoners. This video can not be played Here's what protesters in Catalonia are singing about The sacked former ministers are being investigated for alleged rebellion and sedition, while the two activists were arrested over a mass protest before the referendum. There were performances and speeches to the crowd. Protesters chanted ""Puigdemont for president"" and a cellist played a traditional Christmas carol, The Song of the Birds, which is associated with Catalans driven into political exile. The left-wing ERC party, a key ally of Mr Puigdemont, has announced that some of the prisoners, including party leader Oriol Junqueras, as well as some of the sacked ministers who also went to Belgium, will stand on its electoral list. However, the ERC has rejected a call from Mr Puigdemont to fight the election as part of a single pro-independence bloc with other parties - as they did in 2015. A recent opinion poll in Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia suggests that the ERC will win the biggest share of the vote in December.,external Mr Rajoy was mocked as the Devil on this recent placard in Barcelona The Spanish prime minister is to make his first appearance in Catalonia since implementing direct rule two weeks ago. He is expected to address a meeting of supporters of his centre-right Popular Party, who firmly want Catalonia to remain a part of Spain. Ada Colau, who was elected mayoress in 2015 on an anti-capitalist platform and whose party (a merger of left-wing parties) is standing in the regional parliamentary election for the first time, said leaders of the independence movement had ""tricked the population for their own interests"". Ms Colau, seen here kissing her baby, has kept her distance from both separatists and unionists ""They've provoked tensions and carried out a unilateral independence declaration which the majority do not want,"" she told a meeting of her Catalunya en ComÃº (English: Catalonia in Common) party. Spain could allow referendums, says FM Belting it out for Catalan independence.

Your biggest financial decision - in charts,"Buying a home is the most significant financial decision in most people's lives. For tenants, paying the rent is the biggest monthly outgoing. So it is little wonder that house prices are an obsession for some, and a source of frustration for others. The financial crisis had huge implications for those wanting to buy or sell property. Here is the story of what has happened to the UK housing market in the past 10 years. The price of the average UK home has risen in the past 10 years, as you would expect. Prices of goods and services in general, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation, have increased faster. So, in real terms, the average UK house price has fallen compared with a decade ago. The average UK house price masks a massive regional divide. In London, the average property value has risen by nearly 70% in 10 years, whereas in Northern Ireland it has fallen by more than 40%. The number of sales was 30% higher 10 years ago, so who is no longer buying? Many people already with a home and a mortgage have chosen to stay put, rather than buy somewhere bigger. Recent tax changes have also cut the numbers of buy-to-let investors. Look at the difference in price when moving from a three-bedroom home to a four-bedroom one, and it is no surprise that many families have chosen not to move. Many may have spent their money on an extension instead. A lack of four-bedroom family homes on the market has pushed up prices of this type of property. It means the cost of moving to a bigger house has stymied many people's dreams of moving up the housing ladder - perhaps to give the children their own room. Government schemes, such as Help to Buy, mean first-time buyers are still in the game. Despite this assistance, lenders have been much more demanding of young borrowers. Mortgage providers wanted a much bigger initial deposit when they were left reeling by the financial crisis. Those deposit requirements have eased since, but first-time buyers still need some hefty savings, or help from their parents, to secure a home loan. Wages have risen slowly, if at all, for most people in the last 10 years. This has made it even tougher for potential buyers in their 20s and 30s to save some of their income. The money has been used to pay the bills, not to fund soaring deposit demands. These financial pressures have meant people choosing to rent rather than buy, or to continue as tenants into their 30s and 40s when they might previously have bought a home by then. This has led to some robust debate over the plight of renters in recent years, from lettings agent fees to the length of tenancies. Collectively, London property has the highest value, followed by the South East of England. If you believe that property is always a good investment, then just look at what has happened to the collective value of homes in the North of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland in the past 10 years. Ten years of low interest rates, and rock-bottom home loan rates, have meant that mortgage repayments account for less of a typical homeowner's income than at any time in the past 10 years. The bad news is that it is unlikely to get any cheaper. Policymakers at the Bank of England have put up interest rates, so borrowing on any kind of loan is going to get more expensive. Lucian Cook, director of residential research at estate agents Savills, predicts that deposits are likely to stay relatively high compared to incomes in the coming years. Owners will continue to take fewer steps up the housing ladder compared to the past, he adds. This is a result of the stricter regulation following the financial crisis that, he believes, will remain in place for the foreseeable future. The other major factor, looking ahead, is how rising interest rates will ""be the next restraint on house price growth"", he says, particularly in London. Savills predicts that an average mortgage rate will double to 4% in the next five years.

Woman killed by stolen hit-and-run carTwo stolen Mercedes cars had been spotted by police minutes before the fatal crash.6h6 hours agoSussex,"The driver of a Ford Fiesta died at the scene and her passenger suffered minor injuries A 70-year-old woman has been killed in a hit-and-run crash with a stolen car which had failed to stop for police moments earlier. The woman was driving a Ford Fiesta on the A24 in Horsham, West Sussex. Another 70-year-old woman, who was a passenger, was injured in the crash at the Farthing Hill roundabout, just before 14:30 GMT on Friday. The driver of the Fiesta died at the scene, police said. A black Mercedes AMG was believed to have been taken during a burglary in Goring-by-Sea, and was seen leaving the services on the A24 along with another stolen car - an A Class Mercedes. Both cars failed to stop for police, and at 14:23 the A Class car crashed into a hedge. The driver ran off and was caught by officers shortly after. The other Mercedes carried on, but was not being followed by police when it crashed with the Fiesta about 10 minutes later, a Sussex Police spokesman said. Officers with dogs, and a police helicopter failed to find the missing driver of the Mercedes, who escaped on foot. Emergency services remained at the scene of the crash into the evening Det Insp Will Rolis said: ""Enquiries are ongoing to identify the driver who ran from the scene after crashing in to the Ford Fiesta. We believe he tried to flag down a lift from near the fatal crash scene minutes later."" An 18-year-old man from Feltham in West London has been arrested on suspicion of burglary. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has been informed and any witnesses are asked to come forward.

"LiveRugby Union latest updatesWatch, listen and follow live text as Ireland face South Africa after Wales lose and England and Scotland both win.BBC Sport","Final score: Ireland 38-3 South Africa Irish score four tries to secure record win v SA Final score: Wales 21-29 Australia Wales lose to Wallabies for 13th straight game Final score: England 21-8 Argentina Final score: Scotland 44-38 Samoa Mike Henson, Caroline Chapman and Louise Gwilliam Three out of four ain't badas Meatloaf didn't say.,external England against Argentina was only the only dud on a hugely entertaining day of rugby. And Wales were the only northern hemisphere side to lose, coming a cropper to Australia. But Scotland enjoyed a thrilling win against Samoa - a game which boasted 11 tries in total and Ireland thrashed South Africa in Dublin. 'Highlights' of England v Argentina are up nowon BBC Two and online.But they will be worth it just to see Eddie Jones simmering on the sidelines. See you next week. So all Australians are full of praise for stadium, the atmosphere and the way Wales attacked the game in Cardiff. But the consensus is the southern-hemisphere side got over the line due to their 'winning mentality'. So close, yet again for Wales. FT: Wales 21-29 Australia Australia head coach Michael Cheika speaking on BBC Two: ""It's such a great place to play rugby - the crowd, the stadium and the history. It makes you want to play footie. ""We just hung in there today. Wales played really well and were on the front foot from the first minute. We defended really well under difficult circumstances. ""The guys were up for it, they stopped a lot of short-range efforts from Wales but our winning-mentality helped us hang in there."" Ireland 38-3 South Africa Tony WardFormer Ireland and Lions fly-half on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra An incredible finish to the game. Absolutely magnificent final quarter from Ireland to end the game in style. They were in control throughout and what a start to the autumn series. Ireland 38-3 South Africa Party time in the Aviva. The crowd head off sharpish in the hope of seeing the Republic of Ireland football team do something  similar against Denmark. Wales 21-29 Australia Sam WarburtonWales flanker on BBC Two Tomorrow will be an off day. The coaches will be deep into the laptops. The guys will go home tonight and apart from a medical assessment, they'll have Sunday with their families and then get down to the analysis on Monday. The next serious training day will be Tuesday. You go into the team room and there's a big 60-inch TV with each player and all their statistics from the game. There's no hiding place. Jacob Stockdale (con Carbery) South Africa have been taken to the cleaners. With the clock in the red, it is a superb try to polish up the scoreline with Joey Carbery's kick out wide brilliantly gathered by Darren Sweetnam. Play switches to the opposite wing where Jacob Stockdale motors in for a fine and fully deserved score. Carbery with a superb conversion from way, way out wide. Ireland 31-3 South Africa Johnny Sexton is announced as the man of the match over the Aviva tannoy. He reacts with a raised eyebrow and a sly grin. Ireland 31-3 South Africa This is going to be Ireland's record win over South Africa. And by some margin. The scoreline trumps a 32-15 win back in 2006. Ireland 31-3 South Africa Tony WardFormer Ireland and Lions fly-half on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra They've taken South Africa on in the maul and minced them there for that final try. This is going to be a huge win for Ireland. Wales 21-29 Australia Do Australia like coming to Cardiff? Here's what captainMichael Hooperhas to say: ""I actually do and so does the team,"" he told BBC Two. ""It's a great place to play in front of a noisy crowd. It's never easy to win and play here. The Welsh took it to us but the boys dug deep. ""Obviously they've got new threats we haven't seen before. We're happy we could deal with those threats and get the win."" Rob Herring It's been a long time since I have seen a northern hemisphere pack bully the Boks like this. Ireland pack low and tight as their jumper returns to earth and plough though the South Africa forwards with replacement Rob Herring at the back to dot down the ball. Two more for Joey Carbery. Ireland 24-3 South Africa Five minutes left and Ireland are pushing for more. A kick to the corner and the replacements want a pushover score of their own... Ireland 24-3 South Africa Tony WardFormer Ireland and Lions fly-half on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra There is fabulous camaraderie around the Irish squad led by Bundee Aki. And it's all on the back of hard work and hard graft on the training field. Their defensive positions have been excellent today. Ireland 24-3 South Africa Joe Schmidt throws Darren Sweetnam into the mix in place of full-back Rob Kearney to big cheers from the crowd. And Johnny Sexton gets a similar send-off as Joey Carbery trots on in his place. FT: Wales 21-29 Australia Australia scrum-half and man of the match Will Genia speaking on BBC Two: ""It was a great game to play and we knew they would look to move the ball. What a great atmosphere and good rugby to watch. ""There was a lot more ball movement from Wales today and they created chances in the second half. Without the dropped balls we would have been scrambling. ""For us its about creating that winning mindset. We played well in the first half and were forced to defend hard in the second but it's all about the mindset."" Rhys Ruddock (71 mins) Con: Sexton Game,set, match. Ireland fling the ball wide, Robbie Henshaw punches through a hole and suddenly the Boks defence is in tatters. The tourists manage to haul Andrew Conway just short, but you don't stop a full-bore Rhys Ruddock from that distance. The back row is over as is Johnny Sexton's conversion kick. Ireland 17-3 South Africa Kieran Marmion, John Ryan and James Ryan are on for the Lions trio of Conor Murray, Tadhg Furlong and Iain Henderson. Wales 21-29 Australia Sam WarburtonWales flanker on BBC Two It's a loss, so I'm obviously disappointed but I'm really proud. I thought in the second half Wales played some great rugby. When they go back over the analysis, apart from a freakish try by Kurtley Beale, we had most of the possession and territory. Ireland 17-3 South Africa Tony WardFormer Ireland and Lions fly-half on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra I have been hugely disappointed in South Africa. They've had so much possession but I can't remember anything close to a line break. Ireland are in complete control all the way across the field. Â© 2025 BBC.

Zoo 'outraged' over lynx killing,"This video can not be played The zoo's co-owner Dean Tweedy has been ""broken emotionally and physically"" over the lynx killing A Welsh zoo is ""truly devastated and outraged"" that an escaped wild cat has been killed. Lilleth, the Eurasian lynx,had escaped from Borth Wild Animal Kingdombut Ceredigion council said on Friday that shehad been ""humanely destroyed"". The council said despite ""exhaustive efforts"" to recapture her, it received advice that the risk to public safety had ""increased to severe"". But the zoo owners have condemned the ""hunting and killing"" of Lilleth. Ceredigion councillor Ceredig Davies has called for ""a full investigation"" and for a report to be presented to councillors ""on how this unfortunate animal met its end in this way"". A statement on Borth Wild Animal Kingdom's Facebook page said: ""The decision to kill her was not ours and we in no way agreed to or participated in the shooting of our baby lynx. ""We are truly devastated and outraged that this happened."" Escaped lynx 'humanely destroyed' Lynx 'leapt' over electrified zoo fence Escaped lynx 'playing with us' Escaped lynx 'evades capture' overnight Borth zoo added that ""for the past three weeks we have been tracking and attempting to catch her in a safe way"" and employed 24-hour on-site help from ""expert trackers and animal recovery specialists"". They said they ""spared no expense or effort"" in the search and sighted the lynx underneath a caravan at a nearby caravan park, which is closed for the winter, on Thursday. ""All we had to do was sling a net across the back and we would have had her trapped,"" the statement said. ""Unfortunately, one of the officials insisted that he needed to photograph her and make a positive ID before we were allowed close. ""He slipped and fell going up the bank which startled her causing her to run past him and off across the fields. ""After a fruitless search we were informed that due to her being in a heavily populated area they would be issuing a shoot to kill order and we had run out of time."" They said a marksmen with ""state-of-the-art night scopes and thermal imaging cameras"" was called in ""to hunt her down and shoot her dead"". Lilleth went missing some time in the last three weeks Dean Tweedy, co-owner of the zoo, told BBC Wales he wanted to see Lilleth darted but was told there were ""issues"" with the terrain and licensing of the guns. He said he was ""absolutely responsible"" for the escape and that they had been building new enclosures over the summer having taken over the zoo six months ago, as it was in ""a real state of disrepair"". ""Ironically the next project on the list was building a new lynx enclosure,"" he added. The Farmer's Union of Wales (FUW) said it had raised concerns the escaped lynx was not being taken seriously enough. Glyn Roberts, FUW president, wrote to Dyfed-Powys Police's crime commissioner on 9 November, urging officers to make a statement about the potential danger to livestock, after the ""suspected killing"" of seven sheep by the lynx. ""It is a great concern that proactive action has not been taken by the police and other authorities to warn people or capture the escaped animal,"" he wrote. ""Many of our members feel that the issue is being treated by the authorities with indifference."" Flowers have been left outside the zoo in tribute to Lilleth Ceredigion council said the lynx had strayed over to a populated area of the community and ""it was necessary to act decisively"". It said that, because the lynx had been used to being near people, it ""presented an even greater danger to the general public once it had strayed into a populated area"". ""The safety of the public was paramount,"" the council statement said, adding it could not return the lynx's body to the zoo because a post mortem examination would be carried out. Lilleth was caught on camera near one of the baited traps Staff at the zoo, which has been closed since Lilleth's escape, had been attempting to catch her. She is believed to have escapedafter making a ""giant leap"" over an electrified fence. There had been a number of sightings but she evaded capture and was at one point thought to be hiding in bushes near the zoo.

Briton to face trial in Egypt for pills,"A British woman held in Egypt on drug smuggling charges has been referred to a criminal court for trial. Laura Plummer, 33, was arrested last month accused of entering the country with 300 Tramadol tablets, a painkiller legal in the UK but not in Egypt. She will remain in custody at a police station in the resort of Hurghada. The shop assistant from Hull told the BBC she had ""no idea"" the painkillers she was carrying were banned in the country. But local police said that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Her lawyers had hoped to apply for bail on Saturday, but a custody hearing was cancelled. Laura Plummer said the prescription pills were for her partner Omar Caboo Ms Plummer's mother, Roberta Synclair, had waited at the courthouse in the Red Sea resort hoping to see her daughter granted bail on Saturday. She told the BBC Ms Plummer was in ""very bad spirits"" when she last saw her a few days ago. ""It's absolutely heart-breaking because your daughter's there and you can't bring her home with you,"" Ms Synclair said. It is unclear when the first hearing for the trial will be. Orla Guerin BBC News, Cairo This is a blow for Laura Plummer and her lawyers. Instead of being granted bail - as they had hoped - she has now been referred to a criminal court. Being sent for trial was always a possibility after the shop assistant was charged with the serious offence of drug smuggling. Police investigating the case have stressed that she had a large quantity of the banned drug Tramadol - about 300 tablets. Laura Plummer insists she had no idea that the painkiller is banned here and that she brought it for her Egyptian boyfriend, who has a bad back. Her lawyers say he has medical certificates which could help her case. This could be the beginning of a lengthy legal process. In Egypt, defendants can be kept in custody for up to two years before a trial. For now she remains in an overcrowded cell at a police station in Hurghada. Drug smuggling can carry the death sentence in Egypt. Tramadol is legal in the UK with a prescription but banned in Egypt, where many are addicted to the opiate. In a phone call from her cell, Ms Plummer told the BBC she was given the tablets by a colleague for her Egyptian partner, Omar Caboo, who she says has back problems. She said the colleague put them in a chemist's bag, which she put in her suitcase. ""I didn't even look in the bag,"" she said. ""I can't tell you how stupid I feel."" Ms Plummer is being held in the Red Sea beach resort of Hurghada Ms Plummer told the BBC her cell in a police station was the size of her bedroom in the UK, but she was having to share it with 25 other women. Her shared cell was claustrophobic, she said, and it was sometimes hard to breathe. Although her fellow prisoners were trying to look after her, none of them spoke English. Her family have said Ms Plummer was ""unrecognisable"" after four weeks in custody in Egypt. Ms Plummer's local MP, Karl Turner, says she has never been in trouble at home. ""She's never had so much as a parking ticket in the UK,"" he said. ""This is a woman who's definitely, clearly, done wrong, but she, in my view, absolutely had no knowledge of what she was doing to be illegal, and we need to be mindful of that.""

Gallery,"World War One officially ended at 11:00 French time on 11 November, 1918. Almost a century later, in Australia, Sydney's iconic opera house was lit up with poppies - the symbol adopted by the Poppy Appeal, in aid of those serving in the British armed forces, back after its formation in 1921. Members of the Sri Lankan navy observed a silence in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Here it is known as ""Poppy Day"". By the time the Great War, as it was known then, ended, about 17 million soldiers and civilians had died. Soldiers laid a wreath of poppies in Belgrade, Serbia. Poppies were the first flower to grow on the battlefields after the war. A day has been set aside to remember those killed in wars ever since 1919. In France, one town was not only remembering the end of World War One, but the loss of one of its citizens, Chloe Boissinot, killed in the jihadist attacks on Paris two years ago. The Treaty of Versailles was signed in France in 1919, imposing harsh terms on Germany. Princess Anne travelled to the Ypres Monument at the Menenpoort (Menin Gate) in Belgium. Thousands gathered here in July to mark a century since the Battle of Passchendaele began, which left 320,000 dead or wounded on the Allied side alone. Canada was also due to mark Remembrance Day, but these red ribbons had already been tied to Rose of Sharon trees in honour of the 516 troops who lost their lives in the Korean War. Some 61,000 Canadians lost their lives in World War One.

Woman killed by stolen hit-and-run car,"The driver of a Ford Fiesta died at the scene and her passenger suffered minor injuries A 70-year-old woman has been killed in a hit-and-run crash with a stolen car which had failed to stop for police moments earlier. The woman was driving a Ford Fiesta on the A24 in Horsham, West Sussex. Another 70-year-old woman, who was a passenger, was injured in the crash at the Farthing Hill roundabout, just before 14:30 GMT on Friday. The driver of the Fiesta died at the scene, police said. A black Mercedes AMG was believed to have been taken during a burglary in Goring-by-Sea, and was seen leaving the services on the A24 along with another stolen car - an A Class Mercedes. Both cars failed to stop for police, and at 14:23 the A Class car crashed into a hedge. The driver ran off and was caught by officers shortly after. The other Mercedes carried on, but was not being followed by police when it crashed with the Fiesta about 10 minutes later, a Sussex Police spokesman said. Officers with dogs, and a police helicopter failed to find the missing driver of the Mercedes, who escaped on foot. Emergency services remained at the scene of the crash into the evening Det Insp Will Rolis said: ""Enquiries are ongoing to identify the driver who ran from the scene after crashing in to the Ford Fiesta. We believe he tried to flag down a lift from near the fatal crash scene minutes later."" An 18-year-old man from Feltham in West London has been arrested on suspicion of burglary.

Texas gunman's wife describes death threatTessa Brennaman says Devin Kelley abused her and threatened to kill her over a speeding ticket.12h12 hours agoUS & Canada,"Tessa Brennaman was Devin Kelley's first wife The ex-wife of Texas church gunman Devin Kelley has said he subjected her to abuse and violence, and threatened to kill her and her entire family. Kelley ""had a lot of demons or hatred inside of him"", said Tessa Brennaman, 25, in an interview with CBS News. The former US Air Force airman pleaded guilty in 2013 to hitting, choking and kicking Ms Brennaman, and to fracturing the skull of her young son. He was sentenced to a year in military prison and demoted over the incident. In her first interview since Kelley shot and killed 26 people at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas on 5 November, Ms Brennaman described how he once threatened to kill her for getting a speeding ticket. ""He had a gun in his holster right here and he took that gun out and he put it to my temple and he told me, 'Do you want to die? Do you want to die?'"" she said. The loopholes that let domestic abusers keep their guns Is domestic violence a common theme in mass shootings? FBI seeks to unlock Texas shooter's iPhone Kelley also wounded 20 people in the shooting. Outside the church, he dropped the military-style AR-15 rifle he used in the massacre and drove away from the scene in his truck, pursued by two locals, before shooting himself dead with a handgun. Kelley had been banned from buying or owning a gun after his domestic violence conviction but his conviction ""was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database"", the Air Force revealed in the wake of the shooting. Devin Kelley killed 26 people at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs People with domestic violence convictions are barred from owning firearms, but laws, which vary from state to state, arebeset by loopholes and lack of enforcement. Gun safety campaign group Every Town For Gun Safety found that in 54% of the 156 mass shootings between 2009 and 2016, the victims were current or former intimate partners or other family members. More than 50 women in the US every month are killed by former partners, according to data compiled by Everytown, and the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it five times more likely that a woman will be killed. A series of legal troubles began in 2012 when he was court-martialled and sentenced to a year in military prison for assaulting his wife and child In the same year Tessa Kelley filed court papers to divorce Kelley, with her wish being speedily granted. There were no children listed in the proceedings After his jail term ended in 2014, Kelley was demoted in rank and released from the military with a bad conduct discharge In August 2014 he again appeared in court - this time charged with mistreating, neglecting or being cruel to animals.

Briton's Egypt court hearing postponed,"A British woman held in Egypt on drug smuggling charges has been referred to a criminal court for trial. Laura Plummer, 33, was arrested last month accused of entering the country with 300 Tramadol tablets, a painkiller legal in the UK but not in Egypt. She will remain in custody at a police station in the resort of Hurghada. The shop assistant from Hull told the BBC she had ""no idea"" the painkillers she was carrying were banned in the country. But local police said that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Her lawyers had hoped to apply for bail on Saturday, but a custody hearing was cancelled. Laura Plummer said the prescription pills were for her partner Omar Caboo Ms Plummer's mother, Roberta Synclair, had waited at the courthouse in the Red Sea resort hoping to see her daughter granted bail on Saturday. She told the BBC Ms Plummer was in ""very bad spirits"" when she last saw her a few days ago. ""It's absolutely heart-breaking because your daughter's there and you can't bring her home with you,"" Ms Synclair said. It is unclear when the first hearing for the trial will be. Orla Guerin BBC News, Cairo This is a blow for Laura Plummer and her lawyers. Instead of being granted bail - as they had hoped - she has now been referred to a criminal court. Being sent for trial was always a possibility after the shop assistant was charged with the serious offence of drug smuggling. Police investigating the case have stressed that she had a large quantity of the banned drug Tramadol - about 300 tablets. Laura Plummer insists she had no idea that the painkiller is banned here and that she brought it for her Egyptian boyfriend, who has a bad back. Her lawyers say he has medical certificates which could help her case. This could be the beginning of a lengthy legal process. In Egypt, defendants can be kept in custody for up to two years before a trial. For now she remains in an overcrowded cell at a police station in Hurghada. Drug smuggling can carry the death sentence in Egypt. Tramadol is legal in the UK with a prescription but banned in Egypt, where many are addicted to the opiate. In a phone call from her cell, Ms Plummer told the BBC she was given the tablets by a colleague for her Egyptian partner, Omar Caboo, who she says has back problems. She said the colleague put them in a chemist's bag, which she put in her suitcase. ""I didn't even look in the bag,"" she said. ""I can't tell you how stupid I feel."" Ms Plummer is being held in the Red Sea beach resort of Hurghada Ms Plummer told the BBC her cell in a police station was the size of her bedroom in the UK, but she was having to share it with 25 other women. Her shared cell was claustrophobic, she said, and it was sometimes hard to breathe. Although her fellow prisoners were trying to look after her, none of them spoke English. Her family have said Ms Plummer was ""unrecognisable"" after four weeks in custody in Egypt. Ms Plummer's local MP, Karl Turner, says she has never been in trouble at home. ""She's never had so much as a parking ticket in the UK,"" he said. ""This is a woman who's definitely, clearly, done wrong, but she, in my view, absolutely had no knowledge of what she was doing to be illegal, and we need to be mindful of that.""

Exclusion 'ultimate rejection' for adopted kids,"Adoption UK says exclusion reinforces rejection ""Being permanently excluded was the ultimate rejection for him,"" says Faye, mother of 15-year-old Joe. Faye says since he was excluded from secondary school, Joe's behaviour has deteriorated, with a devastating knock-on effect for the rest of the family. But this family's experience is not unusual, according to a report by the charity Adoption UK. Its research estimates adopted children can be up to 20 times more likely to be permanently excluded than their peers. The charity surveyed 2,084 of its members and found that of those with adopted children at school  in 2015-16, 12% had had a fixed-term and 1.63% a permanent exclusion. This compares with a rate of 4.29% for fixed and 0.08% for permanent exclusions across all state schools in England. Adoption UK says that while its survey is indicative rather than scientific, it raises serious concerns. 'Hid in cupboard - we couldn't get our adopted son to school' Its report says adopted children often experience challenges in education, with the ""effects of early loss, trauma, abuse and neglect"" accounting for much of this. ""Our survey revealed that many adoptive families have struggled in their search for a school that can understand and cater for their child's needs,"" it says. Faye says her son had coped fairly well in his small, nurturing primary school but struggled when he made the transition to secondary school. ""They put him in isolation when he did something wrong, which wasn't good for him,"" she says. ""They didn't understand the huge sense of shame and rejection that adopted children feel. ""The other major thing is organisation. Adopted children are on another level - we have to remind them to clean their teeth, but their teachers expect them to remember various different textbooks each day. ""I've got a file full of negative letters about him from the school."" Joe was temporarily excluded on a number of occasions and then was permanently excluded earlier this year. ""That has been the ultimate rejection for him. He was sorting his head out about his own rejection, but now he's in a pupil referral unit,"" says Faye. ""His behaviour has gone drastically downhill, and his behaviour has become increasingly unmanageable, dangerous and aggressive. ""He's now got dreadful anxiety about learning and school."" Faye believes adopted children need a small, nurturing school with staff who understand the sorts of issues children with a history of care often have. ""But these schools don't seem to exist,"" she says. ""One of the main things is the size of the school, because they get lost and they feel like a very small fish."" ""Exclusions only serve to add to feelings of low self-worth for an adopted child"" ""Schools should have more training to better enable them to deal with adopted and looked-after children"" ""It was exclusion by stealth. He was held in from playtime, excluded from school trips and after-school clubs. He was made to feel very bad about himself"" ""[Exclusions] become a shameful self-fulfilling prophesy for children experiencing attachment trauma"" Adoption UK is calling for school staff to have better training around the needs of adopted children and for better support for these children throughout their schooling. The charity's schools development officer, Becky White, says: ""The true extent of this problem is being masked because schools are regularly asking adoptive parents to take their children home and keep them out of school, without recording them as exclusions. ""We need to find better ways of improving the situation for children and teachers rather than relying on exclusions. ""The challenge for us now is in convincing education professionals that extra support is needed for adopted children from the start - instead of waiting until they are at crisis point."" Children and Families Minister Robert Goodwill said there was a ""range of measures in place"" to help adopted children in England, as well as priority admission to schools that best met their needs. ""From April 2018, a network of 'virtual school heads' and designated teachers will be responsible for ensuring adopted children are getting the support that they need,"" he said. ""Alongside this, we are reviewing exclusions in schools to look at how we can improve practices and focus on the experiences of those groups who are disproportionately likely to be excluded.""

What do ex-aides' charges mean for Trump?,"On Monday morning Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates were charged with 12 counts of money laundering, undisclosed foreign lobbying, lying to government investigators, and various and sundry other serious-sounding offences. It turned out that wasn't the biggest news of the day. Indictments had been telegraphed since news reports on Friday evening mentioned they were signed, sealed and soon-to-be-delivered. Manafort's name was at the top of most lists of possible targets. It was the follow-up revelation from Robert Mueller's independent counsel team, however, that caught most of Washington by surprise. George Papadopoulos - hardly a household name - had pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators about his contacts with Russian nationals and connected individuals while he was serving as a foreign policy with the Trump campaign. Where the Manafort indictment was somewhat expected and covered business dealings prior to his time as head of the Trump campaign, the Papadopoulos news sits at the heart of Mr Mueller's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia. Here are three reasons why Papadopoulos is a key piece of the puzzle. And lest we give the Manafort case short shrift, here are three more reasons why it could end up being even more explosive. Per details of the indictment and plea agreement, Papadopoulos has revealed that he was in contact with individuals - a London professor, a female Russian national, a Russian foreign affairs ministry official - either directly or tangentially connected to the Russian government. He was passing along details of conversations he had to senior members of the Trump presidential campaign team including, reportedly, Manafort. At one point, a ""campaign supervisor"", responding to one of  Papadopoulos's emails, replied ""good work"". This video can not be played White House: ""Today's announcement has nothing to do with the president"" While not evidence of collusion, this is clear indication that the Russian government was seeking back channels to the Trump campaign - and were finding at least some success. The White House has diminished Papadopoulos's role within the campaign, noting he was an unpaid adviser and that his efforts to set up a senior-level meeting between the Trump team and Russian officials were rebuffed. Papadopoulos did have a sit-down conference on 31 March 2016, with Mr Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team. Candidate Trump also mentioned Papadopoulos, whom he called an ""excellent guy"", as an adviser in a21 March interview,externalwith the Washington Post. Papadopoulos may have been on the campaign periphery, but he was far from a total unknown. On April 26, 2016, Papadopoulos's professor contact told him he had just returned from Moscow and learned from ""high-level Russian government officials"" that they possessed ""dirt"" on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"". It's unclear from the indictment whether Papadopoulos passed this bit of information on to his campaign contacts, although it notes he ""continued to correspond"" with them. What is clear, however, is that there is now evidence that individuals with Russian government connections on two separate occasions tried to let the Trump campaign know that they had information they thought was damaging to the Democratic candidate. Papadopoulos was the first. The second was when the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, heard a similar line from his publicist-friend Rob Goldstone in June 2016. Trump Jr responded by writing ""if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer"". Later that month, Trump Jr, Manafort and Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met a group of Russian nationals. In July, embarrassing emails that were hacked from the Democratic National Committee were published by Wikileaks. In October, the contents of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's personal email inbox were released. It makes for an interesting timeline. If there's anyone in Trump's campaign circle with something to hide, they should be concerned that Papadopoulos was arrested back on 27 July. He struck a plea agreement with the Mueller team on 5 October. That was nearly four weeks ago and, according to the court documents, Papadopoulos has been co-operating with government investigators ever since. In fact, Mr Mueller told the relevant court he did not want the arrest made public because it would ""significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive co-operator"". So who has Papadopoulos spoken to since his arrest? And what sorts of topics could he have discussed? According to Dan Dale of the Toronto Star,external, a former prosecutor told him the term ""proactive co-operator"" can indicate someone who is willing to wear a wire tap. HotAir Blog goes through,externalan extended what-if scenario that envisions how Papadopoulos could go about surreptitiously gathering incriminating details from members of Trump's campaign inner circle. He could ask for their ""advice"" on how to disrupt Mr Mueller's investigation after disclosing that he had been arrested. ""Suddenly those people woke up this morning and realised they'd had conversations with Papadopoulos recently about how to throw Mueller off the trail and only now do they realise he's been in cahoots with Mueller for three months,"" the theory goes. ""Hoo boy."" Hoo boy, indeed. Donald Trump gives a thumbs up as his campaign manager Paul Manafort and daughter Ivanka look on during Trump's walk through at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland Even if, as Mr Trump writes ina tweet,external, Manafort's alleged illegal activities occurred ""years ago"", before he took a senior position in the Trump campaign, it still reflects poorly on the then-candidate's personnel choices. It was clear at the time Manafort came on board with Mr Trump that he had some questionable dealings in his past - including work for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians, Philippine ex-leader Ferdinand Marcos and a group with ties to Pakistani intelligence. Like many politicos in Mr Trump's orbit, Manafort was thrust into the campaign spotlight with little background vetting because more established hands wanted nothing to do with the upstart candidate's presidential efforts. The decision to run with Manafort, who was backed by Trump confidante Roger Stone, has come back to haunt his presidency. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair What is 'conspiracy against the United States'? Part of the case against Manafort - that he was operating as an undisclosed agent for a foreign government - echoes similar allegations made against another Trump associate, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Flynn resigned his White House post after revelations that he had lied about discussing US sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016. It was later disclosed that Flynn was also working for the Turkish government - something he didn't disclose on his relevant government forms. If Manafort can face charges for his Ukrainian involvement, Flynn may be in jeopardy as well. This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe Slate's Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Sternalso theorise,externalthat Mr Mueller's case against Manafort for financial misdeeds relating to foreign income could serve as a blueprint for a future case against Mr Trump's own business organisation, which also brings in a fair amount of revenue from foreign sources. ""This is an indictment that should terrify Trump in that it shadows and hints at his own unlawful conduct,"" they write. Mr Trump wasn't named in the Manafort indictment, but the message may have been sent nevertheless. Then there's the million-dollar question. If Manafort and Gates are each staring at double-digit prison terms if convicted, might they follow Papadopoulos's lead and seek to strike a deal with Mr Mueller in exchange for leniency? Papadopoulos, of course, is a figure from the edges of the Trump campaign. Manafort, for months, was at the heart of it. Mr Mueller and his veteran team of prosecutors know how to build a case against a large enterprise. Start with the easy targets, then offer a deal. Work your way up from the bottom. Reward those who co-operate early, and throw the book at the hold-outs. Turn the screws, and have your targets constantly looking over their shoulders. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? Manafort and Gates may have nothing to bargain with - the White House insists that there is nothing there.

Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House,"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin Throughout the confusion of Donald Trump's campaign and the chaotic events of his early days in the White House, one controversy has clung to the Trump team like glue: Russia. US intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. It is alleged that Russian hackers stole information linked to the campaign of his rival Hillary Clinton and passed it to Wikileaks so it could be released to undermine her. Congressional committees were set up to investigate the matter and, in March, then-FBI director James Comey confirmed the bureau had its own inquiry. President Trump sacked Mr Comey on 9 May, citing his reason as ""this Russia thing"", in a move that shocked Washington andfuelled claims of a cover-up. However, it did not halt the investigation. On 18 May, the department of justice appointed ex-FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to look into the matter. Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn resigned in February after failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington. In December, he pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his meetings with Mr Kislyak. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling the allegations a ""witch hunt"". It was back in May 2016 that the first reports emerged of hackers targeting the Democratic Party. Over the next two months, the reports suggested US intelligence agencies had traced the breaches back to Russian hackers. In July, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Wikileaks published 20,000 internal emails stolen by the hackers. US intelligence officials said they believed with ""high confidence"" that Russia was behind the operation, but the Trump campaign publicly refused to accept the findings. Instead, at a press conference, Mr Trump caused outrage by inviting Russian hackers to target Hillary Clinton's controversial personal email server, saying: ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"". About the same time the hacking scandal was beginning to unfold, Mr Trump's then campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was accused of accepting millions of dollars in cash for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and US, including dealings with an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives. Subsequently, further allegations were made in Ukraine about secret funds said to have been paid to Mr Manafort, and it has also been claimed that he secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to assist President Putin's political ends. Mr Manafort has denied both allegations. He was found guilty in August 2018 of eight counts of financial fraud and tax evasion crimes. In September 2018, he pleaded guilty to two remaining charges - and agreed to co-operate with the special counsel's investigation in exchange for a reduced jail sentence. This video can not be played Trump praises Putin's leadership In October, the US intelligence community released a unanimous statement formally accusing Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Mr Trump continued to argue against the finding, claiming in a presidential debate that it ""could be Russia, but it could also be China, it could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds"". The same day that the intelligence agencies released their findings, the explosive ""Access Hollywood"" recording emerged of Mr Trump's obscene remarks about women in 2005. An hour later, Wikileaks began dumping thousands more leaked Clinton emails. Mr Trump continued to refuse to acknowledge the consensus that Russia was behind the hack. In December, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security published a report of the US intelligence findings linking Russia to the hack. In response, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and levied new sanctions on Russia. The world awaited Mr Putin's response but he chose not retaliate. Mr Trump, by then the president-elect, sided with the Russian president, tweeting: ""Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"" Mr Putin's decision not to respond in kind struck many as a canny PR move, but reportedly set off suspicions among US intelligence officials that Russia was confident the sanctions would not last. The same month, Mr Trump picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state, arguably the most important job in the cabinet. The biggest hurdle for Mr Tillerson's confirmation? Close ties to Mr Putin. As CEO of the ExxonMobil oil company, Mr Tillerson cultivated a close personal relationship with the Russian leader, leading many to speculate on whether he was fit to serve as America's most senior diplomat. Mr Tillerson wassworn in as secretary of state on 2 February. In January, Buzzfeed published a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, which alleged that Moscow had compromising material on the then-president-elect, making him liable to blackmail. Among the various memos in the dossier was an allegation that Mr Trump had been recorded by Russian security services consorting with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel. Mr Trump dismissed the claims as fake news. CNN revealed that President Obama and President-elect Trump had been briefed on the existence of the dossier by intelligence officials, and Buzzfeed went one further, publishing the entire thing. In February, the most concrete and damaging Russia scandal finally surfaced, months after suspicions were raised among intelligence officials. Michael Flynn quit as national security adviser after 23 days US media reported that Mr Flynn had discussed the potential lifting of Mr Obama's Russia sanctions with the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, before Mr Trump took the reins of government. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy. He resigned as Mr Trump's national security adviser after 23 days on the job, saying he had ""inadvertently briefed the vice-president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador"" late last year. Since leaving the White House, the Pentagon has launched an investigation into whether he failed to disclose payments from Russian and Turkish lobbyists that he was given for speeches and consulting work. Who is Michael Flynn? Attorney General Jeff Sessions was being accused of lying at his confirmation hearing when he said he had had ""no communications with the Russians"" during the election campaign. It later emerged that he too had met Mr Kislyak - at a private meeting in September and as part of a group of ambassadors in July last year. The Alabama senator was one of the most prominent players in Mr Trump's bid to take the White House. But he says his meetings with Mr Kislyak were related to his role as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and had nothing to do with the election campaign. But Mr Sessions recused himself from the FBI investigation into the Russian hacking claims, an investigation he is overseeing. Two months into the Trump presidency, Mr Comey confirmed at a rare open hearing of the House Intelligence Committee that the agency was investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. It is an ""ongoing"" investigation that began in July 2016, he said. Mr Trump's controversial meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Mr Kislyak But on 9 May, Mr Comey was fired. The White House initially said it was over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails. But Mr Trump later said ""this Russia thing"" was a factor. On 10 May, Mr Trump met the Russian ambassador and foreign minister in the Oval Office. He told them firing Mr Comey had eased ""great pressure"",the New York Times reported,external. He also reportedlyshared with them highly-sensitive ""codeword"" materialrelating to terrorism and airline safety, sending more shockwaves through Washington. Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel a week later. In his much anticipated testimony before a Senate panel, Mr Comey said that Mr Trump had asked him to pledge his loyalty, confirming previous media reports about a January meeting between the pair. ""I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,"" Mr Trump said, according to Mr Comey's testimony. James Comey was ""terminated and removed from office"" by President Trump Mr Comey said: ""I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence."" Mr Comey also said Mr Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into Mr Flynn. ""[Trump] said: 'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' I replied only that 'he is a good guy.'"" But Mr Comey did confirm the president's account that he had told Mr Trump the FBI was not investigating him personally. He said he had kept written memos on his meetings and phone calls with the president, fearing Mr Trump might lie. He denied asking for Mr Comey's loyalty, although he added: ""I don't think it would be a bad question to ask."" The White House also denied that Mr Trump had asked for the Flynn inquiry to be dropped. Mr Trump has alsoquestioned the neutrality of Robert Mueller, saying the special counsel's friendship with Mr Comey is ""bothersome"". He has criticised the FBI on numerous occasions and, in one tweet, said the organisation's reputation was ""in tatters"". On9 July came newsof what was thought to be the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and members of President Trump's inner circle. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr, admitted meeting Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on 9 June 2016 at Trump Tower after being told that she had damaging material on Hillary Clinton. But he insisted the lawyer had provided ""no meaningful information"" in a meeting that also included the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Mr Manafort. Mr Trump Jr told the House Intelligence committee he discussed the Trump Tower meeting with his father once it became public in a New York Times report earlier this year, but he refused to provide details of their conversation, citing attorney-client privilege. September saw Facebook reveal it had discovered that politically charged advertising had been targeted at American voters during the 2016 campaign. The social network said it believed this had been paid for by Russians with links to the Kremlin. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said his company would share 3,000 Russia-linked political adverts with US investigators. The adverts did not support a specific candidate, Facebook said, but instead posted inflammatory information on hot topics such as immigration. Rival network Twitter said it had shut down about 200 accounts linked to a Russian misinformation campaign. President Trump responded to Facebook's revelations by saying the site had always been against him. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rejected his comments, saying his company did not take sides. In October 2017, Mr Manafort,who quit as Mr Trump's campaign chairman last August, was charged with conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine. The good news for Mr Trump was that these charges - of which he was later convicted - were not directly linked to the Russia investigation. But the bad news is that Mr Manafort later agreed to co-operate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. Paul Manafort ended up falling prey to the controversy his appointment was intended to stifle Another of his advisers, George Papadopoulos, admitted making false statements to FBI agents about his dealings with an unnamed overseas academic who allegedly informed him that the Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. The charges against Mr Papadopoulos were the first to be brought by Robert Mueller as part of the Russia investigation. Paul Manafort: The man who helped Trump win In December, Michael Flynn admitted making false statements to the FBI about meetings with the Russian ambassador, making him the most senior member of the administration to be indicted. He also revealed he was co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. A statement made by Mr Flynn to prosecutors appeared to implicate a more senior, though unnamed, Trump team official - indicating the direction in which Mr Mueller's investigation may be heading. Numerous US media outlets said the senior official now under the spotlight is Jared Kushner - Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law. Soon after Mr Flynn was charged, the president appeared to suggest that he had known Mr Flynn had lied about meetings with the Russian ambassador, contradicting his own account from the time - and prompting accusations that he obstructed justice. A White House lawyer later said he had written the tweet and that the controversial line had actually been an error.

'Selfie' Hitler removed from museum,"Pictures like these have provoked outrage across the globe A life-size model of Adolf Hitler used for ""selfies"" by visitors to an Indonesian museum has been removed. Pictures shared on social media show people grinning as they pose with the Nazi leader in front of an image of the gates of Auschwitz concentration camp. It was only when the international community reacted with outrage that the De ARCA Statue Art Museum realised it had caused any offence. The museum, in Jogjakarta, Java, said it had only wanted to educate. ""We don't want to attract outrage,"" the museum's operations manager, Jamie Misbah, told news agency AFP. Seventy years since Auschwitz liberated The Holocaust year by year Why did ordinary people commit atrocities in the Holocaust? Pictures on social media show numerous people posing with the fibreglass statue, including a group of young boys dressed in orange uniforms performing a Nazi salute. It has left many around the world sickened - even if, as the museum originally said, no visitor had actually complained. Rabbi Abraham Cooper, of Jewish human rights organisation The Simon Wiesenthal Center, told news agency AP: ""Everything about it is wrong. It's hard to find words for how contemptible it is. ""The background is disgusting. It mocks the victims who went in and never came out."" An estimated 1.1 million people, mainly European Jews, but also groups including Roma gypsies and Soviet prisoners-of-war, died at Auschwitz during the Holocaust. Some people have blamed a lack of education about the Holocaust on the lack of sensitivity, but Human Rights Watch researcher Andreas Harsono suggested it revealed anti-Jewish feeling in the world's most populous Muslim nation. The display, one of about 80 in the museum, came less than a year after a Nazi-themed cafe was shut down in Bandung, Java.

What do charges mean for Trump?,"On Monday morning Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates were charged with 12 counts of money laundering, undisclosed foreign lobbying, lying to government investigators, and various and sundry other serious-sounding offences. It turned out that wasn't the biggest news of the day. Indictments had been telegraphed since news reports on Friday evening mentioned they were signed, sealed and soon-to-be-delivered. Manafort's name was at the top of most lists of possible targets. It was the follow-up revelation from Robert Mueller's independent counsel team, however, that caught most of Washington by surprise. George Papadopoulos - hardly a household name - had pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators about his contacts with Russian nationals and connected individuals while he was serving as a foreign policy with the Trump campaign. Where the Manafort indictment was somewhat expected and covered business dealings prior to his time as head of the Trump campaign, the Papadopoulos news sits at the heart of Mr Mueller's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia. Here are three reasons why Papadopoulos is a key piece of the puzzle. And lest we give the Manafort case short shrift, here are three more reasons why it could end up being even more explosive. Per details of the indictment and plea agreement, Papadopoulos has revealed that he was in contact with individuals - a London professor, a female Russian national, a Russian foreign affairs ministry official - either directly or tangentially connected to the Russian government. He was passing along details of conversations he had to senior members of the Trump presidential campaign team including, reportedly, Manafort. At one point, a ""campaign supervisor"", responding to one of  Papadopoulos's emails, replied ""good work"". This video can not be played White House: ""Today's announcement has nothing to do with the president"" While not evidence of collusion, this is clear indication that the Russian government was seeking back channels to the Trump campaign - and were finding at least some success. The White House has diminished Papadopoulos's role within the campaign, noting he was an unpaid adviser and that his efforts to set up a senior-level meeting between the Trump team and Russian officials were rebuffed. Papadopoulos did have a sit-down conference on 31 March 2016, with Mr Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team. Candidate Trump also mentioned Papadopoulos, whom he called an ""excellent guy"", as an adviser in a21 March interview,externalwith the Washington Post. Papadopoulos may have been on the campaign periphery, but he was far from a total unknown. On April 26, 2016, Papadopoulos's professor contact told him he had just returned from Moscow and learned from ""high-level Russian government officials"" that they possessed ""dirt"" on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"". It's unclear from the indictment whether Papadopoulos passed this bit of information on to his campaign contacts, although it notes he ""continued to correspond"" with them. What is clear, however, is that there is now evidence that individuals with Russian government connections on two separate occasions tried to let the Trump campaign know that they had information they thought was damaging to the Democratic candidate. Papadopoulos was the first. The second was when the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, heard a similar line from his publicist-friend Rob Goldstone in June 2016. Trump Jr responded by writing ""if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer"". Later that month, Trump Jr, Manafort and Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met a group of Russian nationals. In July, embarrassing emails that were hacked from the Democratic National Committee were published by Wikileaks. In October, the contents of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's personal email inbox were released. It makes for an interesting timeline. If there's anyone in Trump's campaign circle with something to hide, they should be concerned that Papadopoulos was arrested back on 27 July. He struck a plea agreement with the Mueller team on 5 October. That was nearly four weeks ago and, according to the court documents, Papadopoulos has been co-operating with government investigators ever since. In fact, Mr Mueller told the relevant court he did not want the arrest made public because it would ""significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive co-operator"". So who has Papadopoulos spoken to since his arrest? And what sorts of topics could he have discussed? According to Dan Dale of the Toronto Star,external, a former prosecutor told him the term ""proactive co-operator"" can indicate someone who is willing to wear a wire tap. HotAir Blog goes through,externalan extended what-if scenario that envisions how Papadopoulos could go about surreptitiously gathering incriminating details from members of Trump's campaign inner circle. He could ask for their ""advice"" on how to disrupt Mr Mueller's investigation after disclosing that he had been arrested. ""Suddenly those people woke up this morning and realised they'd had conversations with Papadopoulos recently about how to throw Mueller off the trail and only now do they realise he's been in cahoots with Mueller for three months,"" the theory goes. ""Hoo boy."" Hoo boy, indeed. Donald Trump gives a thumbs up as his campaign manager Paul Manafort and daughter Ivanka look on during Trump's walk through at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland Even if, as Mr Trump writes ina tweet,external, Manafort's alleged illegal activities occurred ""years ago"", before he took a senior position in the Trump campaign, it still reflects poorly on the then-candidate's personnel choices. It was clear at the time Manafort came on board with Mr Trump that he had some questionable dealings in his past - including work for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians, Philippine ex-leader Ferdinand Marcos and a group with ties to Pakistani intelligence. Like many politicos in Mr Trump's orbit, Manafort was thrust into the campaign spotlight with little background vetting because more established hands wanted nothing to do with the upstart candidate's presidential efforts. The decision to run with Manafort, who was backed by Trump confidante Roger Stone, has come back to haunt his presidency. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair What is 'conspiracy against the United States'? Part of the case against Manafort - that he was operating as an undisclosed agent for a foreign government - echoes similar allegations made against another Trump associate, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Flynn resigned his White House post after revelations that he had lied about discussing US sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016. It was later disclosed that Flynn was also working for the Turkish government - something he didn't disclose on his relevant government forms. If Manafort can face charges for his Ukrainian involvement, Flynn may be in jeopardy as well. This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe Slate's Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Sternalso theorise,externalthat Mr Mueller's case against Manafort for financial misdeeds relating to foreign income could serve as a blueprint for a future case against Mr Trump's own business organisation, which also brings in a fair amount of revenue from foreign sources. ""This is an indictment that should terrify Trump in that it shadows and hints at his own unlawful conduct,"" they write. Mr Trump wasn't named in the Manafort indictment, but the message may have been sent nevertheless. Then there's the million-dollar question. If Manafort and Gates are each staring at double-digit prison terms if convicted, might they follow Papadopoulos's lead and seek to strike a deal with Mr Mueller in exchange for leniency? Papadopoulos, of course, is a figure from the edges of the Trump campaign. Manafort, for months, was at the heart of it. Mr Mueller and his veteran team of prosecutors know how to build a case against a large enterprise. Start with the easy targets, then offer a deal. Work your way up from the bottom. Reward those who co-operate early, and throw the book at the hold-outs. Turn the screws, and have your targets constantly looking over their shoulders. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? Manafort and Gates may have nothing to bargain with - the White House insists that there is nothing there.

Rise and fall of 'Islamic State',"Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul. ""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'"" The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of  panicked civilians. This video can not be played Video footage from Mosul after its capture by Isis shows militants driving through the streets It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil). Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize. Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch. ""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'"" The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening. As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed. Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west. Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015 Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed. Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants. In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming. After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds. That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics. Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014 Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate. Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014. IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley. In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings. Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word. Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"". IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming. The theology of murder The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD. Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East. ""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk. ""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies."" As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers. For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price. The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.  Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus. These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors). They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula. A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most  puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power. In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah. But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both. Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment. The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times.   Jihad  means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war. But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow. Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought"" Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder. Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such. For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him. Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions,  and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader. Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"". 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith."" And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb."" The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle. Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both. Rise of al-Qaeda The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahideen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam. Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980 There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand. Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists. It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it. By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001. The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today. Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists. After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase. But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir. ""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates. The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004. The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists ""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was  referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved. Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the West into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy. The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan. Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008. Iraq fiasco The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda. Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies. Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it. Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true. Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003 By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in. Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials came to call the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region. Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran. The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in. They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community. Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such. Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism with Baathist organisation at its core. His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists. Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military. As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq. But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion. Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of. The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions. But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security. By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq. They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"". Territorial takeover Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad. Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader. All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad. The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him. 29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? What has happened to Baghdadi? But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its Sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004. Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies. Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership. The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk. Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public. By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"". But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam. Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas. Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships. Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born. IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it. After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter But Jawlani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise. It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office. Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis. Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next? Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry. An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015 When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover. With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army holding large stretches of territory, ruling millions of people, and not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world. The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of al-Nuri, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him. By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global. Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism. A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north. The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258. Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924. So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion. For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad. Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria. It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule. To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts. Satellite images show Palmyra's once majestic Temple of Bel before and after its destruction by Islamic State militants Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including themagnificent temples of Beland Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq. It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion. All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves. A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers. And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issued printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and took a percentage of the proceeds. That was just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled into its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done. Captured documentspublished by Der Spiegel in 2015,externalgive some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security. Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014. At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper. ""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later. ""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders.""

They were stopped at an IS checkpoint,  the woman given a veil and allowed to go, while the driver was sent to an Islamic court, and sentenced to two months' detention and to memorise a portion of the Koran. If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated. ""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident, speaking when IS still controlled the city. ""Adulterers are stoned to death. Thieves have their hands cut off. Gays are executed by being thrown off high buildings. Informers are shot dead, Shia militia prisoners are beheaded.""

School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu. ""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident after IS took over. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta [knowing the right people and pulling strings]. They are totally convinced they are on the right track."" Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire One story tells a lot about IS and its ways. As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi in early 2016, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too. Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint. As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander]."" The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders. ""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police. ""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

She managed to escape the city and became a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC. This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who were still inside the city when it was held by IS. Taking on the world Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains. But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers. Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army. Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 ) Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended. The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad. In the three years following the declaration of the ""caliphate"" in 2014, at least 150 attacks in 29 countries across the globe were either carried out or inspired by IS, with well over 2,000 victims killed. The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach. At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief. The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October 2015 and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria. The lone-wolf massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, while apparently inspired rather than organised by IS, would undoubtedly further stiffen the US's already steely resolve to finish the organisation. Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates went as low as half that). A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015 Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or would President Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump be able to fulfil Mr Obama's pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation? Final showdown If there seemed to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there was. When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq. A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to theend of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq."" Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad. That could help explain why the organisation seemed to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily. It's been one of the elements that made IS a formidable fighting force hard to destroy even in strictly military terms. Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated. What made IS so formidable? The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just 10 minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!"" ""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them."" Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic. Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose. Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank. ""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business."" ""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation."" The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, was clearly a vital component in IS success. But that did not mean its fighters were invincible on the battlefield, even in the early days of stunningly rapid expansion. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes. In December 2015, for example, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month alone. Pentagon officials said coalition air strikes killed some 50,000 IS militants in Iraq and Syria between August 2014 and the end of 2016. But IS initially seemed to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on, in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting was done locally. Clearly, had it remained in place, there would soon have been anew generation of young militants,externaldrawn from local sources. This video can not be played Quentin Sommerville: ""They witnessed killing close at hand"" ""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits. Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike. He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets. Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative ""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s."" ""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?'  They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family."" Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. Since we spoke, he has in fact been given two death sentences. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed. ""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now."" Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets. A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds. ""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles."" ""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me."" Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant Rising to the challenge Just as the 9/11 Twin Towers atrocity in 2001 had left the US and its allies with no alternative but to strike back with extreme force, the challenge mounted by IS through its numerous provocative outrages in the region and around the world could not be ignored - nor was it meant to be. But rooting out the militants from Iraq and Syria was always going to be much more complex than the campaign unleashed more than a decade earlier against al-Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan. There was never any real question of a wholesale Coalition invasion of either country. Air strikes were one thing, but putting in vast numbers of troops on the ground would be something else. Syria was embroiled in a bewilderingly complicated civil war. Iraq was also in turmoil. US forces had only pulled out three years earlier. There was no appetite for a repeat of an invasion which was almost universally seen as a disastrous blunder with lasting consequences. But uprooting the militants could not be done by air power alone. Reliable, motivated partner forces on the ground would be needed. In both countries, they were in short supply. In Syria, the US and its allies were already engaged with some of the motley array of Syrian rebel groups. But they never amounted to the kind of focused, cohesive forces that the Coalition was looking for - they were fragmented, fractious, increasingly Islamist in tone, and largely bent on overthrowing the Assad regime rather than turning on IS. In Iraq, the regular armed forces were in disarray after collapsing like a house of cards in the face of the onslaught on Mosul by a few hundred IS militants. Much work would have to be done to weld them into a motivated and competent fighting force. In both countries it was to the Kurds in the north that the Americans and their Coalition partners first turned as their most hopeful immediate allies. The Syrian Democratic Forces emerged as a reliable partner for the US in the fight against IS The Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq had a long relationship with the Western Coalition powers. In 2003, US special forces fought alongside them to clear Islamist militants from mountain positions near the Iranian border just before the invasion against Saddam Hussein, in which they were partners. Humiliated by the loss of vast areas of territory to the lightning IS assault in early August 2014, the Peshmerga needed no encouragement to hit back. Less than two weeks later, with Coalition air support, they recaptured the strategic Mosul dam. In the months that followed, they slowly clawed back much of the ground they had lost, including Sinjar in November 2015, in operations closely co-ordinated with Coalition air strikes. But in the rest of Iraq, the picture was much messier. Iraqi government forces were able to halt the IS thrust southwards towards the capital, Baghdad, but made little early progress pushing back into the mainly Sunni areas where the militants had dug in. It was Iranian-backed Shia militias, whose emergence was consolidated under the IS threat, that made the running in the initial phases of the campaign to oust the militants, driving them out of areas north-east of Baghdad near the Iranian border and pursuing them westwards until the eventual recapture of Saddam Hussein's hometown Tikrit in the Tigris river valley in March 2015. ""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" said Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups, known as the Hashd al-Shaabi or Popular Mobilisation (PM), that rose in defence of Baghdad and the south. ""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Irbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq."" But in the Sunni heartlands of Anbar province to the west of Baghdad the Iraqi state forces were struggling. In May 2015, IS militants captured the provincial capital, Ramadi. At the same time, they spread their grip in Syria, taking the iconic city of Palmyra (Tadmur) in the desert east of Homs. It was a clear signal that while the organisation may have been dealt some setbacks it was still at the height of its powers and capable of exploiting any weaknesses it found. But the Americans were quietly busy preparing for the real war on IS. They had poured billions into rebuilding the Iraqi army after 2003, only to see much of it go to pieces under pressure because so much was wrong with its foundations. Now, putting in several thousand advisers, they focused on training and equipping the key Iraqi special forces - the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), otherwise known as the Golden Division - that was to play a crucial role spearheading the drive against the militants. The systematic lashback began with Anbar province and the eventual recapture of Ramadi at the end of 2015 and early 2016, a grinding and costly operation with close Coalition air support. There was huge destruction and the displacement of most of the city's largely Sunni population. There were also tensions over the deployment of Iranian-backed, mainly Shia militias in core Sunni areas, though they were largely kept out of the city itself. Pro-government forces patrol Ramadi The recapture of Ramadi tightened the noose around the even more iconic centre of Sunni sentiment at nearby Falluja, where militants had fought two major battles with the Americans in 2004. Government and PM forces began closing in around the city in early 2016, soon after taking Ramadi. By now, after a lot of testing and assessing, the Americans and their allies, working closely with local forces, were clearly embarked on a comprehensive strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS wherever it could be found. The broad lines were spelled out in February 2016 by Lt Gen Sean McFarland, then the commanding general of the Coalition's Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve. ""The campaign has three objectives: to destroy the ISIL parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack."" Next step on the road to Mosul, the battle for Falluja was joined in late May 2016 and took just over a month of assaults, bombardments and air strikes to complete, with civilians again paying a heavy price. IS fighters deployed their full range of battle tactics, with snipers, booby-traps and suicide bombers making advance difficult and dangerous for the attacking forces. Despite the attrition suffered by the Iraqi forces, especially the elite CTS forces, it was not long before eyes turned to the big prize - Mosul. With President Obama due to bow out early in the new year, the Americans were getting impatient. In peacetime roughly 10 times the size of either Falluja or indeed the IS ""capital"" Raqqa, Mosul was never going to be an easy nut to crack. It had fallen to the militants in a matter of hours in 2014. By the time the government and Coalition campaign to dislodge them was finally launched in mid-October 2016, IS had had nearly two-and-a-half years to dig in and prepare its defences. There is a moment in the journey into Raqqa when you leave the real world behind. After the bombed-out Samra bridge, any signs of normal life vanish. Turn right at the shop that once sold gravestones - its owner is long gone - and you are inside the city. Ahead lies nothing but destruction and grey dust and rubble. This is a place drained of colour, of life, and of people. In six days inside Raqqa, I didn't see a single civilian. The city fit for no-one Marshalled against a band of militants variously estimated at between 2,000 and 12,000 with a hard core probably closer to 4,000 or 5,000, was a vast assembly of government and auxiliary forces, estimated at around 100,000, counting regular army and federal police units, Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and the Popular Mobilisation, including some Sunni and minority volunteers as well as Shia militias. It was an epic battle that was to last nine months. Government forces slowly battered their way in around the city through dozens of outlying villages and finally into Mosul's eastern half, which was declared ""liberated"" towards the end of January 2017. Then it was on to the western side of the river and the old city, with its dense warren of narrow streets. The area around theancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdad had made his only public appearance as the newly-anointed ""caliph"", was the last to fall. The mosque was blown up, almost exactly three years after the declaration of the IS ""caliphate"". The evidence was that IS itself had destroyed it, rather than let it fall into ""infidel"" hands. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, saw this as ""official recognition of defeat"" by the militants. It signalled, he said, ""the collapse of the IS caliphate and a grand military victory"". This video can not be played The Iraqi military circulated a video it says shows the destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri. It was indeed a monumental achievement, a massive body-blow to the IS state project. The city had been, as a senior Western official in northern Iraq put it, ""the beating heart of IS"", in real terms much more important than Raqqa in Syria. But it came at huge cost. The years of preparation and months of battering that it took to dislodge a few thousand militants stood in stark contrast to the ease with which they had rolled into the city virtually unopposed in June 2014. Some estimates put the number of civilians killed at more than 40,000. At least 1,200 Iraqi security personnel also died in battle. The damage was estimated at $50bn. Hundreds thousands of mainly Sunni inhabitants were displaced, and there were widespread allegations of abuses. The weeks that followed saw a further rapid erosion of the group's territorial position in Iraq. By the end of August 2017, it had been driven out of Tal Afar, an important town controlling the main road from Mosul towards Syria. A month later, another long-standing IS pocket in and around the mainly Sunni town of Hawija, west of Kirkuk, was also largely overrun by government and auxiliary forces. In Iraq, that left IS in control only of the area in and around the town of al-Qaim, on the River Euphrates by the Syrian border in the far west of Anbar province. Its presence in the country had been very radically degraded. But the organisation was still far from destroyed. Across in Syria, the overall picture by the autumn of 2017 was roughly the same, despite the country's very different, extremely complex and fast-moving situation. In 2014 and 2015, IS had substantial holdings in Syria - it looked as though someone had spilled a bottle of black ink on its map. They controlled virtually the whole of Syria's stretch of the Euphrates, from Albu Kamal on the Iraqi border, up through Deir al-Zour and Raqqa, the Tabqa dam, and on to Jarablus on the border with Turkey, one of several crossings that were lifelines for the militants. They held towns and villages to the east and north of Aleppo (including the near-mythical Dabiq) and other pockets further south, including Palmyra and nearby oilfields. But this heyday did not last. In Syria, IS found itself facing, not one motley coalition of enemies as in Iraq, but three. The Americans, despairing of Syrian rebel groups whose interests lay elsewhere, adopted the experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters of the YPG, the Popular Protection Units, as their main on-the-ground partners. They added on as many Arab and minority fighters as they could find to produce the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), their favoured vehicle against IS in Syria. A cruise missile is fired from Russian ship in the Mediterranean Sea (Russian Defence Ministry handout) This did not go down at all well with the US's Nato ally Turkey, which sees the YPG and their parent political body, the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), as terrorists because of their affiliation to Turkey's own Kurdish rebels, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Often seeming to be working at cross-purposes to the Americans, Ankara set up its own coalition from among the Syrian opposition groups it had been backing and facilitating for years. IS also received attention from a third coalition, grouping Syrian government forces, Iran and Russia. The Russians carried out air strikes against IS positions partly with the same kind of motivation as the Western Coalition - revenge for the downing by IS of the Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015 - but their real strategic interest was different. The Russians and Iranians were bent on securing their investment in the Assad regime, helping it restore its authority in the country, and pre-empting any move by the Americans and their allies to block a link-up between eastern Syria and western Iraq that would give Tehran a direct land connection from Iran all the way to Lebanon. That thought may have been somewhere in Washington's head, but its primary concern was hitting and destroying IS. Turkey for its part had a different overriding preoccupation: to prevent the Syrian Kurds from expanding and joining up the areas they controlled along the southern side of the Turkey-Syria border. Despite these conflicting motivations, for IS the result was the same - pressure on many fronts. The US-backed SDF made the most headway, systematically whittling away IS assets step-by-step, but Turkey and Syrian government forces were also on the march. As early as September 2014, US air strikes had helped prevent IS taking over the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the border with Turkey. After that, the SDF were pushing forward. By October 2016, IS had lost all access to the Turkish border, a huge logistical setback - virtually all foreign jihadists bound for both Syria and Iraq had come that way, apart from other advantages. Smoke rises from a bombed building in Deir al-Zour The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels also played their part, taking over IS-held areas north and east of Aleppo - including Dabiq, which fell in a mundane enough manner with none of the apocalyptic ""burning of the Crusader armies"" heralded in IS mythology. Gradually the militants' tide receded further and further down the Euphrates valley, with the SDF, backed by perhaps 2,000 US special forces with artillery and air power, doing most of the pushing. By November 2016, the SDF were in a position to launch a campaign to isolate and eventually attack the IS ""capital"", Raqqa. The assault on the city itself began in early June 2017. By then, much of the population and many IS fighters had already fled, with most of the militants heading further downstream to the final major city largely under their control - another provincial capital, Deir al-Zour. But before the recapture of Raqqa had been completed, Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces were already thrusting towards Deir al-Zour, where a military base and airport had held out against the IS militants for almost three years. To get there, the government forces had recaptured Palmyra (for the second time) in March and pushed eastwards along the road to take Sukhna in August before reaching Deir al-Zour itself in September. US-backed SDF forces had already bypassed the yet-to-fall Raqqa and moved into oil-rich areas to the east of Deir al-Zour, laying claim to oil and gasfields that would greatly bolster the Kurds' ambitions to run their own area in the north of the country - or at least strengthen their hand in eventual negotiations with Damascus. So as 2017 moved into its final months, IS territorial control in Syria seemed to be as doomed as it was in Iraq - bottled up in a small patch straddling the border around al-Qaim in western Iraq and Albu Kamal in Syria. Rooting the militants out from there would not necessarily be a simple task in a fiercely tribal area prone to defying governments. But to all intents and purposes, the IS dream of administering and expanding a thriving Islamic state in the two countries as the core of a growing global caliphate had crashed in flames. So had IS been virtually destroyed as well as severely degraded? Was it time to celebrate its demise? It had certainly been dealt crippling blows in terms of functioning as a territorial state. That project lay in ruins. The administrative structures it had set up had been swept away. Major sources of finance had been cut off - from the oilfields it had controlled, taxes imposed on the millions of Iraqis and Syrians it had ruled, and cash coming in across the border with Turkey. It could no longer attract thousands of foreign jihadists or recruit locals to replace the 60,000 IS fighters the Americans believe have died since the heady days of June 2014. With virtually all of their urban holdings lost, the militants were shrinking back into the shadows and deserts. Many of their leaders had also been killed, although Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself apparently eluded the hunt, issuing adefiant audio statementin September 2017. Among the known dead were Mohammed Emwazi, ""Jihadi John"", killed by a drone strike in Syria in late 2015. But all of this had been long foreseen by the leadership. In May 2016, the man regarded as the organisation's real Number Two, spokesman and head of external operations Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, made a lengthy statement already foreshadowing the next phase of IS existence. ""You will never be victorious. You will be defeated,"" he told the Americans. ""Do you think that victory comes by killing one leader or another? That would be a fake victory!"" ""Or do you consider defeat to be the loss of a city or the loss of territory? Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq [in 2007-8] and were in the desert without any city or land? And would we be defeated, and you victorious, if you were to take Mosul or Sirte or Raqqa, or even all the cities, and we were to return to our previous situation? Absolutely not! True defeat is the loss of will and desire to fight."" Abu Muhammad al-Adnani Adnani, who as spokesman had announced the birth of ""Islamic State"" and the caliphate in June 2014, may not have lost the will and desire to fight. But he did lose his life. He was killed by an American air strike near Aleppo in August 2016. He was right to suggest that the targeted killing of militant leaders has in general had little discernible impact on the course of movements, psychologically important though it may be. But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes the case of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi might be different. The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015. ""IS's future depends on Baghdadi,"" Hashemi said, speaking at a time when IS still controlled huge swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest."" ""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation."" Baghdadi's death might not have such an impact in the new situation. But his special talents could come into their own again should conditions in either or both of those countries, or elsewhere, once again favour a comeback by the militants. That is not so fanciful, even amid the smoking wreckage of the IS above-ground infrastructure. In Iraq, the burning Sunni grievances against the Shia-dominated Baghdad government that allowed IS to make its astonishing advances in 2014 have not been seriously addressed. American officials are already referring to the danger of an ""AQI-2"" emerging - a second al-Qaeda in Iraq. It has happened before. The wholesale destruction of Sunni towns and cities in the drive against IS and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Sunnis may even have aggravated those grievances, providing fertile ground for militants to infiltrate back. There is an optimistic argument that the united cross-sectarian effort that it took to drive the militants out may have sown the seeds of a new Iraqi nationalism. But the fact remains that the Sunni community has been crushed, and the Shia majority dominates both politically and through the proliferation of its powerful militias. Political leaderships in Baghdad have signally failed to promote any serious national reconciliation since 2003. ""IS was essentially an Iraqi creation,"" said a senior Western intelligence official, speaking shortly before the militants were ousted from Mosul. ""The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population."" Thousands of IS cases are being tried in courts like Nineveh Criminal Court in Qaraqosh (above) A young man wearing a shabby, brown prisoner's outfit stands before three black-robed judges in a tiny, provincial courtroom, shaking nervously. After sipping some water, he confirms his name: Abdullah Hussein. He is accused of fighting for so-called Islamic State (IS). ""The decision of the court has been taken according to articles 2 and 3 of the 2005 Counterterrorism Law,"" states the judge. ""Death by hanging."" And then Hussein - who, like many suspects here, was picked up on the Mosul frontline - breaks down crying. Inside the Iraqi courts sentencing IS suspects to death Much work remains to be done if that sobering assessment is to be reversed. And Baghdad meanwhile faces multiple challenges that might help tip it back into the state of chaos in which the militants could thrive. The state's coffers are empty at a time when the reconstruction bill is estimated conservatively at $100bn. Corruption is endemic. Apart from the Sunni issue, Baghdad politics is in turmoil, with deep rivalries between Shia factions with greater or lesser attachment to Iran. And the threat of secession by the Kurds in the north, after the September 2017 independence referendum, could bring further instability. The very least that could be expected post-Mosul was an indefinite period of low-level insurgency, with bomb blasts and suicide attacks in different parts of the country, especially aimed, as before, at mainly Shia areas. It was already happening. The US military's Combating Terrorism Center reported that by mid-2017 there was already an average of 130 insurgent attacks taking place monthly in the ""liberated"" eastern half of Mosul. And it was already happening next door in Syria too, with IS carrying out random deadly explosions in Damascus and elsewhere despite its stark loss of territory. Although it was obvious by late 2017 that the Assad government with its Russian and Iranian backers were prevailing, the final pattern of control and governance country-wide remained uncertain. There were many ways in which further turmoil could ensue, not least the fact that, with US support, Kurdish forces had spread well beyond their own demographic comfort zone, causing huge resentment among some Sunni elements. As in Iraq, many Syrian Sunnis were bound to feel aggrieved by everything that had happened since the civil war broke out in 2011. And where there were grievances, IS or its successors would surely be there to build on them. Capitalising on chaos IS had in any case been busy spreading its bets and developing other territorial possibilities beyond the ""parent tumour"" of Iraq and Syria. Libya initially proved the most promising. It had just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the state of ""savagery"", that left room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime of Muammar Gaddafi, just as they had done in Iraq. IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""Crusader"" European countries on the other side of the sea that radical Islam was on the way. The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck in Paris, 13 November 2015. A Libyan security official at a site used by so-called Islamic State near Sirte The militants took over a big stretch of the coast and the central city of Sirte, which was to Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia. But the IS presence in Libya soon came under pressure, with militias loyal to the Government of National Accord, which been born out of UN efforts, dislodging the militants from Sirte in the second half of 2016. But they did not disappear. The Americans launched an air strike on IS elements south of Sirte in October 2017, their first such action in Libya since President Trump took over. The militants were undoubtedly on the defensive in Libya. But it remained a deeply fragmented country, and its new government far from powerful or universally accepted. There would likely continue to be pockets of chaos there for the jihadists to exploit. And there was no shortage of other possibilities being actively explored and developed - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria... wherever there were dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there would be opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted. Long before IS lost almost all its territorial gains in Iraq and Syria, it was clear that the organisation, while trying its best to hold ground wherever it could, was trying to stay alive and assert itself (""Remaining and Expanding"") in other ways - renewed insurgency in the lost lands, constant propaganda and proselytising on the internet, and above all, a revitalised push to carry out acts of terror in the West, the more shocking the better. As early as September 2014, just as IS was embarking on its provocative confrontation with the West, spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani urged the movement's followers in graphic detail to kill the hated infidels. ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other of the unbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, slaughter him with a knife, run him over with your car, throw him down from a high place, choke him or poison him."" In his statement in May 2016, al-Adnani signalled the organisation's new stress on attacks inside Western countries in response to the drive against it in Iraq and Syria. ""Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them... Know that your targeting those who are called ""civilians"" is more beloved to us and more effective, as it is more harmful, painful, and a greater deterrent to them."" Attacks in Europe and elsewhere intensified almost in direct proportion to IS' loss of terrain in Iraq and Syria. Among the more notable were the truck assault in Nice, France, in July 2016 (at least 86 killed) and a similar attack in Berlin in December (12 killed), the Istanbul nightclub bombing in January 2017 (39 killed), and two vehicle and knife attacks in London in March and June 2017 (15 killed). The attacks in London broke new ground for IS, and even more so the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena in May 2017 in which more than 20 people died. A van attack in Barcelona in August in which 13 people were killed was also seen as an advance for the militants. Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester bombing in 2017 These kinds of attacks, often carried out by ""lone wolves"" and involving everyday implements that are impossible to control, were clearly a nightmare for security services. Their job was made all the more challenging by studies showing that fewer than 20% of  ""successful"" attacks in Europe and North America were carried out by jihadists who had gone to Syria or Iraq, and that most were perpetrated by citizens of the countries under attack. While IS had managed to plant a small number of activists in the crowds of refugees and asylum seekers besieging the gates of Europe and the West, simply vetting them carefully would obviously not be enough. Clearly, IS internet messaging was still powerful, resonating among the disaffected, the resentful, the alienated and disempowered. The Americans, focusing largely on the military defeat of the militants, seemed taken aback by IS's ability to keep up and even expand the challenge. ""When I consider how much damage we've inflicted and they're still operational, they're still capable of pulling off things like some of these attacks we've seen internationally, we have to conclude that we do not yet fully appreciate the scale or strength of this phenomenon,"" said Lt Gen Michael Nagata, one of the top US Special Operations officers, quoted by the Combating Terrorism Center. ""We spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,"" added Thomas P Bossert, President Trump's adviser on homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser. ""They're proselytizing. It's troubling."" Clearly, tackling such a vague, ethereal and pervasive threat was a far cry from the clear-cut task of confronting IS fighters on the battlefield. The threat was not going to go away. Cyber-inspired lone wolf attacks could materialise at almost any time, any place. The price of relative safety would be eternal vigilance. Battle for minds The US and its allies were starting to come to grips with the cyber dimension of the challenge - and giving much less priority to the crucial problem of poor governance in the countries whose dysfunctionalities provided opportunities for the radicals to take root. But there were other parts of IS' complicated root system that were even harder to get at. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that more than half of the 27,000 foreign jihadists making their way to Syria and Iraq in the first 18 months of the ""Islamic State"" were from the Middle East and North Africa. Clearly, the ""Caliphate"" had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases, because of - its graphically publicised brutality. While vowing to degrade and destroy the organisation, President Obama put his finger on the real challenge: ""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said. On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life. Fishing and ultraviolence The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions. They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly. The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the sinister ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, less so in the case of Tunisia. While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed. Unidentified IS fighter Mohammed is giddy with excitement as he films the discovery of three IS fighters on his mobile phone. ""Shoot him,"" he shouts, gesturing at one of them. His nervousness gives him away as the unit's cook. He's unarmed, but his fellow soldiers from the Iraqi police special forces - known as the Emergency Response Division - are armed to the teeth and are not taking any chances. The secret lives of young IS fighters One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, wherea detailed survey,externalin the poorest suburbs of the capital Tunis showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless. IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, which caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers. In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century: the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing  a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals.... The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam. ""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many Western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"". But it has. ""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis."" Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees. ""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily."" Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty. Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten  corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed. ""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli. He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama wanted to see. ""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013. ""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it."" Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups. But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true ""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says. ""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics."" Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path. More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme. This video can not be played Saudi Arabia's 'creative' approach to de-radicalisation But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for a hard-to-achieve reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups. The winds of change do now seem to be starting to blow through the desert kingdom, with cautious reforms behind which the young Crown Prince, Muhammad Bin Salman, is seen as the driving force. Although the 2017 decree allowing women to drive caused a stir, it remains to be seen how deep such changes can go in a country where the grip of the ultra-conservative clergy is still strong, and where official primary schoolbooks still teach that all religions apart from Islam are ""false"". Changing some of the fundamental interpretations of religion is a monumental undertaking that could take generations. But it cannot come fast enough for a senior Sunni politician in Iraq. ""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" he says. ""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo]."" ""You can't kill all the Muslims. You need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money has been blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world - too much oil, too much money."" Sunni Axis v Shia Crescent The demise of the IS as a ""state"" straddling Iraq and Syria has huge geo-strategic implications, few of them positive for the US and its regional allies. While President Trump railed and tweeted against the evil of Iran and its sponsorship of terrorism, Tehran was quietly benefitting from everything the Americans were doing against IS. They were non-speaking, arms-length partners in the campaign against the militants in Iraq. US air power, training and hardware directly helped the official Iraqi forces. But the Iranian-backed Shia militias played their part in a series of campaigns ending in a victory which greatly expanded their presence. The rise and fall of the IS phenomenon in Iraq left Iran's influence there stronger than ever. While the distance between the American and Iranian roles in Syria was even bigger, with Iran on the side of the regime and the US originally backing the rebels, both were fighting IS, and its defeat would ultimately benefit the Assad regime and its Iranian backers. The Americans and their Coalition allies will not be around forever. Iran and its local allies will. Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups The US had little choice but to do what it did. The superpower could not allow itself to be goaded and provoked with impunity. But it had earlier opened the floodgates to Iranian influence through a war that was purely elective, a war of choice and ambition rather than necessity: the invasion of Iraq in 2003, launched on pretexts (Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his support for terrorism) that turned out to be totally spurious. By dismantling the Iraqi state in 2003, the US-led coalition was breaking down the bulwark that had contained Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics. For years, it had been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Now they came home to rule the roost. The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian influence, through the arming, training and directing of the burgeoning Iraqi Shia militias. For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction, Hezbollah. From the outset of the war in Syria in 2011, the regional Sunni powers - the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey - backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule. A north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would split the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it. That is essentially what IS did in 2014, when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity that straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria. Now that Sunni stake through the heart of the Shia crescent has been removed by the military defeat of IS and the failure of the Saudis, Turks and others - all American allies - to bring about regime change in Damascus. It's intriguing to wonder what would have happened had IS halted its advances and provocations after the seizure of Mosul in 2014, toned down its rhetoric, perhaps made some local compromises and accommodations. Just after the fall of Mosul, I asked the Iraqi Kurdistan President, Masoud Barzani, whether he could live with his new neighbours. ""You don't choose your neighbours,"" was his reply. But five weeks later, IS attacked and overran his areas, threatening the Kurdistan capital Irbil, and inflicting genocide on the Yazidis. ""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli. We may never fully understand why IS did it. Perhaps its virulent strain of Salafism just had to keep pushing outwards: ""Remaining and Expanding"". The Islamic State in its original form has been smashed. But for all the reasons that brought it about, IS and everything it represented will still be around in one form or another for a very long time to come.

What now in Syria after IS defeats?,"Civil wars that spread devastation and suffering across a whole country have no real victors. But one war in Syria - that against the Islamic State (IS) group's so-called caliphate - is well on the way to being won. Earlier this weekIS's last urban bastion in eastern Syria, Deir al-Zour, hard up against the Iraqi border, fell to Assad government forces. IS will remain in some form or another as an insurgency and source of ideological inspiration but as a territorial entity or physical caliphate, it is finished. But what of Syria's other war, the uprising against the Assad regime and its efforts - aided by Iran and Russia - to crush the opposition? The current situation on the ground means that forces from the above countries will be in close proximity to United States troops, who are supporting some of the anti-Assad groups. Joshua Landis, a Syria expert and professor at Oklahoma University, summed it up in simple terms. ""Assad has won the Syria war militarily,"" he told me. ""He has defeated the original uprising or revolution. The rebel groups that remain have been pushed to the margins of Syria. ""The international community has all but abandoned them as a lost cause. The rebel militias,"" he argues, ""still have some teeth in defence, but cannot mount a credible offensive against Assad's military."" Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, and another close watcher of Syria, has a slightly more cautious assessment. ""President Assad,"" he notes, ""sits more comfortably in Damascus than at any time since 2011."" But having said that, he argues that ""it would be inaccurate to suggest Assad had won the war. He's simply avoided losing it."" ""The Assad regime has a stated intent to recapture every inch of Syria. If that goal is to ever be met, we're talking years at least,"" he explained. But the crucial take-away from all this is that Syria is entering a new phase of conflict. The territorial defeat of IS, says Charles Lister, ""will throw an awful lot of potential sources of hostility up into the air and nobody really knows right now how they'll land"". What is emerging is a new strategic map with Syria divided into different zones: One controlled by the Assad regime (with the support of Russia and Iran), another controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (an amalgam of Kurdish, Arab and other groups supported by the US), and others run by various elements of the Syrian opposition, backed to varying degrees by Turkey and Jordan. The rise and fall of the Islamic State group What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? Raqqa: IS 'capital' falls to US-backed Syrian forces How much territory have Russia and Syria recaptured from IS? Having helped Assad restore his control over a significant part of the Syrian population, Moscow has also manoeuvred itself into holding the best cards in the putative diplomatic end-game. As Joshua Landis told me, the Astana peace process, led by the Russians, ""is the only one worth anything at the moment. ""The Geneva process, led by the US,"" he notes, ""has been about grandstanding and sticking to talking points that no longer have any relevance on the ground, such as demanding that Assad step aside and that democratic elections be held in Syria. Everyone knows this will not happen."" With the demise of IS, Syria's future will continue to be determined by a variety of external players, fighting out their own strategic battles and seeking local advantage. The four key actors are the US, Russia, Turkey and Iran. The United States Special forces from Western countries, including the US, have supported Kurdish-Arab forces in Syria Its initial half-hearted efforts to galvanise a democratic opposition to defeat the Syrian regime failed dramatically. Its focus has largely been on the defeat of the IS caliphate. But now, Joshua Landis says, Washington must make a decision: ""Will it stay in Northern Syria to defend the gains of the Syrian Democratic Forces that it has armed, trained and propelled to victory in Raqqa and the region north of the Euphrates River?"" The difficulty, as Charles Lister told me, is that ""beyond fighting IS, it is sadly very hard to determine whether the US really has a Syria policy."" And he says that what policy there is is full of contradictions. For example, Washington continues to say Assad must leave and that his days are numbered, and yet the US has ceased all support to anyone opposed to Assad. Turkey Turkish President Erdogan's main concern is with the Kurds If US policy could be said to be in a mess, so too could that of Turkey. Ankara's goal, says Joshua Landis, is to retrench. ""It seriously overreached in Syria,"" he told me, ""almost to the point of destabilising Turkey."" He believes that President Erdogan ""must make sure that theKurdishquestion in Turkey does not lurch toward civil war. He will increasingly normalise relations with Assad in order to contain the independence of Syria's Kurds."" Turkish troops have moved a small way into northern Syria to achieve this goal. Indeed, after posing as a champion of the opposition against the Assad regime, Charles Lister says, that ""at times, Turkey has directly betrayed the opposition groups it had stood by for so long, merely to secure a more favourable position against the Kurdish YPG, which it views as a terrorist organisation. Iran Shia militias, backed by Tehran, have played a prominent role in the campaign against IS In backing the Assad regime (and offering significant support to the Shia-dominated government in Iraq) Tehran has had one clear goal - to secure its hegemony in the northern Middle East: the lands stretching from Lebanon through Syria and Iraq, all the way to Iran's own borders. ""This,"" says Joshua Landis, ""is the new security architecture that Iran has fought so vigorously for and it is within its reach today. This means that Iran can counter-balance Israel. It means that Iran can establish oil pipelines running to the Mediterranean coast, trade routes, highways, and pilgrimage routes."" This, he says, means ""Iran is no longer cut out of the Middle East."" And Tehran has troops to back up its position. Charles Lister notes that Iran ""commands tens of thousands of Shia militiamen inside Syria, which gives Tehran more influence than any other actor, bar none."" Russia Russian troops have been on the ground in Syria Russia, after Iran, is the other great winner from the Syrian conflict, reviving its role in the region, securing important military bases, and making itself a key diplomatic player. It wants to ""solve"" Syria on its terms and with its favoured actors ending up the victors and it seems to be well on the way to achieving this goal. But the growing proximity of Russian and Iranian-backed pro-regime forces and those backed by the US raises the possibility of some dangerous encounters. The US and Russia can agree on the need to defeat IS but on little else. Moscow's ""side"" has the military and diplomatic advantage on the ground. Will the US seek to bolster its position in Syria, perhaps as part of a broader policy to ""roll back"" Iranian influence, as US conservatives are hoping? This may be easier said than done and might require many more resources and boots-on-the-ground than the Trump administration is prepared to put in harm's way.

Woman killed by stolen hit-and-run carTwo stolen Mercedes cars had been spotted by police minutes before the fatal crash.23m23 minutes agoSussex,"The driver of a Ford Fiesta died at the scene and her passenger suffered minor injuries A 70-year-old woman has been killed in a hit-and-run crash with a stolen car which had failed to stop for police moments earlier. The woman was driving a Ford Fiesta on the A24 in Horsham, West Sussex. Another 70-year-old woman, who was a passenger, was injured in the crash at the Farthing Hill roundabout, just before 14:30 GMT on Friday. The driver of the Fiesta died at the scene, police said. A black Mercedes AMG was believed to have been taken during a burglary in Goring-by-Sea, and was seen leaving the services on the A24 along with another stolen car - an A Class Mercedes. Both cars failed to stop for police, and at 14:23 the A Class car crashed into a hedge. The driver ran off and was caught by officers shortly after. The other Mercedes carried on, but was not being followed by police when it crashed with the Fiesta about 10 minutes later, a Sussex Police spokesman said. Officers with dogs, and a police helicopter failed to find the missing driver of the Mercedes, who escaped on foot. Emergency services remained at the scene of the crash into the evening Det Insp Will Rolis said: ""Enquiries are ongoing to identify the driver who ran from the scene after crashing in to the Ford Fiesta. We believe he tried to flag down a lift from near the fatal crash scene minutes later."" An 18-year-old man from Feltham in West London has been arrested on suspicion of burglary.

Tillerson warns against Lebanon proxy warsThe US Secretary of State supports Lebanon's sovereignty after accusations of Saudi interference.7h7 hours agoMiddle East,"Rex Tillerson said the US supported Lebanon's government and right to sovereignty US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has warned other countries against using Lebanon for proxy conflicts, following a crisis triggered by the resignation of its prime minister, Saad Hariri. Iran and its Lebanese ally, the militant Shia group Hezbollah, claim the Saudis detained Mr Hariri and forced his resignation. Mr Tillerson said he had received assurances that Mr Hariri was free. Mr Hariri resigned a week ago while in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. ""There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,"" Mr Tillerson said in a statement. ""The United States strongly supports the sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Lebanon and of its political institutions,"" he added. Mr Tillerson encouraged the prime minister to return to Lebanon and clarify the situation so the government could function, expressing concern about how the crisis might affect the stability of the fragile coalition. Iran and Saudi Arabia: Who's siding with whom Lebanon caught in crosshairs of Saudi-Iran tension Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles The delay in response from America's top diplomat - it took him six days to respond to the crisis - has renewed criticism that the US lacks a strategy for the crucial region. Under the direction of Saudi Arabia's crown prince and heir to the throne Mohammed bin Salman, a new anti-corruption body last week detained 11 of the kingdom's princes, four sitting ministers and dozens of ex-ministers. President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday to say he had ""great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing."" Appearing to contradict the president, not for the first time, Mr Tillerson said on Friday: ""It raises a few concerns until we see more clearly how these particular individuals are dealt with."" Responding to Mr Hariri's resignation, the leader of Hezbollah on Friday accused Saudi Arabia of declaring war on his country. Hassan Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was holding Mr Hariri against his will. He also accused the Saudis of inciting Israel against Lebanon. ""In short, it is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon, but I have to say this is a war on Lebanon,"" Mr Nasrallah said. Mr Hariri said in a TV broadcast from Riyadh on Saturday that he was stepping down because of an unspecified threat to his life. He also attacked Hezbollah and Iran. Mr Nasrallah said it was ""beyond any doubt"" that Mr Hariri had been forced out by the Saudis However, Lebanese President Michel Aoun and other senior politicians have demanded his return, amid suspicions that he is being held by the Saudis under house arrest and forced to do their bidding. Mr Aoun has not accepted Mr Hariri's resignation, and Mr Hariri has not spoken publicly since his resignation announcement. Mr Nasrallah also accused Saudi Arabia of being prepared to pay ""billions"" to Israel for a military strike against Lebanon, describing this as the ""most dangerous thing"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that a new conflict in the region would have ""devastating consequences"". On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron paid an unscheduled visit to Saudi Arabia, to emphasise to Saudi leaders the importance of stability in Lebanon. Mr Hariri (R) was seen meeting the Saudi king on Monday France has historical ties with Lebanon, as its former colonial power before it gained independence during World War Two. Earlier on Thursday,Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies told their citizensin Lebanon to leave the country immediately. The move came after Riyadh accused Iran of ""direct military aggression"", saying it supplied a missile which it says was fired by Hezbollah at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday.

Christmas rail works set to close lines,"Rail passengers are being advised to travel earlier to avoid disruption over the Christmas period, with more than 200 sets of engineering works planned. Routes across London, Kent, East Sussex, Lancashire, Essex and Glasgow are among the lines to be shut. Network Rail, which controls the UK's railways, says 95% of the network will be unaffected and it is the least disruptive time to do this work. Bus replacements are planned but journey times are likely to increase. London Paddington will be closed for four days between Christmas Eve and 27 December with Great Western Railway advising passengers to travel by 23 December ""at the latest"". Between 23 December and 1 January, there will be no Greater Anglia trains between London Liverpool Street and Ingatestone or Billericay. Elsewhere, buses will replace trains between Preston and Lancaster from Christmas Eve until 27 December. Over this period, those travelling between London and Glasgow will also face longer journey times as passengers are advised to go via Edinburgh. Southeastern trains will not be running to London Bridge, Charing Cross or Cannon Street from 23 December to 1 January. Network Rail's chief executive Mark Carne said most of the network is open for ""business as usual"" but some routes will be ""heavily affected"". He strongly advised passengers to plan ahead this Christmas. ""We know that our railway is up to 50% quieter than usual during the festive period, so taking on and delivering these huge transformational schemes at this time of year minimises our impact on passengers.""

MP to submit 'unwanted attention' letters,"Kerry McCarthy will hand over the letters to Labour officials on Monday Labour's Kerry McCarthy is to submit letters to the party which she says show she received ""unwanted attention"" from a fellow MP, the BBC understands. The member for Bristol East claims she was sent ""upsetting"" correspondence from Kelvin Hopkins, the MP for Luton North, over a period of about 20 years. Mr Hopkins 76, said the complaint had caused him ""unbearable"" stress. He iscurrently suspended from the partyin connection with a separate allegation, which he denies. Ms McCarthy, 52, a former shadow environment secretary, will hand the file to Labour party officials on Monday, the BBC has learned. She alleges Mr Hopkins sent her a series of letters and cards commenting on her appearance, including one in which he described having a dream about her. Mr Hopkins said the allegations caused him ""immense personal hurt"" The former Labour frontbencher said she believed Mr Hopkins, who urged her in two of the notes to ""dispose"" of them, knew his actions were wrong. ""I never responded in any way, I never gave him any encouragement in any way, I tried to keep my distance as much as possible,"" she said. ""I absolutely believe he knew this behaviour was unacceptable. It made me feel uncomfortable in his presence and was quite upsetting."" Ms McCarthy says Mr Hopkins told her he dreamt about her in a letter written of House of Commons notepaper In a statement, Mr Hopkins said her complaint had caused him ""immense personal hurt and utter dismay"" from someone he regarded as a friend. ""I cannot understand why a parliamentarian of such experience and standing, who is also such a long-term friend, would not have told me that she was unhappy with any aspect of our friendship rather than going straight to the national press,"" he said. ""At a minimum I would have expected a parliamentary colleague to raise any complaint through normal channels, allowing me due process and a fair chance to defend myself, if necessary.

Tillerson warns against Lebanon proxy wars,"Rex Tillerson said the US supported Lebanon's government and right to sovereignty US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has warned other countries against using Lebanon for proxy conflicts, following a crisis triggered by the resignation of its prime minister, Saad Hariri. Iran and its Lebanese ally, the militant Shia group Hezbollah, claim the Saudis detained Mr Hariri and forced his resignation. Mr Tillerson said he had received assurances that Mr Hariri was free. Mr Hariri resigned a week ago while in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. ""There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,"" Mr Tillerson said in a statement. ""The United States strongly supports the sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Lebanon and of its political institutions,"" he added. Mr Tillerson encouraged the prime minister to return to Lebanon and clarify the situation so the government could function, expressing concern about how the crisis might affect the stability of the fragile coalition. Iran and Saudi Arabia: Who's siding with whom Lebanon caught in crosshairs of Saudi-Iran tension Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles The delay in response from America's top diplomat - it took him six days to respond to the crisis - has renewed criticism that the US lacks a strategy for the crucial region. Under the direction of Saudi Arabia's crown prince and heir to the throne Mohammed bin Salman, a new anti-corruption body last week detained 11 of the kingdom's princes, four sitting ministers and dozens of ex-ministers. President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday to say he had ""great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing."" Appearing to contradict the president, not for the first time, Mr Tillerson said on Friday: ""It raises a few concerns until we see more clearly how these particular individuals are dealt with."" Responding to Mr Hariri's resignation, the leader of Hezbollah on Friday accused Saudi Arabia of declaring war on his country. Hassan Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was holding Mr Hariri against his will. He also accused the Saudis of inciting Israel against Lebanon. ""In short, it is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon, but I have to say this is a war on Lebanon,"" Mr Nasrallah said. Mr Hariri said in a TV broadcast from Riyadh on Saturday that he was stepping down because of an unspecified threat to his life. He also attacked Hezbollah and Iran. Mr Nasrallah said it was ""beyond any doubt"" that Mr Hariri had been forced out by the Saudis However, Lebanese President Michel Aoun and other senior politicians have demanded his return, amid suspicions that he is being held by the Saudis under house arrest and forced to do their bidding. Mr Aoun has not accepted Mr Hariri's resignation, and Mr Hariri has not spoken publicly since his resignation announcement. Mr Nasrallah also accused Saudi Arabia of being prepared to pay ""billions"" to Israel for a military strike against Lebanon, describing this as the ""most dangerous thing"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that a new conflict in the region would have ""devastating consequences"". On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron paid an unscheduled visit to Saudi Arabia, to emphasise to Saudi leaders the importance of stability in Lebanon. Mr Hariri (R) was seen meeting the Saudi king on Monday France has historical ties with Lebanon, as its former colonial power before it gained independence during World War Two. Earlier on Thursday,Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies told their citizensin Lebanon to leave the country immediately. The move came after Riyadh accused Iran of ""direct military aggression"", saying it supplied a missile which it says was fired by Hezbollah at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Iran has dismissed the Saudi allegations as ""false and dangerous"".

Russia: 'Cloud' over White House,"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin Throughout the confusion of Donald Trump's campaign and the chaotic events of his early days in the White House, one controversy has clung to the Trump team like glue: Russia. US intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. It is alleged that Russian hackers stole information linked to the campaign of his rival Hillary Clinton and passed it to Wikileaks so it could be released to undermine her. Congressional committees were set up to investigate the matter and, in March, then-FBI director James Comey confirmed the bureau had its own inquiry. President Trump sacked Mr Comey on 9 May, citing his reason as ""this Russia thing"", in a move that shocked Washington andfuelled claims of a cover-up. However, it did not halt the investigation. On 18 May, the department of justice appointed ex-FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to look into the matter. Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn resigned in February after failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington. In December, he pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his meetings with Mr Kislyak. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling the allegations a ""witch hunt"". It was back in May 2016 that the first reports emerged of hackers targeting the Democratic Party. Over the next two months, the reports suggested US intelligence agencies had traced the breaches back to Russian hackers. In July, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Wikileaks published 20,000 internal emails stolen by the hackers. US intelligence officials said they believed with ""high confidence"" that Russia was behind the operation, but the Trump campaign publicly refused to accept the findings. Instead, at a press conference, Mr Trump caused outrage by inviting Russian hackers to target Hillary Clinton's controversial personal email server, saying: ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"". About the same time the hacking scandal was beginning to unfold, Mr Trump's then campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was accused of accepting millions of dollars in cash for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and US, including dealings with an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives. Subsequently, further allegations were made in Ukraine about secret funds said to have been paid to Mr Manafort, and it has also been claimed that he secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to assist President Putin's political ends. Mr Manafort has denied both allegations. He was found guilty in August 2018 of eight counts of financial fraud and tax evasion crimes. In September 2018, he pleaded guilty to two remaining charges - and agreed to co-operate with the special counsel's investigation in exchange for a reduced jail sentence. This video can not be played Trump praises Putin's leadership In October, the US intelligence community released a unanimous statement formally accusing Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Mr Trump continued to argue against the finding, claiming in a presidential debate that it ""could be Russia, but it could also be China, it could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds"". The same day that the intelligence agencies released their findings, the explosive ""Access Hollywood"" recording emerged of Mr Trump's obscene remarks about women in 2005. An hour later, Wikileaks began dumping thousands more leaked Clinton emails. Mr Trump continued to refuse to acknowledge the consensus that Russia was behind the hack. In December, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security published a report of the US intelligence findings linking Russia to the hack. In response, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and levied new sanctions on Russia. The world awaited Mr Putin's response but he chose not retaliate. Mr Trump, by then the president-elect, sided with the Russian president, tweeting: ""Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"" Mr Putin's decision not to respond in kind struck many as a canny PR move, but reportedly set off suspicions among US intelligence officials that Russia was confident the sanctions would not last. The same month, Mr Trump picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state, arguably the most important job in the cabinet. The biggest hurdle for Mr Tillerson's confirmation? Close ties to Mr Putin. As CEO of the ExxonMobil oil company, Mr Tillerson cultivated a close personal relationship with the Russian leader, leading many to speculate on whether he was fit to serve as America's most senior diplomat. Mr Tillerson wassworn in as secretary of state on 2 February. In January, Buzzfeed published a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, which alleged that Moscow had compromising material on the then-president-elect, making him liable to blackmail. Among the various memos in the dossier was an allegation that Mr Trump had been recorded by Russian security services consorting with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel. Mr Trump dismissed the claims as fake news. CNN revealed that President Obama and President-elect Trump had been briefed on the existence of the dossier by intelligence officials, and Buzzfeed went one further, publishing the entire thing. In February, the most concrete and damaging Russia scandal finally surfaced, months after suspicions were raised among intelligence officials. Michael Flynn quit as national security adviser after 23 days US media reported that Mr Flynn had discussed the potential lifting of Mr Obama's Russia sanctions with the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, before Mr Trump took the reins of government. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy. He resigned as Mr Trump's national security adviser after 23 days on the job, saying he had ""inadvertently briefed the vice-president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador"" late last year. Since leaving the White House, the Pentagon has launched an investigation into whether he failed to disclose payments from Russian and Turkish lobbyists that he was given for speeches and consulting work. Who is Michael Flynn? Attorney General Jeff Sessions was being accused of lying at his confirmation hearing when he said he had had ""no communications with the Russians"" during the election campaign. It later emerged that he too had met Mr Kislyak - at a private meeting in September and as part of a group of ambassadors in July last year. The Alabama senator was one of the most prominent players in Mr Trump's bid to take the White House. But he says his meetings with Mr Kislyak were related to his role as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and had nothing to do with the election campaign. But Mr Sessions recused himself from the FBI investigation into the Russian hacking claims, an investigation he is overseeing. Two months into the Trump presidency, Mr Comey confirmed at a rare open hearing of the House Intelligence Committee that the agency was investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. It is an ""ongoing"" investigation that began in July 2016, he said. Mr Trump's controversial meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Mr Kislyak But on 9 May, Mr Comey was fired. The White House initially said it was over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails. But Mr Trump later said ""this Russia thing"" was a factor. On 10 May, Mr Trump met the Russian ambassador and foreign minister in the Oval Office. He told them firing Mr Comey had eased ""great pressure"",the New York Times reported,external. He also reportedlyshared with them highly-sensitive ""codeword"" materialrelating to terrorism and airline safety, sending more shockwaves through Washington. Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel a week later. In his much anticipated testimony before a Senate panel, Mr Comey said that Mr Trump had asked him to pledge his loyalty, confirming previous media reports about a January meeting between the pair. ""I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,"" Mr Trump said, according to Mr Comey's testimony. James Comey was ""terminated and removed from office"" by President Trump Mr Comey said: ""I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence."" Mr Comey also said Mr Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into Mr Flynn. ""[Trump] said: 'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' I replied only that 'he is a good guy.'"" But Mr Comey did confirm the president's account that he had told Mr Trump the FBI was not investigating him personally. He said he had kept written memos on his meetings and phone calls with the president, fearing Mr Trump might lie. He denied asking for Mr Comey's loyalty, although he added: ""I don't think it would be a bad question to ask."" The White House also denied that Mr Trump had asked for the Flynn inquiry to be dropped. Mr Trump has alsoquestioned the neutrality of Robert Mueller, saying the special counsel's friendship with Mr Comey is ""bothersome"". He has criticised the FBI on numerous occasions and, in one tweet, said the organisation's reputation was ""in tatters"". On9 July came newsof what was thought to be the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and members of President Trump's inner circle. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr, admitted meeting Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on 9 June 2016 at Trump Tower after being told that she had damaging material on Hillary Clinton. But he insisted the lawyer had provided ""no meaningful information"" in a meeting that also included the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Mr Manafort. Mr Trump Jr told the House Intelligence committee he discussed the Trump Tower meeting with his father once it became public in a New York Times report earlier this year, but he refused to provide details of their conversation, citing attorney-client privilege. September saw Facebook reveal it had discovered that politically charged advertising had been targeted at American voters during the 2016 campaign. The social network said it believed this had been paid for by Russians with links to the Kremlin. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said his company would share 3,000 Russia-linked political adverts with US investigators. The adverts did not support a specific candidate, Facebook said, but instead posted inflammatory information on hot topics such as immigration. Rival network Twitter said it had shut down about 200 accounts linked to a Russian misinformation campaign. President Trump responded to Facebook's revelations by saying the site had always been against him. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rejected his comments, saying his company did not take sides. In October 2017, Mr Manafort,who quit as Mr Trump's campaign chairman last August, was charged with conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine. The good news for Mr Trump was that these charges - of which he was later convicted - were not directly linked to the Russia investigation. But the bad news is that Mr Manafort later agreed to co-operate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. Paul Manafort ended up falling prey to the controversy his appointment was intended to stifle Another of his advisers, George Papadopoulos, admitted making false statements to FBI agents about his dealings with an unnamed overseas academic who allegedly informed him that the Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. The charges against Mr Papadopoulos were the first to be brought by Robert Mueller as part of the Russia investigation. Paul Manafort: The man who helped Trump win In December, Michael Flynn admitted making false statements to the FBI about meetings with the Russian ambassador, making him the most senior member of the administration to be indicted. He also revealed he was co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. A statement made by Mr Flynn to prosecutors appeared to implicate a more senior, though unnamed, Trump team official - indicating the direction in which Mr Mueller's investigation may be heading. Numerous US media outlets said the senior official now under the spotlight is Jared Kushner - Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law. Soon after Mr Flynn was charged, the president appeared to suggest that he had known Mr Flynn had lied about meetings with the Russian ambassador, contradicting his own account from the time - and prompting accusations that he obstructed justice. A White House lawyer later said he had written the tweet and that the controversial line had actually been an error.

Briton due in Egypt court on drugs charges,"A British woman held in Egypt on drug smuggling charges has been referred to a criminal court for trial. Laura Plummer, 33, was arrested last month accused of entering the country with 300 Tramadol tablets, a painkiller legal in the UK but not in Egypt. She will remain in custody at a police station in the resort of Hurghada. The shop assistant from Hull told the BBC she had ""no idea"" the painkillers she was carrying were banned in the country. But local police said that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Her lawyers had hoped to apply for bail on Saturday, but a custody hearing was cancelled. Laura Plummer said the prescription pills were for her partner Omar Caboo Ms Plummer's mother, Roberta Synclair, had waited at the courthouse in the Red Sea resort hoping to see her daughter granted bail on Saturday. She told the BBC Ms Plummer was in ""very bad spirits"" when she last saw her a few days ago. ""It's absolutely heart-breaking because your daughter's there and you can't bring her home with you,"" Ms Synclair said. It is unclear when the first hearing for the trial will be. Orla Guerin BBC News, Cairo This is a blow for Laura Plummer and her lawyers. Instead of being granted bail - as they had hoped - she has now been referred to a criminal court. Being sent for trial was always a possibility after the shop assistant was charged with the serious offence of drug smuggling. Police investigating the case have stressed that she had a large quantity of the banned drug Tramadol - about 300 tablets. Laura Plummer insists she had no idea that the painkiller is banned here and that she brought it for her Egyptian boyfriend, who has a bad back. Her lawyers say he has medical certificates which could help her case. This could be the beginning of a lengthy legal process. In Egypt, defendants can be kept in custody for up to two years before a trial. For now she remains in an overcrowded cell at a police station in Hurghada. Drug smuggling can carry the death sentence in Egypt. Tramadol is legal in the UK with a prescription but banned in Egypt, where many are addicted to the opiate. In a phone call from her cell, Ms Plummer told the BBC she was given the tablets by a colleague for her Egyptian partner, Omar Caboo, who she says has back problems. She said the colleague put them in a chemist's bag, which she put in her suitcase. ""I didn't even look in the bag,"" she said. ""I can't tell you how stupid I feel."" Ms Plummer is being held in the Red Sea beach resort of Hurghada Ms Plummer told the BBC her cell in a police station was the size of her bedroom in the UK, but she was having to share it with 25 other women. Her shared cell was claustrophobic, she said, and it was sometimes hard to breathe. Although her fellow prisoners were trying to look after her, none of them spoke English. Her family have said Ms Plummer was ""unrecognisable"" after four weeks in custody in Egypt. Ms Plummer's local MP, Karl Turner, says she has never been in trouble at home. ""She's never had so much as a parking ticket in the UK,"" he said. ""This is a woman who's definitely, clearly, done wrong, but she, in my view, absolutely had no knowledge of what she was doing to be illegal, and we need to be mindful of that.""

"Trump, Putin 'agree to defeat IS in Syria'","Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump had kept the world guessing about whether they would formally meet in Vietnam US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to fight so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria until its defeat. A statement was prepared by experts after the leaders met briefly on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam on Saturday. In total, they had three encounters within 24 hours at the summit. During one conversation, Mr Trump said Mr Putin had denied allegations of meddling in the US 2016 election. Questions over Mr Trump's ties to Moscow have dogged his presidency, with key former aides under investigation for alleged collusion with Russia. The two stood side by side in matching shirts for a group photo on Friday A formal bilateral meeting between the two presidents had been widely expected at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in the port city of Da Nang, but Mr Putin later said scheduling issues had got in the way. The pair met for the first time in July at the G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg. How different are Trump and Putin? Did dinner chat break diplomatic protocol? Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House A statement released by the Kremlin on Saturday said the leaders had ""agreed that the conflict in Syria has no military solution"". They also confirmed their ""determination to defeat Isis [another term for IS]"" and called on all parties to take part in the Geneva peace process. According to Russia's Interfax news agency, they promised to maintain existing Russian-US military channels of communication to prevent ""serious incidents involving the forces of partners combating IS"". Russia has been the Syrian government's main ally in the six-year-long civil war. The US meanwhile has been backing Syrian Arab and Kurdish rebels on the ground, and since 2014 it has led a coalition carrying out air strikes against IS in Syria. The jihadist group has been pushed out of its main strongholds in Syria in recent months by a combination of offensives involving the Syrian army and the Kurdish and Arab coalition. Last month the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared they were in full control of Raqqa, a city that became the headquarters of IS's self-styled ""caliphate"" in 2014.

Iran building base in Syria - claim Mr Trump and President Putin posed side by side for a photo in custom-made blue shirts for the summit on Friday. They also shook hands as leaders sat down for talks on Saturday morning and later exchanged a few words before a ""family photo"" of attendees. The two men were seen chatting as they joined a larger group shot of attendees at the summit Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also met his US counterpart Rex Tillerson earlier the same day, a source from the Russian delegation told Interfax news agency. The Kremlin said the two had co-ordinated the statement on Syria especially for the meeting in Da Nang. Questions over whether the two leaders would formally meet or not were raised after conflicting statements from the White House and the Kremlin on Friday. Trump and Putin's body language analysed.

Who's siding with whom,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (L) and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been regional rivals, but tensions between the two have recently soared. Each has its own powerful allies, and enemies, in the region. Here is where the key players stand: TheÂ Sunni-dominated kingdom isÂ home to the birthplace of Islam and contains the most important sites in the Islamic world. It is one of the world's top oil exporters and among its wealthiest countries.Â Saudi ArabiaÂ fears Iran wants to dominate the Middle East and is opposed to the Shia-led power's growing involvement and influence in the region. Its belligerence towards Iran appears to have been emboldened by US President Donald Trump's equally tough position. The young and increasingly powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin SalmanÂ is waging a long war against Houthi rebels in neighbouring Yemen. The Saudis say the rebels are materially supported by Iran, a claim Tehran denies. Saudi Arabia leads a coalition that has attacked the Houthis in Yemen and blockaded the country Saudi Arabia also backs rebels in Syria and wants to remove its president, Bashar al-Assad, who is a key ally of Iran.Â Saudi Arabia has one of the best-equipped militaries in the region and is among the biggest arms importers in the world. It has an estimated 227,000 troops. Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979, when the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini. The vast majority of Iran's 80m-strong population are Shia Muslims, and the country is the leading Shia power in the region.Â Current leader Ali Khamenei has the final say on major foreign and domestic policy issues. Iran's influence has grown considerably in the past decade, especially after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Iran has supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his fight against opposition groups and the so-called Islamic State (IS).Â Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has been instrumental in advances against Sunni jihadistsÂ in Syria as well as in Iraq. Iran also believes Saudi Arabia is trying to destabilise Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Shia movement Hezbollah is part of theÂ government.Â Iran considers the US its main adversary.Â The IRGC is a major military, political and economic force in Iran Iran is reported to have some of the most advanced missile systems in the region. It has over 534,000 personnel in active service, which includes the regular army and the IRGC. US-Iran relations have been strained to say the least. Key events affecting them have included the CIA-orchestrated overthrow of Iran's prime minister in 1953,Â the Islamic revolution in Iran, and the taking of hostages at the US embassy in Tehran in the 1980s.Â Saudi Arabia, on the other hand,Â has always been a US ally, though relations were strained under Barack Obama's administration, particularly given its engagement policy with Iran.Â President Trump vowed to take a harder line on Iran - and he has, disavowing the landmark nuclear deal Iran signed under the Obama administration. In contrast, the White House and Saudi royals have rolled out the red carpet for each other. The US has long been a key backer of Saudi Arabia Neither Mr Trump nor his administration have criticised radical Islam in the Kingdom in the same way they link Iran to terrorism. Nor are Saudis on the list of foreign nationals on his controversial travel ban. Donald Trump's first trip abroad as president was to the Middle East,Â where he met Saudi and Israeli leaders, who have a common desire to stem Iran's regional influence. Saudi Arabia is the primary destination for US arms sales. Russia is an ally of both Saudi Arabia and Iran, having close economic ties with each. It has also sold advanced weaponry to both countries. Russia appears not to have taken a particular side in the crisis between Tehran and Riyadh, indicating instead that it is ready to act as a mediator. Moscow's involvement in the Middle East goes back to the Cold War times, when the Soviet Union provided arms and training for Syria's military officers. Its influence in Syria and in the region in general subsided after the fall of the Soviet Union but Moscow has striven to increase it of late. Russia's air offensive in the Syrian war helped turn the tide in Bashar al-Assad's favour, and the Iran-backed fighters supporting him. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Syrian and Russian forces have liberated over 90 per cent of the country's territory Turkey has trod a fine line between Iran and Saudi Arabia in the fast-moving military and political developments in the Middle East.Â Ankara has become more involved in regional matters since the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party came to power in 2002.Â Turkey, a Sunni power, has established strong ties with Saudi Arabia over their sectarian kinship and mutual opposition toward the Syrian government. Despite a deep mistrust of Iran, Turkey also recently forged an alliance with it against the growing Kurdish influence in the region, which both countries perceive as a threat.Â Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has also backed Qatar in its row with Saudi Arabia The state of Israel was declared in 1948 with a majority Jewish population but, in the Arab world, only has diplomatic relations with Egypt and Jordan. Iran and Israel are arch-foes. Iran rejects Israel's right to exist and calls for it to be eradicated. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly urged the international community to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and has also called for the annulment of Iran's landmark nuclear deal to curb what he calls its ""aggressive"" policy in the region. He has said there is a level of co-operation with some Arab countries in the region to counter Iran's growing influence. Saudi Arabia has denied reports in Israeli media that a high-level Saudi prince secretly visited Israel for talks in September. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has congratulated Donald Trump for ""boldly confronting Iran's terrorist regime"". Egypt has often played a central role in Middle East politics and has historically had better relations with Saudi Arabia than Iran, particularly after the Islamic revolution. Saudi Arabia also supported the Egyptian army's removal of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. However, there have been occasions of rapprochement between Egypt and Iran, such as when Iran sponsored an Egyptian-Iraqi oil deal after Saudi Aramco halted its oil exports to Egypt in October 2016. Amid recent heightened tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi called for ""avoiding escalation of tension in the region, but not at the expense of the Gulf's security and stability"". ""Gulf national security is Egyptian national security. I have faith in the wise and firm leadership of Saudi Arabia,"" Mr Sisi has said. The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad strongly sides with Iran in its standoff with Saudi Arabia. Iran has traditionally backed the Syrian leadership and has been providing military and personnel support to the Syrian army in its fight against rebels and jihadist groups. Iran sees Mr Assad, a member of the heterodox Shia Alawite sect, as its closest Arab ally. Syria is also the main transit point for Iranian weapons shipments to the Shia group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to back the Syrian government. Correspondents say that due to its training and equipment, the group is now viewed as a fully-fledged army rather than a semi-amateur militia. The Syrian government often accuses Saudi Arabia of adopting subversive policies in the Middle East. Syrian forces have slowly but surely been recapturing territory from IS Lebanon's stance on the Saudi-Iran standoff is mixed. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who announced his resignation from Saudi Arabia a few days ago, has very good relations with the Saudi government and sides with it against Iran. The Lebanese prime minister resigned recently, while on a visit to Saudi Arabia On the other hand, Lebanese Hezbollah is an ally of Iran, which provides it with considerable support. Its leader Hassan Nasrallah has often attacked the Saudi government. The Gulf States of Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait have had friendlier ties with Saudi Arabia than Iran in the past. But Qatari-Saudi ties have suffered since Qatar defied a demand from Saudi Arabia for it to curb ties with Iran earlier this year. Saudi Arabia says it wants Qatar to do more to combat extremism and terrorism After Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain imposed a blockade on Qatar in July, Iran sent five planeloads of food to Qatar to help it over food shortages. In August,Qatar and Iran restored full diplomatic relationswhich had previously been dropped over attacks on two Saudi diplomatic facilities in Iran. Bahrain and Kuwait lean toward Saudi Arabia though. Bahrain's Sunni king and his family hold the main political and military posts there but about 70% of the country is Shia. Bahrain has accused Iran of training ""terrorist cells"" to operate inside the country to overthrow its government. It also accuses the Shia opposition of maintaining links with Iran. The government said in October that ""it is one of the countries most affected by the expansionist policy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards"". Although Kuwait is not imposing a blockade on Qatar, its government has shifted from an earlier stance of siding with Iran, to siding with Saudi Arabia. In February, it called for improving Arab-Iranian relations and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visited for the first time since he was elected in 2013 to discuss Iran-GCC tensions. Kuwait's emir also offered to mediate in talks between Doha and Riyadh Following the Saudi-Qatar crisis, however, Kuwait expelled 15 Iranian diplomats and shut down related military, cultural and trade missions in the country.

What next in Riyadh?,"Saad Hariri said he feared an assassination plot, accusing Iran and Hezbollah of breeding strife A night of long knives and long-range missiles in Riyadh has provoked another seismic shift across a volatile Middle East and nervous uncertainty over what salvos will follow next. Three events that happened suddenly on Saturday in the Saudi capital were not directly linked. But, all told, they pack a powerful punch at a time when Saudi Arabia and its key partners, including the United States, are showing ever greater resolve to confront their arch rival, Iran. The first, and potentially most explosive, salvo for the region was Saad al-Hariri's shock announcement from Riyadh that he was stepping down as Lebanon's prime minister. Informed observers say he was summoned from Beirut, then ""sacked"" by his Saudi allies. ""It wasn't his own language,"" was how an Arab government minister described Mr Hariri's televised address to me. Lebanon PM quits, fearing for own life Looking visibly distressed, Hariri spoke of fears for his life in his own country. He pointed an accusing finger at Iran for spreading ""disorder and destruction"". And he charged that its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, a major Shia militia and powerful political force, with building a ""state within a state"". ""Saudi Arabia launched a 'fire-and forget-missile,'"" said Yezid Sayigh, a senior associate at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. Its main target was not Lebanon but what Riyadh and its allies view as Tehran's deeply destabilising actions across the region. The political projectile jolted Lebanon first. A finely balanced government of national unity, which includes Hezbollah and Hariri's Sunni faction, collapsed. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah accused Saudi Arabia of forcing Mr Hariri to step down Hours after Mr Hariri's declaration, a real long-range missile fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels was intercepted near Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport. It heightened pronounced Saudi fears of what it sees as Iran's reach to its border, and now beyond. Saudis 'intercept missile' near capital ""That missile is just the beginning,"" insisted Ali Shihabi, executive director of the Arabia Foundation, who shared his views with me in the margins of a forum in the United Arab Emirates last weekend. ""If this situation is left as it is for another five years, there'll be 40,000 missiles to hit Riyadh."" As a political buzz sizzled across the region and far beyond on Saturday night, a third astonishing bombshell dropped just as midnight approached: dozens of princes, billionaires, and former ministers were rounded up, and some sacked, in a spectacular anti-corruption purge. Saudi princes held in 'corruption' purge It was the boldest signal yet of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's drive to consolidate his control over a new course for the kingdom at home and abroad. ""It was a message that no one is above the law, or more precisely above his law,"" said one senior Arab official in the region as he explained the lightening sweep by the 32-year-old future king. A meeting between Mr Hariri and Ali Akbar Velayati (C) reportedly angered Saudi Arabia Saudi sources said Riyadh had grown increasingly impatient with Saad Hariri over the past year as he struggled to contain Hezbollah's sway over Lebanon's fragile unity government. Last year's hard-fought deal on the creation of a 30-member cabinet had broken years of political deadlock. It was meant to help ease tensions magnified by the war in neighbouring Syria where Iran and Saudi Arabia, and their allies, back opposing sides. ""By his actions, Hariri created a veneer of respectability for a state which in reality is captured by Hezbollah,"" said Ali Shihabi. The final straw appears to have been Mr Hariri's meeting in Beirut on Friday with Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Lebanese and Iranian media highlighted Mr Velayati's praise for the ""great success"" of the Lebanon's coalition government. Shortly afterwards, according to accounts by Hariri's close aides, he was a harried man in a hurry. ""He told us to cancel his appointments on Friday and Saturday and then he left,"" one of them said. There's been intense speculation since then as to whether Hariri, who holds Lebanese and Saudi citizenship, has also been caught up in the anti-corruption purge. Mr Hariri met Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Monday, a day after announcing his resignation The big question now is: ""What next?"" ""Saudi Arabia has started something in Lebanon but it doesn't control all the levers of power there,"" said Yezid Sayigh. One Western diplomat with long experience in the region highlighted possible next moves: withdrawal of major Saudi bank deposits; trade embargo; action by the Lebanese military, which the US and UK has long helped train and build in an effort to provide a national counterweight to Hezbollah's military might. Just last month, the US House of Representatives endorsed the imposition of new sanctions against Hezbollah as part of the Trump administration's drive to exert greater pressure on Iran. The measures, which have yet to become law, include a resolution urging the European Union to designate Hezbollah's political wing, and not just its military wing, as a terrorist organisation. Hezbollah is fighting in Syria's civil war alongside President Bashar al-Assad's forces Eyes too are on Israel, which shares Riyadh and Washington's fixation with Tehran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was on an official visit to London last week, immediately called it a ""wake-up call for the international community to take action against Iran's aggression that is trying to turn Syria into Lebanon 2."" Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, seeking to calm nerves in a shaky Lebanon, urged ""patience and calm"" after what he described as a Saudi decision ""imposed"" on Hariri. From Iran also came accusations of plots to create tensions in the region. As always in a volatile neighbourhood beset by all too many crises, the greatest worry is not just the risk of war, but an accidental tumbling toward a confrontation. ""Hezbollah knows its red lines, and every Israeli general will caution against military action,"" said Jean-Marie Guenhenno of the International Crisis Group. But, he added: ""You can't be sure what politicians will do."" Lebanon's president said he was waiting to hear from Mr Hariri on his return to Beirut For now, every move is being watched carefully after this sudden crescendo. ""The crown prince should have postponed the arrests inside Saudi Arabia once the Lebanon crisis blew up,"" commented an Arab government minister. ""There are too many balls in the air now."" Others disagree. ""Better to do it all in one night and then it's done with,"" said a Saudi observer. ""There's just been a constant drip, drip, drip."" And, like the events of that decisive day last week, they all add up to something much bigger.

TPP deal moves forward without USLeaders from 11 Asia-Pacific nations say they have agreed a new framework.1han hour agoUS & Canada,"The meeting was held during the Apec summit in Da Nang, Vietnam Members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have agreed a new framework to revive the proposed trade deal, following the US withdrawal earlier this year. Meeting on the sidelines of the Apec summit in Vietnam, the remaining eleven nations released a joint statement saying they were committed to free and open trade. Canada had been accused of stalling. However its trade minister said good progress has now been made. FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne also denied that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had deliberately skipped a leaders' meeting on the TPP on Friday and blamed his no-show on a scheduling mix-up. ""There was never an intention not to show up at any meeting,"" he said. What is the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Mr Trudeau said earlier in the week that Canada would not be rushed into a renewed TPP deal. The country's delegation said labour and environmental rights would be crucial pillars of a new agreement, but added that a lot of work still needs to be done. Canadian officials said Canada was not the only country that wanted more time to work through the agreement. The other countries working towards an agreement are Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Brunei, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam. PresidentDonald Trump withdrew the US from the original 12-nation TPP agreementin January. The bid to revive the TPP, which would have covered 40% of the global economy, was led by trade ministers from Japan, Australia and New Zealand. By Jonathan Head, BBC South-East Asia correspondent When President Trump abandoned the TPP it was widely expected that the deal would collapse. It had originally been championed by President Obama, partly as a way of maintaining US influence in the Asia-Pacific region, and the US economy was bigger than that all of the other members combined. The remaining countries are now having to renegotiate the terms of the deal, as access to the huge US market was the prize that persuaded less developed countries, including Vietnam and Peru, to sign up to tough conditions on issues such as labour rights and protection of intellectual property. Canada remains concerned that commitments made could affect any renegotiation of the huge North American Free Trade Agreement, which may be needed if President Trump keeps up his threats to pull out of that deal as well. But the 11 TPP members now say they have enough agreement on what they call the core elements of the trade pact to move ahead, although it is still not clear when it will be finalised.

"MP to submit 'unwanted attention' lettersKerry McCarthy claims she received ""upsetting"" correspondence from fellow Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins.7h7 hours agoBristol","Kerry McCarthy will hand over the letters to Labour officials on Monday Labour's Kerry McCarthy is to submit letters to the party which she says show she received ""unwanted attention"" from a fellow MP, the BBC understands. The member for Bristol East claims she was sent ""upsetting"" correspondence from Kelvin Hopkins, the MP for Luton North, over a period of about 20 years. Mr Hopkins 76, said the complaint had caused him ""unbearable"" stress. He iscurrently suspended from the partyin connection with a separate allegation, which he denies. Ms McCarthy, 52, a former shadow environment secretary, will hand the file to Labour party officials on Monday, the BBC has learned. She alleges Mr Hopkins sent her a series of letters and cards commenting on her appearance, including one in which he described having a dream about her. Mr Hopkins said the allegations caused him ""immense personal hurt"" The former Labour frontbencher said she believed Mr Hopkins, who urged her in two of the notes to ""dispose"" of them, knew his actions were wrong. ""I never responded in any way, I never gave him any encouragement in any way, I tried to keep my distance as much as possible,"" she said. ""I absolutely believe he knew this behaviour was unacceptable. It made me feel uncomfortable in his presence and was quite upsetting."" Ms McCarthy says Mr Hopkins told her he dreamt about her in a letter written of House of Commons notepaper In a statement, Mr Hopkins said her complaint had caused him ""immense personal hurt and utter dismay"" from someone he regarded as a friend. ""I cannot understand why a parliamentarian of such experience and standing, who is also such a long-term friend, would not have told me that she was unhappy with any aspect of our friendship rather than going straight to the national press,"" he said. ""At a minimum I would have expected a parliamentary colleague to raise any complaint through normal channels, allowing me due process and a fair chance to defend myself, if necessary. ""I do ask, on my behalf and on behalf of all other individuals and their families dealing with allegations, that these matters are dealt with by proper due process and not by unfair, humiliating one-sided trial by media. ""I am a 76-year old man and the stress this has caused me and my family is unbearable."" The note Kerry McCarthy says she was sent in the run up to the 1997 general election The MPs first met when Ms McCarthy was in her late 20s and they were both involved in Labour politics in Luton. After a lunch in 1994, the purpose of which she believed was to discuss politics she said, he sent her a card saying he had invited her ""because you are attractive, intelligent and charming"". More notes and cards followed over the next three years, she claimed, but they then stopped until her 50th birthday. A final letter, sent some time in 2015/16, said Mr Hopkins had a dream about Ms McCarthy and she remained a ""very attractive woman"". She said she decided to go public after the ""bravery"" of a young activist, Ava Etemadzadeh, who complained last week about the behaviour of Mr Hopkins.

"UK must provide Brexit clarity - BarnierThe EU says Britain has two weeks to say what it will pay when it leaves the bloc, among other issues.15h15 hours agoUK PoliticsComments","The UK has two weeks to clarify key issues or make concessions if progress is to be made in Brexit talks, the bloc's chief negotiator has said. Michel Barnier was speaking after meeting the Brexit secretary for talks on citizens' rights, the Irish border, and the UK's ""divorce bill"". David Davis said it was time for both sides ""to work to find solutions"". Before the talks, Theresa May said she wanted the UK's exit date set in law, and warned MPs not to block Brexit. Davis stands firm on Irish border issue May warns rebels as Brexit timing set out Brexit: All you need to know Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Mr Barnier suggested Britain would have to clarify its position in the next fortnight on what it would pay to settle its obligations to the EU if the talks were to have achieved ""sufficient progress"" ahead of December's European Council meeting. ""It is just a matter of settling accounts as in any separation,"" Mr Barnier said. Mr Barnier also said both sides had to work towards an ""objective interpretation"" of Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge that no member of the EU would lose out financially as a result of the Brexit vote. The Brexit secretary insisted good progress was being made across the board, and that the negotiations had narrowed to a ""few outstanding, albeit important, issues"". This video can not be played David Davis says there cannot be a new border within the UK Mr Davis and Mr Barnier agreed there had been progress on the issue of settled status for EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. Mr Barnier said the UK had provided ""useful clarifications"" on guaranteeing rights, although more work needed to be done on some points including rights of families and exporting welfare payments. For the UK's part, Mr Davis said, the government had ""listened carefully"" to concerns and that there would be a ""streamlined and straightforward"" process for EU nationals to obtain settled status. ButMr Davis rejected a suggestion that Northern Ireland could remain within the European customs union. He was responding to a European Commission paper, which proposed that Northern Ireland may have to remain a member of the EU's single market or customs union, if a so-called ""hard border"" with the Irish Republic is to be avoided. Reality Check: Where are we really with Brexit? Brexit is 'getting dramatic', says EU Saying there had been ""frank discussions"" with Mr Barnier and his negotiators on the issue of the Irish border, Mr Davis insisted there could be ""no new border"" inside the UK.

""We recognise the need for specific solutions for the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland.  But let me be clear - this cannot amount to creating a new border inside our United Kingdom,"" he added. Mr Barnier said the ""unique situation"" on the island of Ireland required ""technical and regulatory solutions necessary to prevent a hard border"". By Adam Fleming, BBC Europe correspondent Michel Barnier usually says at post-negotiation press conferences that the clock is ticking. He didn't this time: he gave a specific timeframe. He wants the UK to provide more clarity in the next two weeks on its positions on the rights of EU citizens who wish to remain after Brexit, the plans for the Irish border and principles for calculating Britain's financial obligations. Although the EU doesn't want a precise figure, it wants the UK to clarify what it's willing to pay to live up to the financial commitments made as a member. On Ireland, both sides have pledged to protect the peace process but the EU has suggested that might require Northern Ireland sticking to European rules on customs and the single market - rules that the rest of Britain might not follow in future. David Davis rejected that. UK sources agree it looks like they've been set a deadline but they feel it is a logical reading of the EU's timetable, under which their officials have to begin preparations for the next summit of EU leaders in December fairly soon.

TPP deal moves forward without US,"The meeting was held during the Apec summit in Da Nang, Vietnam Members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have agreed a new framework to revive the proposed trade deal, following the US withdrawal earlier this year. Meeting on the sidelines of the Apec summit in Vietnam, the remaining eleven nations released a joint statement saying they were committed to free and open trade. Canada had been accused of stalling. However its trade minister said good progress has now been made. FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne also denied that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had deliberately skipped a leaders' meeting on the TPP on Friday and blamed his no-show on a scheduling mix-up. ""There was never an intention not to show up at any meeting,"" he said. What is the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Mr Trudeau said earlier in the week that Canada would not be rushed into a renewed TPP deal. The country's delegation said labour and environmental rights would be crucial pillars of a new agreement, but added that a lot of work still needs to be done. Canadian officials said Canada was not the only country that wanted more time to work through the agreement. The other countries working towards an agreement are Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Brunei, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam. PresidentDonald Trump withdrew the US from the original 12-nation TPP agreementin January. The bid to revive the TPP, which would have covered 40% of the global economy, was led by trade ministers from Japan, Australia and New Zealand. By Jonathan Head, BBC South-East Asia correspondent When President Trump abandoned the TPP it was widely expected that the deal would collapse. It had originally been championed by President Obama, partly as a way of maintaining US influence in the Asia-Pacific region, and the US economy was bigger than that all of the other members combined. The remaining countries are now having to renegotiate the terms of the deal, as access to the huge US market was the prize that persuaded less developed countries, including Vietnam and Peru, to sign up to tough conditions on issues such as labour rights and protection of intellectual property. Canada remains concerned that commitments made could affect any renegotiation of the huge North American Free Trade Agreement, which may be needed if President Trump keeps up his threats to pull out of that deal as well. But the 11 TPP members now say they have enough agreement on what they call the core elements of the trade pact to move ahead, although it is still not clear when it will be finalised.

Lebanon caught in Mideast tension,"There is heightened anxiety in Lebanon after the prime minister's resignation The Middle East is entering what many analysts see as a dangerous new phase. With the Islamic State group on the brink of defeat, the long-simmering rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran threatens to boil over, with Lebanon in the crosshairs. It was a resignation like no other and it is still sending shockwaves through the region. The Lebanese Prime Minister,Saad Hariri, unexpectedly quit last weekend. He made his announcement not from Lebanon but in Saudi Arabia, the country that acts as his political backer. Many Lebanese believe he was pushed into the decision by Riyadh. It is still not clear when, or if, Mr Hariri will return home. The spectacle of the missing prime minister is being seen as part of the wider regional struggle between Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia and Shia-dominated Iran. Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles Profile: Lebanon's Hezbollah Lebanon country profile For now, Lebanon is uncomfortably centre stage - it is after all where proxy wars have been fought in the past. Iran backs the Shia movement Hezbollah here. Its supporters believe Mr Hariri's resignation was orchestrated by the Saudis in order to weaken their influence in the country. Hezbollah has been accused of operating a ""state within a state"". Its armed wing is more powerful than the Lebanese army and it leads a bloc which dominates the cabinet. Hezbollah operates a powerful armed wing On Thursday, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies further ratcheted up the pressure by urging their citizens to leave Lebanon, sending a clear signal of a toughening up of its policy towards the country. ""The Americans, the Saudis, the Israelis are all trying to prevent Hezbollah from maximising its gains from the wars in Syria and Iraq,"" says Hassan Ileik, an editor at the pro-Hezbollah newspaper, Al Akhbar. ""What is happening in Yemen is also related to the Lebanon situation. Hezbollah and its allies have achieved enormous success. But they're now facing huge pressure because of this."" Saudi Arabia has accused Hezbollah of firing an Iranian-made missile at it from Yemen, where Riyadh says Iran is also equipping Shia rebels it is leading a long war against. Iran denies the claim. Basem Shabb is a Lebanese parliamentarian from Mr Hariri's political bloc. He says that the influence of Iran and its allies need to be checked. ""As the situation in Syria comes to an end the regime has the upper hand,"" he says. ""Iran and Hezbollah are seeking dividends in Lebanon for the role they played in Syria."" This video can not be played Saudi Arabia accuses Hezbollah of firing a missile at Riyadh from Yemen ""Because this has a regional dimension the solution is not going to come from within Lebanon. The more powerful actors who are interested in stability will need to intervene with the local players to help us maintain stability."" Meddling in Lebanon's affairs by great powers is nothing new. But the fear is a misstep now could trigger something far graver. ""In the last few decades, we've never been so close to the precipice,"" warns Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center think-tank. ""The threat of a regional war has never been this real where a conflict would involve a variety of different countries."" And that is why what happens in Lebanon matters to us all. The so-called Islamic State group is all but defeated. What is happening now though - the growing rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran - could be even more dangerous for the region and beyond.

A night of long knives and missiles,"Saad Hariri said he feared an assassination plot, accusing Iran and Hezbollah of breeding strife A night of long knives and long-range missiles in Riyadh has provoked another seismic shift across a volatile Middle East and nervous uncertainty over what salvos will follow next. Three events that happened suddenly on Saturday in the Saudi capital were not directly linked. But, all told, they pack a powerful punch at a time when Saudi Arabia and its key partners, including the United States, are showing ever greater resolve to confront their arch rival, Iran. The first, and potentially most explosive, salvo for the region was Saad al-Hariri's shock announcement from Riyadh that he was stepping down as Lebanon's prime minister. Informed observers say he was summoned from Beirut, then ""sacked"" by his Saudi allies. ""It wasn't his own language,"" was how an Arab government minister described Mr Hariri's televised address to me. Lebanon PM quits, fearing for own life Looking visibly distressed, Hariri spoke of fears for his life in his own country. He pointed an accusing finger at Iran for spreading ""disorder and destruction"". And he charged that its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, a major Shia militia and powerful political force, with building a ""state within a state"". ""Saudi Arabia launched a 'fire-and forget-missile,'"" said Yezid Sayigh, a senior associate at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. Its main target was not Lebanon but what Riyadh and its allies view as Tehran's deeply destabilising actions across the region. The political projectile jolted Lebanon first. A finely balanced government of national unity, which includes Hezbollah and Hariri's Sunni faction, collapsed. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah accused Saudi Arabia of forcing Mr Hariri to step down Hours after Mr Hariri's declaration, a real long-range missile fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels was intercepted near Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport. It heightened pronounced Saudi fears of what it sees as Iran's reach to its border, and now beyond. Saudis 'intercept missile' near capital ""That missile is just the beginning,"" insisted Ali Shihabi, executive director of the Arabia Foundation, who shared his views with me in the margins of a forum in the United Arab Emirates last weekend. ""If this situation is left as it is for another five years, there'll be 40,000 missiles to hit Riyadh."" As a political buzz sizzled across the region and far beyond on Saturday night, a third astonishing bombshell dropped just as midnight approached: dozens of princes, billionaires, and former ministers were rounded up, and some sacked, in a spectacular anti-corruption purge. Saudi princes held in 'corruption' purge It was the boldest signal yet of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's drive to consolidate his control over a new course for the kingdom at home and abroad. ""It was a message that no one is above the law, or more precisely above his law,"" said one senior Arab official in the region as he explained the lightening sweep by the 32-year-old future king. A meeting between Mr Hariri and Ali Akbar Velayati (C) reportedly angered Saudi Arabia Saudi sources said Riyadh had grown increasingly impatient with Saad Hariri over the past year as he struggled to contain Hezbollah's sway over Lebanon's fragile unity government. Last year's hard-fought deal on the creation of a 30-member cabinet had broken years of political deadlock. It was meant to help ease tensions magnified by the war in neighbouring Syria where Iran and Saudi Arabia, and their allies, back opposing sides. ""By his actions, Hariri created a veneer of respectability for a state which in reality is captured by Hezbollah,"" said Ali Shihabi. The final straw appears to have been Mr Hariri's meeting in Beirut on Friday with Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Lebanese and Iranian media highlighted Mr Velayati's praise for the ""great success"" of the Lebanon's coalition government. Shortly afterwards, according to accounts by Hariri's close aides, he was a harried man in a hurry. ""He told us to cancel his appointments on Friday and Saturday and then he left,"" one of them said. There's been intense speculation since then as to whether Hariri, who holds Lebanese and Saudi citizenship, has also been caught up in the anti-corruption purge. Mr Hariri met Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Monday, a day after announcing his resignation The big question now is: ""What next?"" ""Saudi Arabia has started something in Lebanon but it doesn't control all the levers of power there,"" said Yezid Sayigh. One Western diplomat with long experience in the region highlighted possible next moves: withdrawal of major Saudi bank deposits; trade embargo; action by the Lebanese military, which the US and UK has long helped train and build in an effort to provide a national counterweight to Hezbollah's military might. Just last month, the US House of Representatives endorsed the imposition of new sanctions against Hezbollah as part of the Trump administration's drive to exert greater pressure on Iran. The measures, which have yet to become law, include a resolution urging the European Union to designate Hezbollah's political wing, and not just its military wing, as a terrorist organisation. Hezbollah is fighting in Syria's civil war alongside President Bashar al-Assad's forces Eyes too are on Israel, which shares Riyadh and Washington's fixation with Tehran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was on an official visit to London last week, immediately called it a ""wake-up call for the international community to take action against Iran's aggression that is trying to turn Syria into Lebanon 2."" Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, seeking to calm nerves in a shaky Lebanon, urged ""patience and calm"" after what he described as a Saudi decision ""imposed"" on Hariri. From Iran also came accusations of plots to create tensions in the region. As always in a volatile neighbourhood beset by all too many crises, the greatest worry is not just the risk of war, but an accidental tumbling toward a confrontation. ""Hezbollah knows its red lines, and every Israeli general will caution against military action,"" said Jean-Marie Guenhenno of the International Crisis Group. But, he added: ""You can't be sure what politicians will do."" Lebanon's president said he was waiting to hear from Mr Hariri on his return to Beirut For now, every move is being watched carefully after this sudden crescendo. ""The crown prince should have postponed the arrests inside Saudi Arabia once the Lebanon crisis blew up,"" commented an Arab government minister. ""There are too many balls in the air now."" Others disagree. ""Better to do it all in one night and then it's done with,"" said a Saudi observer. ""There's just been a constant drip, drip, drip."" And, like the events of that decisive day last week, they all add up to something much bigger.

Did you know under-fives need vitamins?,"Children between the age of six months and five years should take vitamin A, C and D supplements, government advice says - do you find this surprising? If you do, it seems you're not alone. Researchers in Wales found only 30% of parents and carers said they had ever been given advice by a health professional about giving young children vitamin supplements. And nearly two-thirds (64%) of those asked said they didn't give their children vitamin supplements. The Department for Health (DoH) recommends all children aged six months to five years should be given supplements containing vitamins A, C and D every day. This advice has been in existence since the early 1990s, when it was endorsed by the then committee on medical aspects of food policy. The DoH also says breastfed babies should be given a daily vitamin D supplement from birth. The Welsh researchers wanted to find out how well known this advice was among parents and carers. They surveyed adults accompanying children at paediatric out-patient clinics in two hospitals in Swansea. A total of 101  filled out questionnaires designed to test their knowledge ofthe guidelines.,external The researchers said the most common reasons given by parents for not giving their children vitamin supplements were: They were unaware that they should/had not been advised They thought a healthy diet was enough ""We are concerned that the majority of carers participating in our survey do not follow guidance around vitamin supplementation for their young children,"" the report says. ""Many seem unaware of recommendations, suggesting that health professionals are not providing them with information. ""We feel that action needs to be taken to raise carers' awareness and encourage a much wider use of vitamin supplements in the under-fives, with health professionals adopting a more proactive approach."" Winter vitamin D 'advised for everyone' Dr Bethan McMinn, paediatric registrar at the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, said the complexity of the guidelines could be a barrier for effective information sharing between professionals and parents. She said that while the DoH recommends all children aged six months to five years take a daily supplement, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has recently updated its advice. It now says that all babies from birth to one year should take a daily Vitamin D supplement - but this does not apply for infants having 500ml a day of formula milk. Dr McMinn acknowledges her research is small scale, but says it could well reflect the situation across the UK. ""Our project was conducted in Swansea, Wales so it is difficult to comment on whether our findings reflect the situation across the UK in general. ""However it would not surprise me if this were the case."" Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the Swansea research suggested healthcare professionals were not routinely sharing the information with new parents. ""I suspect in large part this is due to the complex and conditional nature of the guidelines leading to confusion and that we would be likely to see a similar picture in other parts of the country. ""Further research is needed to establish if this is the case and, if so, how to best overcome these challenges so that our children can receive the best possible nutrition."" Prof Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, said: ""All children aged six months to five years should take a supplement containing vitamins A, C and D.
