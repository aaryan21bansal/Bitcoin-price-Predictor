Volunteer firefighter killed by 'freakish' wind,"This video can not be played Residents have taken shelter on beaches to escape the flames Thousands of people have fled to a beach in Victoria, Australia, to escape bushfires racing towards the coast. Locals in Mallacoota described a ""terrifying experience"" of camping on wharves and boarding boats under blood-red skies. Military aircraft and vessels are to be sent to help rescue efforts. Officials confirmed another two people had been killed by fires in New South Wales (NSW), bringing the fire-linked death toll to 12. Authorities say four people are missing in Victoria and another in NSW. The beach town where fires turned day to night The bodies of the latest victims - believed to be a father and son - were found in the NSW town of Corbargo, which was hit by a massive blaze on Tuesday. ""Very tragic set of circumstances,"" said NSW police deputy commissioner Gary Worboys. ""[They were] obviously trying to do their best with the fire as it came through in the early hours of the morning."" Sydney NYE fireworks to go ahead despite protests A visual guide to Australia's bushfire crisis In Mallacoota, the local fire service said a change in wind direction had taken the worst of the fires away from the town. ""I understand there was a public cheer down at the jetty when that was announced,"" said chief officer Steve Warrington. This video can not be played Mallacoota resident David Jeffrey says people were ""terrified for their lives"" More than a dozen ""emergency-level"" blazes span a 500km (310 miles) stretch across two Australian states - from Batemans Bay in New South Wales to Bairnsdale in Victoria. Several holiday spots along the coast have been cut off and the main road in the region - the Princes Highway - has been closed. Victoria's state premier, Daniel Andrews, said navy ships might be called upon to provide food, water and power to the cut-off townships. In Mallacoota, residents fled to the beach or took up shelter in fortified homes when they heard the warning siren go off at 08:00 local time on Tuesday. One woman shared this picture of her young son wearing a mask and life jacket as the family fled on to a boat at Mallacoota ""It should have been daylight but it was black like midnight and we could hear the fire roaring,"" said David Jeffrey, a local business owner. ""We were all terrified for our lives."" ""There's a rock wall that they've built to keep back the sea, and that was where we were going to jump into the water if the radiant heat had hit,"" he added. The fire swept through the town destroying numerous buildings, but was kept back from the shore by the change in wind. Firefighters had gathered at the shore as a last line of defence. Victoria's state emergency commissioner Andrew Crisp told reporters there were ""4,000 people on the beach"". Steve Warrington from the fire service said: ""It is pitch black, it is quite scary... the community right now is under threat but we will hold our line and they will be saved and protected."" Why extreme wildfires are so dangerous How do you fight extreme wildfires? He said there had been ""significant property losses"" across the entire East Gippsland region in the past days. Are you affected by the fires? Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Authorities had urged people in the region - many of them tourists - to stay put because by Monday it was too late and dangerous to evacuate. Residents in the NSW holiday towns of Bermagui and Batemans Bay also fled on Tuesday morning to the waterfront or makeshift evacuation sites near the shore. Residents of Batemans Bay in NSW also headed to the water for safety Locals told the BBC they had ""bunkered in"" as the front approached, raining ash on the beaches. ""It was bloody scary. The sky went red, and ash was flying everywhere,"" said Zoe Simmons in Batemans Bay. Hundreds of massive blazes have destroyed millions of hectares in the eastern states of Australia since September. A ""freakish weather event"" killed a volunteer firefighter on Sunday, according to the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS). He is the third volunteer firefighter to have died. Samuel McPaul, 28, a newlywed, was expecting his first child. Powerful winds near the NSW-Victoria border - generated by the fires - lifted his 10-tonne truck off the ground and flipped it over, the service said. Two other firefighters were also injured and suffered burns. The sacrifices of Australia's firefighters Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? Temperatures exceeded 40C (104F)in every state and territory at the start of the week, with strong winds and lightning strikes bolstering the flames. Meteorologists say a climate system in the Indian Ocean, known as the dipole, is the main driver behind the extreme heat in Australia. But much of Australia is also suffering from a record drought and scientists say climate change has worsened the conditions, making it easier for fires to grow. Lucy Martin, BBC News, Merimbula For many Australians, the final days of 2019 have been a tense and worrying time. The smoke hanging in the sky day after day is a constant reminder of communities on fire. Some are staying inside to avoid the thick, acrid smoke, while others are cancelling holidays or taking long detours to avoid roadblocks. Here in Merimbula, on the NSW coast, the sun has been blotted out, casting a deep orange haze in the sky. People on the street are describing it as apocalyptic. The smoke is now so thick it's almost impossible to drive. The ground is blanketed in ash and supermarkets are packed with people stocking up with supplies. Holidaymakers should be swimming and hiking today, but they're checking into evacuation centres or planning escape routes. Have you been told to evacuate?

Nissan's ex-head Ghosn in surprise Lebanon arrival,"It remains unclear how Mr Ghosn managed to leave Japan, where he was awaiting trial Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has travelled to Lebanon after fleeing Japan, where he faces a trial over allegations of financial misconduct. In a statement, Mr Ghosn said he had not fled justice but ""escaped injustice and political persecution"". His lawyer said he was ""dumbfounded"" by the news and that he had not recently spoken with his client. It is unclear how the former chief executive officer managed to leave, as he was barred from travelling abroad. Mr Ghosn, who has an estimated net worth of $120m (Â£91m), was one of the most powerful figures in the global car industry until his arrest in November 2018. He denies any wrongdoing. His case has attracted global attention and his months-long detention led to increased scrutiny of Japan's justice system. Carlos Ghosn: The driven 'cost killer' Carlos Ghosn and Japan's 'hostage justice' system Five charts on the scandal The 65-year-old was born in Brazil to parents of Lebanese descent and was raised in Beirut, before travelling to France for further education. He holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese passports. But his lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that Mr Ghosn's legal team was still in possession of his passports. ""I don't even know if we can contact him. I don't know how we will proceed beyond that,"" he said. Lebanon has no extradition agreement with Japan. This house in Beirut belongs to Mr Ghosn. His wife, Carole, was born in the city Mr Ghosn was released on $9m bail in April under strict conditions that barred him from travelling abroad. Mr Ghosn released a short statement after multiple news agencies reported he had travelled to Lebanon. Confirming he had gone to the Middle Eastern country, Mr Ghosn said he would ""no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied. ""I have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution. I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week."" Mr Ghosn has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing since he was first detained.His lawyers have accused the Japanese government of conspiring against him, calling the prosecution's case ""politically motivated"". Mr Ghosn's wife,Carole, told the BBC in Junethat authorities had sought to ""intimidate and humiliate"" the couple. This video can not be played Carole Ghosn called for President Trump's support over her husband's legal battle How he could have left Japan remains unclear. There was video surveillance of his home and he had restricted phone and computer usage. He had to surrender his passports to his lawyer, and had to ask for court permission to travel away from home for more than two nights. According to Japan's Kyodo News agency,the terms of his bail remain unchanged,external. Immigration authorities hold no record of him leaving the country, public broadcaster NHK reports. Analysis by Quentin Sommerville, BBC News, Beirut There's no sign of Carlos Ghosn at his $14m dusty pink mansion in one of Beirut's most expensive neighbourhoods. The building, which is subject to a legal dispute, is empty. But the former Nissan boss will have no trouble finding somewhere safe and luxurious to stay in Lebanon. Of Lebanese heritage, Mr Ghosn spent his early years here with family members. He's much celebrated and even appears on one of the country's postage stamps. He is also the co-founder of the IXSIR vineyard here, which boasts wines that are rich and ""of remarkable elegance"". Escaping Japan would have been difficult given that his three passports were taken from him, but Lebanon has less than stringent border controls. Mr Ghosn is said to have arrived by private jet on Sunday evening and someone of his stature would have been able to breeze through immigration. When in town, he is often escorted by the security services. He's been held in Japan for more than a year and in that time Lebanon has changed dramatically. Months of protests against corruption and the political elite have ousted the prime minister, and there's a full-blown economic crisis. Japan gives millions in aid to Lebanon and will want Mr Ghosn returned. He may have successfully fled Japan, but he hasn't escaped his troubles. Once considered a hero in Japan for turning around Nissan - even becoming the subject of a Japanese comic book -Mr Ghosn spent 108 days in custodyafter his arrest in Tokyo in November 2018. Nissansacked him three days after his arrest. Prosecutors allege that he made a multi-million-dollar payment to a Nissan distributor in Oman. Nissan, meanwhile, has filed its own criminal complaint against Mr Ghosn, accusing him of diverting money from the company for his own personal enrichment. He is also accused of underreporting his own salary. Mr Ghosn denies all the charges. Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive who was arrested along with Mr Ghosn, is awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges. He denies conspiring with Mr Ghosn to falsify the former CEO's pay.

Top schools defend rejecting bursary for white boys,"Dulwich College, left, charges Â£14,782 for a term of full boarding and Winchester, right, charges Â£13,903 Two top English private schools have defended their decision not to accept a benefactor's offer of scholarships for disadvantaged white boys. Winchester and Dulwich colleges have declined the offer - reported to be worth over Â£1m - by a former pupil from both, Professor Sir Bryan Thwaites. The schools say they do not want to put ethnic restrictions on who can benefit from financial help. Sir Bryan says he is now looking for state schools to accept his offer. The philanthropist, who is 96 and plans to leave the funds in his will, attended Dulwich until the start of the Second World War, and then went on to Winchester. His parents could not have afforded the fees for him and his brother without the aid of scholarships. Sir Bryan says he wants to help white boys from disadvantaged backgrounds because they perform worse at school than their counterparts from other ethnic groups. Stormzy sending black students to Cambridge Private schools propose 10,000 free places Private schools 'should help children in care' Sir Bryan told theTimes newspaper,externalthat this was why he wanted to make a leading education available to others and believed the institutions were wrong to reject his offer on the basis that it was based on race. He told the Times: ""I have done a lot for both schools over the years and have been closely involved in them. ""All the more, therefore, do I feel that both schools have made a strategic mistake in their interpretation of legislation."" News of the scholarship offer first appeared inan article in the monthly magazine Standpoint by Trevor Phillips,external, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Mr Phillips wrote that ""Sir Bryan wanted to do the right thing by families who need support"" and said that the Equality Act of 2010 was not designed to favour people of colour, but to ensure equality. In August last year, the rapperStormzy announced he would fund two black British studentsto go to the University of Cambridge. Stormzy is helping to fund black students through Cambridge The star said there was ""a whole bunch of academically brilliant, excellent students"" who needed an incentive to aim for top universities. In his single, Crown, Stormzy addressed some of the negative reaction to his decision to offer the scholarships, rapping that it is not ""anti-white, it's pro-black"". Winchester, a boarding school which charges Â£13,903 per term, and Dulwich, which charges Â£7,082 a term for day boys and Â£14,782 for a term of full boarding, are among the most exclusive schools in England. At Dulwich, there are currently 191 pupils from Year 3 to Year 13 who are in receipt of a means-tested bursary, the school said. ""The college's ambition is for 50% of pupils at Dulwich to be in receipt of fee relief through scholarships and, increasingly, means-tested bursaries. This figure is currently 30%,"" it said in a statement. A spokesman for Winchester College said: ""The school, in common with many universities, has outreach schemes aimed at carefully selected and under-represented communities. These schemes operate successfully and are regularly reviewed. Winchester College says it has outreach schemes ""The school will continue to discuss with benefactors the effective delivery of their intentions. ""But the trustees are clear, having consulted widely, that acceptance of a bequest of this nature would neither be in the interests of the school as a charity, nor the specific interests of those it aims to support through its work. ""Notwithstanding legal exceptions to the relevant legislation, the school does not see how discrimination on grounds of a boy's colour could ever be compatible with its values."" Master of Dulwich College, Dr Joe Spence, said: ""We are extremely grateful to the many benefactors who support the College's bursary fund. Their generosity means we are able to offer academically able boys a place at Dulwich College. ""I am, however, resistant to awards made with any ethnic or religious criteria. Bursaries are an engine of social mobility, and they should be available to all who pass our entrance examinations, irrespective of their background."" In England's education system, how you do in GCSE exams shapes your life chances, because they are the gateway to everything that follows. Just 40% of all boys get a strong pass of grade 5 or above in maths and English. That's almost 7 percentage points lower than girls. Poverty in childhood is the other strong influence, when measured by children who are entitled to free school meals. Only around a third of these poorer children from white British backgrounds pass their maths and English GCSEs. Combine gender and poverty, and poor white boys have long been recognised as the left-behind pupils of the education system. So what would make a difference?  Evidence from England and abroad suggest it's the quality of teaching which has the greatest impact. Yet secondary schools in disadvantaged areas find it harder to recruit and keep highly qualified teachers, making it more likely that children will have lessons taught by someone who doesn't have a degree in the subject.

New York attacker 'referred to Jews' in journals,"This video can not be played Grafton Thomas emerges from court after being charged The man suspected of stabbing five people at a rabbi's house in New York state on Saturday kept journals which included references to Jews and anti-Semitism, authorities said. Federal prosecutors have filed hate crime charges against Grafton Thomas over the attack. The filing says his journals included drawings of the Star of David. His internet search history also included questions such as ""why did Hitler hate the Jews"", it said. The threat of rising anti-Semitism ""I'm now more aware of being Jewish"" Grafton Thomas's attorney pointed to his client's history of mental health problems, and said there is no evidence the attack was driven by anti-Semitism. There has been an increase in police patrols around Jewish neighbourhoods and synagogues following the attack. The criminal complaint said agents recovered journals from the suspect's home in Greenwood Lake, New York, including comments such as ""why [people] mourned for anti-Semitism when there is Semitic genocide"". It says the 37-year-old also used his phone to search for ""why did Hitler hate the Jews"" on four occasions. The attack took place during a religious celebration inside a rabbi's house ""German Jewish Temples near me"" and ""prominent companies founded by Jews in America"" were also searched, along with other references to ""Nazi culture"" and swastikas. On Saturday, Grafton Thomas accessed an article about an increase in police presence in New York after possible anti-Semitic attacks. He is expected to appear in federal court on Monday to face five counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by attempting to kill with a dangerous weapon and causing injuries. Michael Sussman, Thomas's lawyer, told a press conference on Monday that he had requested a full mental health evaluation. ""We were able this morning to... review scores of papers which frankly show the ramblings of a disturbed individual, but there is no suggestion in any of those ramblings... of an anti-Semitic motive,"" he told reporters. A man brandishing a machete on Saturday attacked a Hanukkah celebration at the rabbi's property in Monsey - an area with a large population of ultra-Orthodox Jews. Rabbi Yisroel Kahan, who was in the house at the time, described the moment the attack began. ""He pushed his way in, slammed the door shut and said 'none of you getting out of here' - something to that effect, nobody's leaving - and pulls out a machete and unsheathes it and starts doing the unthinkable,"" he said. This video can not be played ""We were scared, but we were not surprised"" Thomas was detained soon after and charged with attempted murder. He pleaded not guilty, and is being held in jail with his bail set at $5m (Â£3.8m). State Governor Andrew Cuomo described the attack as ""domestic terrorism"", while President Donald Trump said the attack was ""horrific"". ""We must all come together to fight, confront and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism,"" the president said. On Friday, New York city police's hate crimes unit said it was investigating eight anti-Semitic incidents reported since 13 December. They included a threat by a man who walked into an Orthodox Jewish community organisation's headquarters in Brooklyn and threatened to shoot someone. In another incident a 30-year-old woman reportedly slapped three women in the face. New York city police's hate crimes unit said it was investigating eight anti-Semitic incidents reported since 13 December New York Police Department commissioner Dermot Shea has said hate crimes in New York City are up 22% this year. ""You see a swastika being drawn, you see a brick being thrown through a window, you see a woman walking down the street with her kids and having her wig ripped off,"" he said. In April a gunman killed a woman and wounded three people at a synagogue in San Diego. That attack came exactly six months after the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in US history, when a gunman killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.

"Thunberg's father: 'Greta is happy, but I worry'","This video can not be played Greta Thunberg's father says she is happier since becoming an activist Greta Thunberg's father has said he thought it was ""a bad idea"" for his daughter to take to the ""front line"" of the battle against climate change. Millions of people have been inspired to join the 16-year-old in raising awareness of environmental issues. But Svante Thunberg told the BBC he was ""not supportive"" of his daughter skipping school for the climate strike. Mr Thunberg said Greta was much happier since becoming an activist - but that he worries about the ""hate"" she faces. As part of the same broadcast, guest-edited by Greta forRadio 4's Today programme, Sir David Attenborough told her she had ""woken up the world"" to climate change. She called Sir David on Skype from Stockholm in Sweden, where she lives, and told him how he inspired her activism. This video can not be played When Greta Thunberg met Sir David Attenborough for the first time (via Skype) The broadcaster and naturalist told Greta she had ""achieved things that many of us who have been working on the issue for 20 years have failed to do"". He added that the 16-year-old was the ""only reason"" that climate change became a key topic in the recent UK general election. Bank chief Carney issues climate change warning Thunberg: 'Almost nothing is being done' The Swedish schoolgirl who inspired a generation Greta Thunberg is youngest Time Person of the Year Greta was nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, after spearheading a global movement demanding world leaders take action over climate change. It led toco-ordinated school strikesacross the globe. She is among five high-profile people taking over the Today programme as guest editors during the festive period. The BBC flew presenter Mishal Husain to Sweden to interview the teenager and her father. On the decision to fly, Today editor Sarah Sands said: ""We just did not have time for other means of transport. But we met our cameraman there and the interview between Greta and David Attenborough was conducted by Skype, which felt the right way for the two of them to communicate."" Speaking to Husain as part of the show, Mr Thunberg said his daughter had struggled with depression for ""three or four years"" before she began her school strike. ""She stopped talking... she stopped going to school,"" he said. He added that it was the ""ultimate nightmare for a parent"" when Greta began refusing to eat. To help her get better, Mr Thunberg spent more time with Greta and her younger sister, Beata, at their home in Sweden. Greta's mother, opera singer and former Eurovision Song Contest participant Malena Ernman, cancelled contracts so the whole family could be together. The family also sought help from doctors, Mr Thunberg said. Greta was diagnosed with Asperger's - a form of autism - aged 12,something she has said allows her to ""see things from outside the box"".,external Svante Thunberg and his daughter sailed to a climate summit in New York on zero-carbon yacht Over the next few years they began discussing and researching climate change, with Greta becoming increasingly passionate about tackling the issue. As ""very active"" human rights advocates, Greta accused her parents of being ""huge hypocrites"", Mr Thunberg said. ""Greta said: 'Whose human rights are you standing up for?', since we were not taking this climate issue seriously,"" he explained. He said Greta got ""energy"" from her parents' changes in behaviour to become more environmentally friendly - such as her mother choosing not to travel by aeroplane and her father becoming vegan. Mr Thunberg has also accompanied his daughter on hersailing expeditions to UN climate summitsin New York and Madrid. Greta refuses to travel by air because of its environmental impact. ""I did all these things, I knew they were the right thing to do... but I didn't do it to save the climate, I did it to save my child,"" Mr Thunberg said. ""I have two daughters and to be honest they are all that matter to me. I just want them to be happy,"" he added. Di Caprio: 'Greta is a leader of our time' Jane Fonda: 'I worry about Greta' In pictures: Millions attend global climate strike Mr Thunberg said Greta has ""changed"" and become ""very happy"" as a result of her activism. ""You think she's not ordinary now because she's special, and she's very famous, and all these things. But to me she's now an ordinary child - she can do all the things like other people can,"" he said. ""She dances around, she laughs a lot, we have a lot of fun - and she's in a very good place."" However, since Greta's school strike stunt went viral online, Mr Thunberg said she has faced abuse from people who ""don't want to change"" their lifestyles in order to save the environment. Greta has said previously that people abuse herfor ""my looks, my clothes, my behaviour and my differences"". Her father said he was particularly worried about ""the fake news, all the things that people try to fabricate her - the hate that that generates"". But he added that his daughter deals with the criticism ""incredibly well"". ""Quite frankly, I don't know how she does it, but she laughs most of the time. She finds it hilarious."" This video can not be played Greta at UN climate change talks - one year apart Mr Thunberg said he hoped things would become ""less intense"" for his family in the future and that he thinks Greta ""really wants to go back to school"". He added that as Greta turns 17 soon, she will no longer need to be accompanied on her travels. ""If she needs me there, I'll try to do it,"" he said. ""But I think she'll be, more and more, going to do it by herself which is great.""

Innes had been travelling to his home in France after an evening out with his wife and friends. His family have asked for privacy ""at this difficult time"". ""It is with deep sorrow and great sadness that we have to announce the death of Neil James Innes on 29 December 2019,"" they said in a statement. ""We have lost a beautiful, kind, gentle soul whose music and songs touched the heart of everyone and whose intellect and search for truth inspired us all. ""He died of natural causes quickly without warning and, I think, without pain."" They went on: ""His wife Yvonne and their three sons, Miles, Luke and Barney, and three grandchildren, Max, Issy and Zac, give thanks for his life, for his music and for the joy he gave us all."" Neil Innes (right, in the hat) at a script conference for BBC television show Monty Python's Flying Circus in 1974 The Essex-born star, who was raised in Germany, performed piano, guitar and vocals in The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band - later renamed The Bonzo Dog Band - who had a hit in 1968 with I'm the Urban Spaceman. The track was co-produced by Apollo C. Vermouth - a pseudonym for Sir Paul McCartney. The comic songwriter penned the track Death Cab For Cutie, which was used in The Beatles' 1967 film Magical Mystery Tour, and later inspired the US band of the same name. In the 1990s he was given a writing credit on the Oasis track Whatever, after it was found Noel Gallagher had borrowed portions of his song How Sweet To Be An Idiot. In the 1970s, Innes worked closely with British comedy collective Monty Python, and Palin recalled how during their live shows he would ""bring the house down"" performing the track with a half cut out plastic duck on his head. Innes contributed sketches and songs like Knights of the Round Table and Brave Sir Robin, as well as appearing in their classic films The Holy Grail and Life of Brian. He wrote and performed sketches for their final TV series in 1974 after Cleese temporarily left, and was one of only two non-Pythons to be credited as a writer, alongside The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy author Douglas Adams. A film about Innes called The Seventh Python was made in 2008. (Left to right) Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, Neil Innes, Eric Idle and Terry Jones After the comedy group came to an end, Innes joined fellow Python Eric Idle on a new series, Rutland Weekend Television, which gave birth to their spoof band The Rutles - a pastiche of The Beatles. In the band Innes played Ron Nasty, a character loosely-based on John Lennon. According to Innes's wife Yvonne, he toured with the Fab Four tribute act The Bootleg Beatles last year. (Left to right) Innes' character Ron Nasty, along with Stig O'Hara, Dirk McQuickly and Barry Wom of the fictional band The Rutles Reacting to the news on Monday, screenwriter Charlie Brooker admitted he'd had The Rutles track Cheese and Onions ""stuck in my head for approximately 40 years"". Actor and writer Stephen Fry tweeted that Innes' earlier band ""the Bonzos were everything to me when I was a teenager."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The thing is it all happened very quickly,"" he said. ""The Bonzos lasted for just five years or so and in that time we paid off three managers and had no holidays. Then I dropped into the Python era but that seemed to be over in a flash, too. ""And similarly The Rutles were a brief phase... They were only intended to be a short-term, one-off gag because the timing seemed so right."" He added: ""People were desperate to get the Beatles back together and a guy in America was offering them $20m [Â£15.2m] each for a reunion! It was quite absurd. ""And George Harrison, who by then was closely involved with the Pythons, felt something even sillier needed to be done. He loved every moment of The Rutles.

Search for missing firefighter continues,"Anthony Knott was due home in the early hours of 21 December The search for a missing firefighter has returned to ""a dangerous area"" which flooded around an outdoor swimming pool. Anthony Knott, 33, disappeared during a work night out in Lewes, East Sussex, on 20 December. Officers have carried out a land and water search of the local area involving boats, dogs and drones. Det Insp John Gillings said Sussex Police officers would once again search the area around Pells Pool. He said the public had been ""absolutely fantastic"" but urged people ""not to come down and be involved with any further physical searches"". ""The Pells' floodwater has dropped but it is still a dangerous area and we have got specialist trained search officers down there working in teams,"" he added. He said said officers would also be doing ""CCTV sweeps"" in the hunt for leads and carrying out house-to-house inquiries around The Lamb pub in Fisher Street. This video can not be played Police said a ""slight bounce"" in Mr Knott's walk and his hand rubbing might jog someone's memory Family, friends and concerned members of the public have been searching different locations across Lewes, including fields and outskirts. Phil Michael, an old friend of Mr Knott, said they were ""branching further out"" but the firefighters were ""wading in the Pells again"" where the water was subsiding. He said Mr Knott was a ""really nice bloke who wouldn't hurt a fly"". ""I just feel the urge to keep looking for him. I think he would do the same for me,"" he added. Mr Knott, of Orpington, has not been seen since leaving his colleagues at the pub, for unknown reasons, at about 19:15 GMT. Det Insp Gillings said there was currently no information about where he was going. On Sunday, Sussex Search and Rescue shared images from its searches of the River Ouse, between Lewes and Newhaven, on social media. Allow Twitter content?

Police said the search would continue to focus on ""the vicinity of the Pells which is the direction he was last seen walking when he left the pub"". ""But obviously there is now additional CCTV that shows him heading in a different direction, slightly later on,"" Det Insp Gillings said. Footage shows Mr Knott walking along White Hill at 19:19, before heading back along the road in the opposite direction about 20 minutes later. An earlier image showed him walking up Market Street - towards the pub - at 19:41, 20 minutes after his phone was turned off or the battery died. Mr Knott, who is 5ft 8ins (1.73m) tall, was wearing a black long-sleeved top, dark denim coat, dark jeans and black shoes. East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service crews have previously carried out searches along the River Ouse Det Insp Gillings said: ""Anthony walks on the balls of his feet which makes it looks as though he is bouncing along."" He also said he could be seen rubbing his hands in the newly-released CCTV footage. ""We can see him doing [this] within the pub itself earlier in the evening,"" he added. Mr Knott's partner Lucy Otto previously said of his disappearance: ""This isn't something he would intentionally do. He wouldn't want to stay away.""

Almost 100 police officers reported for speeding,"Police officers who are reported for speeding are subject to a full investigation Almost 100 police officers have been reported for speeding while on duty in the last four years. Figures obtained by the Press Association from Police Scotland show a marked rise in the number of staff investigated after complaints of driving too fast. There were 16 incidents in the financial year 2016-2017, and 23 so far since April for the year 2019-2020. Police Scotland said it expected all staff to uphold the highest standards. The figures relate to complaints and conduct cases held on the Professional Standards Department database which were received between 1 April 2016 and 15 November 2019, when the reported officers were found to be speeding on duty. The force said that when an allegation an officer has committed a criminal offence is received, it is ""assessed, investigated and must be reported to the procurator fiscal at the Criminal Allegations Against the Police Division (CAAPD)"". Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: ""Police Scotland expects all officers and staff to uphold the highest standards of personal and professional integrity, and this extends to their driving both when on and off duty. ""If an officer is reported for his or her standard of driving when on duty, then such matters are reported to Complaints Against the Police Division at Crown Office and not dealt with as a fixed-penalty ticket. ""While off duty, all officers are treated in the same manner as any member of the public would be. ""Only when such matters are fully concluded through the court system will Police Scotland consider any internal misconduct matters and this is done on a case-by-case basis."" Police Scotland said its officers and staff were expected to adhere to a high standard of driving Neil Greig, from motoring campaign organisation, IAM Roadsmart, said the numbers were a good sign the force were taking the issue seriously. He said: ""The public are rightly concerned about incidents of police officers speeding when on duty as they expect the highest standards of behaviour from those who enforce our motoring laws. ""It is reassuring to see how seriously Police Scotland take this and the numbers being caught are a strong reflection of that. ""It can be difficult for the public to know what is and isn't an emergency and most drivers are very supportive of any police presence on our roads. Ultimately Police Scotland need to continue to take a high profile and zero tolerance approach to bad driving by their officers so that public support is not reduced.""

Military service objectors pardoned in S Korea,"One of the world's most heavily fortified borders divides the two Koreas South Korea will grant pardons to 1,879 men who refused to do military service for religious or personal reasons. It comes after a court last year recognised ""conscience or religious beliefs"" as a justifiable reason to turn down military service. All able-bodied men in South Korea are required to serve for up to 24 months by the time they are 28. Conscientious objectors faced 18 months in prison and often struggled to find employment. One objector who is on parole will be exempt from the remaining penalty. All the others have already been freed, and the pardon allows them to correct their criminal records. Rights groups say conscientious objectors face social stigma in Korea - and struggle to find employment after their jail sentence. An ""alternative"" non-military service - lasting three years and taking place in prisons or ""correctional facilities"" - is beingintroduced next year.,external The tiny South Korean island watching the horizon Reality Check: Which countries have military service? Monday's announcement was the third round of special pardons since President Moon Jae-in was elected in 2017. More than 5,000 people were pardoned in total, including 267 who breached election law, and three political and labour activists, the justice ministry said. The government said the move would help convicts return to society. The band BTS are not exempt from national service South Korea shares a tense relationship - and one of the world's most heavily-fortified borders - with North Korea, and conscription is seen as key to the country's defence. Able-bodied Korean men are required to serve in the army for 21 months, the navy for 23 months, or the air force for 24 months. Male conscription has been law for decades, and conscientious objectors have been arrested and subject to punishment. They face 18 months in jail. Earlier this year, it was confirmed that pop group BTSwould not be exempt- despite fans calling for special treatment. South Korea's footballers - including Tottenham forward Son Heung-min - received exemptions afterwinning the Asian Games tournament. N Korea missile launch a 'solemn warning' to South North Korea crisis in 300 words In 2018, a landmark court ruling recognised the need for an alternative service - that did not involve the use of firearms or other weapons - for those with faith-based objections. After the ruling, charges against hundreds of men, mostly Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to serve, were dropped. The government released from prison hundreds of men who were already serving jail time and had exhausted all their appeals. Last week, parliament passed a new law that allows conscientious objectors to do alternative service - but it was criticised by rights groupAmnesty International.,external ""Confining people to work in a prison - and for almost twice as long as the typical military service - does not respect their right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief,"" said Arnold Fang, their east Asia researcher.

Long-Bailey outlines vision for Labour's future,"Rebecca Long Bailey is believed to be favoured by some key figures within Jeremy Corbyn's inner circle Rebecca Long Bailey has confirmed she is considering standing in the contest to be Labour's next leader, pledging to champion ""progressive patriotism"". Writing in the Guardian,external, she blamed Labour'sdecisive election defeaton its ""compromise solution"" on Brexit, as well as a lack of trust among voters. However, the shadow business secretary insisted its policy agenda was popular. She also confirmed she will back shadow education secretary Angela Rayner for the vacant post of deputy leader. Jeremy Corbyn has said he will stand down as leader early next year in the wake of Labour's election defeat earlier this month, where much of the party's traditional Northern strongholds fell to the Conservatives. While the timetable for the contest has yet to been announced, it is expected to begin next month, with a new leader set to be in place by the spring. Labour was defeated for a fourth election in a row and recorded its worst performance, in terms of seats, since 1935. Labour leadership: How wide will the debate be? Defeated Labour MPs call for 'fundamental change' Despite not yet formally declaring her candidacy, Mrs Long Bailey is seen as a frontrunner in the contest to replace Mr Corbyn, with her main rivals expected to include shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy. In her first substantive comments on the election results, the Salford and Eccles MP said Labour's Brexit policy ""satisfied too few"" but defended the party's policies. ""We didn't lose because of our commitment to scrap universal credit, invest in public services or abolish tuition fees,"" she wrote. Mrs Long-Bailey is widely viewed to be the favourite among Corbyn supporters, and frequently defended the party's policies on the airwaves during the election campaign. However, in comments that will be seen as an attempt to differentiate herself from the Labour leader, she called for the party to champion ""progressive patriotism"". ""From ex-miners in Blyth Valley to migrant cleaners in Brixton, from small businesses in Stoke-on-Trent to the self-employed in Salford, we have to unite our communities. ""Britain has a long history of patriotism rooted in working life, built upon unity and pride in the common interests and shared life of everyone. ""To win we must revive this progressive patriotism and solidarity in a form fit for modern Britain."" Mrs Long Bailey also suggested Labour had further to go in giving its members control of the party. ""Our promise to democratise society will ring hollow if we can't even democratise our own party,"" she added. So far, only Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis have officially entered the race to replace Mr Corbyn, though a number of others - including former cabinet minister Yvette Cooper, party chairman Ian Lavery and Sheffield City Region mayor Dan Jarvis - have said they are thinking about standing Labour's dire election performance has prompted a debate about the future direction of the party and how it can return to power. Thornberry enters Labour leadership race Who will be Labour's next leader? Apanel of party figures has been established to ""map out a route back to power"", but defeated MPs have argued any examination of Labour's performance requires ""fundamental change"" at the top of the party. Mr Lewis told the BBC it would be wrong to solely blame Brexit or Jeremy Corbyn's leadership for the scale of the defeat, arguing that working-class support for Labour in northern England and the Midlands had been eroding for decades. He said the party, when it was in power between 1997 and 2010, had failed to do enough to help people in communities affected by de-industrialisation and other major socio-economic changes ""rebuild their lives"". ""We have to work out why we weren't able to connect with people in these heartlands,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""Why couldn't we get our message across to them? ""We know that people under the age of 45 were pretty much pro-Labour but over that age it declined rapidly. That is something we have to look at.""

New tax 'should fund school curriculum changes',"The curriculum will be rolled out from September 2022 for children currently in year 3 and below A tax should be introduced to ensure Welsh schools are properly funded as they introduce a new curriculum, a leading economist has said. Cardiff University's Prof Calvin Jones said the major reforms would fail without a significant cash injection. He said a levy could be applied to council tax, business rates or income tax. The Welsh Government said it is prioritising education within its budgets. Prof Jones, of Cardiff Business School, said the current funding for schools was ""pretty dire"" and another Â£200-Â£250m a year was needed as a minimum to return to the spending levels of a decade ago. Q&A: Wales' new curriculum 'Ambitious' new curriculum unveiled New school curriculum 'gamble' for Wales He suggests a new tax or levy which would raise money specifically for education as schools prepare to introduce the new curriculum from 2022. ""The new curriculum requires much wider areas of learning and it also requires teachers to be more autonomous, to be more flexible and to create more content themselves,"" he said. ""I feel there simply isn't any slack in the system at the moment so to ask teachers to do that job, it's just unfair."" Prof Calvin Jones believes there is no slack in the system ahead of the curriculum coming in The academic also suggests the borrowing powers which are not now being used to pay for an M4 relief road should be deployed to ""kick-start this change in school education in Wales"". Once the new tax was established in two or three years' time it could channel extra cash into schools while paying off the borrowed money over the longer term, he said. Prof Jones put forward the ideas in a report for the Future Generations Commissioner,which also proposed a major overhaul of GCSEs. He said without extra resource the new curriculum would ""fail,"" bringing serious implications for skills and the economy. ""If we don't fund schools properly we're almost certainly locking in a dysfunctional economy for another generation or two generations,"" he added. Rebecca Williams, deputy general secretary of teaching union Ucac, said large scale reform, such as a new curriculum, required a proportional level of investment. ""We're very lucky that we've got a very clear vision of where we're going with the new curriculum, and it's a vision that people are excited about and they're feeling positive about in general and are eager to get to grips with and implement,"" she said. ""But the danger is that if we don't have sufficient investment over the next two or three years, that we won't be able to implement that new and exciting and positive vision."" Ms Williams said that would be a ""terrible shame"" for all involved and could also result in some ""quite chaotic effects"" for schools and stress for staff. The Welsh Government said that the budget for 2020-21 included an extra Â£86m for education. ""We are prioritising education within our existing budgets,"" a spokesperson said. ""To support the roll-out of the new curriculum, we've made the single biggest investment in teachers since devolution - a Â£39m package of professional learning to help raise standards in the classroom.""

""It is with deep sorrow and great sadness that we have to announce the death of Neil James Innes on 29 December 2019,"" they said in a statement. ""We have lost a beautiful, kind, gentle soul whose music and songs touched the heart of everyone and whose intellect and search for truth inspired us all. ""He died of natural causes quickly without warning and, I think, without pain."" They went on: ""His wife Yvonne and their three sons, Miles, Luke and Barney, and three grandchildren, Max, Issy and Zac, give thanks for his life, for his music and for the joy he gave us all."" Neil Innes (right, in the hat) at a script conference for BBC television show Monty Python's Flying Circus in 1974 The Essex-born star, who was raised in Germany, performed piano, guitar and vocals in The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band - later renamed The Bonzo Dog Band - who had a hit in 1968 with I'm the Urban Spaceman. The track was co-produced by Apollo C. Vermouth - a pseudonym for Sir Paul McCartney. The comic songwriter penned the track Death Cab For Cutie, which was used in The Beatles' 1967 film Magical Mystery Tour, and later inspired the US band of the same name. In the 1990s he was given a writing credit on the Oasis track Whatever, after it was found Noel Gallagher had borrowed portions of his song How Sweet To Be An Idiot. In the 1970s, Innes worked closely with British comedy collective Monty Python, and Palin recalled how during their live shows he would ""bring the house down"" performing the track with a half cut out plastic duck on his head. Innes contributed sketches and songs like Knights of the Round Table and Brave Sir Robin, as well as appearing in their classic films The Holy Grail and Life of Brian. He wrote and performed sketches for their final TV series in 1974 after Cleese temporarily left, and was one of only two non-Pythons to be credited as a writer, alongside The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy author Douglas Adams. A film about Innes called The Seventh Python was made in 2008. (Left to right) Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, Neil Innes, Eric Idle and Terry Jones After the comedy group came to an end, Innes joined fellow Python Eric Idle on a new series, Rutland Weekend Television, which gave birth to their spoof band The Rutles - a pastiche of The Beatles. In the band Innes played Ron Nasty, a character loosely-based on John Lennon. According to Innes's wife Yvonne, he toured with the Fab Four tribute act The Bootleg Beatles last year. (Left to right) Innes' character Ron Nasty, along with Stig O'Hara, Dirk McQuickly and Barry Wom of the fictional band The Rutles Reacting to the news on Monday, screenwriter Charlie Brooker admitted he'd had The Rutles track Cheese and Onions ""stuck in my head for approximately 40 years"". Actor and writer Stephen Fry tweeted that Innes' earlier band ""the Bonzos were everything to me when I was a teenager."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The thing is it all happened very quickly,"" he said. ""The Bonzos lasted for just five years or so and in that time we paid off three managers and had no holidays. Then I dropped into the Python era but that seemed to be over in a flash, too. ""And similarly The Rutles were a brief phase... They were only intended to be a short-term, one-off gag because the timing seemed so right."" He added: ""People were desperate to get the Beatles back together and a guy in America was offering them $20m [Â£15.2m] each for a reunion! It was quite absurd. ""And George Harrison, who by then was closely involved with the Pythons, felt something even sillier needed to be done. He loved every moment of The Rutles. The 1996 revival for our Archaeology album was even funnier really."" In the same interview he described joining the other members of Python onstage atConcert for George,external- a 2002 tribute to the late Beatles guitarist and Python collaborator George Harrison, at London's Royal Albert Hall - as ""probably one of the most special evenings of my life.""

Bank chief Carney issues climate change warning,"This video can not be played Mark Carney: ""I would say we're in a climate crisis... action needs to be taken"" The world will face irreversible heating unless firms shift their priorities soon, the outgoing head of the Bank of England has told the BBC. Mark Carney said the financial sector had begun to curb investment in fossil fuels â but far too slowly. He said leading pension fund analysis ""is that if you add up the policies of all of companies out there, they are consistent with warming of 3.7-3.8C"". Mr Carney made the comments in a pre-recordedBBC Radio 4 Today interview. The interview, by presenter Mishal Husain, is one of several items on the programme which are focusing on climate change, on the day the show isguest edited by environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg. Mr Carney added that the rise of almost 4C was ""far above the 1.5 degrees that the people say they want and governments are demandingâ. Scientists say the risks associated with an increase of 4C include a nine metre rise in sea levels,external- affecting up to 760 million people â searing heatwaves and droughts, and serious food supply problems. Mr Carney, who will next year starthis new role as United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance, continued: âThe concern is whether we will spend another decade doing worthy things but not enough... and we will blow through the 1.5C mark very quickly. As a consequence, the climate will stabilise at the much higher level.â Thunberg's father: 'Greta is happy, but I worry' UK banks to face climate stress tests $5bn fund unveiled for climate-friendly shipping Speaking to the Today programme, he re-iterated his warning that unless firms woke up to what he called the climate crisis, many of their assets would become worthless. âIf we were to burn all those oil and gas [reserves], thereâs no way we would meet carbon budget,â he said. âUp to 80% of coal assets will be stranded, [and] up to half of developed oil reserves. âA question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: whatâs your plan? âFour to five years ago, only leading institutions had begun to think about these issues and could report on them. âNow $120tn worth of balance sheets of banks and asset managers are wanting this disclosure [of investments in fossil fuels]. But itâs not moving fast enough.â Climate campaigners Extinction Rebellion question whether the capitalist system can halt climate change. Mr Carney said capitalism had a vital role in raising funding for clean technologies. But he added that it had to be tempered by government-imposed incentives, rules and prohibitions of the most damaging activities. Climate change was what he called a âtragedy of the horizonâ, because the decision-making time horizon of investment managers is between two and 10 years. âIn those horizons there will be more extreme weather events, but by the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious itâs too late to do anything about it,"" he said. âWe look to political leaders to start addressing future problems today.â He told those questioning the consensus on climate change: âWe canât afford on this one to have selective information, spin, misdirectionâ¦ It needs to be absolutely clear because we are all in on it. âTo deliver, there needs to be shared understanding about whatâs necessary. [But] it is reasonable for there to be debates at the margin about where does the role of the state stop - and whatâs the role of markets.â Mr Carney applauded the UK government for hosting next yearâs vital global climate conference in Glasgow. He said success was âvitalâ. Under Mr Carneyâs leadershipthe Bank of England recently launched a âstress testâto determine which firms and sectors would be worst-hit by climate change. The question is how fast financial institutions can change course. Recently, investment bank Goldman Sachs ruled out future finance for oil drilling or exploration in the Arctic. The bank said it would not invest in new thermal coal mines (for power stations) anywhere in the world. It also announced plans to help its clients manage climate impacts by selling weather-related catastrophe bonds. Insurance giant AXA said it would stop insuring any new coal construction projects, and totally phase out existing insurance and investments in coal in the EU, by 2030. Nest, the workplace pension scheme set up by the government, is testing whether it can invest its Climate Aware Fund in firms compatible with a 1.5C warming. Environmentalists applaud the moves but say they donât go remotely far enough. Scientists say nations must cut emissions five-fold to avoid a temperature rise over 1.5C. Meanwhile, the heads of two key environmental bodies have warned that 2020 is the ""last chance"" to bring the world together to tackle climate change to protect communities and nature. Climate change and damage to nature are already having ""dire consequences"", the leaders of government agencies Natural England and the Environment Agency said. In an article on theGreen Alliance website,external, Natural England chairman Tony Juniper and the Environment Agency's Emma Howard Boyd pointed to the recent flooding which saw hundreds evacuated at Fishlake, Doncaster, with some people still out of their homes. And a report in October on the state of nature in the UK found two-fifths (41%) of the country's wildlife species had declined over the past 50 years and 13% of the species tracked were threatened with extinction in England. ""It's clear that 2020 is our last chance to bring the world together to take decisive action on climate change in order to protect our communities and reverse the alarming loss of wildlife we have witnessed in recent years,"" Mr Juniper and Ms Howard Boyd wrote.

Almost 100 police officers reported for speedingA total of 96 Police Scotland officers have been investigated since 2016 for driving too fast while on duty.Scotland,"Police officers who are reported for speeding are subject to a full investigation Almost 100 police officers have been reported for speeding while on duty in the last four years. Figures obtained by the Press Association from Police Scotland show a marked rise in the number of staff investigated after complaints of driving too fast. There were 16 incidents in the financial year 2016-2017, and 23 so far since April for the year 2019-2020. Police Scotland said it expected all staff to uphold the highest standards. The figures relate to complaints and conduct cases held on the Professional Standards Department database which were received between 1 April 2016 and 15 November 2019, when the reported officers were found to be speeding on duty. The force said that when an allegation an officer has committed a criminal offence is received, it is ""assessed, investigated and must be reported to the procurator fiscal at the Criminal Allegations Against the Police Division (CAAPD)"". Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: ""Police Scotland expects all officers and staff to uphold the highest standards of personal and professional integrity, and this extends to their driving both when on and off duty. ""If an officer is reported for his or her standard of driving when on duty, then such matters are reported to Complaints Against the Police Division at Crown Office and not dealt with as a fixed-penalty ticket. ""While off duty, all officers are treated in the same manner as any member of the public would be. ""Only when such matters are fully concluded through the court system will Police Scotland consider any internal misconduct matters and this is done on a case-by-case basis."" Police Scotland said its officers and staff were expected to adhere to a high standard of driving Neil Greig, from motoring campaign organisation, IAM Roadsmart, said the numbers were a good sign the force were taking the issue seriously. He said: ""The public are rightly concerned about incidents of police officers speeding when on duty as they expect the highest standards of behaviour from those who enforce our motoring laws. ""It is reassuring to see how seriously Police Scotland take this and the numbers being caught are a strong reflection of that. ""It can be difficult for the public to know what is and isn't an emergency and most drivers are very supportive of any police presence on our roads. Ultimately Police Scotland need to continue to take a high profile and zero tolerance approach to bad driving by their officers so that public support is not reduced.""

Tesla delivers its first 'Made in China' cars,"Tesla has delivered its first cars made in China, marking a major milestone for the electric vehicle maker. Fifteen Model 3 sedans were handed over at the company's so-called ""Gigafactory"" near Shanghai. It comes as Elon Musk's company aims to secure a significant slice of the world's biggest car market. Tesla's move into the country comes as the trade war has forced other American companies to shift production out of China. During a ceremony at the company's multi-billion dollar plant in Shanghai, 15 of its employees received cars they had purchased. The event means deliveries of cars have starteda little over a year after construction of the factory got underway. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

California-based Tesla said that it wanted to start handing over vehicles before the Lunar New Year beginning on 25 January, and now plans to scale up deliveries from the start of 2020. The Chinese-made Model 3, priced at $50,000 (Â£38,000) before subsidies, will compete with local electric car makers, including NIO and Xpeng Motors, as well as global brands such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Tesla gets the go-ahead to build cars in China Tesla: China suspends customs clearance Tesla to build factory in Shanghai US technology giants Apple, Google, HP, and Dell have all reportedly started the process of moving production from China to other Asian countries. That's as US tariffs on Chinese-made goods make them more expensive when they are imported into America, or companies have to absorb the cost themselves. It also comes after intense pressure from US President Donald Trump for American companies to bring back manufacturing to the US. In August Mr Trump issued a demand for all US firms to move production out of China. However, Tesla doesn't plan to export the cars it makes in China to the US, where they would be hit with tariffs. Instead it wants to sell the cars in China itself. Previously Tesla was exporting all of the cars it sold in China from the US, which meant they were hit with tariffs in China. The company isn't just expanding its manufacturing into China. In November, it revealed plans to build a huge European production facility on the outskirts of Berlin in Germany.

Military service objectors pardoned in S KoreaMen who refused mandatory military service were subjected to prison - and social stigma.Asia,"One of the world's most heavily fortified borders divides the two Koreas South Korea will grant pardons to 1,879 men who refused to do military service for religious or personal reasons. It comes after a court last year recognised ""conscience or religious beliefs"" as a justifiable reason to turn down military service. All able-bodied men in South Korea are required to serve for up to 24 months by the time they are 28. Conscientious objectors faced 18 months in prison and often struggled to find employment. One objector who is on parole will be exempt from the remaining penalty. All the others have already been freed, and the pardon allows them to correct their criminal records. Rights groups say conscientious objectors face social stigma in Korea - and struggle to find employment after their jail sentence. An ""alternative"" non-military service - lasting three years and taking place in prisons or ""correctional facilities"" - is beingintroduced next year.,external The tiny South Korean island watching the horizon Reality Check: Which countries have military service? Monday's announcement was the third round of special pardons since President Moon Jae-in was elected in 2017. More than 5,000 people were pardoned in total, including 267 who breached election law, and three political and labour activists, the justice ministry said. The government said the move would help convicts return to society. The band BTS are not exempt from national service South Korea shares a tense relationship - and one of the world's most heavily-fortified borders - with North Korea, and conscription is seen as key to the country's defence. Able-bodied Korean men are required to serve in the army for 21 months, the navy for 23 months, or the air force for 24 months. Male conscription has been law for decades, and conscientious objectors have been arrested and subject to punishment. They face 18 months in jail. Earlier this year, it was confirmed that pop group BTSwould not be exempt- despite fans calling for special treatment. South Korea's footballers - including Tottenham forward Son Heung-min - received exemptions afterwinning the Asian Games tournament. N Korea missile launch a 'solemn warning' to South North Korea crisis in 300 words In 2018, a landmark court ruling recognised the need for an alternative service - that did not involve the use of firearms or other weapons - for those with faith-based objections. After the ruling, charges against hundreds of men, mostly Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to serve, were dropped. The government released from prison hundreds of men who were already serving jail time and had exhausted all their appeals. Last week, parliament passed a new law that allows conscientious objectors to do alternative service - but it was criticised by rights groupAmnesty International.,external ""Confining people to work in a prison - and for almost twice as long as the typical military service - does not respect their right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief,"" said Arnold Fang, their east Asia researcher.

UK banks face climate stress tests,"Climate change carries huge insurance risks The Bank of England has launched one of the most ambitious attempts to date to quantify the risk that climate change poses to the financial system. Banks and insurers will face climate stress tests in a similar way to the financial stress tests they already do. It is a project that could ultimately result in banks and insurers having to hold more capital to do certain kinds of business. And that could have profound effects on the way the economy is funded. Bank officials told journalists that the value of every asset on the face of the planet will be affected by climate change. Where values change, there is financial risk and the bank wants to measure it - and then manage it. Large banks and insurance groups will be asked to go through their balance sheets almost asset by asset to assess the risks posed by a range of climate scenarios. It's perhaps not intuitive to see how climate change affects financial assets. Imagine that, after years of Australian bush fires, insurers decide that houses in the country are uninsurable. A house that can't be insured is worth a lot less than one that can. The price plummets, to be worth less than the mortgage the owner has taken out. Worries about homes built in flood zones is increasing The bank that offered that mortgage is left nursing a big loss - and so are all the other banks. Hey hey presto, you have an Australian financial crisis. You could find examples closer to home. Banks and insurers already look very closely at houses built in flood-affected areas. If the bank of England decides that it wants them to hold additional capital (effectively financially penalising them for taking that risk) then that insurance and those mortgages will be harder and more expensive to get. Thousands of homes to be built in flood zones Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external The Bank of England recognises there are two types of financial risk posed by climate change. There are physical risks arising from weather related events - floods, droughts, fire, etc. And then there are what it describes as transition risks. Things that happen as a result of adjusting to a low carbon economy - meat becoming more expensive, costs incurred in the mandatory insulation of homes. This is a massive undertaking, and banks and insurers are being consulted on what information is most relevant and how it can best be gathered. The European Banking Authority is considering doing something similar, while the Federal Reserve is expected to be watching closely. The Bank insists that this is not primarily an exercise designed to place additional burdens on financial institutions. However, the Bank of England's most powerful regulatory tool is the rules around how much shock absorbing capital it requires them to hold. Making banks ultimately pay more to finance climate changing behaviour is the kind of powerful stick climate activists have been crying out for. But it is also the kind of thing that could have unexpected and possibly painful transitional effects.

Fund for climate-friendly shipping,"A group of ship owners have announced plans for a $5bn (Â£3.8bn) fund to design zero-emissions vessels. They says $2 (Â£1.50) should be levied on every tonne of ships' fuel - to support research into clean engines. Shipping creates about 3% of the emissions that are over-heating the climate - equivalent to all of Germany's CO2. Environmentalists welcomed the proposal but also described it as too little, too late. They say it's outrageous that international shipping pays no fuel taxes, unlike lorry owners. Green groups argue that if ships were taxed at the same level as lorries, 70 times more cash for developing clean engines would be raised in Europe alone. Around 250m tonnes of fuel a year are burned by ships. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) says that 90% of owners globally are behind the $2 levy on fuel. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external Speed limits for ships can have 'massive' benefits Five things we've learned from Madrid climate talks Guy Platten, secretary-general of the ICS told BBC News: ""I have seen a massive change in the opinion of ships' owners over the past few years. ""They've realised that we've got to do our bit by decarbonising shipping - and that means designing zero-carbon ships. That's why we need the levy. ""At the moment we can't yet see what the best clean fuel would be for ships. But there's a real urgency about solving the problem."" He defended the size of the levy, saying it was small enough to be agreed by ship owners in the developing world, but big enough to make a difference. However, Faig Abbasov from the green group Transport and Environment responded: ""The proposed levy is a tiny amount. It's outrageous that the shipping industry has avoided taking responsibility for its emissions for years - that's why it's facing difficulty now.""Speed limits for ships can have 'massive' benefits Campaigners wanted to slow ships down, but the proposal was rejected ""What's needed is a huge programme to incentivise owners to buy zero-carbon vessels - as well as researching new technologies."" The ICS says its proposal is supported by the owners of 90% of the merchant fleet. It defends its proposed 10-year research fund, which would need to be enforced through by the UN shipping body the International Maritime Organization. The industry has reduced its emissions slightly over recent years, thanks mainly to ships slowing down after the 2008 financial crisis in order to absorb the oversupply in shipping capacity. Campaigners wanted mandatory slow steaming to save emissions, but the IMO rejected that proposal. The IMO does have a target of halving emissions from international shipping by 2050 compared to 2008. But the ICS says ships are so long-lived that zero-carbon vessels must be available as soon as possible. The optimum shipping fuel has not yet been decided. One option is biofuels, but their availability will be globally limited by the need to ensure they're sustainable. Shipping experts assume that the supply will be gobbled up by the wealthy aviation industry, anyway. Other options are ""green"" hydrogen (produced by renewables); ammonia; fuel cells; batteries and synthetic fuels produced from renewables. The ICS says none of these yet exists in a form or scale that can be applied to large transoceanic ships. Even when the industry settles on a technology, massive investment will be needed to ensure the chosen fuel is available in ports round the world. Mr Platten from the ICS says the path ahead is not year clear. And then there remains the obstacle of the IMO, which is bound by the UN's need for consensus. Environmentalists say some nations' delegates appeared intent on staving off action to protect the climate. The IMO said it would consider the levy plan. The EU meanwhile is under pressure to include shipping in the EU emissions trading scheme, in which polluting industries can buy and sell emissions permits. T&E says that would raise â¬24bn a year on current carbon prices. Faig Abbasov complained: ""The shipping industry is totally subsidised. It pays no tax on fuel, no VAT, no corporate tax. ""The EU tax directive specifically bans any member state from taxing ships' fuel. If you travel to the south of France by coach, the firm pays fuel tax. If you go by luxury cruise you don't pay. ""It's time for a major change."" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, made extending the EU emissions trading scheme to maritime transport one of the top political priorities of her tenure.

US attacks Iran-backed militia in Iraq and Syria,"Kataib Hezbollah said its headquarters in the western Iraqi town of al-Qaim was hit The US has conducted air strikes in Iraq and Syria against an Iran-backed Iraqi militia blamed for an attack that killed a US civilian contractor. Weapons caches and command and control centres at five sites associated with Kataib Hezbollah were hit on Sunday, the defence department said. An Iraqi paramilitary force said 25 fighters were killed and 51 injured. The US secretary of state said it would not stand for Iran taking actions that put American lives in jeopardy. Kataib Hezbollah leader Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi, who is also known as Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, warned that ""the blood of the martyrs will not be in vain"". ""Our response will be very tough on the American forces in Iraq,"" he said. The paramilitary Popular Mobilisation said dozens of people were killed or injured Iraq's prime minister denounced the ""violation of Iraqi sovereignty"", while Iran's foreign ministry said the US strikes were a ""clear example of terrorism"". The US contractor died when more than 30 rockets hit an Iraqi military base in the northern city of Kirkuk on Friday. Four US service personnel and two members of the Iraqi security forces were also wounded in the attack. Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman saidUS forces conducted ""precision defensive strikes"" against three Kataib Hezbollah facilities in Iraq and two in Syria,externalthat would degrade its ability to conduct attacks against US-led coalition forces based in Iraq to fight the Islamic State (IS) group. These locations included weapon storage facilities and command and control locations that Kataib Hezbollah used to plan and execute attacks, he added. A spokesman for the Popular Mobilisation, an Iraqi paramilitary force dominated by Iran-backed Shia militias like Kataib Hezbollah, said the US strikes had targeted its Al-Jazira Operations Command facility in the al-Qaim area of Anbar province, as well as fighters from its 45th and 46th brigades. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper told reporters the strikes were ""successful"" and that he had discussed with President Donald Trump ""other options"" to discourage further attacks on US forces. ""I would note also that we will take additional actions as necessary to ensure that we act in our own self-defence and we deter further bad behaviour from militia groups or from Iran,"" he said. Mark Esper said the US was prepared to take further actions to deter attacks by Iranian proxies Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""This wasn't the first set of attacks against this particular Iraqi facility and others where there are American lives at risk. ""What we did was take a decisive response that makes clear what President Trump has said for months and months and months - which is that we will not stand for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take actions that put American men and woman in jeopardy."" Kataib Hezbollah (Brigades of the Party of God) is a powerful Iraqi Shia militia that receives financial and military support from Iran. Since 2009, the US has designated the group as a terrorist organisation and listed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis as a ""global terrorist"", accusing them of threatening the peace and stability of Iraq. The US has designated Kataib Hezbollah a terrorist organisation since 2009 Mr Hoffman said Kataib Hezbollah had a ""strong linkage"" with Iran's Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), and had ""repeatedly received lethal aid and other support from Iran that it has used to attack"" US-led coalition forces in Iraq. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who is also the chief of staff of the Popular Mobilisation, is said to advise Quds Force commander Gen Qasem Soleimani. The Trump administration has previously alleged that the Quds Force is ""Iran's primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting"" US-designated terrorist groups across the Middle East. Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Iran's network of influence in Mid-East 'growing' Iran's influence over Iraq's internal affairs has grown steadily since the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. It has close links to Shia politicians who are part of the ruling elite, and has backed the Popular Mobilisation, which played a key role in defeating IS. Protesters in Iraq have accused Iran of complicity in Iraq's failure and corruption. They have set fire to a number of Iranian consulate buildings in the country during the recent wave of protests. Earlier this month, Mr Pompeo blamed Iranian-backed forces for a series of attacks in Iraq. He warned Iran that any attacks by the country or its proxies that harmed the US or allies would be ""answered with a decisive US response"".

South Korea to pardon conscientious objectors,"One of the world's most heavily fortified borders divides the two Koreas South Korea will grant pardons to 1,879 men who refused to do military service for religious or personal reasons. It comes after a court last year recognised ""conscience or religious beliefs"" as a justifiable reason to turn down military service. All able-bodied men in South Korea are required to serve for up to 24 months by the time they are 28. Conscientious objectors faced 18 months in prison and often struggled to find employment. One objector who is on parole will be exempt from the remaining penalty. All the others have already been freed, and the pardon allows them to correct their criminal records. Rights groups say conscientious objectors face social stigma in Korea - and struggle to find employment after their jail sentence. An ""alternative"" non-military service - lasting three years and taking place in prisons or ""correctional facilities"" - is beingintroduced next year.,external The tiny South Korean island watching the horizon Reality Check: Which countries have military service? Monday's announcement was the third round of special pardons since President Moon Jae-in was elected in 2017. More than 5,000 people were pardoned in total, including 267 who breached election law, and three political and labour activists, the justice ministry said. The government said the move would help convicts return to society. The band BTS are not exempt from national service South Korea shares a tense relationship - and one of the world's most heavily-fortified borders - with North Korea, and conscription is seen as key to the country's defence. Able-bodied Korean men are required to serve in the army for 21 months, the navy for 23 months, or the air force for 24 months. Male conscription has been law for decades, and conscientious objectors have been arrested and subject to punishment. They face 18 months in jail. Earlier this year, it was confirmed that pop group BTSwould not be exempt- despite fans calling for special treatment. South Korea's footballers - including Tottenham forward Son Heung-min - received exemptions afterwinning the Asian Games tournament. N Korea missile launch a 'solemn warning' to South North Korea crisis in 300 words In 2018, a landmark court ruling recognised the need for an alternative service - that did not involve the use of firearms or other weapons - for those with faith-based objections. After the ruling, charges against hundreds of men, mostly Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to serve, were dropped. The government released from prison hundreds of men who were already serving jail time and had exhausted all their appeals. Last week, parliament passed a new law that allows conscientious objectors to do alternative service - but it was criticised by rights groupAmnesty International.,external ""Confining people to work in a prison - and for almost twice as long as the typical military service - does not respect their right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief,"" said Arnold Fang, their east Asia researcher.

"New tax 'should fund school curriculum changes'A leading economist proposes a new levy to make up for ""pretty dire"" funding for schools.Wales","The curriculum will be rolled out from September 2022 for children currently in year 3 and below A tax should be introduced to ensure Welsh schools are properly funded as they introduce a new curriculum, a leading economist has said. Cardiff University's Prof Calvin Jones said the major reforms would fail without a significant cash injection. He said a levy could be applied to council tax, business rates or income tax. The Welsh Government said it is prioritising education within its budgets. Prof Jones, of Cardiff Business School, said the current funding for schools was ""pretty dire"" and another Â£200-Â£250m a year was needed as a minimum to return to the spending levels of a decade ago. Q&A: Wales' new curriculum 'Ambitious' new curriculum unveiled New school curriculum 'gamble' for Wales He suggests a new tax or levy which would raise money specifically for education as schools prepare to introduce the new curriculum from 2022. ""The new curriculum requires much wider areas of learning and it also requires teachers to be more autonomous, to be more flexible and to create more content themselves,"" he said. ""I feel there simply isn't any slack in the system at the moment so to ask teachers to do that job, it's just unfair."" Prof Calvin Jones believes there is no slack in the system ahead of the curriculum coming in The academic also suggests the borrowing powers which are not now being used to pay for an M4 relief road should be deployed to ""kick-start this change in school education in Wales"". Once the new tax was established in two or three years' time it could channel extra cash into schools while paying off the borrowed money over the longer term, he said. Prof Jones put forward the ideas in a report for the Future Generations Commissioner,which also proposed a major overhaul of GCSEs. He said without extra resource the new curriculum would ""fail,"" bringing serious implications for skills and the economy. ""If we don't fund schools properly we're almost certainly locking in a dysfunctional economy for another generation or two generations,"" he added. Rebecca Williams, deputy general secretary of teaching union Ucac, said large scale reform, such as a new curriculum, required a proportional level of investment. ""We're very lucky that we've got a very clear vision of where we're going with the new curriculum, and it's a vision that people are excited about and they're feeling positive about in general and are eager to get to grips with and implement,"" she said. ""But the danger is that if we don't have sufficient investment over the next two or three years, that we won't be able to implement that new and exciting and positive vision."" Ms Williams said that would be a ""terrible shame"" for all involved and could also result in some ""quite chaotic effects"" for schools and stress for staff. The Welsh Government said that the budget for 2020-21 included an extra Â£86m for education. ""We are prioritising education within our existing budgets,"" a spokesperson said. ""To support the roll-out of the new curriculum, we've made the single biggest investment in teachers since devolution - a Â£39m package of professional learning to help raise standards in the classroom.""

Surge in teenagers setting up businesses - study,"Coral Eyewear uses 100% recycled waste plastic and fishing nets The number of teenagers in the UK with their own businesses has gone up 700% in 10 years, research suggests. In 2009 there were 491 businesses run by teens, now there are 4,152, OneFamily found. These include tech companies, clothing lines and make-up brands, the financial services provider said. George Bailey, 19, who runs his own company said: ""I think tech and social media has made it easier for young people to start their own business."" George started his own business, Coral Eyewear, which makes eyewear out of 100% recycled waste plastic and fishing nets. He told Radio 1 Newsbeat: ""At first it started off as a side project. It can be hard to juggle because at first I was running it on my own with my co-founder. But as time has gone on we've got some more people working for us, which makes it easier."" George Bailey is 19 and runs Coral Eyewear As well as running his own business George is studying philosophy, politics and economics at University of East Anglia. ""There are some difficulties... I'm always studying or doing stuff with the business which can be difficult but I have chosen an area I enjoy and it's starting to see it's making an impact."" The university has a entrepreneurial fund where they help young businesses and invested Â£50,000 into his start-up. ""It doesn't surprise me there are more teenagers with businesses,"" George adds. ""In 2019, we've witnessed young people who are passionate about social media and the climate and there are lots of opportunities for young people to put the problems they're voicing into fuelling their technology or sustainable businesses."" According to the research, one in five (19%) teens would much rather be their own boss than work for someone else. George says: ""We can set our own goals, it's great we don't have someone above telling us what to do and we can make sure we're getting everything right from an ethical perspective."" He says there were other sustainable eyewear options out there but they didn't look as good. ""We are trying to make sure we get both style and sustainability."" Allow YouTube content?

Anti-Semitic graffiti on London shops,"A council worker removed the graffiti which someone had covered with a note wishing all people ""Peace and Good Will"" Anti-Semitic graffiti has been daubed on a synagogue and several shops in north London during the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. The Star of David, a Jewish symbol, and ""911"" were spray-painted in Hampstead and Belsize Park, possibly referencing a conspiracy theory. South Hampstead Synagogue was among the premises targeted, with reports made to police from 23:30 GMT on Saturday. Police are treating it as a racially motivated hate crime. The graffiti could reference an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews are responsible for the 9/11 terror attack. It could also reference Kristallnacht, an organised nationwide attack on Jews which began in Germany on 9 November 1938. The vandalism was carried out six days after the start of Hanukkah - one of the biggest festivals of the year for Jewish people. No arrests have been made. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said on Twitter: ""This makes me sick to my stomach"" adding that ""anti-Semitism like this"" had ""no place anywhere and certainly not in London"". He also said that residents could expect more police patrols in the area. A South Hampstead Synagogue spokesman said: ""This is a time for people of all backgrounds - of all faiths and of none - to stand united and show our determination that we do not tolerate prejudice, hate and division - on our streets or online.""

MP for Hampstead and Kilburn Tulip Siddiq, MP for Holborn and St Pancras Keir Starmer and Camden Council leader Georgia Gould released a joint statement, which read: ""Camden is and always will be no place for hate. ""We stand together with all of our Jewish residents and our whole community in saying these cowardly pedlars of hate do not represent Camden and our values. ""We are proud to have a strong, vibrant Jewish community as part of our beautiful borough. ""This is not an isolated incident and we must all confront the rising tide of hate crime and anti-Semitism in the UK. ""Now is the moment to find the courage to confront hatred and prejudice wherever we see it."" Camden street cleaning teams are removing the graffiti ""as quickly and sensitively as possible,"" they added. Conservative councillor for Hampstead Oliver Cooper said he spent Sunday morning patrolling the neighbourhood after ""appalled"" residents alerted the Community Security Trust charity, which works to protect the Jewish community. The graffiti could reference an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews are responsible for the 9/11 terror attack Mr Cooper said: ""My first reaction was shock and horror. ""I've had to report anti-Semitic graffiti in Hampstead a number of times before, including by a banned neo-Nazi group, but I have never seen anything approaching this extent."" Mr Cooper said he came across the graffiti in nine places, and others also posted photographs of the markings on Twitter. Ms Siddiq described the vandalism as ""unbelievable, senseless, disgusting anti-Semitism at the heart of our community"". Insp Kev Hailes, of the Met, said: ""This is clearly a concerning incident and one we are taking seriously. ""We have liaised with our partners in order to remove the graffiti and various inquiries are under way to find who is responsible.

$5bn fund unveiled for climate-friendly shipping,"A group of ship owners have announced plans for a $5bn (Â£3.8bn) fund to design zero-emissions vessels. They says $2 (Â£1.50) should be levied on every tonne of ships' fuel - to support research into clean engines. Shipping creates about 3% of the emissions that are over-heating the climate - equivalent to all of Germany's CO2. Environmentalists welcomed the proposal but also described it as too little, too late. They say it's outrageous that international shipping pays no fuel taxes, unlike lorry owners. Green groups argue that if ships were taxed at the same level as lorries, 70 times more cash for developing clean engines would be raised in Europe alone. Around 250m tonnes of fuel a year are burned by ships. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) says that 90% of owners globally are behind the $2 levy on fuel. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external Speed limits for ships can have 'massive' benefits Five things we've learned from Madrid climate talks Guy Platten, secretary-general of the ICS told BBC News: ""I have seen a massive change in the opinion of ships' owners over the past few years. ""They've realised that we've got to do our bit by decarbonising shipping - and that means designing zero-carbon ships. That's why we need the levy. ""At the moment we can't yet see what the best clean fuel would be for ships. But there's a real urgency about solving the problem."" He defended the size of the levy, saying it was small enough to be agreed by ship owners in the developing world, but big enough to make a difference. However, Faig Abbasov from the green group Transport and Environment responded: ""The proposed levy is a tiny amount. It's outrageous that the shipping industry has avoided taking responsibility for its emissions for years - that's why it's facing difficulty now.""Speed limits for ships can have 'massive' benefits Campaigners wanted to slow ships down, but the proposal was rejected ""What's needed is a huge programme to incentivise owners to buy zero-carbon vessels - as well as researching new technologies."" The ICS says its proposal is supported by the owners of 90% of the merchant fleet. It defends its proposed 10-year research fund, which would need to be enforced through by the UN shipping body the International Maritime Organization. The industry has reduced its emissions slightly over recent years, thanks mainly to ships slowing down after the 2008 financial crisis in order to absorb the oversupply in shipping capacity. Campaigners wanted mandatory slow steaming to save emissions, but the IMO rejected that proposal. The IMO does have a target of halving emissions from international shipping by 2050 compared to 2008. But the ICS says ships are so long-lived that zero-carbon vessels must be available as soon as possible. The optimum shipping fuel has not yet been decided. One option is biofuels, but their availability will be globally limited by the need to ensure they're sustainable. Shipping experts assume that the supply will be gobbled up by the wealthy aviation industry, anyway. Other options are ""green"" hydrogen (produced by renewables); ammonia; fuel cells; batteries and synthetic fuels produced from renewables. The ICS says none of these yet exists in a form or scale that can be applied to large transoceanic ships. Even when the industry settles on a technology, massive investment will be needed to ensure the chosen fuel is available in ports round the world. Mr Platten from the ICS says the path ahead is not year clear. And then there remains the obstacle of the IMO, which is bound by the UN's need for consensus. Environmentalists say some nations' delegates appeared intent on staving off action to protect the climate. The IMO said it would consider the levy plan. The EU meanwhile is under pressure to include shipping in the EU emissions trading scheme, in which polluting industries can buy and sell emissions permits. T&E says that would raise â¬24bn a year on current carbon prices. Faig Abbasov complained: ""The shipping industry is totally subsidised. It pays no tax on fuel, no VAT, no corporate tax. ""The EU tax directive specifically bans any member state from taxing ships' fuel. If you travel to the south of France by coach, the firm pays fuel tax. If you go by luxury cruise you don't pay.
