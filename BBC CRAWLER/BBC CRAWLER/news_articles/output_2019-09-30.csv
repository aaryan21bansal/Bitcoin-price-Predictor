Javid pledges National Living Wage rise,"This video can not be played Chancellor Sajid Javid: ""We are the workers' party"" Chancellor Sajid Javid has pledged to raise the National Living Wage to Â£10.50 within the next five years. He will also lower the age threshold for those who qualify from 25 to 21. Speaking to a packed hall at the Tory Party Conference, Mr Javid said the policy would ""help the next generation of go-getters to get ahead"". The current rate for over 25s is Â£8.21 - but the Living Wage Foundation says it should already be Â£9 across the UK and Â£10.55 for those in London. Earlier this year, Labour pledged to raise the National Living Wage to Â£10 an hour in 2020 and toinclude all workers under 18- who currently get a minimum wage of Â£4.35. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, called Mr Javid's announcement a ""pathetic attempt at catch-up"". Mr Javid also confirmed Â£25bn for road projects, Â£220m for bus improvements and Â£5bn for digital infrastructure in his speech, along with extra funding for youth services. Javid promises 'significant response' to no-deal Tories pour funds into marginal seats, data shows Government plans billions for hospital projects PM 'touching' row continues at Tory conference The Tories have made a raft of spending announcements so far at their party conference in Manchester. But the conference has been overshadowed by allegations that Boris Johnson squeezed the thigh of a journalist during a lunch in 1999 - which the prime minister denies. Charlotte Edwardes made the claims in a column in the Sunday Times, and said the PM did the same to another woman in the room. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said a rumour had been circulating at the conference the other woman was journalist Mary Wakefield - the wife of the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings - but she released a statement saying ""nothing like this ever happened to me"". With the prime minister looking on from the audience, Mr Javid told his party the living wage pledge would make the UK ""the first major economy in the world to end low pay altogether"". What is full-fibre broadband? And do the government's promises on it add up? How high could the lowest salaries go? He said cutting the threshold to 21 would ""reward the hard work of all millennials"" - but it will come in two stages, with 23-year-olds qualifying for the rise in 2021 and 21-year-olds by 2024. ""It's clear it's the Conservatives who are the real party of labour - we are the workers' party,"" he told delegates. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: National Living Wage rise ""is right thing to do"" Business groups sounded a note of caution about the potential effects of the policy. The CEO of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson, said there was ""nothing wrong with targeting higher wages"", but ""all of this adds to the cumulative pressures you have seen take their toll on the retail sector"". Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, a charity which represents nurseries, said: ""A rise in the national living wage is fantastic for younger workers, but for the early years sector, this could be an additional cost that many providers will not be able to afford to bear."" The TUC, meanwhile, said the chancellor's promise ""should be taken with a huge bucket of salt"". ""This pledge would be overwhelmed by a no-deal Brexit,"" general secretary Frances O'Grady added. ""If we leave the EU without a deal, jobs will be lost, wages will fall, and our public services will suffer."" The National Living Wage was introduced by then Chancellor George Osborne in 2016, but the Living Wage Foundation argues the level should always have been higher in order to cover the real needs of employees and their families. Director of the organisation Katherine Chapman said nearly 6,000 employers across the UK were already ""going further than the legal minimum and paying a real Living Wage that covers the cost of living"". The chancellor also: Confirmed pledges made by his predecessor for Â£25bn to upgrade England's road network Announced funding of Â£220m to improve bus networks Promiseda Â£5bn boost to digital infrastructure, with an ambition to connect the hardest-to-reach 20% of the country - upping the earlier target of 10% He also confirmed Â£500m for youth services. The Youth Investment Fund will be focused on building up to 60 new centres and refurbishing 360 old ones so that young people have ""somewhere to go, something to do and someone to talk to"". However, funding for youth services has fallen in real terms from more than Â£870m in 2011/12 to Â£352m in 2017/18 - meaning the pledge still does not return spending to the level of eight years ago. ""I'd guess that some businesses will worry this is the return of the magic money tree. But with them being asked to grow it..."" That was the response from one UK trade body boss to Sajid Javid's announcement that he would give four million workers a pay rise by increasing the National Living Wage to Â£10.50 an hour over the next five years. Business leaders here at the Conservative Party conference are loathe to publicly object to the elimination of low pay (defined as anything below 66% of the median national average). However, they are worried that the government is making eye-catching and vote winning promises while handing the bill for them to business. In truth, the government's wage promise is not as generous as it first looks. A promise made in 2018 to set the National Living Wage at 60% of the median income would have seen wages rise to nearly nearly Â£9.50 by 2023 - so targeting Â£10.50 by 2025 is fairly close the trajectory they were already on. The biggest disappointment was the lack of detail on how exactly the government intends to cushion business against the costs of no-deal disruption. Having talked this up in recent days, the head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, was not alone in saying she thought there had been a page missing from the chancellor's speech. However, for the chancellor to put numbers around an emergency package would have been to put a hefty price tag on no-deal. Something the government is understandably reluctant to do. Mr Javid also reiterated his government's position of leaving the EU on 31 October, echoing the conference slogan of ""Get Brexit Done"". ""We are leaving the European Union,"" he said. ""It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of days - 31 days, deal, or no deal."" Earlier, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the government had been working on ""mitigations"" which would allow it ""to deal with many of the disruptions"" of a no-deal. He also promised ""a significant economic policy response"" in such circumstances. The BBC's Norman Smith said that could mean tax cuts to help ease the potential impact. In his speech, the chancellor announced the government would commit Â£4.3bn to replace EU funding received by ""organisations and devolved administrations"" in the coming year, offering them ""extra certainty"". And he said a ""Brexit Red Tape Challenge"" would be launched, letting businesses tell the government what rules they want changing after Brexit through an online portal.

UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations,"Stephen Barclay and Michel Barnier met for Brexit talks in Brussels on Friday The government has prepared the legal text of an updated Brexit deal, government sources have told the BBC. It is expected to make more of the plans public in the next few days, a senior government figure says. The government has suggested creating ""customs clearance zones"" in Northern Ireland and Irish Republic, as part of the proposals put to the EU. But Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveneysaid the plans were a ""non-starter"". In atweet,external, Mr Coveney said Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ""deserve better"" than the proposals, which wereoriginally reported by Irish state broadcaster RTE,external. Proposals for reaching a Brexit deal had been expected ahead of a crucial EU summit on 17 October. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson says this will happen whether or not there is a new deal with Brussels. Laura Kuenssberg: Brexit is the key for the PM Brexit border customs plan 'non starter' Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Mr Johnson says that he would prefer leaving with a deal. At the Conservative Party conference on Monday, he said: ""I'm cautiously optimistic. We have made some pretty big moves, we are waiting to see whether our European friends will help us and whether we can find the right landing zone."" MPs have passed a law, known as the Benn Act, requiring Mr Johnson to seek an extension to the deadline from the bloc if he is unable to pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit, by 19 October. With the detailed proposals on the table, the UK side hopes that by the end of the week, both the EU and UK would be in a period of intense negotiations where both sides thrash out a final text. But there is no certainty over whether the EU will accept the premise of the plans in order to move to the next phase of talks. The biggest obstacle to a deal is the backstop - the plan to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The policy - agreed to by former PM Theresa May in her withdrawal deal with the EU, which was rejected three times by Parliament - is unacceptable to many Conservative MPs. Since becoming prime minister, Mr Johnson has stressed to EU leaders the backstop would have to be replaced if any deal was to be passed by Parliament. Mr Johnson has argued that the backstop would keep the UK too closely aligned with EU rules after Brexit. What are the Brexit backstop options? UK shares Brexit documents with EU How are the UK's talks with the EU going? The EU Commission has said it is willing to look at new proposals but these must achieve the same aims as the backstop - and be legally enforceable. Sources involved in the negotiations with the EU say the checks proposed would not be at the Irish border, and suggestions there would be a series of checkpoints along the border are a misunderstanding. The proposals were rejected by political parties in Dublin and non-unionist politicians in Belfast, with the SDLP's Colum Eastwood saying there would be ""economic and security challenges that are unacceptable"". Lisa Chambers, the Fianna Fail Brexit spokeswoman described it as ""effectively a border with a buffer zone"", while Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said it was ""further evidence of Tory recklessness and belligerence towards Ireland"". ""Anything that causes there to be customs, tariffs, checks anywhere represents a hardening of the border,"" she told Radio 4'sTodayprogramme. ""[It] goes against all of the commitments that have been entered into by the British government at the get-go of this Brexit process to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to ensure no hardening of the border, to respect the Irish economy, Irish society - to do nothing that would in anyway threaten or destabilise the situation,"" she added. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer described the proposals as ""utterly unworkable"". Talks have continued between the UK and EU, at a technical level. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier met on Friday. The BBC has learnt the proposals will accept the need for customs checks on the island of Ireland - but insist these checks, as the government previously pledged, would be conducted away from the border. Customs formalities would be carried out mostly where goods originate or at their final destination. The UK government maintains that any further customs inspections would be very limited - and these could be conducted either at new locations or at existing business premises. The Irish broadcaster RTE had reported that a ""string of customs posts perhaps five to 10 miles away from the frontier"" had been floated by the UK. However, government sources have denied that UK officials had proposed a series of inspection posts on either side of the Irish border. Leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson told the Today programme the proposals showed Mr Johnson was ""not serious"" about getting a deal. ""He knows that this is going to be rejected,"" she said. Ms Swinson also said cross-party talks continued about how to ensure the Benn Act was ""watertight"". She raised concerns that although Mr Johnson has promised to respect the rule of law, he has also promised to deliver Brexit on 31 October, with or without a deal. ""Those two things can't simultaneously be true,"" she said.

Javid promises 'significant response' to no-deal,"This video can not be played The chancellor says Britain could still leave the EU without a deal The chancellor has promised ""a significant economic policy response"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Sajid Javid did not give details, but the BBC's Norman Smith said it could mean tax cuts to help mitigate the potential impact. Mr Javid is setting out plans for infrastructure investment on the second day of the Tory conference. But the event has so far been overshadowed by claims Boris Johnson touched a female journalist's thigh. The allegation - which the PM has denied - relates to a lunch in 1999 when Mr Johnson was the editor of the Spectator magazine. Meanwhile, as the Tories gather in Manchester other MPs will be in Westminster after they voted down a motion to grant a three-day recess to cover the conference, andopposition parties were expected to meet to discuss their next moves on Brexit. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme they were ""prepared and ready in Parliament to respond to anything that comes out of Downing Street"". The SNP has also said the party wants to look at the possibility of holding ano confidence vote in the governmentthis week. Tory conference: Five things to look out for in Manchester PM 'model of restraint' amid language row Three Brexit champions hammer home PM's message Minister 'looking seriously' at compulsory vaccines The theme of the conference in Manchester is ""Get Brexit Done"" and Mr Javid insisted the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October - with or without a deal. That is despite a law - the Benn Act - being passed by MPs which stipulates that the government must ask for an extension to the Brexit deadline if a deal is not agreed by 19 October. Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? What is a vote of no confidence? The chancellor said the government had been working on ""mitigations"" which mean ""we will be able to deal with many of the disruptions"" of a no-deal if agreement cannot be reached with the bloc before the deadline. He said he would give more detail in his speech later, but told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm clear that if it was no deal there would be a significant economic policy response. ""You have the independent Bank of England that will almost certainly think about a monetary policy response and that's for them. ""I will be thinking about a fiscal and other economic policy response."" But Mr Javid admitted he was not sure how much a no-deal Brexit would cost the economy in the short-term, saying: ""I don't think anyone really knows a full proper answer to that question."" Elsewhere, the Scottish Conservatives' interim leader Jackson Carlawsaid the party would not support a further delayto Brexit and had dropped the opposition to no-deal advanced by his predecessor Ruth Davidson. The Tories have so far made spending vows of more than Â£50bn at their conference. That includes an announcement later of Â£25bn for England's roads as well as Â£5bn for ultrafast broadband in some of the UK's ""hardest to reach parts"". The conference comes aftera stormy week for their leaderMr Johnson - includingallegations about his links to a US businesswomanand culminating on Sunday in the accusations by journalist Charlotte Edwardes. On BBC Breakfast, Mr Javid refused to comment on the ""personal allegations"" against the PM, adding: ""I have full faith in the prime minister and I don't doubt that and what he has said for a second."" However, former cabinet minister Justine Greening told Today the allegations were ""deeply concerning"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Channel 4 News he knew Ms Edwardes well and she was ""trustworthy"". The banners that dangle from the conference hall ceiling here tell a story. Invest, invest, invest they say - in schools, the NHS and the police. In other words, spend, spend, spend. What a contrast with a few years ago, when the focus was on cuts. The Conservatives argue that is because the public finances can now support a new approach. But vast uncertainty still swirls around Brexit - and what it might mean for the national balance sheet. Since the start of this conference, the party has fleshed out details on how it will spend more than Â£50bn. Chancellor Sajid Javid will later make his contribution to this tally with promises on roads, buses and broadband. The chancellor will say the full benefits of his infrastructure investment ""may not be felt for some time"", but ""the work must start here and now"". The Â£25bn pot had already been set aside provisionally by his predecessor, Philip Hammond, but Mr Javid will confirm it will be spent on upgrades for 14 of England's major roads, including: Completing the dualling of the A66 Trans-Pennine expressway and the A46 Newark bypass Improving the M60 Simister Island interchange in Manchester Starting construction on the A428 to improve journeys between Cambridge and Milton Keynes and widening the A12 in east England At least Â£5bn will also be set aside to maintain and renew other strategic roads between 2020 and 2025. The chancellor will renew a pledge made earlier this month to invest Â£220m into improved bus services in England, including Â£50m for the country's first all-electric bus town or city. And he will set a goal for contactless payments to be made available on every city bus. Plans for so-called superbus networks, where local authorities will invest in bus lanes in exchange for more services from operators, will also be announced. A pilot is planned for Cornwall in 2020. Other promises unveiled on Monday include: A Â£5bn investment to support the roll-out of gigabit-capable internet, and mobile networks - including 5G. An ambition to connect the hardest-to-reach 20% of the country - upping the earlier target of 10% - but a deadline to reach this goal has not been confirmed. A pledge by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick to give tenants in new housing association properties the right to shared ownership of their home. Plans to create a simpler planning system to speed up the building of new homes. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused the Tories of only offering ""a combination of re-announcements and damp squibs"". He added the announcements showed ""the real difference between the parties"" with the Tories were ""tinkering around the edges, while Labour was proposing a fundamental shift of power and wealth from the few to the many"".

315 billion-tonne iceberg breaks off Antarctica,"The EU's Sentinel-1 satellite system captured these before and after images The Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica has just produced its biggest iceberg in more than 50 years. The calved block covers 1,636 sq km in area - a little smaller than Scotland's Isle of Skye - and is called D28. The scale of the berg means it will have to be monitored and tracked because it could in future pose a hazard to shipping. Not since the early 1960s has Amery calved a bigger iceberg. That was a whopping 9,000 sq km in area. Amery is the third largest ice shelf in Antarctica, and is a key drainage channel for the east of the continent. The shelf is essentially the floating extension of a number of glaciers that flow off the land into the sea.Losing bergs to the ocean is how these ice streams maintain equilibrium, balancing the input of snow upstream. So, scientists knew this calving event was coming. What's interesting is that much attention in the area had actually been focussed just to the east of the section that's now broken away. This is a segment of Amery that hasaffectionately become known as ""Loose Tooth"",externalbecause of its resemblance in satellite images to the dentition of a small child. Both ice areas had shared the same rift system. Nasa space laser tracks water depths from orbit 'No role' for climate in Halley iceberg Antarctic instability 'is spreading' Loose Tooth pictured in the early 2000s. D28 is seen forming to the left But although wobbly, Loose tooth is still attached. It's D28 that's been extracted. ""It is the molar compared to a baby tooth,"" Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography told BBC News. Prof Fricker had predicted back in 2002,externalthat Loose Tooth would come off sometime between 2010 and 2015. ""I am excited to see this calving event after all these years. We knew it would happen eventually, but just to keep us all on our toes, it is not exactly where we expected it to be,"" she said. The Scripps researcher stressed that there was no link between this event and climate change. Satellite data since the 1990s has shown that Amery is roughly in balance with its surroundings, despite experiencing strong surface melt in summer. ""While there is much to be concerned about in Antarctica, there is no cause for alarm yet for this particular ice shelf,"" Prof Fricker added. Amery experiences a lot of summer surface melt, but the data indicates it is in equilibrium The Australian Antarctic Division will however be watching Amery closely to see if it reacts at all. The division's scientists have instrumentation in the region. It's possible the loss of such a big berg will change the stress geometry across the front of the ice shelf. This could influence the behaviour of cracks, and even the stability of Loose Tooth. D28 is calculated to be about 210m thick and contains some 315 billion tonnes of ice. The name comes from a classification system run by the US National Ice Center, which divides the Antarctic into quadrants. The D quadrant covers the longitudes 90 degrees East to zero degrees, the Prime Meridian. This is roughly Amery to the Eastern Weddell Sea. D28 is dwarfed by the mighty A68 berg, which broke away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in 2017. It currently covers an area more than three times as big. Nearshore currents and winds will carry D28 westwards. It's likely to take several years for it to break apart and melt completely.

Scots Conservatives would not support Brexit delayInterim leader Jackson Carlaw also confirms that the party has dropped its opposition to a no-deal Brexit.Scotland politicsComments,"Jackson Carlaw said he would support a no-deal Brexit A further delay to the UK's departure from the EU would not be supported by the Scottish Conservatives, according to their interim leader. Jackson Carlaw, who replaced Ruth Davidson earlier this year, also confirmed that the party had dropped its opposition to a no-deal Brexit. However, he said his preferred option was for the UK to leave the EU with a deal on 31 October. When she was leader Ms Davidson would not support leaving without a deal. She pushed for an agreementthat would mean the UK remained part of the European Single Market and Customs Union.

""We need to work as hard as we can with our European partners to secure that deal, but if at the end of that process, [along with] our European partners, we aren't able to arrive at a fresh arrangement, then I think the time has come where we have to prepare to leave,"" he said. ""Another extension, another three months, with nobody really agreeing on what they would do during that [time] or what the outcome would be, is far more damaging for Scotland, for the United Kingdom and for business, for everybody, than finally getting to a point where we resolve this issue and move on."" Jackson Carlaw was made interim leader after Ruth Davidson stepped down in August Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said he would rather be""dead in a ditch""than ask EU leaders for a further extension to Article 50. But a new law has been introduced designed to prevent a no-deal EU exit. Introduced by Labour's Hilary Benn, it requires Mr Johnson to request a three-month Brexit delay by 19 October. Mr Carlaw has also signalled a change in direction for the party which, under Ruth Davidson's leadership, strongly opposed a no-deal Brexit. Javid promises 'significant response' to no-deal Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland, he said a ""tremendous amount of work"" had taken place to ensure the UK could ""cope with the challenges"".

"UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiationsIt includes the legal text of an updated Brexit deal, including suggested ""customs clearance zones"" in Northern Ireland.UK Politics","Stephen Barclay and Michel Barnier met for Brexit talks in Brussels on Friday The government has prepared the legal text of an updated Brexit deal, government sources have told the BBC. It is expected to make more of the plans public in the next few days, a senior government figure says. The government has suggested creating ""customs clearance zones"" in Northern Ireland and Irish Republic, as part of the proposals put to the EU. But Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveneysaid the plans were a ""non-starter"". In atweet,external, Mr Coveney said Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ""deserve better"" than the proposals, which wereoriginally reported by Irish state broadcaster RTE,external. Proposals for reaching a Brexit deal had been expected ahead of a crucial EU summit on 17 October. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson says this will happen whether or not there is a new deal with Brussels. Laura Kuenssberg: Brexit is the key for the PM Brexit border customs plan 'non starter' Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Mr Johnson says that he would prefer leaving with a deal. At the Conservative Party conference on Monday, he said: ""I'm cautiously optimistic. We have made some pretty big moves, we are waiting to see whether our European friends will help us and whether we can find the right landing zone."" MPs have passed a law, known as the Benn Act, requiring Mr Johnson to seek an extension to the deadline from the bloc if he is unable to pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit, by 19 October. With the detailed proposals on the table, the UK side hopes that by the end of the week, both the EU and UK would be in a period of intense negotiations where both sides thrash out a final text. But there is no certainty over whether the EU will accept the premise of the plans in order to move to the next phase of talks. The biggest obstacle to a deal is the backstop - the plan to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The policy - agreed to by former PM Theresa May in her withdrawal deal with the EU, which was rejected three times by Parliament - is unacceptable to many Conservative MPs. Since becoming prime minister, Mr Johnson has stressed to EU leaders the backstop would have to be replaced if any deal was to be passed by Parliament. Mr Johnson has argued that the backstop would keep the UK too closely aligned with EU rules after Brexit. What are the Brexit backstop options? UK shares Brexit documents with EU How are the UK's talks with the EU going? The EU Commission has said it is willing to look at new proposals but these must achieve the same aims as the backstop - and be legally enforceable. Sources involved in the negotiations with the EU say the checks proposed would not be at the Irish border, and suggestions there would be a series of checkpoints along the border are a misunderstanding. The proposals were rejected by political parties in Dublin and non-unionist politicians in Belfast, with the SDLP's Colum Eastwood saying there would be ""economic and security challenges that are unacceptable"". Lisa Chambers, the Fianna Fail Brexit spokeswoman described it as ""effectively a border with a buffer zone"", while Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said it was ""further evidence of Tory recklessness and belligerence towards Ireland"". ""Anything that causes there to be customs, tariffs, checks anywhere represents a hardening of the border,"" she told Radio 4'sTodayprogramme. ""[It] goes against all of the commitments that have been entered into by the British government at the get-go of this Brexit process to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to ensure no hardening of the border, to respect the Irish economy, Irish society - to do nothing that would in anyway threaten or destabilise the situation,"" she added. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer described the proposals as ""utterly unworkable"". Talks have continued between the UK and EU, at a technical level. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier met on Friday. The BBC has learnt the proposals will accept the need for customs checks on the island of Ireland - but insist these checks, as the government previously pledged, would be conducted away from the border. Customs formalities would be carried out mostly where goods originate or at their final destination. The UK government maintains that any further customs inspections would be very limited - and these could be conducted either at new locations or at existing business premises. The Irish broadcaster RTE had reported that a ""string of customs posts perhaps five to 10 miles away from the frontier"" had been floated by the UK. However, government sources have denied that UK officials had proposed a series of inspection posts on either side of the Irish border. Leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson told the Today programme the proposals showed Mr Johnson was ""not serious"" about getting a deal. ""He knows that this is going to be rejected,"" she said. Ms Swinson also said cross-party talks continued about how to ensure the Benn Act was ""watertight"". She raised concerns that although Mr Johnson has promised to respect the rule of law, he has also promised to deliver Brexit on 31 October, with or without a deal. ""Those two things can't simultaneously be true,"" she said.

315 billion-tonne iceberg breaks off AntarcticaThe Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica produces its largest iceberg in more than 50 years.,"The EU's Sentinel-1 satellite system captured these before and after images The Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica has just produced its biggest iceberg in more than 50 years. The calved block covers 1,636 sq km in area - a little smaller than Scotland's Isle of Skye - and is called D28. The scale of the berg means it will have to be monitored and tracked because it could in future pose a hazard to shipping. Not since the early 1960s has Amery calved a bigger iceberg. That was a whopping 9,000 sq km in area. Amery is the third largest ice shelf in Antarctica, and is a key drainage channel for the east of the continent. The shelf is essentially the floating extension of a number of glaciers that flow off the land into the sea.Losing bergs to the ocean is how these ice streams maintain equilibrium, balancing the input of snow upstream. So, scientists knew this calving event was coming. What's interesting is that much attention in the area had actually been focussed just to the east of the section that's now broken away. This is a segment of Amery that hasaffectionately become known as ""Loose Tooth"",externalbecause of its resemblance in satellite images to the dentition of a small child. Both ice areas had shared the same rift system. Nasa space laser tracks water depths from orbit 'No role' for climate in Halley iceberg Antarctic instability 'is spreading' Loose Tooth pictured in the early 2000s. D28 is seen forming to the left But although wobbly, Loose tooth is still attached. It's D28 that's been extracted. ""It is the molar compared to a baby tooth,"" Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography told BBC News. Prof Fricker had predicted back in 2002,externalthat Loose Tooth would come off sometime between 2010 and 2015. ""I am excited to see this calving event after all these years. We knew it would happen eventually, but just to keep us all on our toes, it is not exactly where we expected it to be,"" she said. The Scripps researcher stressed that there was no link between this event and climate change. Satellite data since the 1990s has shown that Amery is roughly in balance with its surroundings, despite experiencing strong surface melt in summer. ""While there is much to be concerned about in Antarctica, there is no cause for alarm yet for this particular ice shelf,"" Prof Fricker added. Amery experiences a lot of summer surface melt, but the data indicates it is in equilibrium The Australian Antarctic Division will however be watching Amery closely to see if it reacts at all. The division's scientists have instrumentation in the region. It's possible the loss of such a big berg will change the stress geometry across the front of the ice shelf. This could influence the behaviour of cracks, and even the stability of Loose Tooth. D28 is calculated to be about 210m thick and contains some 315 billion tonnes of ice. The name comes from a classification system run by the US National Ice Center, which divides the Antarctic into quadrants. The D quadrant covers the longitudes 90 degrees East to zero degrees, the Prime Meridian. This is roughly Amery to the Eastern Weddell Sea. D28 is dwarfed by the mighty A68 berg, which broke away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in 2017. It currently covers an area more than three times as big. Nearshore currents and winds will carry D28 westwards. It's likely to take several years for it to break apart and melt completely.

Man guilty of killing film producer ex-girlfriend,"Film producer Laureline Garcia-Bertaux was found in a shallow grave in her garden A man has been found guilty of murdering his ex-girlfriend, who he strangled and buried in a flower bed at her south-west London home. Film producer Laureline Garcia-Bertaux was found naked and wrapped in bin bags in a shallow grave in her Kew garden. Kirill Belorusov, 32, denied murder but was found guilty at the Old Bailey and will be sentenced on Friday. He was arrested in Estonia under a European arrest warrant and brought back to the UK to face trial. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC said: ""The last few minutes of Ms Garcia-Bertaux's life must have been truly terrifying as this defendant squeezed the very life out of her and as she struggled for her final breath, there must have been a moment of terrible clarity when she realised that the man she cared for was a liar, a cheat and a killer."" Kirill Belorusov will be sentenced on Friday The court heard Belorusov owed the 34-year-old victim thousands of pounds and avoided paying her back by pretending to have cancer. There was no record of him receiving treatment at hospitals in London. Ms Garcia-Bertaux was reported missing by worried friends when she failed to turn up to work at PR firm Golin, where she was an executive assistant. She also worked as a television and film producer and had worked with Dame Joan Collins on the 2018 short film Gerry. The court heard in a bid to cover his tracks, Belorusov sent text messages from her phone to her friends saying she was planning a party and a ""boob job"". Jurors saw CCTV of Kirill Belorusov waiting to catch a flight to Estonia after killing his ex-girlfriend The jury also wattched footage of Belorusov buying an axe and rubble sacks in Homebase Belorusov worked in bars and nightclubs and claimed to have been a stuntman on the Brad Pitt film World War Z but the online IMDb film database listing -which included 148 people under the heading ""stunts"" - did not feature his name. Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said: ""I'm entirely satisfied the defendant is not someone who believes the lies he tells. ""He just tells them on a scale and magnitude which I have not encountered before. ""I do not believe he has ever had cancer. I'm entirely sure of that.""

Saudi prince warns of Iran threat to world oil,"This video can not be played Saudi crown prince: Oil attack ""hit the heart of the global energy industry"" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has warned that oil prices may soar if the world does not act to deter Iran. He said failure to act could embolden Iran and lead to war, which he said would ruin the global economy. The prince was speaking after an attack on oil facilities which he blames on Tehran. Iran said the remarks would ""bring [the Saudis] nothing but shame"". Mohammed bin Salman also said he accepted some responsibility for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing. But, speaking to CBS News, he denied personally ordering it. The prince, who is considered the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, is suspected of personally targeting Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist critical of the government in Riyadh. Mr Khashoggi was killed in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey on 2 October 2018. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes news programme on Sunday,,externalhe said: ""I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it [the killing] was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government."" The secret tapes of Jamal Khashoggi's murder Who's using armed drones in the Middle East? Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals However, he denied ordering the killing of Mr Khashoggi directly, or having knowledge of it at the time. Saudi authorities have since blamed a ""rogue"" operation for his murder and put 11 men on trial. You may also be interested in: This video can not be played Investigators who have heard a recording of Khashoggi's interrogation describe his final moments The secret tapes of Khashoggi's murder The prince also appeared to offer talks for a political solution to the civil war in Yemen, where government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition are fighting Houthi rebels supported by Iran. Iran is Saudi Arabia's regional rival and an opponent of the US, which pulled out of a treaty aimed at limiting Tehran's nuclear programme after Mr Trump took power. US-Iran tensions have risen markedly this year, with the US blaming Iran on attacks on six oil tankers in the Gulf between May and July. Tehran rejects the accusations. There are subtle clues in this interview as to why the Saudi response to the 14 September drone and missile attacks has been so restrained. Note that the crown prince warns that a war with Iran would be catastrophic, not just for his country but for the global economy. Four years ago, when MBS committed his forces to the disastrous war in Yemen, his response might have been bolder. But the Yemen war has not gone as the Saudis intended while their enemy, the Houthi rebels, are launching ever increasing numbers of drones and missiles across the common border. The recent attacks on the Saudi oil industry, widely blamed on Iran, did real damage. So the Saudis now know just how vulnerable their critical infrastructure is to any Iranian strike. On the Khashoggi murder, the crown prince's ""taking of responsibility"" is a belated acknowledgment of how much unease there still is about this incident in the West. But that, of course, is not the same as admitting any involvement in it, which he and his government still deny. Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities earlier in September, whichknocked out about 5% of global oil supply and sent oil prices soaring. But Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the Saudi throne, said: ""If the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests. Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region ""Oil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven't seen in our lifetimes."" This video can not be played Abqaiq was struck in the early hours of Saturday morning He said the Middle East region ""represents about 30% of the world's energy supplies, about 20% of global trade passages, about 4% of the world GDP"". ""Imagine all of these three things stop. This means a total collapse of the global economy, and not just Saudi Arabia or the Middle East countries,"" the prince said.

"Saudi prince warns of Iran threat to world oilThe Saudi prince says oil prices could be ""unimaginably high"" unless the world acts to deter Iran.Middle East","This video can not be played Saudi crown prince: Oil attack ""hit the heart of the global energy industry"" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has warned that oil prices may soar if the world does not act to deter Iran. He said failure to act could embolden Iran and lead to war, which he said would ruin the global economy. The prince was speaking after an attack on oil facilities which he blames on Tehran. Iran said the remarks would ""bring [the Saudis] nothing but shame"". Mohammed bin Salman also said he accepted some responsibility for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing. But, speaking to CBS News, he denied personally ordering it. The prince, who is considered the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, is suspected of personally targeting Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist critical of the government in Riyadh. Mr Khashoggi was killed in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey on 2 October 2018. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes news programme on Sunday,,externalhe said: ""I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it [the killing] was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government."" The secret tapes of Jamal Khashoggi's murder Who's using armed drones in the Middle East? Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals However, he denied ordering the killing of Mr Khashoggi directly, or having knowledge of it at the time. Saudi authorities have since blamed a ""rogue"" operation for his murder and put 11 men on trial. You may also be interested in: This video can not be played Investigators who have heard a recording of Khashoggi's interrogation describe his final moments The secret tapes of Khashoggi's murder The prince also appeared to offer talks for a political solution to the civil war in Yemen, where government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition are fighting Houthi rebels supported by Iran. Iran is Saudi Arabia's regional rival and an opponent of the US, which pulled out of a treaty aimed at limiting Tehran's nuclear programme after Mr Trump took power. US-Iran tensions have risen markedly this year, with the US blaming Iran on attacks on six oil tankers in the Gulf between May and July. Tehran rejects the accusations. There are subtle clues in this interview as to why the Saudi response to the 14 September drone and missile attacks has been so restrained. Note that the crown prince warns that a war with Iran would be catastrophic, not just for his country but for the global economy. Four years ago, when MBS committed his forces to the disastrous war in Yemen, his response might have been bolder. But the Yemen war has not gone as the Saudis intended while their enemy, the Houthi rebels, are launching ever increasing numbers of drones and missiles across the common border. The recent attacks on the Saudi oil industry, widely blamed on Iran, did real damage. So the Saudis now know just how vulnerable their critical infrastructure is to any Iranian strike. On the Khashoggi murder, the crown prince's ""taking of responsibility"" is a belated acknowledgment of how much unease there still is about this incident in the West. But that, of course, is not the same as admitting any involvement in it, which he and his government still deny. Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities earlier in September, whichknocked out about 5% of global oil supply and sent oil prices soaring. But Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the Saudi throne, said: ""If the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests. Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region ""Oil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven't seen in our lifetimes."" This video can not be played Abqaiq was struck in the early hours of Saturday morning He said the Middle East region ""represents about 30% of the world's energy supplies, about 20% of global trade passages, about 4% of the world GDP"". ""Imagine all of these three things stop. This means a total collapse of the global economy, and not just Saudi Arabia or the Middle East countries,"" the prince said. He blamed Iranian ""stupidity"" for the attacks, saying there was no strategic goal.

"National Living Wage to rise to Â£10.50, Javid says","This video can not be played Chancellor Sajid Javid: ""We are the workers' party"" Chancellor Sajid Javid has pledged to raise the National Living Wage to Â£10.50 within the next five years. He will also lower the age threshold for those who qualify from 25 to 21. Speaking to a packed hall at the Tory Party Conference, Mr Javid said the policy would ""help the next generation of go-getters to get ahead"". The current rate for over 25s is Â£8.21 - but the Living Wage Foundation says it should already be Â£9 across the UK and Â£10.55 for those in London. Earlier this year, Labour pledged to raise the National Living Wage to Â£10 an hour in 2020 and toinclude all workers under 18- who currently get a minimum wage of Â£4.35. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, called Mr Javid's announcement a ""pathetic attempt at catch-up"". Mr Javid also confirmed Â£25bn for road projects, Â£220m for bus improvements and Â£5bn for digital infrastructure in his speech, along with extra funding for youth services. Javid promises 'significant response' to no-deal Tories pour funds into marginal seats, data shows Government plans billions for hospital projects PM 'touching' row continues at Tory conference The Tories have made a raft of spending announcements so far at their party conference in Manchester. But the conference has been overshadowed by allegations that Boris Johnson squeezed the thigh of a journalist during a lunch in 1999 - which the prime minister denies. Charlotte Edwardes made the claims in a column in the Sunday Times, and said the PM did the same to another woman in the room. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said a rumour had been circulating at the conference the other woman was journalist Mary Wakefield - the wife of the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings - but she released a statement saying ""nothing like this ever happened to me"". With the prime minister looking on from the audience, Mr Javid told his party the living wage pledge would make the UK ""the first major economy in the world to end low pay altogether"". What is full-fibre broadband? And do the government's promises on it add up? How high could the lowest salaries go? He said cutting the threshold to 21 would ""reward the hard work of all millennials"" - but it will come in two stages, with 23-year-olds qualifying for the rise in 2021 and 21-year-olds by 2024. ""It's clear it's the Conservatives who are the real party of labour - we are the workers' party,"" he told delegates. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: National Living Wage rise ""is right thing to do"" Business groups sounded a note of caution about the potential effects of the policy. The CEO of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson, said there was ""nothing wrong with targeting higher wages"", but ""all of this adds to the cumulative pressures you have seen take their toll on the retail sector"". Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, a charity which represents nurseries, said: ""A rise in the national living wage is fantastic for younger workers, but for the early years sector, this could be an additional cost that many providers will not be able to afford to bear."" The TUC, meanwhile, said the chancellor's promise ""should be taken with a huge bucket of salt"". ""This pledge would be overwhelmed by a no-deal Brexit,"" general secretary Frances O'Grady added. ""If we leave the EU without a deal, jobs will be lost, wages will fall, and our public services will suffer."" The National Living Wage was introduced by then Chancellor George Osborne in 2016, but the Living Wage Foundation argues the level should always have been higher in order to cover the real needs of employees and their families. Director of the organisation Katherine Chapman said nearly 6,000 employers across the UK were already ""going further than the legal minimum and paying a real Living Wage that covers the cost of living"". The chancellor also: Confirmed pledges made by his predecessor for Â£25bn to upgrade England's road network Announced funding of Â£220m to improve bus networks Promiseda Â£5bn boost to digital infrastructure, with an ambition to connect the hardest-to-reach 20% of the country - upping the earlier target of 10% He also confirmed Â£500m for youth services. The Youth Investment Fund will be focused on building up to 60 new centres and refurbishing 360 old ones so that young people have ""somewhere to go, something to do and someone to talk to"". However, funding for youth services has fallen in real terms from more than Â£870m in 2011/12 to Â£352m in 2017/18 - meaning the pledge still does not return spending to the level of eight years ago. ""I'd guess that some businesses will worry this is the return of the magic money tree. But with them being asked to grow it..."" That was the response from one UK trade body boss to Sajid Javid's announcement that he would give four million workers a pay rise by increasing the National Living Wage to Â£10.50 an hour over the next five years. Business leaders here at the Conservative Party conference are loathe to publicly object to the elimination of low pay (defined as anything below 66% of the median national average). However, they are worried that the government is making eye-catching and vote winning promises while handing the bill for them to business. In truth, the government's wage promise is not as generous as it first looks. A promise made in 2018 to set the National Living Wage at 60% of the median income would have seen wages rise to nearly nearly Â£9.50 by 2023 - so targeting Â£10.50 by 2025 is fairly close the trajectory they were already on. The biggest disappointment was the lack of detail on how exactly the government intends to cushion business against the costs of no-deal disruption. Having talked this up in recent days, the head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, was not alone in saying she thought there had been a page missing from the chancellor's speech. However, for the chancellor to put numbers around an emergency package would have been to put a hefty price tag on no-deal. Something the government is understandably reluctant to do. Mr Javid also reiterated his government's position of leaving the EU on 31 October, echoing the conference slogan of ""Get Brexit Done"". ""We are leaving the European Union,"" he said. ""It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of days - 31 days, deal, or no deal."" Earlier, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the government had been working on ""mitigations"" which would allow it ""to deal with many of the disruptions"" of a no-deal. He also promised ""a significant economic policy response"" in such circumstances. The BBC's Norman Smith said that could mean tax cuts to help ease the potential impact. In his speech, the chancellor announced the government would commit Â£4.3bn to replace EU funding received by ""organisations and devolved administrations"" in the coming year, offering them ""extra certainty"". And he said a ""Brexit Red Tape Challenge"" would be launched, letting businesses tell the government what rules they want changing after Brexit through an online portal.

Billions for hospital projects,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: This is the moment to invest in our NHS for the long term The government has pledged billions for hospital projects across England, at the start of the Conservative party conference. The plans include a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years. A new approach to NHS mental health treatment will also be trialled in 12 areas of England - with housing and job support alongside psychological help. NHS Providers welcomed the funding but said more was needed to make up for ""a decade of capital squeeze"". The organisation, which represents trusts in England, said the NHS's annual capital spending of around Â£6bn needed to double over the next five to 10 years to meet its needs. The government says Â£70m is also being invested in the mental health pilot areas, with the NHS building more ties with charities and local councils. About 1,000 extra specialist staff will be recruited in 12 pilot sites, with expertise in a range of mental health issues, the government says. Under plans drawn up by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the government has said Â£13bn will be spent on hospital projects, including entirely new buildings or revamping existing structures to improve facilities. The same pot of money will also be used to develop plans for further projects in the future. Mr Hancock said the funding would come from taxpayers, rather than PFI contracts whereby private firms fund the cost of building facilities and, in return, the state makes payments over a stipulated period of time for their use and management. The six hospital trusts to benefit from the Â£2.7bn in funding are: Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone, east London Epsom and St Helier Trust West Hertfordshire Trust Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust University Hospitals of Leicester Trust Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. Mr Hancock told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that funding for these six trusts was in place so building work could begin ""straight away"". A further 34 hospitals will receive Â£100m in initial funding to start developing projects, including Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge, the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham and the North Manchester General Hospital. The remaining projects, including up to a dozen smaller community hospitals in Dorset, would be completed over the second half of the next decade. The plans also include Â£200m for replacing MRI, CT scanners and breast cancer screening equipment. The government has certainly tried to grab the headlines with its claim that 40 new hospitals are to be built in England. But the announcement is very scant on detail. While we know which places these new hospitals will be built in, we don't know the scale of the plans. For example, when the government announced 20 projects in the summer it turned out that some amounted to little more than re-development of wards and clinics in the community. The green light has been given to six schemes - and with Â£2.7bn of funding attached we can assume they will be pretty substantial. But it's far from certain that will be the case for the other 34. The government has basically given health bosses the go-ahead to draw up plans, not to actually build them. The money being talked about to pay for them in the long-term suggests some may be on a smaller-scale. The final - and perhaps most important - element to be decided is just how much the budget for buildings is to be increased by in the coming years to pay for all this. Around Â£7bn is being spent this year, but there is already a huge backlog of repairs and maintenance that needs to be done. If ministers are serious about these new buildings and tackling that, the budget will have to increase substantially. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the commitments were ""significant"" and ""particularly good news"" for the six hospitals that would directly benefit. However, he said funding to complete schemes in 34 other hospitals had not yet been allocated. ""It's not just these six hospitals who have crumbling, outdated, infrastructure - community and mental health trusts, ambulance services and other hospitals across the country have equally pressing needs,"" he added. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's announcement that it was building 40 new hospitals had ""quickly unravelled as spin"". ""This isn't 40 new hospitals, it is just reconfiguring six,"" he said. ""New investment is desperately needed and of course we welcome any genuine new money, but patients and demoralised NHS staff are fed up of being taken for fools like this."" Brexit promises as Tory conference begins NHS plan: What it means for you Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? PM 'glad' about father's hospital confrontation The government said there would be an extra Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-4 to improve mental health care and Â£975m of funding was earmarked to provide community mental health provision. The 2.3bn figure was announced when the government outlined its future priorities for the NHS in January under theNHS Long Term Plan,external. The 12 pilot areas will be funded from this pot. Mental health minister Nadine Dorries said the plans for a new approach to mental health treatment and Â£70m of investment in pilot areas would begin a ""step-change"" in provision. This video can not be played Boris Johnson confronted during London hospital visit The pilot areas will cover services in the Humber, Coast and Vale Health and Care Partnership, Frimley Health and Care, and Surrey Heartlands; providers for Cambridge and Peterborough; Hertfordshire and West Essex; north-west London; north-east London; Herefordshire and Worcestershire; Lincolnshire; South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw; Cheshire and Merseyside, and Somerset. Ministers say the plans will involve a range of mental health issues, including eating disorders and alcohol addiction, psychosis and bipolar disorder. Speaking ahead of the start of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, Ms Dorries added: ""We know there are many causes behind mental illness - including significant life changes, problems at work or addiction - so it is only right that the NHS brings services together to serve patients in their communities."" Meanwhile, the prime minister has unveiled a Â£200m cash injection for the UK's health and life sciences industry. The funding will be matched by Â£400m of private investment to allow science companies to expand development plans.

Priest calls Lunney attack a 'modern crucifixion',"This video can not be played Priest describes Kevin Lunney attack as ""a modern form of crucifixion"". A priest has said there is an ""obvious cancer of evil in our midst"" after an attack on a Fermanagh businessman. Fr Oliver O'Reilly told churchgoers in Ballyconnell, County Cavan, that the evil needed to be ""exorcised before someone is murdered"". Kevin Lunney, a director of Quinn Industrial Holdings,was driving from work to his home in Kinawley when he was abducted on 17 September. Fr O'Reilly's condemnation of the assault received loud applause. Loyalty and violence after an empire's collapse He described it as a ""modern crucifixion carried out by a mafia-style group"". Mr Lunney was found 22 miles (35km) away beside a road in County Cavan. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said Mr Lunney sustained severe and life-changing injuries. Kevin Lunney is a director at Quinn Industrial Holdings Fr O'Reilly said the ""long reign of terror"" now threatened the lives and livelihoods of everybody living in the border areas of Fermanagh and Cavan. He said there was a ""false narrative"" being pushed by a ""small group of people in our midst"" about the directors of Quinn Industrial Holding. Fr O'Reilly apologised for being ""too complacent"" in recent years to Mr Lunney, his family and Quinn management. ""I now believe there has been a Mafia-style group with its own Godfather operating in our region for some time behind the scenes,"" he said. ""They have decided to ratchet up the intimidation. The Rubicon has now been crossed by this most recent barbaric assault."" Fr O'Reilly added that no one was above the law. The vast majority of peace-loving, law-abiding people in the area were being ""held to ransom by a few unscrupulous individuals who are hugely dangerous"", said Fr O'Reilly. ""This depraved act and scandalous attack on an innocent and powerless man by hired savage thugs,"" he added. ""This senseless atrocity follows years of threats, abuse, lies and various forms of violent intimidation, against the directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings. A burnt out BMW believed to be the one used by Kevin Lunney's attackers ""Maybe some people in our region need to examine their consciences about their angry rants at public meetings and defamatory statements on one or more social media sites. ""They need to face the truth that their diatribes added to that climate of intimidation and incited hatred leading up to this dark deed. ""Let them now take responsibility for their actions and learn lessons."" Quinn Industrial Holdings was founded by SeÃ¡n Quinn but the company later collapsed and was bought over by businessmen backed by three investment funds. Mr Quinn was employed as a consultant at his former company but left that role in 2016. Quinn executives have allegedly been subject to repeated attacks, something Mr Quinn has publicly condemned on a number of occasions. A Belfast High Court hearing earlier in the year heard that Mr Lunney was targeted as part of a wider campaign involving arson attacks, firebombs and online harassment.

Scots Conservatives would not support Brexit delay,"Jackson Carlaw said he would support a no-deal Brexit A further delay to the UK's departure from the EU would not be supported by the Scottish Conservatives, according to their interim leader. Jackson Carlaw, who replaced Ruth Davidson earlier this year, also confirmed that the party had dropped its opposition to a no-deal Brexit. However, he said his preferred option was for the UK to leave the EU with a deal on 31 October. When she was leader Ms Davidson would not support leaving without a deal. She pushed for an agreementthat would mean the UK remained part of the European Single Market and Customs Union. Meanwhile,Nicola Sturgeon condemned the Scottish Conservatives,external' new stance on no-deal, accusing them of ""putting the demands of Boris Johnson ahead of the interests of the Scottish people"". Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? What is 'no-deal Brexit'? 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Speaking toGood Morning Scotland on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Carlaw said a delay would be more damaging than resolving the issue. ""We need to work as hard as we can with our European partners to secure that deal, but if at the end of that process, [along with] our European partners, we aren't able to arrive at a fresh arrangement, then I think the time has come where we have to prepare to leave,"" he said. ""Another extension, another three months, with nobody really agreeing on what they would do during that [time] or what the outcome would be, is far more damaging for Scotland, for the United Kingdom and for business, for everybody, than finally getting to a point where we resolve this issue and move on."" Jackson Carlaw was made interim leader after Ruth Davidson stepped down in August Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said he would rather be""dead in a ditch""than ask EU leaders for a further extension to Article 50. But a new law has been introduced designed to prevent a no-deal EU exit. Introduced by Labour's Hilary Benn, it requires Mr Johnson to request a three-month Brexit delay by 19 October. Mr Carlaw has also signalled a change in direction for the party which, under Ruth Davidson's leadership, strongly opposed a no-deal Brexit. Javid promises 'significant response' to no-deal Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland, he said a ""tremendous amount of work"" had taken place to ensure the UK could ""cope with the challenges"". ""I'm not one of those who's argued the world will fall in if no deal is where we end up,"" he added. ""I think it presents challenges and difficulties which we will have to overcome... I believe that the work that is being done now to prepare for no deal means that although those challenges will still be considerable, if that's what we have to do, then that is what we will do. ""Although that's not my preferred option, I will support the prime minister if that's where we have to be.""

""It is shameful that not a single Scottish Tory can bring themselves to stand up for Scotland against an extreme Brexit - even at this critical moment for our country,"" he added.

Forever 21 files for bankruptcy protection,"Fashion retailer Forever 21 has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US. The company said it plans to ""exit most international locations in Asia and Europe"" but would continue to operate in Mexico and Latin America. It expects to close up to 350 stores worldwide, a spokesperson said, including as many as 178 US stores. Forever 21 sells inexpensive, trendy clothes and accessories, and competes against brands such as Zara and H&M. But some analysts say the retailer, founded in 1984, has lost its way over the past five years, and fallen out of favour with young US shoppers looking for relatively cheap clothing. The company has also, like many traditional retailers, struggled against rising competition from online rivals. Chapter 11 protection postpones a US company's obligations to its creditors, giving it time to reorganise its debts or sell parts of the business. A Forever 21 spokesperson said the retailer expected to have between 450 and 500 stores globally after this process, down from its current total of about 800. Ariana Grande claims Forever 21 'stole' name Forever 21 accused of 'fat shaming' over diet bars High Street: How many UK shops have closed? Forever 21 had announced last week that it would pull out of Japan by October due to ""continued sluggish sales"". The California-based firm has now said it is seeking to close up to 178 stores across the US. It is also closing its stores in Canada, but has provided few details on other markets. ""Decisions as to which international locations will be closing are ongoing. We do not expect to exit any major markets in the US,"" the spokesperson said. The retailer sought to reassure its customers in a public letter on Sunday,external, saying ""stores are open"" and ""it will continue to feel like a normal day"". ""This does not mean that we are going out of business - on the contrary, filing for bankruptcy protection is a deliberate and decisive step to put us on a successful track for the future."" Forever 21 has faced competition from the likes of Zara, H&M, and Primark Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said: ""The entry of Forever 21 into Chapter 11 bankruptcy is a consequence of both changing trends and tastes within the apparel market and of missteps by the company."" He said that as well as facing competition from the likes of H&M there was also a lack of clarity and differentiation at Forever 21. ""Over the past few years, the brand has lost much of the excitement and oomph which is critical to driving footfall and sales and is now something of an also-ran which is too easily overlooked. ""Store standards have also been sliding and consumer ratings for the quality of displays, merchandise, and the amount of inspiration in shops have dipped considerably over the past year."" He said bankruptcy would result in a much leaner US business, but he added that most, if not all, stores in Europe would be expected to close.

Cocaine and alcohol a 'deadly combination',"This video can not be played Cocaine and alcohol 'muddles the mind' Mixing cocaine and alcohol together creates a ""deadly combination"" which can increase violent and impulsive behaviour, doctors are warning. At least 13 ""self-inflicted"" deaths happened in a year in England among people who took the two substances, the Victoria Derbyshire programme found. Many, including two contestants on Love Island, took their own lives between April 2018 and March 2019. Coroners have reported seeing a rise in such cases. The charity Inquest uses the term ""self-inflicted"" to describe deaths where a person had injured or harmed themselves, resulting in death. The programme has also uncovered a death in similar circumstances in Wales during the same period, and there were also another five in England where cocaine and alcohol were consumed but coroners said there was not enough evidence to record suicide conclusions. One of those was Logan Woolliscroft, 21, who died after falling off a cliff near the family's Derbyshire home in 2018. His father, Steve, said he found 8g of cocaine bags and a bottle of Disaronno liqueur at the top of the cliff and ""just knew"" he had fallen. Police then found his body. Logan had become increasingly volatile and depressed in the three months before his death, Steve said. He had made some new friends and started taking cocaine and drinking heavily. The coroner said while Logan left notes for his family, he could have fallen while intoxicated and recorded an open conclusion. Steve says he believes ""100%"" that taking cocaine and alcohol together caused his death. ""To mix a stimulant with a depressant, it muddles your brain up completely and you just don't know where you are,"" he says. Logan's sister, Tillie, added: ""I like to think of who he was before. He was such a nice boy. To think of something like this changing someone in such a drastic way, it shows what it can do to you."" Figures show there has been a rise in the number of alcohol-and-cocaine-related deaths over the past two decades, plus an increase in cocaine use. Prof Julia Sinclair says mixing cocaine and alcohol increases the likelihood of risky behaviour Professor of addiction psychiatry Julia Sinclair, who is chairwoman of the faculty of addictions at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, explained that alcohol and cocaine were very different pharmacologically. ""Alcohol is a depressant, it increases the levels of Gaba (gamma-aminobutyric acid) in the brain, which is like its handbrake and makes us feel less anxious. ""You add cocaine into the mix and you have a rocket-fuelled increased impulsivity which gives people the driver to complete an act that they may not otherwise do. It's like crossing a road in front of a car speeding towards you."" Some research in the US even suggests the mixture could increase the risk of suicide by a factor of 16. There are calls for more research into the combination of alcohol and cocaine and its links with suicide or life-threatening behaviour. Some doctors believe that when you mix the two the liver produces a substance called cocaethylene, which may temporarily enhance the high - but also increases blood pressure, poor judgement and violent thoughts. Prof Sinclair said: ""People are looking for what the ingredient that makes alcohol and cocaine such a toxic combo. It might be cocaethylene - but we don't know and everyone has a different response."" Love Island star Sophie Gradon died in June last year Among those who have died in this way in the past year after consuming alcohol and cocaine are Love Island contestants Mike Thalassitis and Sophie Gradon and her boyfriend, Aaron Armstrong, who took his own life just weeks after her. There are no standardised statistics for these types of deaths. After consulting an academic, we found the figures by searching local and national media articles - it is likely the number of deaths will actually be higher. Prof Sinclair said the way coroners recorded their conclusions could be obscuring emerging trends in difficult cases. In the inquests we found, where the deceased hanged themselves - a conclusion of suicide was not always recorded, with ""narrative"", or open conclusions instead. But coroners have warned about the dangers in a number of cases. The coroner who heard Ms Gradon's case, Eric Armstrong, said during his conclusion: ""There's a good deal of concern at the moment because of the consequences of taking alcohol and using cocaine. ""The combination, I'm given to understand, is used by those who believe it brings on a so-called high much quicker. What they don't appreciate is that it also appears to give rise to violent thoughts. If Sophie's death is to serve any purpose at all, that message should go far and wide."" The Ministry of Justice said while coroners contributed to the compilation of death statistics, it was not their legal function. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said it was investing Â£25m in suicide-prevention efforts. ""We are also committed to reducing drug-and-alcohol-related harms and have commissioned a major independent review of drugs to help inform our thinking. And as part of the NHS long-term plan we are rolling out alcohol-care teams in hospitals with the highest number of alcohol-related admissions,"" he said.

"Â£10m to 'shine light' on teenage mental healthResearchers wants to find out how much social media, genetics and the environment impact on young people's mental health.Wales","This video can not be played Gwion, 15, Olwen, 13, and Grace, 17, discuss the pressures teenagers can face A new research centre will aim to ""shine a light"" on why young people develop mental health problems. The Â£10m Wolfson Centre at Cardiff University wants to develop new ways of reducing anxiety and depression. It will look at whether parents, family or genetic factors play a part, as well as social media and wider lifestyle and environmental issues. It will track the progress of thousands of teenagers and adolescents to better understand what happens. The charitable Wolfson Foundation is investing Â£10m over the next five years and will bring together experts from different fields. Cardiff University will work in partnership with Swansea University experts, the Welsh Government, NHS Wales, university health boards and schools across Wales. Welcoming the investment, Cardiff University psychologist Fran Rice, who will co-direct the new centre, said it would ""shine a light"" on adolescent mental health. ""It's an appreciation of this area of research, the significance of the problem and involves schools, young people, healthcare professionals, scientists and government working together to try to understand the causes and develop new methods of ensuring there is adequate help and support early on,"" said Prof Rice. Graduates need mental health support Teenager with anxiety 'treated like a truant' In the UK, one in eight young people experience anxiety or depression - a rise of 50% compared to 20 years ago - and the vast majority go unrecognised, according to the team. But the start of the increase predated social media, so there was not a simple cause. The Wolfson Centre will focus on five scientific areas: examining data to track children over time to better understand how anxiety and depression develop looking at the role of genetic and environmental factors on anxiety and depression in young people developing earlier intervention to help young people cope better when a parent suffers from depression, something Cardiff University has already been working on for a decade looking at the role schools play in promoting positive mental health in youngsters, including working with all secondary schools in Wales working jointly with Swansea University to use anonymous medical records to better understand the long-term outcomes of young people with anxiety and depression Co-director Stephan Collishaw added: ""Wales is a living lab of some 1.3m young people. ""This major investment will allow us not only to understand the causes of anxiety and depression but help create early interventions to ensure that young people get the right help, advice and support they need."" Survey of 3,000 children, aged 11 to 19 44%didnât find support at school helpful 56%wouldnât feel confident approaching teachers or other staff 22%had accessed support for their mental health in school 48%wouldnât know where to go to access support within school Mental health charity Mind Cymru said in the last year to June there had been 21,000 referrals and its recent survey of hundreds of children found one in seven describing their mental health as either poor or very poor. Policy officer Rhiannon Hedge said the new centre would help identify gaps in support. ""There are a lot of things we don't know, the rise of social media is still an area of very little research, exam stress, job prospects - all of those sorts of things can impact on children and young people,"" she said. Pupils in Cardiff say exams and social media can bring pressures At Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bro Edern in Cardiff, there are health and wellbeing lessons and a counsellor. Teachers also believe there is far more openness about mental health issues now. But there are also more expectations and less downtime. ""I feel young people are under far more pressure than they were 20 or 30 years ago,"" said Alan Williams, the deputy head teacher. ""There's more pressure on examinations, there's a focus on it in the media, schools are held accountable but unintentionally, more pressure is passed onto young children."" He believes there is also less quality time spent away from social media. Sixth former Grace, 17, echoes this. ""Some people rely on social media for validation - it's something you put on yourself but then you've got to step away from it for a bit and I think that's really hard for some people."" Olwen, 13, said: ""You're expected to feel, act or behave in a certain way - whether comparing yourself to celebrities or just the more popular groups in school. It can be hard if you're not included."" Gwion, 15, added: ""One of the main things is exam pressure - it's huge - and social media, you're always comparing yourself to people who have the perfect life or mindset. You can see it every minute of every day. Before phones were around, if you had an argument or were getting bullied, it would stop at the end of the day when the bell went.  Now it's a constant 24/7 and you're more vulnerable."" He would like to see the support available at all schools. Child mental health 'must be priority' Children as young as six self-harming Prof Rice said it would be important to involve young people themselves when it comes to improving services. The Wolfson Centre's plans include developing the next generation of youth mental health experts and holding an annual adolescent mental health summer school for training. The Wolfson Foundation is a charity which has already made Â£900m worth of grants and was set up in the name of the late mail-order tycoon and philanthropist Sir Isaac Wolfson.

Â£10m to 'shine light' on teenage mental health,"This video can not be played Gwion, 15, Olwen, 13, and Grace, 17, discuss the pressures teenagers can face A new research centre will aim to ""shine a light"" on why young people develop mental health problems. The Â£10m Wolfson Centre at Cardiff University wants to develop new ways of reducing anxiety and depression. It will look at whether parents, family or genetic factors play a part, as well as social media and wider lifestyle and environmental issues. It will track the progress of thousands of teenagers and adolescents to better understand what happens. The charitable Wolfson Foundation is investing Â£10m over the next five years and will bring together experts from different fields. Cardiff University will work in partnership with Swansea University experts, the Welsh Government, NHS Wales, university health boards and schools across Wales. Welcoming the investment, Cardiff University psychologist Fran Rice, who will co-direct the new centre, said it would ""shine a light"" on adolescent mental health. ""It's an appreciation of this area of research, the significance of the problem and involves schools, young people, healthcare professionals, scientists and government working together to try to understand the causes and develop new methods of ensuring there is adequate help and support early on,"" said Prof Rice. Graduates need mental health support Teenager with anxiety 'treated like a truant' In the UK, one in eight young people experience anxiety or depression - a rise of 50% compared to 20 years ago - and the vast majority go unrecognised, according to the team. But the start of the increase predated social media, so there was not a simple cause. The Wolfson Centre will focus on five scientific areas: examining data to track children over time to better understand how anxiety and depression develop looking at the role of genetic and environmental factors on anxiety and depression in young people developing earlier intervention to help young people cope better when a parent suffers from depression, something Cardiff University has already been working on for a decade looking at the role schools play in promoting positive mental health in youngsters, including working with all secondary schools in Wales working jointly with Swansea University to use anonymous medical records to better understand the long-term outcomes of young people with anxiety and depression Co-director Stephan Collishaw added: ""Wales is a living lab of some 1.3m young people. ""This major investment will allow us not only to understand the causes of anxiety and depression but help create early interventions to ensure that young people get the right help, advice and support they need."" Survey of 3,000 children, aged 11 to 19 44%didnât find support at school helpful 56%wouldnât feel confident approaching teachers or other staff 22%had accessed support for their mental health in school 48%wouldnât know where to go to access support within school Mental health charity Mind Cymru said in the last year to June there had been 21,000 referrals and its recent survey of hundreds of children found one in seven describing their mental health as either poor or very poor. Policy officer Rhiannon Hedge said the new centre would help identify gaps in support. ""There are a lot of things we don't know, the rise of social media is still an area of very little research, exam stress, job prospects - all of those sorts of things can impact on children and young people,"" she said. Pupils in Cardiff say exams and social media can bring pressures At Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bro Edern in Cardiff, there are health and wellbeing lessons and a counsellor. Teachers also believe there is far more openness about mental health issues now. But there are also more expectations and less downtime. ""I feel young people are under far more pressure than they were 20 or 30 years ago,"" said Alan Williams, the deputy head teacher. ""There's more pressure on examinations, there's a focus on it in the media, schools are held accountable but unintentionally, more pressure is passed onto young children."" He believes there is also less quality time spent away from social media. Sixth former Grace, 17, echoes this. ""Some people rely on social media for validation - it's something you put on yourself but then you've got to step away from it for a bit and I think that's really hard for some people."" Olwen, 13, said: ""You're expected to feel, act or behave in a certain way - whether comparing yourself to celebrities or just the more popular groups in school. It can be hard if you're not included."" Gwion, 15, added: ""One of the main things is exam pressure - it's huge - and social media, you're always comparing yourself to people who have the perfect life or mindset. You can see it every minute of every day. Before phones were around, if you had an argument or were getting bullied, it would stop at the end of the day when the bell went.  Now it's a constant 24/7 and you're more vulnerable."" He would like to see the support available at all schools. Child mental health 'must be priority' Children as young as six self-harming Prof Rice said it would be important to involve young people themselves when it comes to improving services. The Wolfson Centre's plans include developing the next generation of youth mental health experts and holding an annual adolescent mental health summer school for training. The Wolfson Foundation is a charity which has already made Â£900m worth of grants and was set up in the name of the late mail-order tycoon and philanthropist Sir Isaac Wolfson.

Firefighters call for protection against cancer,"This video can not be played 'I'm proud that I did it, but looking back it shortened my life' Firefighters have called for more protection after research found they were being exposed to dangerously high levels of harmful chemicals. Their plea echoed scientific research that said firefighters were at risk of getting cancer because of contaminated clothing and equipment. For the first time, the UK's chief fire officer has acknowledged the high rate of cancer among his colleagues. The Fire Brigades Union has called on the government to protect firefighters. Union spokesman Chris Moore, a firefighter in South Shields, has himself been receiving treatment for an incurable cancer. ""Up and down the country firefighters are dying of this, due to them saving lives in the line of duty, and their job is killing them,"" said Mr Moore. ""The government needs to wake up and realise, 'OK there could well be a link here, in the interim term, while we work out what's going on, this is what we're going to put in place'. ""Give us better protective equipment. More of it, so when it gets dirty we put it away and we can put a clean fresh set on. ""At the moment we're having to turn out to fires with kit that's already dirty, because we've got one set in the washing machine and the one we've got is already dirty. Chris Moore has stage three non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of blood cancer ""We're there to protect the community. We need our employers and the government to protect us."" The government said it was vital every possible measure was in place to protect firefighters. Harmful carcinogens can also be transferred from one place to another, for example when firefighters get on to an engine after a blaze Fire chemistry and toxicity expert Prof Anna Stec has called on the the government to protect firefighters by providing them with the best preventative medical care, education and support, while investing in guidance and research to ensure best practice was followed. ""In my opinion, there is a direct link between firefighters' occupation and cancer,"" she said. ""Firefighters are twice as likely to die when compared to the general population - and they're dying from not one type of cancer, but they've got multiple types. ""Yet in the UK absolutely nothing is done to address, generally, fire toxicity or firefighters' health."" There are toxins and carcinogens in all fires, whether a family barbecue or a house fire Prof Stec and her team of researchers at the University of Central Lancashire said firefighters' risk of developing cancer was increased by dangerously high levels of harmful chemicals remaining on their protective gear following exposure to smoke. According to Prof Stec's research, firefighters' leading cause of exposure to carcinogens was not inhalation but absorption via the skin. That absorption automatically increased in hot environments that led to sweating and dehydration, meaning the firefighters became ""a sponge for all the fire toxins"". Firefighting remained an unregulated occupation in the UK in terms of long-term health protection, according tothe team at the University of Central Lancashire,external, and there was currently no national directive or standard to tell firefighters how their kit should be cleaned. Instead it has been left to individual brigades to decide for themselves. Researchers have said the methods used to clean firefighters' protective clothing and equipment were not effectively implemented, which has caused protective gear to be contaminated for its next use, meaning the length of time that skin is exposed to fire toxins was increased. 'I watched my stabbed son die on the Underground' Attenborough's plea to save 'magical' kelp forests High tides and rain put South coast on alert Firefighters' uniforms have been found to contain high levels of carcinogens, particularly in the helmets, especially when gloves are stored in them The UK's chief fire officer Chris Davies said: ""There is a lot of scientific and medical information out there but all of it, that I'm aware of, states that you can't prove or disprove a link to cancer. ""What I do acknowledge is firefighters are contracting certain types of cancer above the population norm, I accept that and that is a concern. ""What I want to stress is that we're not just sat back waiting, we are developing this all the time. It does sound frustratingly slow, I will acknowledge that, but the assurances that I want to give is there is an incredible amount of work going on in the background to make this happen as quickly as possible. ""But, I do acknowledge that that's not quick enough for some people."" Chief fire officer Chris Davies' acknowledgement of medical statistics is the first time officials have accepted firefighters are getting sick at a higher rate than average Firefighters past and present have described a ""macho culture"" that once prevailed in the fire brigade. Having dirty kit was seen as a ""seal of approval"" and a sign of firefighters having worked harder than their colleagues. Breathing apparatus was described as heavy and difficult to service and those who wore it were often regarded as ""wimps"". Firefighters often worked without the apparatus, earning them the nickname ""smoke eaters"". Researchers say cancer is the leading cause of death among line of duty firefighters Gerard Hollingworth from Bradford worked as a firefighter and a fire instructor and now has cancer of the blood. He recalled still wearing dirty kit while having tea and cakes on his break after a training exercise. ""Looking back, it's now shortened my life,"" said Mr Hollingworth. ""We've got firefighters getting cancer on all watches and all stations and things need to be done about it. ""I'm angry after all this time that it's going through Congress in America, yet nothing seems to be happening in the UK."" In the United States, President Donald Trump has acknowledged a potential link between being a firefighter and contracting cancer, signing the9/11 Victims Compensation Fundfor first responders, meaning firefighters who had become sick from toxic exposure could claim health care compensation. Research, believed to be the first of its kind in the UK, has started to analyse levels of contamination, with fire services having to opt-in to have their staff tested. Firefighters in East Sussex, Hampshire, Essex, Kent, West Midlands and Staffordshire have provided samples for the research with results expected to be published at the end of 2020. Dr Emily Watkins, a physiologist based at the University of Brighton, is conducting research by taking samples of firefighters' blood and urine to analyse contamination levels The Home Office said it had supported the National Fire Chiefs Council in establishing a health and wellbeing board focusing on prevention and early intervention. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Our firefighters put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe, and it is vital that every possible measure is in place to mitigate the risks they take.""

Saudi prince warns of threat to global oil supply,"This video can not be played Saudi crown prince: Oil attack ""hit the heart of the global energy industry"" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has warned that oil prices may soar if the world does not act to deter Iran. He said failure to act could embolden Iran and lead to war, which he said would ruin the global economy. The prince was speaking after an attack on oil facilities which he blames on Tehran. Iran said the remarks would ""bring [the Saudis] nothing but shame"". Mohammed bin Salman also said he accepted some responsibility for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing. But, speaking to CBS News, he denied personally ordering it. The prince, who is considered the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, is suspected of personally targeting Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist critical of the government in Riyadh. Mr Khashoggi was killed in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey on 2 October 2018. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes news programme on Sunday,,externalhe said: ""I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it [the killing] was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government."" The secret tapes of Jamal Khashoggi's murder Who's using armed drones in the Middle East? Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals However, he denied ordering the killing of Mr Khashoggi directly, or having knowledge of it at the time. Saudi authorities have since blamed a ""rogue"" operation for his murder and put 11 men on trial. You may also be interested in: This video can not be played Investigators who have heard a recording of Khashoggi's interrogation describe his final moments The secret tapes of Khashoggi's murder The prince also appeared to offer talks for a political solution to the civil war in Yemen, where government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition are fighting Houthi rebels supported by Iran. Iran is Saudi Arabia's regional rival and an opponent of the US, which pulled out of a treaty aimed at limiting Tehran's nuclear programme after Mr Trump took power. US-Iran tensions have risen markedly this year, with the US blaming Iran on attacks on six oil tankers in the Gulf between May and July. Tehran rejects the accusations. There are subtle clues in this interview as to why the Saudi response to the 14 September drone and missile attacks has been so restrained. Note that the crown prince warns that a war with Iran would be catastrophic, not just for his country but for the global economy. Four years ago, when MBS committed his forces to the disastrous war in Yemen, his response might have been bolder. But the Yemen war has not gone as the Saudis intended while their enemy, the Houthi rebels, are launching ever increasing numbers of drones and missiles across the common border. The recent attacks on the Saudi oil industry, widely blamed on Iran, did real damage. So the Saudis now know just how vulnerable their critical infrastructure is to any Iranian strike. On the Khashoggi murder, the crown prince's ""taking of responsibility"" is a belated acknowledgment of how much unease there still is about this incident in the West. But that, of course, is not the same as admitting any involvement in it, which he and his government still deny. Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities earlier in September, whichknocked out about 5% of global oil supply and sent oil prices soaring. But Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the Saudi throne, said: ""If the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests. Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region ""Oil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven't seen in our lifetimes."" This video can not be played Abqaiq was struck in the early hours of Saturday morning He said the Middle East region ""represents about 30% of the world's energy supplies, about 20% of global trade passages, about 4% of the world GDP"". ""Imagine all of these three things stop. This means a total collapse of the global economy, and not just Saudi Arabia or the Middle East countries,"" the prince said. He blamed Iranian ""stupidity"" for the attacks, saying there was no strategic goal. Saudi Arabia says 18 drones and seven cruise missiles were fired on the country's two oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais on 14 September. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have said they were behind the attacks. A week after the facilities were hit, theUS pledged to send troops to Saudi Arabiato help defend against further attacks. The prince urged Iran to cease its support for Houthi rebels, saying it would be ""much easier"" to bring the war to an end. ""Today we open all initiatives for a political solution in Yemen,"" he said. ""We hope this happens today rather than tomorrow."" Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? He welcomed a Houthi ceasefire, announced several days ago, as a ""positive step"" towards political dialogue. The civil war has triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with 80% of the population  requiring humanitarian assistance or protection. More than 70,000 people are believed to have died since 2016 as a result of the conflict, according to UN estimates. The crown prince said he would ""personally follow up"" onallegations that women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was tortured in jail. Ms Hathloul and other activists have been in custody for more than a year, despite organising a successful campaign for rights such as that of a woman to drive and travel without a man's permission. But the prince said the decision whether or not to release the activists lay not with him, but with the public prosecutor. Asked why they had been jailed, he said laws had to be respected, even though there were some he disagreed with. Who's using armed drones in the Middle East?

PM 'model of restraint' amid language row,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I think I've been the model of restraint"" Boris Johnson says he has been ""a model of restraint"" when it comes to language around the Brexit debate. The PM was accused of dismissing abuse fears of female MPs as ""humbug"" during a heated Commons debate this week. Mr Johnson said there had been a ""misunderstanding"" over his intention - which he apologised for. But he claimed there was a ""cloud of indignation"" around the use of terms like ""surrender"" to distract from MPs' desire to frustrate Brexit. Labour's Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson should be ""absolutely, utterly ashamed of himself"". The shadow education secretary said the PM had ""a direct strategy to divide our country"", which she called ""really damaging"", but added that MPs on both sides of the Commons needed to ""dial down that language and act responsibly"". Tory conference: Five things to look out for in Manchester Conservative conference call to 'get Brexit done' Downing St language 'incites violence', says former Tory minister Mr Johnson spoke to the BBC's Andrew Marr ahead of the start of the Conservative Party conference in Manchester. The annual gathering follows a turbulent week for the PM - facing stormy scenes in Westminster after a ruling by the Supreme Court that his suspension of Parliament was unlawful. Rows later broke out over Mr Johnson's Commons conduct- andthat of his Attorney General Geoffrey Cox- andquestions are also continuing over his linkswith US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. But he will use the conference to try to focus on delivering Brexit and making funding promises for public services. On the opening day, ministers havepromised to spend billions on hospital projectsacross England in the next decade. This video can not be played Furious MPs confront Boris Johnson over his language But opposition MPs back in London couldstage a no-confidence vote in the governmentsome time this week. No 10 failed to secure a recess for the conference, meaning Tory MPs could face travelling between Manchester and Westminster for crucial votes while it takes place. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is also expected to bring opposition leaders together at a meeting on Monday to plan their next steps to avert a no-deal Brexit. Mr Corbyn has said he would be ready to become a caretaker PM if Mr Johnson was forced from No 10. This video can not be played Corbyn: Emergency government 'more likely every day' Greater Manchester Police said they were expecting tens of thousands of protesters to attend two rallies on Sunday against Brexit and austerity. A small number of demonstrators also gathered outside the conference venue on Saturday night when Mr Johnson arrived with his partner, Carrie Symonds. Speaking to Andrew Marr, Mr Johnson defended his decision to repeatedly refer to the Benn Act - which is designed to force the PM to seek an extension rather than lead the country into a no-deal Brexit - as ""the surrender bill"". Last week, Labour's Paula Sheriff said threats made to her and other MPs often quoted his ""dangerous"" language of ""surrender"" and ""betrayal"". She also referred to the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016, but Mr Johnson replied: ""I've never heard such humbug in all my life."" Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds arrived in Manchester on Saturday evening The PM said any such threats were ""deplorable"" but he did not regret ""using the word surrender to describe the surrender act"". ""Military metaphors are old, standard, Parliamentary terms,"" he continued. ""I think everybody should calm down,"" he said, but asked whether that included him, he added: ""I think I've been the model of restraint."" The Jo Cox Foundation - set up in memory of the murdered MP - hascalled on all political parties to agree to a code of conduct to help protect MPs. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the UK's most senior Catholic clergyman, warned some of the language being used could encourage violent extremists. He told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme political leaders had a particular responsibility to be respectful in public discourse. Commons Speaker John Bercow will hold an emergency meeting on Monday with party leaders over the use of ""inflammatory language"" in Parliament. Hilary Benn presented the bill in his name to Parliament When Mr Johnson talks about the ""surrender bill"", he is referring to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act, also known as the Benn Act after Labour MP Hilary Benn, who introduced the legislation to the Commons. The act - which became law earlier this month - stipulates the prime minister will have until 19 October to either pass a deal in Parliament or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit. Once this deadline has passed, he will have to request an extension to the UK's departure date to 31 January 2020 from the EU. If the EU responds by proposing a different date, the PM will have two days to accept that proposal. But during this two-day period, MPs - not the government - will have the opportunity to reject the EU's date. On Brexit, Mr Johnson said he still thought there was a ""good chance"" of getting a deal with the EU and the government was ""working incredibly hard"". Success depended on ""the common sense of our EU partners"", he argued, but said talks were ""not being helped"" by the Benn Act. ""If they suspect or think there is a realistic chance the UK can be kept in [the EU], that clearly takes away a lot of our negotiating freedom."" The PM insisted that ""of course"" the UK could still leave without a deal on 31 October despite the act - although he would not be drawn on how that could happen. Mr Johnson also ruled out bringing back the withdrawal agreement negotiated between Theresa May and the EU, and dismissed suggestions he could resign rather than ask for an extension. There's no sign whatsoever of Boris Johnson retreating from his strategy - the approach he's taken since he moved into Downing Street. And as far as many people in his team, and the wider party, are concerned their only real path to success is to stick to trying get Brexit done by 31 October. The tricky thing is, though, that it looks very unlikely - maybe even impossible. And there are plenty of people in Westminster who say they're prepared to do everything necessary to stop Mr Johnson doing what he wants to do - taking the UK out without a deal on that date if one isn't agreed. Party conferences are pretty much always like being in a parallel universe, but this week is going to be something else. Parliament will still be sitting while the Conservatives are gathering here in Manchester and it could certainly be a surreal and bumpy few days. Meanwhile,the Sunday Times has fresh allegations,externalabout the American businesswoman at the centre of claims about her links to the prime minister. The paper claims Jennifer Arcuri told four friends that she had an affair with Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London. On Friday, the Greater London Authority (GLA) referred Mr Johnson to the police watchdog over allegations Ms Arcuri, a US technology entrepreneur, received favourable treatment because of her friendship with him. Inside the conference hall, the ""Get Brexit Done"" message was clear But outside, protesters unhappy with Brexit and Conservative policies took to the streets She joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor and her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. The Independent Office for Police Conduct will now consider whether there are grounds to investigate the prime minister for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office. But Mr Johnson insisted he had ""no interest to declare"" when pressed by Andrew Marr over whether he made his personal relationship with her known at the time. ""Everything was was done with full propriety,"" he added. The PM also appeared to claim the story was politically motivated, saying someone in his position ""expects a lot of shot and shell"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety' As well as promises on hospitals, the government is also announcing a new approach to NHS mental health treatment to be trialled in 12 areas of England - with housing and job support alongside psychological help. Chancellor Sajid Javid is expected to speak on Monday and Home Secretary Priti Patel - talking about tackling crime - on Tuesday. Animal welfare policies, environmental plans - including a proposed Â£1bn fund to boost the electric motor industry and a pledge to plant one million new trees -are on the agenda.

Chancellor to outline Â£25bn road upgrade projects,"This video can not be played The chancellor says Britain could still leave the EU without a deal The chancellor has promised ""a significant economic policy response"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Sajid Javid did not give details, but the BBC's Norman Smith said it could mean tax cuts to help mitigate the potential impact. Mr Javid is setting out plans for infrastructure investment on the second day of the Tory conference. But the event has so far been overshadowed by claims Boris Johnson touched a female journalist's thigh. The allegation - which the PM has denied - relates to a lunch in 1999 when Mr Johnson was the editor of the Spectator magazine. Meanwhile, as the Tories gather in Manchester other MPs will be in Westminster after they voted down a motion to grant a three-day recess to cover the conference, andopposition parties were expected to meet to discuss their next moves on Brexit. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme they were ""prepared and ready in Parliament to respond to anything that comes out of Downing Street"". The SNP has also said the party wants to look at the possibility of holding ano confidence vote in the governmentthis week. Tory conference: Five things to look out for in Manchester PM 'model of restraint' amid language row Three Brexit champions hammer home PM's message Minister 'looking seriously' at compulsory vaccines The theme of the conference in Manchester is ""Get Brexit Done"" and Mr Javid insisted the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October - with or without a deal. That is despite a law - the Benn Act - being passed by MPs which stipulates that the government must ask for an extension to the Brexit deadline if a deal is not agreed by 19 October. Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? What is a vote of no confidence? The chancellor said the government had been working on ""mitigations"" which mean ""we will be able to deal with many of the disruptions"" of a no-deal if agreement cannot be reached with the bloc before the deadline. He said he would give more detail in his speech later, but told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm clear that if it was no deal there would be a significant economic policy response. ""You have the independent Bank of England that will almost certainly think about a monetary policy response and that's for them. ""I will be thinking about a fiscal and other economic policy response."" But Mr Javid admitted he was not sure how much a no-deal Brexit would cost the economy in the short-term, saying: ""I don't think anyone really knows a full proper answer to that question."" Elsewhere, the Scottish Conservatives' interim leader Jackson Carlawsaid the party would not support a further delayto Brexit and had dropped the opposition to no-deal advanced by his predecessor Ruth Davidson. The Tories have so far made spending vows of more than Â£50bn at their conference. That includes an announcement later of Â£25bn for England's roads as well as Â£5bn for ultrafast broadband in some of the UK's ""hardest to reach parts"". The conference comes aftera stormy week for their leaderMr Johnson - includingallegations about his links to a US businesswomanand culminating on Sunday in the accusations by journalist Charlotte Edwardes. On BBC Breakfast, Mr Javid refused to comment on the ""personal allegations"" against the PM, adding: ""I have full faith in the prime minister and I don't doubt that and what he has said for a second."" However, former cabinet minister Justine Greening told Today the allegations were ""deeply concerning"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Channel 4 News he knew Ms Edwardes well and she was ""trustworthy"". The banners that dangle from the conference hall ceiling here tell a story. Invest, invest, invest they say - in schools, the NHS and the police. In other words, spend, spend, spend. What a contrast with a few years ago, when the focus was on cuts. The Conservatives argue that is because the public finances can now support a new approach. But vast uncertainty still swirls around Brexit - and what it might mean for the national balance sheet. Since the start of this conference, the party has fleshed out details on how it will spend more than Â£50bn. Chancellor Sajid Javid will later make his contribution to this tally with promises on roads, buses and broadband. The chancellor will say the full benefits of his infrastructure investment ""may not be felt for some time"", but ""the work must start here and now"". The Â£25bn pot had already been set aside provisionally by his predecessor, Philip Hammond, but Mr Javid will confirm it will be spent on upgrades for 14 of England's major roads, including: Completing the dualling of the A66 Trans-Pennine expressway and the A46 Newark bypass Improving the M60 Simister Island interchange in Manchester Starting construction on the A428 to improve journeys between Cambridge and Milton Keynes and widening the A12 in east England At least Â£5bn will also be set aside to maintain and renew other strategic roads between 2020 and 2025. The chancellor will renew a pledge made earlier this month to invest Â£220m into improved bus services in England, including Â£50m for the country's first all-electric bus town or city. And he will set a goal for contactless payments to be made available on every city bus. Plans for so-called superbus networks, where local authorities will invest in bus lanes in exchange for more services from operators, will also be announced. A pilot is planned for Cornwall in 2020. Other promises unveiled on Monday include: A Â£5bn investment to support the roll-out of gigabit-capable internet, and mobile networks - including 5G. An ambition to connect the hardest-to-reach 20% of the country - upping the earlier target of 10% - but a deadline to reach this goal has not been confirmed. A pledge by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick to give tenants in new housing association properties the right to shared ownership of their home. Plans to create a simpler planning system to speed up the building of new homes. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused the Tories of only offering ""a combination of re-announcements and damp squibs"". He added the announcements showed ""the real difference between the parties"" with the Tories were ""tinkering around the edges, while Labour was proposing a fundamental shift of power and wealth from the few to the many"".
