UK and Australia agree 'vast majority' of trade dealA full trade agreement in principle should be agreed between the UK and Australia by JuneBusiness,"A free trade deal between the UK and Australia will reduce extra costs and taxes on exports and imports between the two countries The UK and Australia say they have agreed ""the vast majority"" of a free trade deal. After talks on Friday in London the two said they aim to seal a deal by June. ""Both countries are confident the remaining issues will be resolved, and will now enter a sprint to agree the outstanding details with the aim of reaching agreement in principle,"" a joint statement said. It is estimated a deal could add Â£500m ($694m) to UK GDP over the long-term. The final day of talks between UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan ended in London without a deal but both sides will spend the next few weeks ironing out the outstanding issues standing in the way of an agreement. Ms Truss said the trade deal between the two countries ""will help us emerge stronger from the pandemic, strengthening ties between two democracies who share a fierce belief in freedom, enterprise and fair play"". If concluded, the UK-Australia free trade agreement will be one of the first post-Brexit trade deals negotiated by the UK that is not a ""rollover deal"", a replica of a trading arrangement earlier negotiated on the UK's behalf by the European Union. The UK inked a trade deal with Japan in October 2020. A free trade deal aims to encourage trade - usually in goods but occasionally in services - by making it cheaper. This is often achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs - taxes or charges by governments for trading goods across borders. Trade agreements also aim to remove quotas - which are limits on the amount of goods which can be traded. Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be checked.

French terror probe into deadly attack on police,"The Yvelines area west of Paris has been targeted by militant Islamists in the past A female police employee has been killed in a knife attack at a police station south-west of Paris. Anti-terror prosecutors have taken over the inquiry, and the killing is being treated as a possible terrorist attack. The attacker, who reportedly came to France from Tunisia several years ago, was shot dead by police. President Emmanuel Macron led tributes to the 49-year-old victim, and said France would never give in to ""Islamist terrorism"". The stabbing took place in the secure entrance to the police station in the commuter town of Rambouillet at 14:20 (12:20 GMT). Witnesses said the attacker had been seen walking around while on his mobile phone outside the police station and seized his chance to go in as the woman - an unarmed administrative officer - went through the security doors. He reportedly lunged at the officer, stabbing her in the neck. Her colleagues then opened fire on him. Anti-terrorism prosecutors said they took over the investigation because of the way the attack had unfolded, remarks made by the attacker and the fact that he targeted a police official. Sources close to the inquiry told media outlets that the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) during the attack. Officials said the attacker, 36, was not previously known to security agencies. Local outlet BFMTV reported that he had lived in the country illegally before obtaining a residency card, which was due to expire later this year. Three people were arrested following the attack, according to reports. A judicial source told AFP news agency they were part of the suspect's ""entourage"". In a Twitter post following the attack, Mr Macron said the victim's name was StÃ©phanie. ""The nation is by the side of her family, her colleagues and security forces,"" he wrote. Her full name has not been released, but local media reports describe her as a mother of two. Prime Minister Jean Castex and Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin went straight to the scene, in the large Yvelines area to the west of the capital. Mr Castex said the country had lost an ""everyday heroine"" and condemned what he described as a ""barbaric act of boundless cruelty"". ""Our determination to combat terrorism in all its forms is as resolute as ever,"" he told reporters. ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse, president of the Paris region, said the attack had been against a ""symbol of France"". The police, she said, were ""the face of France"". Far-right leader Marine Le Pen - seen as the strongest challenger to Mr Macron in next year's presidential election - tweeted condemnation of Friday's attack before details of the suspect's identity had been made public. ""The same horrors come one after another, the same infinite sadness as we think about the relatives and the colleagues of this female police employee who has been killed, the same type of person guilty of this barbarity, the same Islamist motives,"" she wrote. Police cordoned off the area after their colleague was fatally stabbed British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also reacted to the attack on Twitter. ""We stand with our French friends and allies following tragic news of a female police officer killed by a terrorist in Rambouillet while doing her job,"" he wrote. In his comments on Friday, Mr Castex noted that the Yvelines area had been targeted before, including in 2016 when two members of the police force were fatally stabbed at their home. In October 2020 the militant Islamist murder of teacher Samuel Paty in Yvelines led to national outrage, as he was attacked after an online campaign that began with false claims from a 13-year-old girl at his school.

Jury clears XR protesters despite judge's ruling,"The defendants said they believed their actions had been ""necessary"" and ""proportionate"" Six Extinction Rebellion protesters have been cleared of causing criminal damage, despite a jury being told by the judge there was no defence in law for their actions. Activists targeted Shell's London HQ, claiming the oil firm was directly contributing to climate change. It was part of wider demonstrations across the capital on 15 April 2019. Judge Gregory Perrins said that even if their actions were ""morally justified"", that did not provide a lawful excuse. Southwark Crown Court had heard that each of the defendants deliberately sprayed graffiti or smashed windows at the Shell building in Belvedere Road, central London. The six acquitted activists were: Simon Bramwell, 49 (co-founder of Extinction Rebellion) from Stroud, Gloucestershire Ian Bray, 53 (co-founder) from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire Jane Augsburger, 55, from Stroud Senan Clifford, 60, from Stroud David Lambert, 62, from Stroud James ""Sid"" Saunders, 41, from Stroud With the exception of Mr Saunders - who claimed he honestly believed Shell's employees and shareholders would have consented to the damage he caused - the judge had told the jury: ""They don't have any defence in law for the charges they face."" After deliberating for just over seven hours, the jury of seven women and five men cleared the defendants of all charges. Before reaching their verdicts, the jurors had asked to see a copy of the oath they took when they were sworn in. Graffiti was left on Shell's London headquarters in April 2019 The six, who represented themselves, were also cleared of individual counts of having an article with intent to destroy or damage property. They told the court they had targeted the Shell building because the company was directly contributing to climate change, ""thereby causing serious injury and death"". They argued their actions were a ""necessary"" and ""proportionate"" response to the harm being caused. Prosecutor Diana Wilson had told the court that while some protesters merely stood outside the building holding banners or speaking through megaphones, ""these defendants went further"". She added: ""The seven involved caused significant damage."" What does Extinction Rebellion want? XR protesters charged over HSBC windows damage 50 arrests at London climate protest At the conclusion of the trial, the judge thanked the jurors for their ""care and attention"", adding: ""This has been an unusual case."" A seventh protester, Katerina Hasapopoulous, had previously pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage. The 43-year-old, from Stroud, will be sentenced at a later date. After he was cleared, Extinction Rebellion co-founder Mr Bramwell said she had only pleaded guilty because of childcare issues. 50 arrests at London climate protest BREAKING: Richmond Police appeal for help finding two men in connection with missing mother and son You can now use your phone on this tube line on the London Underground 'I love living on London's canals - now I'm being told I am no longer welcome' DLD Students embark on World Challenge Adventure in Morocco Marco Pierre White: New menu helps banish winter blues Bromley brothers accused of revenge porn, having Rambo knife and strangling woman Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction Warning on gas prices as cold snap hits supplies UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

India arrivals begin UK hotel quarantine,"The first people to arrive in the UK from India since the country was placed on the travel ""red list"" have entered hotel quarantine. British and Irish nationals and those with residency rights must isolate in approved accommodation for 10 days after rules changed overnight. India has seen a second wave of infections, with shortages of medical oxygen leaving some patients untreated. Some British Asians have spoken of the trauma of witnessing India's surge. Meeta Joshi, from Guildford, Surrey, described how she has lost nine close relatives and friends in India in the past week - four due to Covid. ""One was an aunt I have known since I was bornâ¦ I was in communication with her regularly through mobile calls,"" she said. ""Life is so fragile and there is no guarantee. Until February, everything was looking fine in India."" Meeta Joshi is coping with the loss of nine close relatives or friends in the past week - four of whom died with Covid Ashree Singh described ""a state of mental agony"" as relatives and friends sent worsening updates from the country on messaging apps. The NHS worker who lives in London said she had a ""feeling of worthlessness and helplessness when you're seeing your family, relatives and friends suffering and dying"". On Friday, India reported 332,730 new cases of coronavirus, setting a world record for a second day running. Deaths were numbered at 2,263 in 24 hours as crematoriums organise mass funeral pyres. Ashree Singh is working for the NHS in London but is receiving concerning updates from relatives in India Passengers from one of the first scheduled commercial flights to land in the UK from India since the red list changed were seen being escorted to government-approved hotels at London's Heathrow Airport on Friday afternoon. TV chef Romy Gill returned from India before the travel rules changed on Thursday and is isolating in a hotel in Bristol. She praised the UK government's handling of the rules for those returning from the country. ""I was in India last November and what has been done now is completely different,"" she said. ""I think the [UK] government is doing what they should have done ages ago."" But some have spoken of their struggle to leave India amid restrictions on travel and widespread flight cancellations. Mukti Mulligan, from London but currently in Goa, told BBC Asian Network's Big Debate he lost out on tickets to return to the UK because his mandatory Covid test did not return within the time limit. Mukti Mulligan is visiting Goa and has described how Covid appears to affect ""pretty much everyone"" in India He said the situation in India was ""very worrying"" - though Goa seemed calmer than elsewhere - and he expressed surprise at how visible Covid was among his friends in their 20s and 30s. ""Even now a number of my friends are isolating, stuck in bed, most of them are not tested,"" he said. ""Almost certainly a vast majority have got Covid. ""We're talking about under 40s, mostly in their 20s and 30s. Pretty much everyone is affected in some way or another."" Deepa Bajaj, an IT consultant living in London, travelled back to India in early March to visit her elderly parents in Mumbai. When the red list change was announced, she secured a seat on a return flight back to the UK - but her mandatory pre-departure Covid tests returned positive results. Deepa Bajaj is isolating at a relative's home in India after her pre-departure Covid tests came back positive ""It was a bit shocking because I had no symptoms, I was being super careful, I don't even remember having gone out for the past five or six days,"" she told Asian Network. The 53-year-old is now experiencing Covid symptoms including a sore throat and fever but hopes to return to the UK once her she recovers from the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK stands ""ready to support our friends in India with whatever we can"". ""We are actively engaged with how we can support from where we are,"" he said. What is the India Covid variant? India is now on the red list - and where else? Why India is running out of oxygen again Friday's travel rule change means direct flights from India are still permitted, but UK and Irish nationals, as well as those with residency rights, must isolate in government-approved hotels - at their own cost - for 10 days. Travel to the UK is banned for all others who have been in red list countries in the past 10 days. There are 40 countries on thegovernment's red list,externalacross the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice. There are specific rules for people arriving in each UK nation, includingEngland,external,Scotland,external,Northern Ireland,externalandWales,external. Public Health England (PHE) confirmed on Thursday thata further 55 cases,externalof the virus variant first identified in India - known as B.1.617 - were found in the UK in the latest week to 14 April. PHE experts are currently unsure whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity. Meanwhile, scientific advisers to the UK government are increasingly optimistic that Covid restrictions will continue to lift in line with the roadmap in England - with hints this could include ditching the requirement for face coverings in many indoor settings during the summer. But there is an expectation that some of the precautions such as masks and social distancing, if eased over the summer, may have to be brought back in the autumn to prevent further surges of cases. The latest R number range for England was estimated to be 0.8 to 1.0, with a growth rate indicating the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1% and 5% every day. The UK reported a further 2,678 coronavirus cases on Friday. Another 40 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded, a slight rise on recent days.

"Science advisers call for better PPE for medicsDoctors say it's a ""crack of light"" after more than a year of campaigning for improved equipment.Health","The surgical-style mask that may now be ditched in favour of higher grade masks Healthcare workers have welcomed a change in scientific advice on how to protect them from coronavirus. A document by the government's scientific advisory group (Sage) says higher grade masks may be needed when caring for Covid patients. Current guidance says that thinner surgical masks are adequate, outside of intensive care units. The Department of Health said guidance ""is kept under constant review"" and protecting NHS staff was a priority. Some doctors described it as a ""crack of light"" after more than a year of campaigning for improvements. A long list of healthcare unions and professional bodies has been making increasingly desperate appeals for what are called FFP3 respirators. These are designed to filter out infectious aerosols that may be lingering in the air, particularly in close proximity to patients. Growing evidence of the risks of airborne transmission has led the government to emphasise the importance of ventilation - with the words ""fresh air"" now added to the public messaging. And now a technical document released by Sage concludes that healthcare workers may need higher standards of respiratory protective equipment (RPE). It says that where there's ""an unacceptable risk of transmission"", and other measures have already been applied, ""it may be necessary to consider the extended use of appropriate RPE (such as FFP3 masks)"". Dr Matt Butler, a consultant in geriatrics in Cambridge, said: ""This is huge, it's the first time they've acknowledged this, it's a crack of light."" He has long argued that surgical masks don't offer enough protection against aerosols, and that FFP3 masks should instead be issued to all medics caring for confirmed or suspected Covid patients. As the guidance stands, they are only worn in intensive care units or where certain ""aerosol generating procedures"" are carried out. How healthcare workers came to feel 'expendable' When can we stop wearing masks and face coverings? PPE fixer who was Tory donor named in admin error The new scientific assessment has yet to be adopted by the authorities in charge of the rules on PPE. But Dr Butler hopes that will follow, and that the lull in the numbers being admitted to hospital will allow stocks of the devices to be built up and for staff to be fitted for them. ""We've got a bit of reprieve until the next wave or peak, so now's the time to get ready,"" he said. At least 23 hospital trusts have broken with the official guidelines by giving the Covid-facing staff FFP3 masks. Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP in north Wales who helped to set up the FreshAirNHS campaign group, says the shift in scientific advice marks a significant moment. ""It feels like a door that was locked has now been opened, at least slightly, and it sounds like the science on airborne transmission is starting to be recognised."" The Sage document points out that FFP3 masks are ""intrusive and can be uncomfortable to wear"". And it warns that they need to be properly worn and can give a false sense of security, with a risk of self-contamination as staff touch them or remove them. This follows multiple official reviews which have concluded that there is no need to change policy on PPE. The Royal College of Nursing's professional lead for infection prevention and control, Rose Gallagher, said: ""This is a step in the right direction. ""What we need is for the UK's infection prevention and control guidance to reflect this change, so that health and care organisations feel confident they can apply it in line with local circumstances and risks. ""We have heard many reports from our members that their employers do not feel able to deviate from the letter of national guidance for fear of being criticised. ""We hope that this change will empower to them to find local solutions that offer a greater level of protection to nurses, midwives and patients."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The safety of NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work round the clock to deliver PPE that helps protect those on the frontline. ""Guidance on the appropriate levels and standards of PPE is written by experts and agreed by all four UK chief medical officers.

Arsenal apologised in an open letter to their fans following their withdrawal from the Super League and said they had ""made a mistake"", adding they were withdrawing after listening to them and the ""wider football community"". The Gunners board said they did not intend to ""cause such distress"" and that they joined the Super League because they ""did not want to be left behind"" and wanted to ensure the club's future. ""Our aim is always to make the right decisions for this great football club, to protect it for the future and to take us forward,"" they added.

US President Biden to visit UK in June,"US President Joe Biden will visit the UK in June for his first overseas trip since his election victory last year. The president will travel to Cornwall for the G7 summit, which takes place between 11 and 13 June. From there, he will travel to Brussels, in Belgium, to participate in the Nato Summit on 14 June. President Biden's trip will focus on ""restoring our alliances"" and ""revitalising the Transatlantic relationship"", the White House said. During his time in the UK, Mr Biden is due to hold bilateral meetings with fellow G7 leaders, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson. PM talks to Biden in first call since inauguration Biden: 'Decisive decade' to tackle climate change G7 to have 5,500 police and no St Ives trains ""This trip will highlight his commitment to restoring our alliances, revitalising the transatlantic relationship, and working in close cooperation with our allies and multilateral partners to address global challenges and better secure America's interests,"" the president's press secretary said. The G7 summit is an opportunity to ""reinforce our commitment to multilateralism, work to advance key US policy priorities on public health, economic recovery, and climate change, and demonstrate solidarity and shared values among major democracies,"" they added. The UK, US, Germany, France, Canada, Italy and Japan make up the G7, while leaders from Australia, India, South Korea and the EU will also attend the summit as guests. It will be held in Carbis Bay, near St Ives. The US president's trip to the UK will be his first to any nation since defeating Donald Trump in November's election. Following his victory, Mr Biden also chose to call the UK prime minister before any other European leader. During that call, the two leaders talked about ""the benefits of a potential free trade deal"" between the UK and the US, with Mr Johnson reiterating his intention ""to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible"", Downing Street said at the time. Mr Johnson raised the benefits of a UK-US trade deal during a phone call with Mr Biden in January Both Mr Johnson and Mr Biden have been taking part in a climate action summit - hosted by the US - this week. The US has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by the year 2030. This new target, which wasunveiled at a virtual summit of 40 global leaders,essentially doubles their previous promise. Earlier in the week, it was revealed that the UK hopes tocut its own carbon emissions by 78% by 2035.

Desperation as Indian hospitals buckle under Covid,"This video can not be played Inside a Delhi hospital running low on beds and oxygen India's healthcare system is buckling as a record surge in Covid-19 cases puts pressure on hospital beds and drains oxygen supplies. Families are left pleading for their relatives who are desperately ill, with some patients left untreated for hours. Crematoriums are organising mass funeral pyres. On Friday India reported 332,730 new cases of coronavirus, setting a world record for a second day running. Deaths were numbered at 2,263 in 24 hours. Dr Atul Gogia, a consultant at the Sir Ganga Ram hospital in Delhi, told the BBC there had been a ""huge surge"" in patients, leaving no space in the emergency room. ""We do not have that many oxygen points. Whatever oxygen points are there, they're full. Patients are coming in with their own oxygen cylinders or without oxygen. We want to help them but there are not enough beds and not enough oxygen points even to supply them oxygen if it is there,"" he said. ""All our telephone lines are jammed. People are continuously calling the helpline. There is a big rush outside the hospital: there are ambulances parked, patients wanting to get deboarded, but the problem is, there is no space. ""We try to mobilise, we try to discharge patients who become stable as early as possible so that we can increase the turnaround, but things are difficult right now."" Have India's rallies help spread coronavirus? Why India is running out of oxygen again Every morning, for the past few days, I have been waking up to my phone buzzing with desperate messages for help. People are seeking hospital beds, life-saving drugs, oxygen and plasma for their infected and sick friends and relatives. Often, after a period of silence, the same people announce the deaths of their ""patients"". My Twitter timeline is India's Covid-19 war-room, as the state appears to have largely withered away. Every essential to save a life is in short supply or available on the black market. Then there's the fear of the virus literally ""at your door"". Over the past week, three buildings in the gated complex where I live have become ""containment zones"", with entire skyscrapers sealed because of too many infections. The days and nights are filled with helplessness, anxiety and fear. The bad news is unrelenting. The Supreme Court of India has called this a ""national emergency"". This is beyond an emergency. It is a ""complete collapse of the goddamn system"", as one of India's leading virologists says. In hotspots like Delhi and Mumbai, life, itself, is now a privilege. Maharashtra, the worst-hit state in India, faces an oxygen shortfall. In the state capital, Mumbai,at least 13 patients died after a fire broke out in an intensive care unitof a hospital treating Covid patients. Two days earlier, 24 Covid patients died in another part of the state after a leak interrupted the flow of oxygen to their ventilators. Why second Covid wave is devastating India How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave On Friday morning, Max Healthcare, which runs 10 private hospitals aroundDelhi, put out an ""SOS"" message, saying it had less than an hour's supply remaining at two of its sites. The shortage was later resolved. Three other states -Gujarat, Uttar PradeshandHaryana- are also facing a critical shortage. The Indian Air Force is being used to lift oxygen tankers and supplies to different parts of the country. Crematoriums have resorted to mass funeral pyres as the number of bodies from Covid victims continues to rise A separation process takes air and splits it into various gases, including oxygen. The oxygen is then purified, super-cooled and stored as a liquid, which is less bulky than keeping it as a gas. The compressed oxygen is used to fill insulated tanks, which supply hospitals, or canisters for individual patients. A vaporiser is used to turn the oxygen back into a gas before it is delivered to patients. Hospitals are struggling to get enough oxygen for Covid patients Cases have surged during India's second wave, driven by a number of factors. Health protocols have been lax, with mask mandates sporadically enforced. Millions of people attended a Hindu festival, the Kumbh Mela, which culminated 10 days ago with a mass dip in the River Ganges. New strains of the virus have emerged, including a ""double mutant"" strain. Bollywood composer Shravan Rathod tested positive shortly after returning from the citywhere the Kumbh Mela was held and died not long after, his family confirmed. As well as the Indian double-mutant strain, the UK strain is the primary variant found in the state of Punjab, National Centre for Disease Control Director Sujeet Kumar Singh told local media. The UK strain is also particularly prevalent in Maharashtra and the city of Delhi, he added. Dr Saswati Sinha, a critical care specialist in the eastern city of Kolkata, said emergency rooms and wards were packed to capacity. ""We are getting direct calls from our patients, our acquaintances, our neighbours: they are pleading with us to be able to accommodate some of their next of kin. But unfortunately, our situation is such that, although we are trying our best, we still have a huge number of patients whom we are not able to accommodate,"" she told the BBC. ""In 20 years of working in intensive care, I have never seen anything of this kind, ever."" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met chief ministers of the most affected states and oxygen manufacturers on Friday. He asked states to work together to stop hoarding and black marketeering, saying that the government was also looking at diverting industrial oxygen to ease the crisis.

Dozens queue overnight to snap up new houses,"This video can not be played Aberdare: Buyers queue overnight to nab new homes Thirteen houses have sold in less than three hours after dozens of people slept outside an estate agent to bid for new homes in Aberdare. Up to 30 people arrived at Bidmead Cook on Thursday with chairs, blankets and prosecco, preparing for a long wait. Estate agent Gavin Williams said he had never seen buyers queuing overnight in his professional life. The scenes - more than 18 hours before the 14 homes went on sale - were described as ""completely bonkers."" Angharad Hamilton-Shaw, 32, from Cwmaman, was first in line having began queuing at 15:15 BST the previous day. ""Originally we planned to go queue at midnight but with more interest, the time got earlier and earlier,"" she said. ""And it's a good job we did as the next person came around four o'clock. ""People were still coming in the early hours and then walking away once they asked those of us queuing which properties we were interested in - it was really heart-breaking."" People ordered pizza and coffee was handed out as they queued in order to be first in line Ms Hamilton-Shaw said family and friends queued through the night in shifts to make sure to help secure her ""forever home."" ""It has been really emotional, just feelings of excitement and anxiety,"" she said. ""It was really cold throughout the night, but everyone seemed to be in good spirits and that helped pass the time. ""And technically those of us that have got the properties are now all neighbours and we have made friends for once we move in."" Angharad (left) braved cold temperatures overnight to ensure to bought her ""forever home"" Hanna Owen sold her house in February and has been looking for another since the beginning of March. Despite seeing a few on the market, she has missed out until now. ""It's crazy, there are loads of people buying at the moment."" The 34-year-old from Aberdare said she was not planning on queuing for as long as she did. ""My mother-in-law walked past and told me there was already someone waiting there and she got in behind so we ended up being second in the queue. ""My sister-in-law and niece took over from 17:00 BST and then me and my mother-in-law were there from 22:00. ""It was freezing cold and my mother-in-law went back to the house numerous times to get bottles of water and flasks of tea,"" she said. She said it was definitely worth queueing - with the bonus being she got to meet her new neighbours. ""When my sister-in-law first suggested queuing so early I thought she was joking, but I am so glad I did - you have got to be in it to win it. ""It felt like such a long night but when I think it about it, it's gone so quickly, and it's only now kicking in that I we are homeowners,"" she said. Hanna Owen (right) and her mother-in-law (Linda Lewis) said it was freezing throughout the night but 'well worth it' Estate agent director Jeanne Fry-Thomas said she ""couldn't believe my eyes"" at the scenes and that colleagues had handed out coffee and donuts overnight to those waiting. The site called Cwm Heulwen, has three-bedroom properties priced at Â£184,950 and with four-bed homes coming in at Â£320,000. Working from home leads to house price rises House prices up 8.5% in 2020 amid tax holiday Currently, the average house price in Wales is Â£209,723,according to the Principality Building Society,external. Ms Thomas said homebuyers were now looking for extra space. ""People want gardens and more space,"" she said. ""It's bouncing and it's completely bonkers. It's local people, people moving from outside the area, investors - it's madness, our busiest offices are all the valleys offices. ""And we just don't have the stock. The demand is there, but we don't have the properties."" Bidmead Cook said the houses are off-plan and they are the second phase of a development by Welsh family-owned company, Davis Homes. Developer Matthew Davis said he was ""flummoxed"" by the situation. The 42-year-old, from Pontyclun, said: ""The housing market is strong but this is absolutely unbelievable. ""The first lady decided to park up and camp mid-afternoon and it must have created a situation where people thought they should start queuing as well.""

"Hollywood has its most diverse year, says report","2020 was a strange year for Hollywood film releases but it was also, ""the industry's most successful year on the diversity front"". That'saccording to a report by UCLA,externalwhich also found movie watchers in the US are becoming more diverse and prefer content with greater diversity. The number of ethnic minorities involved in watching or making American movies also increased. The top 185 English-language films released were examined. Eight of the top 10 theatrically released films had casts in which minorities made up more than 30%, including Bad Boys for Life, starring Will Smith - which had 50%. Christopher Nolan's Tenet and Sonic the Hedgehog each had between 31%-40%. Sonic the Hedgehog was third on the list This is very different from around a decade ago. In 2011, more than half of the films had cast diversity of less than 11% - but in 2020 that fell with less than 10% of films in that lowest level. The report found more people were watching films with diverse casts as well as the entertainment industry hiring more diverse staff for both onscreen and creative roles. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman 1984 was also in the top eight For the first time since the report launched, ethnic minorities were represented in the lead actor and total cast categories at levels proportionate to the US population, with writers credited for the top films almost doubling from 2019. But there's a lot more work to do, with few examples of women and minorities running films with the biggest budgets. ""There is a clear underinvestment of films made by, written by, and led by women and people of colour,"" Ana-Christina Ramon, the report's co-author said. Baftas to add nominees after diversity row Oscars set out best picture diversity targets British stars shine in Oscar nominations White film directors were more than twice as likely as minority directors to lead a film with a budget of $100m (Â£72m) or more - with women and minorities more likely to direct films that fell into the lowest budget category of less than $20m (14.4m). The most underrepresented groups in all categories, relative to their population in the US, are Latino, Asian and Native actors, directors and writers. ""Hollywood would benefit greatly from embracing 2020's revelations about the possibilities associated with major advances on the diversity front,"" the report states. Katie Smith-Wong is a British-Asian film critic and says one lesson is Hollywood's move towards greater diversity in casting and writing. ""They're acknowledging there are different ethnicities and audiences out there who are looking to find a different branch of story,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. The release of Black Panther in 2018, she says, showed there's an audience around the world which needs stories and talent to be recognised from across ethnicities, cultures and histories. In the UK, Katie feels the influence of diversity is not as strong in the mainstream, with films here not celebrating positive stories as much and leaning more to plots of hardship. ""In Hollywood, you see there are more supporting roles, whereas in the UK, it's hard to find ones that don't avoid stereotypes."" This video can not be played John Boyega reflects on his journey calling out racism, and reveals his plans for Christmas 2020 In June 2020,an open letterwas published calling on the UK's film and TV industry to ""tackle structural and systemic racism"" in broadcasting and film-making. Among the things the letter asked for was black and brown independent producers to be empowered and for the lack of diversity on productions to be constantly challenged. ""There is diverse talent in the UK, we've seen that in a show like Small Axe and the Rocks film.""

"Sleaze accusers out of their minds, says PM","This video can not be played The PM queries those who say there's something ""dodgy or rum or weird or sleazy"" about securing more ventilators in a pandemic. Boris Johnson has said anyone who thinks there was something ""dodgy or rum"" in his dealings with Sir James Dyson is ""out of their mind"". The PM was responding to claims by Labour that he was personally involved in ""sleaze"" after texts between the two were revealed by the BBC. Downing Street declined to comment on ""speculation"" Mr Johnson's former aide Dominic Cummings had leaked the texts. The government has launched an internal inquiry into who was responsible. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""We don't get into detail of processes in terms of these inquiries, but the Cabinet Office is taking that work forward."" The BBC said it did not discuss the sources of stories. Cameron: Nonsense to say Greensill was desperate Labour urges probe into revamp of PM's official flat Why ministers have two mobile phones What is lobbying? A brief guide Mr Johnson was speaking on a visit to Derbyshire as allegations of cronyism abound at Westminster. This video can not be played Labour leader claims ""sleaze is back"" after allegations over lobbying of the PM and a former PM. On Tuesdaythe BBC published text messagesbetween Mr Johnson and Sir James, in which the prime minister agreed to ""fix"" concerns the businessman had over his employees' tax bills if they moved to the UK to make ventilators at the start of the pandemic. Asked whether this proved Labour's allegation that friends of the Conservatives were given privileged access, the prime minister said it was ""completely the right thing to do"" to ask manufacturers to help bolster supplies of equipment needed to treat Covid patients. ""To think that there's anything remotely dodgy or rum or weird or sleazy about trying to secure more ventilators at the time of a national pandemic and doing everything in your power to do that, I think you're out of your mind,"" he added. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was on a visit to Hartlepool, said it was ""increasingly obvious"" the prime minister was involved in ""sleaze"". Asked if media reports pointing to Mr Cummings as the source of leaks were part of an attempt to distract from lobbying allegations, Sir Keir said: ""Boris Johnson is desperate to try to keep this at arm's length but it's obvious that he can't. This is government by WhatsApp. ""They are all at it - whether it's access to the prime minister, whether it's the former prime minister accessing ministers and officials, whether it's the health secretary with shares in companies with the contracts with the NHS. The list just grows and grows... ""Sleaze is back and it's bigger than it was before."" Shadow Treasury minister Bridget Phillipson tweeted: ""Dominic Cummings is a distraction. Follow the money, not the soap opera."" Mr Cummings has not accepted invitations to respond to the reports and, so far, no evidence of his involvement in the leaks has been produced. Labour has called for an urgent investigation into the prime minister's conduct by the Liaison Committee of senior MPs. It said the text messages showed Mr Johnson had offered a ""tax break"" to a ""chum"". The head of the committee, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, turned down the call for an inquiry, saying three other parliamentary committees were already looking at the issues. He told Radio 4's Today programme ministers should not be ""locked away in ivory towers"" with people unable to contact them and should be able to carry out conversations about policy in private, as this would ""stifle proper conversation"". ""What's got to come out of this is obviously a system of managing conflicts of interest, which commands more public confidence, and is more rigorous, but also a balance,"" he added. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has written to the Cabinet Secretary, calling for officials to ""secure and publish"" all Mr Johnson's private correspondence on coronavirus contracts, and not just his texts with Sir James Dyson. He said ""such a narrow and limited internal investigation totally and utterly fails to address the scale of the scandal"".

Why ministers have two mobile phones,"The lobbying controversy that has enveloped Westminster is a complex and fast-developing story but there is one strand running right through the centre of it - the smartphone. WhatsApp and text messages have replaced face-to-face meetings and letters as the favourite method of communication for politicians. The casual, and sometimes untraceable, nature of these communications can make it harder for the Civil Service to ensure everyone - ministers, officials, businesses and lobbyists - plays by the rules. It wasn't that long ago that everything was typed out in triplicate, and phone calls were routed through Whitehall switchboards, with officials listening in and taking notes. Cummings denies leaking PM's text messages Cameron: Nonsense to say Greensill was desperate No 10 announces leak inquiry into PM-Dyson texts Tony Blair didn't get a mobile phone until he left Downing Street in 2007. Now politicians, like the rest of us, can't live without them. Following a series of revelations about ministers' use of texts and messaging apps, Labour has warned that the UK is heading towards ""government by WhatsApp"". It's a catchy slogan, but it might be a bit dated, as the prime minister and other leading politicians arereportedly migrating to Signal,,externala rival messaging app. Users can set encrypted messages to automatically delete after short periods of time, even as short as five seconds. They can also stop screenshots being taken of exchanges if they are using an Android phone. Messages sent and received on Facebook-owned WhatsApp - which has been around since 2009 - are also encrypted, but screenshots can be taken and shared. Ministers are issued with work mobile phones when they get a job in government. Until a few years ago, they were given Blackberries, but nowthe iPhone seems to be the favoured brand. The idea is to ensure that professional and personal calls, texts and emails are kept separate from their personal communications. ""I was given a phone as soon as I started,"" one former Conservative minister tells the BBC, ""but I wasn't sat down and issued with any advice on how to use it."" A government source says: ""Clearly ministers may have informal conversations from time-to-time, whether that is in person, via digital communications or remotely, and if they find themselves discussing official business then significant content from such discussions should be passed back to officials."" In official guidance,external, designed for private emails but applying to all electronic communications, ministers are told to work out whether they include details on ""substantive discussions"" or ""decisions"" made on government business. If they do, they should then forward them to civil servants. The ministerial code,,externallaying out general rules of behaviour, says that a private secretary or another official should be present for ""all discussions relating to government"", to ensure transparency. If that's impossible - such as when ministers chat to business leaders at social events - they have to report back to civil servants as soon as possible. It's widely accepted that phone messaging should be reported in the same way if it's about important official business. Communication was very different in Margaret Thatcher's day But the Institute for Government (IfG) think tank wants a tightening of the rules, so that all messages sent and received on official phones - about whatever topic - are logged, with the names of those taking part published quarterly. This already happens for meetings ministers attend. ""There needs to a public record that something's happened,"" IfG associate director Tim Durrant says. ""Texting's essentially a conversation, like a meeting."" A source who used to work in Whitehall in a senior role says it was ""normal"" for ministers to have text exchanges with business leaders - and then let civil servants know about them. ""There's nothing wrong with the leaders of this country talking to captains of industry,"" they add. ""It's a part of how government functions. We live in a free country. ""What really annoys me is that there's an assumption of wrongdoing of some sort here. It's wrong to say government is run by text message. It's a form of communication that everyone uses for personal and official matters."" Culture minister Caroline Dinenage told Times Radio ministers did not hand out their mobile numbers ""willy-nilly"" and there were ""very clear rules"" about handing contacts to civil servants. But Labour argues that the government's use of messaging fosters ""cronyism"", that those with ministers' phone numbers have an unfair advantage over those who do not. An ex-minister tells the BBC they kept personal and official messages completely separate when they were in office. ""You have to rely on people using their common sense,"" they add. ""Some ministers actually hand the work mobile across to be carried by a special adviser or a member of their team, so they're not too close to it and don't use it in an inappropriate way. ""You've also got to be careful as to whom you give your number out to."" Some in government have suggested the prime minister should be less willing to share his personal contact details, the BBC understands, but officials have denied that he was told to change his number. But Mr Johnson says he will keep his phone, arguing: ""I need to be in touch with people... You need one these days."" And there would inevitably be resistance to any rule change among some in Whitehall. One former special adviser asks: ""What are ministers supposed to do? Put in a 30-page submission for every transaction they carry out, even in the midst of a pandemic?""

Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared,"This video can not be played ""It was all about clearing my name - I'm not a thief"": Former Post Office workers react outside court Judges have quashed the convictions of 39 former postmasters after the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice. They were convicted of stealing money, with some imprisoned, after the Post Office installed the Horizon computer system in branches. The system was flawed. Some of those whose lives were ruined now want those responsible to be ""punished"". The judgement was met with cheers from ex-postmasters outside court and was hailed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He called the original convictions an ""appalling injustice"". Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Man's life 'destroyed' by Post Office conviction 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' The clearing of the names of 39 peoplefollows the overturning of six other convictionsin December, This means more people have been affected than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK. Among them was Janet Skinner, who ran a post office in Hull. She was imprisoned in 2007 for nine months over a shortfall of Â£59,000 - a case which she said ""destroyed everything"". Like others, she said she had no idea fellow sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were being prosecuted and convicted. Former post office worker Janet Skinner (centre) outside the Royal Courts of Justice She was taken away from her two children to go to prison and - after her release - had a job offer taken away owing to her criminal conviction. Outside court, she said she was ""relieved"" at the judgement. Speaking after his name was cleared, Harjinder Butoy, who was convicted of theft and jailed for three years and four months in 2008, described the Post Office as ""a disgrace"". He said those responsible for the scandal ""need to be punished, seriously punished"", adding: ""They're just bullies, that's all they are. Somebody needs to really, really sort this out and charge them for this."" Hughie ""Noel"" Thomas, also cleared, said it had been 16 years to fight for justice. ""All I want is my money back. People have walked away from this who were responsible. I'd like to sit down with them and ask them the question 'why?',"" he said. Harjinder Butoy (left) hugs his father outside court Neil Hudgell, who represented 29 of the former sub-postmasters, said the Post Office ""has been found to have been an organisation that not only turned a blind eye to the failings in its hugely expensive IT system, but positively promoted a culture of cover-up and subterfuge in the pursuit of reputation and profit"". ""They readily accepted that loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary people as a price worth paying in that pursuit,"" he said. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells - at the the helm from 2012 to 2019 - said she supported a government inquiry. ""I was deeply saddened by the sub-postmasters' accounts heard during the Court of Appeal proceedings. I am truly sorry for the suffering caused to them as a result of the convictions which the Court of Appeal has today overturned. ""I fully support and am committed to co-operating with the ongoing Government Inquiry, as I did with last year's Select Committee Inquiry.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further while the Inquiry is ongoing."" Those affected have long called for a judge-led, full, public inquiry, rather than the government's own inquiry which is set to report in the summer. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, is reviewing another 22 cases. There were more than 700 prosecutions based on Horizon evidence. The commission and the Post Office are asking anyone else who believes their conviction to be unsafe to come forward. This video can not be played ""How do you die knowing that you've done nothing wrong?"" At the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Lord Justice Holroyde said the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"" the system's defects. But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"" and ""effectively steamrolled over any sub-postmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"", the judge added. The Court of Appeal also allowed the appeals on the basis that their prosecutions were an affront to justice - a decision that allows for the possibility of further claims for compensation against the Post Office.

Those whose convictions have been quashed are Josephine Hamilton, Hughie Noel Thomas, Allison Henderson, Alison Hall, Gail Ward, Julian Wilson, Jacqueline McDonald, Tracy Felstead, Janet Skinner, Scott Darlington, Seema Misra, Della Robinson, Khayyam Ishaq, David Thomas Hedges, Peter Anthony Holmes, Rubina Shaheen, Damien Owen, Mohammed Rasul, Wendy Buffrey, Kashmir Gill, Barry Capon, Vijay Parekh, Lynette Hutchings, Dawn O'Connell, Carl Page, Lisa Brennan, William Graham, Siobhan Sayer, Pauline Thomson, Tim Burgess, Nicholas Clark, Margery Williams, Tahir Mahmood, Ian Warren, David Yates, Harjinder Butoy, Gillian Howard, David Blakey and Pamela Lock. Following the convictions - including theft, fraud and false accounting - some of these former postmasters went to prison, were shunned by their communities and struggled to secure work. Some lost their homes and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions. Three have since died. They always said the fault was in the computer system, which had been used to manage post offices' finances since 1999. Investigative journalist Nick Wallis hasfollowed this saga for years,external, reporting on the case for BBC Panorama and Radio 4. ""Just over 10 years ago, I spoke on the phone to a man who was crying his eyes out,"" he said. ""His pregnant wife, Seema Misra - the sub-postmaster at West Byfleet Post Office in Surrey - had been sent to prison for theft. He swore she was an innocent victim of the Post Office's computer system, Horizon. ""After meeting dozens of sub-postmasters over the past decade, I have been struck by the dignity and quiet anger they convey in interviews and conversation - emotions never stray far from the surface. ""There will be some jubilation at the quashing of so many convictions today, but the trauma, the loss of reputation and the years of financial hardship for the dozens of people who were prosecuted by the Post Office will never leave them."" This video can not be played Noel Thomas was jailed for nine  months in 2006 for false accounting Post Office chief executive Nick Read said: ""I am in no doubt about the human cost of the Post Office's past failures and the deep pain that has been caused to people affected. ""Many of those postmasters involved have been fighting for justice for a considerable length of time and sadly there are some who are not here to see the outcome today and whose families have taken forward appeals in their memory. I am very moved by their courage. ""The quashing of historical convictions is a vital milestone in fully and properly addressing the past as I work to put right these wrongs as swiftly as possible and there must be compensation that reflects what has happened."" In three additional cases - those of Stanley Fell, Wendy Cousins and Neelam Hussain - the judges ruled the convictions were not based on Horizon evidence, so their appeals against conviction failed. The Horizon system is designed to record the transactions carried out in a post office branch The Horizon system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. But from an early stage, it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. Horizon-based evidence was used by the Post Office to successfully prosecute 736 people. But campaigners fought a long and hard series of legal battles for compensation in the civil courts, which have been followed by referrals by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won',"Tom Hedges (centre) was one 39 former postmasters celebrating as their convictions were quashed Thirty-nine postmasters who were victims of the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice have had their names formally cleared. For the men and women involved it marked the end of a long legal battle which took them ""to hell and back"". ""The first thing I did was cry,"" says David Blakey, from Cleethorpes, after hearing hisconviction had been overturnedat the Royal Courts of Justice. ""I am ecstatic at the result, it's just pure joy,"" he says. The former postmaster was convicted of theft and false accounting in 2004, one of 39 branded criminals after the Post Office installed a flawed computer system in branches. He lost his job, his home and his pension as a result. It has taken so long to finally clear the group's names that Mr Blakey says the result ""hasn't really sunk in yet"" but ""it means everything"". David Blakey says he lost his job, his home and his pension His sense of delight is shared by Tom Hedges, from Skegness, who received a seven-month suspended sentence for theft and false accounting in 2001. Opening a bottle of fizz outside the court, he says: ""It's a wonderful afternoon. ""When I told my mother, who's 93, I was coming to court she said: 'Get yourself down to Aldi and get some prosecco'."" Mr Hedges says he went to ""hell and back"" as the group ""fought and fought"" to clear their names. He is critical of the Post Office describing its behaviour throughout as ""totally despicable the entire time"". ""It has lifted my soul and I feel wonderful,"" he says of the court ruling. Convicted Post Office workers cleared Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Alison Hall, from Liversedge, West Yorkshire, says it has been a ""hard 11 years"" since proceedings were first launched against her. She eventually agreed to plead guilty to false accounting so a theft charge would be dropped, and was sentenced to community service. ""I never said a word, I was too embarrassed,"" she says. Alison Hall said there should be a public inquiry into the whole affair Ms Hall is delighted her conviction was quashed but still wants an apology for her ordeal. ""Nobody from the Post Office has ever come and apologised to me,"" she says. ""There should be a public inquiry. People need to find out what happened and what they did to us all."" The prosecutions by the Post Office had a huge impact on the lives of those targeted - some were imprisoned, some lost their homes and some struggled to find new work. Chairman Tim Parker has said the company is ""extremely sorry"" to those affected and their families, blaming ""historical failures"". Neil Hudgell, the solicitor who represented 29 of the postmasters, says his clients were ""honest, hard-working people"" whose reputations and livelihoods had been ""so unfairly destroyed"". Mr Blakey says he was lucky to have the support of his family and friends. ""Everyone believed in me, everybody trusted me. There are people out there who have lost so much more than I have and I have lost a lot."" He believes he and his wife lost about Â£400,000 - including their post office business, which they had bought, and their home when they had to declare bankruptcy. ""We're living in a council house now, we are paying rent every month. I am living on a state pension because I lost my job so I was unable to pay into my private pension,"" he says. Janet Skinner (centre) said her conviction had affected her employment opportunities Janet Skinner, from Hull, was imprisoned for nine months in 2007 for false accounting, and says having a conviction hampered her employment opportunities. ""People look at you and always look down on you,"" she says. But, having at last cleared her name, she says justice has finally been served.

Why were they prosecuted?,"A law quashing the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters was introduced in May. Many were wrongly prosecuted after faulty software said money was missing from their Post Office branch accounts. More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted for stealing because of incorrect information from the Horizon computer system. It has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice. The Post Office itself took many cases to court, prosecuting 700 people between 1999 and 2015. Another 283 cases were brought by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Many sub-postmasters went to prison for false accounting and theft, and many were financially ruined. In 2017, a group of 555 sub-postmasters took legal action against the Post Office. In 2019,it agreed to pay them Â£58m in compensation,but much of the money went on legal fees. The Metropolitan Policeis investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences. Secret papers show Post Office knew case was false Although campaigners won the right for their cases to be reconsidered,only 102 convictions had been overturned,externalby March 2024. Legislation toclear victims' names and pay them compensationbecame law in May. It applies to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Convictions will be automatically quashed if they were: prosecuted by the Post Office or CPS for offences carried out in connection with Post Office business between 1996 and 2018 for relevant offences such as theft, fraud and false accounting against sub-postmasters, their employees, officers, family members or direct employees of the Post Office working in a Post Office that used the Horizon system software It is expected that most victims will have been cleared by the end of July. The Scottish parliamentalso passed its own bill,external. Joy and disbelief as Post Office convictions quashed How the Post Office scandal has affected Scotland In July, the new Labour government publisheddetails of a new compensation scheme,externalcalled the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS). Two compensation routes will be available, with one route offering Â£600,000 as a final settlement and another route for sub-postmasters who think they are owed more. All of those who qualify for compensation will be given an immediate Â£200,000 payout. Those whose wrongful convictions were quashed before the May legislation will not need to move to the new scheme and are entitled to the same compensation. Former Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake previously said the Conservative government had budgeted Â£1bn for compensation. More than 4,000 people were told they were eligible, under three schemes: The Group Litigation Order (GLO) Schemefor the 555 former postmasters (excluding those who had criminal convictions) who won their group lawsuit, but received relatively small payouts after legal costs. They will now be offered Â£75,000, but many are expected to push for more The Overturned Convictions Schemeoffers those eligible a fast-tracked Â£600,000 settlement, or the chance to negotiate a higher payment. The Horizon Shortfall Schemeis for sub-postmasters who were not convicted, or part of the GLO court action, but who believe they experienced shortfalls because of Horizon. This group will be offered a fixed payment of Â£75,000 Prof Chris Hodges, chair of the the independent Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, told the BBC that some individual compensation claims were ""well over Â£1m"". How do the Post Office compensation schemes work? Many former sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses say the scandal ruined their lives. Some used their own money to cover non-existent shortfalls because their contracts said they were responsible for unexplained losses. Many faced bankruptcy or lost their livelihoods. Marriages broke down, and some families believe the stress led to serious health conditions, addiction and even premature death. This video can not be played Victims of the Post Office scandal tell their own stories of how they were accused of criminality. 'I'm terrified' - Post Office victim still fears seeing old customers âI thought mum left me, sheâd been sent to prison' Horizon was developed bythe Japanese company Fujitsu, for tasks such as accounting and stocktaking. It was introduced by the Post Office in 1999. Sub-postmasters quickly complained about bugs in the system after it falsely reported shortfalls - often for many thousands of pounds - but their concerns were dismissed. The Horizon system isstill used by the Post Office,,externalwhich describes the latest version as ""robust"". A public inquirybegan in February 2021,externaland has heard evidence from Post Office and Fujitsu employees. The fifth phase began on Tuesday 9 April, with campaigner Alan Bates the first to appear. He told the inquiry thatthe Post Office has spent 23 years trying to ""discredit and silence"" him. Paula Vennells, chief executive between 2012 and 2019, gave evidence in May and apologised to the sub-postmasters and their families""who have suffered as a result of all that the inquiry has been looking into for so long"". Who is Paula Vennells? Alan Bates says Post Office run by 'thugs in suits' Ms Vennells resigned in 2019 over the scandal. In January 2024,she said she would hand back her CBE. In August 2023, current chief executive Nick Readsaid he would return bonus money awarded for his work on the Horizon inquiry. Post Office threatened BBC over whistleblower Secret papers show Post Office knew case was false Fujitsu Europe director Paul Patterson said the firmhad a ""moral obligation"" to help fund compensation payments. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has been criticised for refusing to meet Mr Bates when he was postal affairs minister, in May 2010. He sayshe was ""deeply misled by Post Office executives"". The BBC discovered that former Prime Minister David Cameron's governmentknew the Post Office had dropped a secret investigation that might have helped postmasters prove their innocence. Separately, former Business Secretary Kemi Badenochdenied claims from former Post Office chairman Henry Stauntonthat he was told to delay compensation payments to allow the government to ""limp into the election"".

"Jury clears XR protesters despite judge's rulingSix activists are acquitted of causing criminal damage despite a judge saying they had ""no defence"".London","The defendants said they believed their actions had been ""necessary"" and ""proportionate"" Six Extinction Rebellion protesters have been cleared of causing criminal damage, despite a jury being told by the judge there was no defence in law for their actions. Activists targeted Shell's London HQ, claiming the oil firm was directly contributing to climate change. It was part of wider demonstrations across the capital on 15 April 2019. Judge Gregory Perrins said that even if their actions were ""morally justified"", that did not provide a lawful excuse. Southwark Crown Court had heard that each of the defendants deliberately sprayed graffiti or smashed windows at the Shell building in Belvedere Road, central London. The six acquitted activists were: Simon Bramwell, 49 (co-founder of Extinction Rebellion) from Stroud, Gloucestershire Ian Bray, 53 (co-founder) from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire Jane Augsburger, 55, from Stroud Senan Clifford, 60, from Stroud David Lambert, 62, from Stroud James ""Sid"" Saunders, 41, from Stroud With the exception of Mr Saunders - who claimed he honestly believed Shell's employees and shareholders would have consented to the damage he caused - the judge had told the jury: ""They don't have any defence in law for the charges they face."" After deliberating for just over seven hours, the jury of seven women and five men cleared the defendants of all charges. Before reaching their verdicts, the jurors had asked to see a copy of the oath they took when they were sworn in. Graffiti was left on Shell's London headquarters in April 2019 The six, who represented themselves, were also cleared of individual counts of having an article with intent to destroy or damage property. They told the court they had targeted the Shell building because the company was directly contributing to climate change, ""thereby causing serious injury and death"". They argued their actions were a ""necessary"" and ""proportionate"" response to the harm being caused. Prosecutor Diana Wilson had told the court that while some protesters merely stood outside the building holding banners or speaking through megaphones, ""these defendants went further"". She added: ""The seven involved caused significant damage."" What does Extinction Rebellion want? XR protesters charged over HSBC windows damage 50 arrests at London climate protest At the conclusion of the trial, the judge thanked the jurors for their ""care and attention"", adding: ""This has been an unusual case."" A seventh protester, Katerina Hasapopoulous, had previously pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage. The 43-year-old, from Stroud, will be sentenced at a later date. After he was cleared, Extinction Rebellion co-founder Mr Bramwell said she had only pleaded guilty because of childcare issues. 50 arrests at London climate protest BREAKING: Richmond Police appeal for help finding two men in connection with missing mother and son You can now use your phone on this tube line on the London Underground 'I love living on London's canals - now I'm being told I am no longer welcome' DLD Students embark on World Challenge Adventure in Morocco Marco Pierre White: New menu helps banish winter blues Bromley brothers accused of revenge porn, having Rambo knife and strangling woman Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction Warning on gas prices as cold snap hits supplies UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

Jury clears XR protesters despite judge's advice,"The defendants said they believed their actions had been ""necessary"" and ""proportionate"" Six Extinction Rebellion protesters have been cleared of causing criminal damage, despite a jury being told by the judge there was no defence in law for their actions. Activists targeted Shell's London HQ, claiming the oil firm was directly contributing to climate change. It was part of wider demonstrations across the capital on 15 April 2019. Judge Gregory Perrins said that even if their actions were ""morally justified"", that did not provide a lawful excuse. Southwark Crown Court had heard that each of the defendants deliberately sprayed graffiti or smashed windows at the Shell building in Belvedere Road, central London. The six acquitted activists were: Simon Bramwell, 49 (co-founder of Extinction Rebellion) from Stroud, Gloucestershire Ian Bray, 53 (co-founder) from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire Jane Augsburger, 55, from Stroud Senan Clifford, 60, from Stroud David Lambert, 62, from Stroud James ""Sid"" Saunders, 41, from Stroud With the exception of Mr Saunders - who claimed he honestly believed Shell's employees and shareholders would have consented to the damage he caused - the judge had told the jury: ""They don't have any defence in law for the charges they face."" After deliberating for just over seven hours, the jury of seven women and five men cleared the defendants of all charges. Before reaching their verdicts, the jurors had asked to see a copy of the oath they took when they were sworn in. Graffiti was left on Shell's London headquarters in April 2019 The six, who represented themselves, were also cleared of individual counts of having an article with intent to destroy or damage property. They told the court they had targeted the Shell building because the company was directly contributing to climate change, ""thereby causing serious injury and death"". They argued their actions were a ""necessary"" and ""proportionate"" response to the harm being caused. Prosecutor Diana Wilson had told the court that while some protesters merely stood outside the building holding banners or speaking through megaphones, ""these defendants went further"". She added: ""The seven involved caused significant damage."" What does Extinction Rebellion want? XR protesters charged over HSBC windows damage 50 arrests at London climate protest At the conclusion of the trial, the judge thanked the jurors for their ""care and attention"", adding: ""This has been an unusual case."" A seventh protester, Katerina Hasapopoulous, had previously pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage. The 43-year-old, from Stroud, will be sentenced at a later date.

India arrivals begin UK hotel quarantineSome UK nationals say they are struggling to secure flights home as India sees a surge in Covid.,"The first people to arrive in the UK from India since the country was placed on the travel ""red list"" have entered hotel quarantine. British and Irish nationals and those with residency rights must isolate in approved accommodation for 10 days after rules changed overnight. India has seen a second wave of infections, with shortages of medical oxygen leaving some patients untreated. Some British Asians have spoken of the trauma of witnessing India's surge. Meeta Joshi, from Guildford, Surrey, described how she has lost nine close relatives and friends in India in the past week - four due to Covid. ""One was an aunt I have known since I was bornâ¦ I was in communication with her regularly through mobile calls,"" she said. ""Life is so fragile and there is no guarantee. Until February, everything was looking fine in India."" Meeta Joshi is coping with the loss of nine close relatives or friends in the past week - four of whom died with Covid Ashree Singh described ""a state of mental agony"" as relatives and friends sent worsening updates from the country on messaging apps. The NHS worker who lives in London said she had a ""feeling of worthlessness and helplessness when you're seeing your family, relatives and friends suffering and dying"". On Friday, India reported 332,730 new cases of coronavirus, setting a world record for a second day running. Deaths were numbered at 2,263 in 24 hours as crematoriums organise mass funeral pyres. Ashree Singh is working for the NHS in London but is receiving concerning updates from relatives in India Passengers from one of the first scheduled commercial flights to land in the UK from India since the red list changed were seen being escorted to government-approved hotels at London's Heathrow Airport on Friday afternoon. TV chef Romy Gill returned from India before the travel rules changed on Thursday and is isolating in a hotel in Bristol. She praised the UK government's handling of the rules for those returning from the country. ""I was in India last November and what has been done now is completely different,"" she said. ""I think the [UK] government is doing what they should have done ages ago."" But some have spoken of their struggle to leave India amid restrictions on travel and widespread flight cancellations. Mukti Mulligan, from London but currently in Goa, told BBC Asian Network's Big Debate he lost out on tickets to return to the UK because his mandatory Covid test did not return within the time limit. Mukti Mulligan is visiting Goa and has described how Covid appears to affect ""pretty much everyone"" in India He said the situation in India was ""very worrying"" - though Goa seemed calmer than elsewhere - and he expressed surprise at how visible Covid was among his friends in their 20s and 30s. ""Even now a number of my friends are isolating, stuck in bed, most of them are not tested,"" he said. ""Almost certainly a vast majority have got Covid. ""We're talking about under 40s, mostly in their 20s and 30s. Pretty much everyone is affected in some way or another."" Deepa Bajaj, an IT consultant living in London, travelled back to India in early March to visit her elderly parents in Mumbai. When the red list change was announced, she secured a seat on a return flight back to the UK - but her mandatory pre-departure Covid tests returned positive results. Deepa Bajaj is isolating at a relative's home in India after her pre-departure Covid tests came back positive ""It was a bit shocking because I had no symptoms, I was being super careful, I don't even remember having gone out for the past five or six days,"" she told Asian Network. The 53-year-old is now experiencing Covid symptoms including a sore throat and fever but hopes to return to the UK once her she recovers from the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK stands ""ready to support our friends in India with whatever we can"". ""We are actively engaged with how we can support from where we are,"" he said. What is the India Covid variant? India is now on the red list - and where else? Why India is running out of oxygen again Friday's travel rule change means direct flights from India are still permitted, but UK and Irish nationals, as well as those with residency rights, must isolate in government-approved hotels - at their own cost - for 10 days. Travel to the UK is banned for all others who have been in red list countries in the past 10 days. There are 40 countries on thegovernment's red list,externalacross the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice. There are specific rules for people arriving in each UK nation, includingEngland,external,Scotland,external,Northern Ireland,externalandWales,external. Public Health England (PHE) confirmed on Thursday thata further 55 cases,externalof the virus variant first identified in India - known as B.1.617 - were found in the UK in the latest week to 14 April. PHE experts are currently unsure whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity. Meanwhile, scientific advisers to the UK government are increasingly optimistic that Covid restrictions will continue to lift in line with the roadmap in England - with hints this could include ditching the requirement for face coverings in many indoor settings during the summer. But there is an expectation that some of the precautions such as masks and social distancing, if eased over the summer, may have to be brought back in the autumn to prevent further surges of cases. The latest R number range for England was estimated to be 0.8 to 1.0, with a growth rate indicating the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1% and 5% every day. The UK reported a further 2,678 coronavirus cases on Friday. Another 40 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded, a slight rise on recent days.

"Sleaze accusers out of their minds, says PMLabour says Boris Johnson is at the centre of cronyism allegations engulfing the government.UK Politics","This video can not be played The PM queries those who say there's something ""dodgy or rum or weird or sleazy"" about securing more ventilators in a pandemic. Boris Johnson has said anyone who thinks there was something ""dodgy or rum"" in his dealings with Sir James Dyson is ""out of their mind"". The PM was responding to claims by Labour that he was personally involved in ""sleaze"" after texts between the two were revealed by the BBC. Downing Street declined to comment on ""speculation"" Mr Johnson's former aide Dominic Cummings had leaked the texts. The government has launched an internal inquiry into who was responsible. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""We don't get into detail of processes in terms of these inquiries, but the Cabinet Office is taking that work forward."" The BBC said it did not discuss the sources of stories. Cameron: Nonsense to say Greensill was desperate Labour urges probe into revamp of PM's official flat Why ministers have two mobile phones What is lobbying? A brief guide Mr Johnson was speaking on a visit to Derbyshire as allegations of cronyism abound at Westminster. This video can not be played Labour leader claims ""sleaze is back"" after allegations over lobbying of the PM and a former PM. On Tuesdaythe BBC published text messagesbetween Mr Johnson and Sir James, in which the prime minister agreed to ""fix"" concerns the businessman had over his employees' tax bills if they moved to the UK to make ventilators at the start of the pandemic. Asked whether this proved Labour's allegation that friends of the Conservatives were given privileged access, the prime minister said it was ""completely the right thing to do"" to ask manufacturers to help bolster supplies of equipment needed to treat Covid patients. ""To think that there's anything remotely dodgy or rum or weird or sleazy about trying to secure more ventilators at the time of a national pandemic and doing everything in your power to do that, I think you're out of your mind,"" he added. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was on a visit to Hartlepool, said it was ""increasingly obvious"" the prime minister was involved in ""sleaze"". Asked if media reports pointing to Mr Cummings as the source of leaks were part of an attempt to distract from lobbying allegations, Sir Keir said: ""Boris Johnson is desperate to try to keep this at arm's length but it's obvious that he can't. This is government by WhatsApp. ""They are all at it - whether it's access to the prime minister, whether it's the former prime minister accessing ministers and officials, whether it's the health secretary with shares in companies with the contracts with the NHS. The list just grows and grows... ""Sleaze is back and it's bigger than it was before."" Shadow Treasury minister Bridget Phillipson tweeted: ""Dominic Cummings is a distraction. Follow the money, not the soap opera."" Mr Cummings has not accepted invitations to respond to the reports and, so far, no evidence of his involvement in the leaks has been produced. Labour has called for an urgent investigation into the prime minister's conduct by the Liaison Committee of senior MPs. It said the text messages showed Mr Johnson had offered a ""tax break"" to a ""chum"". The head of the committee, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, turned down the call for an inquiry, saying three other parliamentary committees were already looking at the issues. He told Radio 4's Today programme ministers should not be ""locked away in ivory towers"" with people unable to contact them and should be able to carry out conversations about policy in private, as this would ""stifle proper conversation"". ""What's got to come out of this is obviously a system of managing conflicts of interest, which commands more public confidence, and is more rigorous, but also a balance,"" he added. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has written to the Cabinet Secretary, calling for officials to ""secure and publish"" all Mr Johnson's private correspondence on coronavirus contracts, and not just his texts with Sir James Dyson. He said ""such a narrow and limited internal investigation totally and utterly fails to address the scale of the scandal"".

"Hollywood has its most diverse year, according to report","2020 was a strange year for Hollywood film releases but it was also, ""the industry's most successful year on the diversity front"". That'saccording to a report by UCLA,externalwhich also found movie watchers in the US are becoming more diverse and prefer content with greater diversity. The number of ethnic minorities involved in watching or making American movies also increased. The top 185 English-language films released were examined. Eight of the top 10 theatrically released films had casts in which minorities made up more than 30%, including Bad Boys for Life, starring Will Smith - which had 50%. Christopher Nolan's Tenet and Sonic the Hedgehog each had between 31%-40%. Sonic the Hedgehog was third on the list This is very different from around a decade ago. In 2011, more than half of the films had cast diversity of less than 11% - but in 2020 that fell with less than 10% of films in that lowest level. The report found more people were watching films with diverse casts as well as the entertainment industry hiring more diverse staff for both onscreen and creative roles. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman 1984 was also in the top eight For the first time since the report launched, ethnic minorities were represented in the lead actor and total cast categories at levels proportionate to the US population, with writers credited for the top films almost doubling from 2019. But there's a lot more work to do, with few examples of women and minorities running films with the biggest budgets. ""There is a clear underinvestment of films made by, written by, and led by women and people of colour,"" Ana-Christina Ramon, the report's co-author said. Baftas to add nominees after diversity row Oscars set out best picture diversity targets British stars shine in Oscar nominations White film directors were more than twice as likely as minority directors to lead a film with a budget of $100m (Â£72m) or more - with women and minorities more likely to direct films that fell into the lowest budget category of less than $20m (14.4m). The most underrepresented groups in all categories, relative to their population in the US, are Latino, Asian and Native actors, directors and writers. ""Hollywood would benefit greatly from embracing 2020's revelations about the possibilities associated with major advances on the diversity front,"" the report states. Katie Smith-Wong is a British-Asian film critic and says one lesson is Hollywood's move towards greater diversity in casting and writing. ""They're acknowledging there are different ethnicities and audiences out there who are looking to find a different branch of story,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. The release of Black Panther in 2018, she says, showed there's an audience around the world which needs stories and talent to be recognised from across ethnicities, cultures and histories. In the UK, Katie feels the influence of diversity is not as strong in the mainstream, with films here not celebrating positive stories as much and leaning more to plots of hardship. ""In Hollywood, you see there are more supporting roles, whereas in the UK, it's hard to find ones that don't avoid stereotypes."" This video can not be played John Boyega reflects on his journey calling out racism, and reveals his plans for Christmas 2020 In June 2020,an open letterwas published calling on the UK's film and TV industry to ""tackle structural and systemic racism"" in broadcasting and film-making. Among the things the letter asked for was black and brown independent producers to be empowered and for the lack of diversity on productions to be constantly challenged. ""There is diverse talent in the UK, we've seen that in a show like Small Axe and the Rocks film."" ""There needs to be more people willing to support different voices that might appeal to more audiences. Because at the end of the day, originality counts,"" she adds.

Rapper who blamed identical twin jailed for murder,"Javell Hall will spend at least 19 years in prison A drill rapper who tried to deflect the blame on to his identical twin after a new father was stabbed to death has been jailed. DNA matching the profile of 18-year-old Javell Hall was found on the sheath of a knife used to murder Asante Campbell in north London, the Old Bailey heard. Asked about the DNA, Hall said:""I never touched that knife. If it's not mine it must be [my twin brother's]."" He was given a life sentence, with a minimum prison term of 19 years. Co-defendant Kofi Abusah, 19, received the same sentence for the rail worker's murder. Mr Campbell was attacked by a group of males on an estate in Hendon on 29 February 2020. The jury was told that the reason for the stabbing remained a mystery. The 24-year-old, who was stabbed through his car window, had been waiting to meet a colleague before setting off for a night shift. Earlier, he had kissed his fiancÃ©e and baby daughter goodnight. Asante Campbell ""just loved helping people"", his mum said In a victim impact statement, Mr Campbell's mother Angela paid tribute to his ""infectious presence"" and charitable nature. Mrs Campbell told the Old Bailey how he stepped in to play football with a lone boy in a park; supported the family of a suicidal girl; and even dropped a total stranger at the airport. She said: ""All this was done with a smile on his face, with him often saying: 'I just love helping people.'"" Mr Campbell and his ""childhood sweetheart"" fiancÃ©e shared a unique bond, his mother said. Mr Campbell was found with stab wounds in Parson Street, Hendon ""Her life has been shattered and their exciting plans for the future crushed. Their lives [were] seemingly complete with the birth of their beautiful baby girl just weeks before he was taken - he absolutely doted on her."" The court heard how Hall had evaded arrest until June last year, travelling to Leeds and Manchester. The rapper had a previous conviction for being in possession of a large combat knife in September 2016. At the time of the murder, he was on court bail over an incident at a supermarket. Others went on to admit affray over what happened.

French female police worker stabbed to deathAnti-terror prosecutors are leading the inquiry after the unarmed employee was stabbed in the neck.,"The Yvelines area west of Paris has been targeted by militant Islamists in the past A female police employee has been killed in a knife attack at a police station south-west of Paris. Anti-terror prosecutors have taken over the inquiry, and the killing is being treated as a possible terrorist attack. The attacker, who reportedly came to France from Tunisia several years ago, was shot dead by police. President Emmanuel Macron led tributes to the 49-year-old victim, and said France would never give in to ""Islamist terrorism"". The stabbing took place in the secure entrance to the police station in the commuter town of Rambouillet at 14:20 (12:20 GMT). Witnesses said the attacker had been seen walking around while on his mobile phone outside the police station and seized his chance to go in as the woman - an unarmed administrative officer - went through the security doors. He reportedly lunged at the officer, stabbing her in the neck. Her colleagues then opened fire on him. Anti-terrorism prosecutors said they took over the investigation because of the way the attack had unfolded, remarks made by the attacker and the fact that he targeted a police official. Sources close to the inquiry told media outlets that the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) during the attack. Officials said the attacker, 36, was not previously known to security agencies. Local outlet BFMTV reported that he had lived in the country illegally before obtaining a residency card, which was due to expire later this year. Three people were arrested following the attack, according to reports. A judicial source told AFP news agency they were part of the suspect's ""entourage"". In a Twitter post following the attack, Mr Macron said the victim's name was StÃ©phanie. ""The nation is by the side of her family, her colleagues and security forces,"" he wrote. Her full name has not been released, but local media reports describe her as a mother of two. Prime Minister Jean Castex and Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin went straight to the scene, in the large Yvelines area to the west of the capital. Mr Castex said the country had lost an ""everyday heroine"" and condemned what he described as a ""barbaric act of boundless cruelty"". ""Our determination to combat terrorism in all its forms is as resolute as ever,"" he told reporters. ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse, president of the Paris region, said the attack had been against a ""symbol of France"". The police, she said, were ""the face of France"". Far-right leader Marine Le Pen - seen as the strongest challenger to Mr Macron in next year's presidential election - tweeted condemnation of Friday's attack before details of the suspect's identity had been made public. ""The same horrors come one after another, the same infinite sadness as we think about the relatives and the colleagues of this female police employee who has been killed, the same type of person guilty of this barbarity, the same Islamist motives,"" she wrote. Police cordoned off the area after their colleague was fatally stabbed British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also reacted to the attack on Twitter. ""We stand with our French friends and allies following tragic news of a female police officer killed by a terrorist in Rambouillet while doing her job,"" he wrote. In his comments on Friday, Mr Castex noted that the Yvelines area had been targeted before, including in 2016 when two members of the police force were fatally stabbed at their home. In October 2020 the militant Islamist murder of teacher Samuel Paty in Yvelines led to national outrage, as he was attacked after an online campaign that began with false claims from a 13-year-old girl at his school.

India arrivals begin UK hotel quarantineSome UK nationals say they are struggling to secure flights home as India sees a surge in Covid.UK,"The first people to arrive in the UK from India since the country was placed on the travel ""red list"" have entered hotel quarantine. British and Irish nationals and those with residency rights must isolate in approved accommodation for 10 days after rules changed overnight. India has seen a second wave of infections, with shortages of medical oxygen leaving some patients untreated. Some British Asians have spoken of the trauma of witnessing India's surge. Meeta Joshi, from Guildford, Surrey, described how she has lost nine close relatives and friends in India in the past week - four due to Covid. ""One was an aunt I have known since I was bornâ¦ I was in communication with her regularly through mobile calls,"" she said. ""Life is so fragile and there is no guarantee. Until February, everything was looking fine in India."" Meeta Joshi is coping with the loss of nine close relatives or friends in the past week - four of whom died with Covid Ashree Singh described ""a state of mental agony"" as relatives and friends sent worsening updates from the country on messaging apps. The NHS worker who lives in London said she had a ""feeling of worthlessness and helplessness when you're seeing your family, relatives and friends suffering and dying"". On Friday, India reported 332,730 new cases of coronavirus, setting a world record for a second day running. Deaths were numbered at 2,263 in 24 hours as crematoriums organise mass funeral pyres. Ashree Singh is working for the NHS in London but is receiving concerning updates from relatives in India Passengers from one of the first scheduled commercial flights to land in the UK from India since the red list changed were seen being escorted to government-approved hotels at London's Heathrow Airport on Friday afternoon. TV chef Romy Gill returned from India before the travel rules changed on Thursday and is isolating in a hotel in Bristol. She praised the UK government's handling of the rules for those returning from the country. ""I was in India last November and what has been done now is completely different,"" she said. ""I think the [UK] government is doing what they should have done ages ago."" But some have spoken of their struggle to leave India amid restrictions on travel and widespread flight cancellations. Mukti Mulligan, from London but currently in Goa, told BBC Asian Network's Big Debate he lost out on tickets to return to the UK because his mandatory Covid test did not return within the time limit. Mukti Mulligan is visiting Goa and has described how Covid appears to affect ""pretty much everyone"" in India He said the situation in India was ""very worrying"" - though Goa seemed calmer than elsewhere - and he expressed surprise at how visible Covid was among his friends in their 20s and 30s. ""Even now a number of my friends are isolating, stuck in bed, most of them are not tested,"" he said. ""Almost certainly a vast majority have got Covid. ""We're talking about under 40s, mostly in their 20s and 30s. Pretty much everyone is affected in some way or another."" Deepa Bajaj, an IT consultant living in London, travelled back to India in early March to visit her elderly parents in Mumbai. When the red list change was announced, she secured a seat on a return flight back to the UK - but her mandatory pre-departure Covid tests returned positive results. Deepa Bajaj is isolating at a relative's home in India after her pre-departure Covid tests came back positive ""It was a bit shocking because I had no symptoms, I was being super careful, I don't even remember having gone out for the past five or six days,"" she told Asian Network. The 53-year-old is now experiencing Covid symptoms including a sore throat and fever but hopes to return to the UK once her she recovers from the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK stands ""ready to support our friends in India with whatever we can"". ""We are actively engaged with how we can support from where we are,"" he said. What is the India Covid variant? India is now on the red list - and where else? Why India is running out of oxygen again Friday's travel rule change means direct flights from India are still permitted, but UK and Irish nationals, as well as those with residency rights, must isolate in government-approved hotels - at their own cost - for 10 days. Travel to the UK is banned for all others who have been in red list countries in the past 10 days. There are 40 countries on thegovernment's red list,externalacross the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice. There are specific rules for people arriving in each UK nation, includingEngland,external,Scotland,external,Northern Ireland,externalandWales,external. Public Health England (PHE) confirmed on Thursday thata further 55 cases,externalof the virus variant first identified in India - known as B.1.617 - were found in the UK in the latest week to 14 April. PHE experts are currently unsure whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity. Meanwhile, scientific advisers to the UK government are increasingly optimistic that Covid restrictions will continue to lift in line with the roadmap in England - with hints this could include ditching the requirement for face coverings in many indoor settings during the summer. But there is an expectation that some of the precautions such as masks and social distancing, if eased over the summer, may have to be brought back in the autumn to prevent further surges of cases. The latest R number range for England was estimated to be 0.8 to 1.0, with a growth rate indicating the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1% and 5% every day. The UK reported a further 2,678 coronavirus cases on Friday. Another 40 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded, a slight rise on recent days.

Man guilty of Â£26m celebrity west London raids,"The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were broken into in December 2019 An Italian man has been convicted over his role in a Â£25m raid on model Tamara Ecclestone's luxury west London home. In a series of high-end burglaries in December 2019, watches and jewellery belonging to Mrs Ecclestone, Frank Lampard and the late Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were among the items taken. Alessandro Maltese, 45, from Milan, pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court to conspiracy to burgle. He will be sentenced at a later date. The raid on Ms Ecclestone's Kensington home is one of the biggest domestic burglaries in English legal history, in terms of the value of items stolen. Maltese was arrested in Italy under a European Arrest Warrant in September and extradited to the UK the following month. Assisted in court by an Italian interpreter, he admitted to conspiring to burgle dwellings between 30 November 2019 and 18 December 2019. Prosecutor Timothy Cray QC said Maltese had previously denied the charge in March, but had now changed his plea. The home of the former Chelsea manager and England international Mr Lampard was the first to be raided on 1 December. Tamara Ecclestone's Kensington mansion was raided on 13 December 2019 as she flew out for a Christmas family holiday A diamond watch, cufflinks and a clock worth an estimated Â£60,000 were taken. Then on 10 December, a Knightsbridge property belonging to the Srivaddhanaprabha family was targeted. It was duty-free billionaire Leicester City owner Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's home before his death in a helicopter crash outside the club's King Power Stadium in October 2018. This time, 400,000 euros in cash was taken, as well as expensive watches. The final burglary, on the palatial home near Kensington Palace that socialite Ms Ecclestone shares with her husband Jay Rutland, resulted in about Â£25m worth of valuables being stolen. Ms Ecclestone, the daughter of ex-Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, was on a Christmas family holiday in Lapland with Mr Rutland, their daughter and their dog at the time. Judge Karen Holt remanded Maltese in custody ahead of a sentencing hearing next month.

"Welsh pubs and restaurants to open indoors in MayPubs, restaurants and all tourist accommodation set to reopen in time for the Spring bank holiday.WalesComments","Having an alcoholic drink inside pubs and restaurants in Wales has been banned since 4 December People in Wales will be able to have a drink inside a pub or restaurant for the first time in more than than five months from 17 May. All tourist accommodation, indoor entertainment and attractions in Wales are also set to reopen that day, in time for the Spring bank holiday. Indoor children's activities and groups of up to 15 adults, like gym classes, have been brought forward to 3 May. First Minister Mark Drakeford described it as a ""major reopening of Wales"". He said the relaxation of a number of lockdown rules had been moved forward because of falling Covid rates. Lockdown rules are changing again - what's happening? 'Let pubs reopen to control drinking' Opening pubs too soon 'may undo all the good' It is the first time a proposed date has been given for the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors in Wales. It comes after the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for the industry to be allowed to resume indoor trade on that date - the same as that proposed in England. Opposition parties accused Mr Drakeford, the leader of Welsh Labour, of electioneering by changing Covid rules during the Welsh Parliament election campaign. Mr Drakeford disagreed, saying the move was only because Wales' Covid case rate had fallen to the UK's lowest. ""The virus doesn't know there is an election on, and I don't think it would have been right not to have given those indications,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. The latest restriction easing comes after previous announcements thatany six people can meet outdoors in Walesfrom Saturday, and dates for gyms and swimming pools being moved forward by two weeks to 3 May. This video can not be played It is the first time a proposed date has been given for the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors in Wales Mr Drakeford has also confirmed outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants, will be allowed to reopen on Monday - alongside outdoor attractions, organised outdoor activities and wedding receptions or funeral services for up to 30 people outdoors. Two people will also be allowed to visit their loved ones in care homes from Monday. Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can also reopen,externalfrom 3 May, while people can once again form extended households, allowing two households to bubble up and have contact indoors. By the time indoor hospitality reopens on 17 May, Mr Drakeford anticipates being able to increase the number of people who can attend organised activities, such as wedding receptions, to 30 indoors and 50 outdoors, from the same date. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage People in Wales haven't been allowed to buy an alcoholic drink inside a pub or restaurant in Wales since 4 December. So allowing people to do so from 17 May would be similar to the plan in England and Scotland - with up to four people from up to four different households in Wales allowed to meet. Although, Scotland will be thefirst in the UK to open its cafes, pubs and restaurants indoorsfrom Monday - but no alcohol can be served. People in England can already visit the pub or have a meal in a restaurant outside - thatcould extend to inside from 17 May. Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants can welcome customers outdoors in Northern Ireland from 30 April, with restrictions, while people may be allowed to socialise inside from 24 May at the earliest, depending on Covid case rates. Happier times for cafÃ© owner Sara Bailey - when customers could order inside It has been a long time coming for Treorchy cafe owner Sara Bailey. Hot Gossip, like so many other catering businesses in Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been shut for four months. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many have had a Covid vaccine in Wales? ""It seems that things are going well at the moment with Covid cases, so it is time to give us a date to reopen,"" she said. Without any outdoor seating, Sara Bailey is desperate to open inside her Treorchy cafÃ© For restaurateur Nataniel Martinez, who runs Le Monde in Cardiff and Penarth's Old Customs House, reopening is a large-scale operation. ""The opening of indoor hospitality for us means we can bring back about 120 staff into work,"" he said. ""The demand for indoor dining is massive, so we are really looking forward now to getting back to it and reopening all the restaurants."" Restaurateur Nataniel Martinez says opening indoors is vital to his businesses Rhian Davies, owner of the Crown and Sceptre pubÂ in Cadoxton in Neath Port Talbot, said there was a ""lot of preparation to do"" before reopening - but added the industry was used to it after months of safety measures last year. She said she accepted closures had been needed: ""I wanted to help the hard working staff of our hospitals and health service... and was happy to do my bit to stop Covid spreading."" The announcement has been warmly welcomed by UKHospitality, the trade body representing the hospitality sector in Wales. ""We have led the calls for earlier reopening and have been advising, consulting and negotiating on the need to help protect jobs and businesses - and the public,"" said Dave Chapman, its director for Wales. He said the announcement ""offers clarity and commercial hope, and reflects positively the medical evidence"". Wales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK when the Welsh governmentbanned sale of alcohol on the premisesof pubs and restaurants on 4 December. Then came the pre-Christmas lockdown, shutting all restaurants, pubs and shops, as Wales reported more than 3,000 Covid cases in a day and that theWelsh NHS was struggling to cope. Now, Wales has thelowest Covid case rate in the UK- around 15 cases per 100,000 people - with, compared to other UK nations, thehighest percentage of its populationvaccinated. The number of Covid patients in hospitals in Wales has also dropped to its lowest level. While there now appears to be a broad consensus on hospitality restrictions, both the Tories and Plaid Cymru have said Mr Drakeford should not be using the televised address for announcements easing restrictions. The Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh Labour leader of ""naked electioneering"" while Plaid Cymru said it was ""completely inappropriate"" for the press conference to be used like this. Plaid leader Adam Price, said: ""A Plaid Cymru government would plan for the reopening of indoor hospitality, tourist accommodation, cinemas and other entertainment venues on 17 May. ""To put businesses on the best possible footing our first steps in office include providing start up grants for hospitality businesses. ""Additional financial support would also be backdated to 26 April for those businesses that cannot viably trade on the basis of outdoor opening alone."" BASICS:Simple guide to the Senedd election POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for? FIRST TIME:Will 16-year-olds vote? Welcoming the announcement Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said it was ""great news"". She said: ""As a nation we must all work together to ensure the vaccination programme continues and that the lockdowns and closures we've been through never need to return."" Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said:  ""Labour had ample opportunity to bring forward a roadmap out of lockdown, but refused to do so. ""Thanks to the UK's great vaccination story much more detail could have been announced prior to the election period... but Labour chose to play politics instead of adopting the Welsh Conservative roadmap."" Mark Reckless, from the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, said: ""This is getting to the point of testing election rules to breaking point. ""The Labour leader is using his platform as first minister to make political announcements during an election campaign.""

Drunk teacher took pupils on trip to strip club,"Richard Glenn got drunk during the school trip to Costa Rica in 2019 An IT teacher who threatened pupils and took some to a strip club while he was drunk during a school trip has been banned from teaching for three years. Richard Glenn's behaviour was so ""unacceptable"" he was sent home early during Longridge Towers School's trip to Costa Rica in July 2019, the Teaching Regulation Agency heard. Mr Glenn, 55, admitted gross misconduct and was dismissed in August 2019. The Northumberland private school costs up to Â£4,850 a term for day pupils. A misconduct panel heard,externalMr Glenn, who taught computer science and had been head of sixth form since 2007, was one of the leaders of the group of 16 to 18-year-olds that went to Costa Rica on 5 July 2019. The panel said pupils were ""relying on him for guidance"" in Costa Rica He was supposed to be there until 28 July, but after six days was sent home by the expedition's leader ""due to his behaviour"". His actions included: Drinking with pupils Allowing one or more pupils to drink alcohol despite being under the legal age of 18 Threatening to ""kick the head in"" of one pupil and ""kill"" another Telling one pupil: ""I'm not in trouble - you'll be in trouble"" After being aggressive to one pupil, he kissed the boy's forehead and told him ""you're all right"" Taking one or more pupils to a strip club Acting aggressively towards the woman leading the trip when she tried to help him back to his tent Exposing himself to the woman in a shared hotel room, although it was agreed this was not ""malicious or sexually motivated"" The panel said his behaviour ""placed one or more pupils in his care at risk"". It added there was ""no malice or sexual intent"" in taking the students to the lapdancing club, but Mr Glenn admitted it was ""inappropriate and unprofessional"" for him to fail to control the situation. He added he could not remember what happened ""due to his state of intoxication"" but he ""did not dispute the recollection of those present"", the report said. The private boarding school near Berwick charges up to Â£9,800 a term for boarders The panel was shown photos of drink tickets bought at the strip club and said it was ""satisfied"" that his conduct ""amounted to misconduct of a serious nature which fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession"". The panel's report said: ""Mr Glenn was, at various times during the school trip, under the influence of alcohol, and therefore not in a position to adequately take decisions or act in loco parentis should the need arise. ""This was in circumstances where pupils under his care were in an unfamiliar country, far from home, and relying on him for guidance and protection. ""Mr Glenn was an experienced teacher and pastoral leader who would have been expected to lead an overseas trip safely, and would have been well aware of the conduct expected of him."" After the three years have elapsed, Mr Glenn will need to apply for the ban to be lifted, the panel said. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

Female officer dead in attack on French police,"The Yvelines area west of Paris has been targeted by militant Islamists in the past A female police employee has been killed in a knife attack at a police station south-west of Paris. Anti-terror prosecutors have taken over the inquiry, and the killing is being treated as a possible terrorist attack. The attacker, who reportedly came to France from Tunisia several years ago, was shot dead by police. President Emmanuel Macron led tributes to the 49-year-old victim, and said France would never give in to ""Islamist terrorism"". The stabbing took place in the secure entrance to the police station in the commuter town of Rambouillet at 14:20 (12:20 GMT). Witnesses said the attacker had been seen walking around while on his mobile phone outside the police station and seized his chance to go in as the woman - an unarmed administrative officer - went through the security doors. He reportedly lunged at the officer, stabbing her in the neck. Her colleagues then opened fire on him. Anti-terrorism prosecutors said they took over the investigation because of the way the attack had unfolded, remarks made by the attacker and the fact that he targeted a police official. Sources close to the inquiry told media outlets that the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) during the attack. Officials said the attacker, 36, was not previously known to security agencies. Local outlet BFMTV reported that he had lived in the country illegally before obtaining a residency card, which was due to expire later this year. Three people were arrested following the attack, according to reports. A judicial source told AFP news agency they were part of the suspect's ""entourage"". In a Twitter post following the attack, Mr Macron said the victim's name was StÃ©phanie. ""The nation is by the side of her family, her colleagues and security forces,"" he wrote. Her full name has not been released, but local media reports describe her as a mother of two. Prime Minister Jean Castex and Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin went straight to the scene, in the large Yvelines area to the west of the capital. Mr Castex said the country had lost an ""everyday heroine"" and condemned what he described as a ""barbaric act of boundless cruelty"". ""Our determination to combat terrorism in all its forms is as resolute as ever,"" he told reporters. ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse, president of the Paris region, said the attack had been against a ""symbol of France"". The police, she said, were ""the face of France"". Far-right leader Marine Le Pen - seen as the strongest challenger to Mr Macron in next year's presidential election - tweeted condemnation of Friday's attack before details of the suspect's identity had been made public. ""The same horrors come one after another, the same infinite sadness as we think about the relatives and the colleagues of this female police employee who has been killed, the same type of person guilty of this barbarity, the same Islamist motives,"" she wrote. Police cordoned off the area after their colleague was fatally stabbed British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also reacted to the attack on Twitter. ""We stand with our French friends and allies following tragic news of a female police officer killed by a terrorist in Rambouillet while doing her job,"" he wrote. In his comments on Friday, Mr Castex noted that the Yvelines area had been targeted before, including in 2016 when two members of the police force were fatally stabbed at their home. In October 2020 the militant Islamist murder of teacher Samuel Paty in Yvelines led to national outrage, as he was attacked after an online campaign that began with false claims from a 13-year-old girl at his school.

Covid pushes UK borrowing to highest since WW2,"The cost of measures to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic has pushed government borrowing to the highest level since the end of World War Two. Government borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - hit Â£303.1bn in the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said. Compared to the previous year, borrowing is nearly Â£250bn higher. Measures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard. Borrowing hit Â£28bn in March alone - a record high for that month. Despite the record figure, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme the annual borrowing figure was ""slightly better than expected a month ago"". Where does the government borrow billions from? But, he added: ""The big story in a sense is they [the borrowing figures] are Â£250bn more than a year ago. ""And that, of course, is because of to some extent the recession of the last year but mostly because of the huge amount of additional government spending to support the economy over the last year."" Government borrowing of Â£303bn is at the same time, an extraordinary record, but also something a relief. For starters it is not Â£400bn, as anticipated only a few months ago, though this number will go up when some Covid support loans fail to be repaid. But its cause has been primarily an active government decision to spend more to support incomes during the pandemic. Of the Â£250bn difference in borrowing between this year and last, over Â£200bn comes from extra spending, the rest on a reduction in taxes. In the latest reported month, March, taxes were barely down on last year. Whereas VAT, fuel duty and business rates were down, self assessment, PAYE, stamp duty and capital gains taxes were up. That is part of a wider trend of the economy riding the second lockdown much more effectively than the first. It is epitomised by this morning's separate retail sales figures showing a boost even ahead of the physical reopening of shops. The ONS suggested Britons wanted to look good and deck out their gardens ahead of some restrictions being lifted. Others, less charitable,  suggested lockdown excess meant our clothes no longer fit. The chancellor's slimming regime for the public finances is a gentle one. Borrowing is predicted to continue at high levels this year, as jobs support continues until the autumn, and massive tax cuts are meant to persuade companies to invest in plant and machinery. It is a rebound in growth that will most effectively shrink these record borrowing numbers. That is why amid the sea of red ink, there is some reason for relief. Measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic contributed to a Â£203.2bn, or 27.5%, increase in central government day-to-day spending in the year to March, the ONS said. Meanwhile, tax and National Insurance receipts fell by Â£34.9bn, down 5% compared with the previous 12 months. The ONS also said public borrowing as a percentage of GDP, or national output rose, to 14.5% - also the highest since the end of the second world war when it reached 15.2% in 1946. The huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed public sector net debt up to Â£2.142 trillion, which is 97.7% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s. Clothes sales boosted retailers ahead of reopening Higher petrol prices drive up cost of living Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG, said: ""Rising debt is largely an unfortunate consequence of the government's focus on shielding the economy as much as possible from the impact of Covid-19. ""However, doing otherwise could have created long-lasting scars which would be far worse for fiscal sustainability."" Despite the record annual figure, the ONS said it was Â£24.3bn lower than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the fiscal watchdog, had forecast in March. Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said: ""If we are right in thinking the economic recovery will be faster and fuller than the OBR anticipates, borrowing will probably fall more quickly than most expect."" Separate research published on Friday added to hopes of a swift rebound for the economy, as it suggested that the easing of lockdown measures this month has triggered a surge in activity among UK businesses. A closely watched survey, produced by IHS Markit/CIPS, indicated that the looser pandemic restrictions had led to the fastest UK private sector growth since late 2013. The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60 in April,external, according to initial findings, up from 56.4 in March. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion. The service sector grew faster than manufacturing for the first time since the Covid pandemic began, the survey found, largely because of the reopening of non-essential shops in England and Wales from mid-April. ""Companies are reporting a surge in demand for both goods and services as the economy opens up from lockdowns and the encouraging vaccine rollout adds to a brighter outlook,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""Business activity should continue to grow strongly in May and June as virus restrictions are eased further, setting the scene for a bumper second quarter for the economy. ""There's also good news for the job market,"" he added. ""Firms have been encouraged to take on extra staff at a rate not seen for over three-and-a-half years. ""There are some causes for concern, however, as export performance remains relatively lacklustre, often linked to post-Brexit trading conditions, and prices continue to rise sharply.""

LiveLiveCovid: Welsh government update1 minute ago1 minute ago Thank you and goodbyeThank you and goodbye12 minutes ago WATCH: Welsh election explainedWATCH: Welsh election explained12 minutes ago Small firms call for 'consensus' on easing after electionSmall firms call for 'consensus' on easing after election,"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving a Welsh government update on the pandemic He confirmed the latest plans for the easing of lockdown rules Any six people can meet outside from Saturday, initially in private gardens, parks and other open spaces Pubs, cafes and restaurants can open to serve people outdoors from Monday The major parties all support the idea of letting them open indoors from 17 May It is the last scheduled Covid update until after the Welsh Parliament election on 6 May Rachel Flint, Luca Weinmann Al-Nawab and Andy Roberts Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of the Welsh government's coronavirus briefing. We learnt that:  However First Minister Mark Drakeford has been accused by opposition parties of ""electioneering"" by announcing positive during a Senedd election campaign, including some proposed changes after polling day. We're planning to run our next live page on Thursday, covering the BBC Wales election leaders' debate to be shown on BBC One Wales at 2030 BST. Join us then for live coverage and reaction. This video can not be played Welsh elections 2021: Why does devolution matter to my vote? As some form of Covid restrictions remain in place, voters in Wales are going to the polls to elect members of the Senedd, or Welsh Parliament, on 6 May. Sixteen and 17-year-olds will able to vote for the first time. So what's at stake? Miriam Barker explains how the responsibilities are divided up between the Senedd in Cardiff Bay and the UK Parliament at Westminster. All political parties need to agree dates for the reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales as lockdown restrictions are eased, business leaders have warned. Some of the changes to lockdown measures come after the Senedd election on 6 May, so the decision will lie in the hands of whoever wins and will be running the Welsh government after that date. This includes the proposed reopening of pubs indoors on 17 May. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said a date after the election added ""even more uncertainty"" for business owners. Ben Francis, FSB Wales Policy Chair, said firms ""need to plan and make financial commitments safe in the knowledge that there is some agreement between the political parties on what will happen in May."" The staff at BrewDog Cardiff are readying themselves for a busy day on Monday. Pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales will be able to serve customers outside, with the prospect of indoor opening from 17 May. Allow Twitter content?

Barry Island was popular with visitors when the first lockdown was lifted last summer Wales is in for a ""better summer"" this year than in 2020, the first minister has forecast. Mark Drakeford was not talking about any potential for a heatwave, but about us being able to do more in our daily lives due to less tight lockdown measures. ""I remember saying some months ago, when I was being asked to look forward and my ambitions for dealing with coronavirus, I said what I hoped we will be able to do would be to lift restrictions earlier in the year than we were able to do last year, and for them to last longer over the summer,"" he said at today's press conference. ""Some of the things that I have announced today - indoor hospitality, the reopening of the whole of tourism accommodation and so on - we were doing that well into the summer last year, and we will be doing it in May, I hope, this year. ""So we are certainly further ahead than we were 12 months ago."" A commuter who lives near Cardiff took to Twitter to brag at the lovely meal he had at a beer garden in the Hereford area before coming home from work. Pubs in England have been allowed to serve customers outdoors for nearly two weeks now. Red Todd-Bennett from Llandough said it was ""too good an opportunity to turn down to have nice cold pint and a burger in the sun"". ""Monday seems like a lifetime away til the pubs open in Wales,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This video can not be played Some gym owners and members had held protests calling for an earlier opening date ahead of today's announcement From Monday, changes to coronavirus laws mean it will be legal to attend a protest in Wales. Mass gatherings are currently banned due to the coronavirus pandemic, and some protest organisers have said they have been fined. In a statement First Minister Mark Drakeford said changes to Covid laws mean that from 26 April, attending a protest will be added to the list of ""reasonable excuses"" for meeting others. This will only be allowed under alert levels one, two and three. Under the changes protests will have to be organised by ""a responsible body with appropriate mitigations, including
undertaking a risk assessment"". The
regulations are also being amended to permit all working in
other peoplesâ homes at alert levels one, two and three.  Rodney Berman of the Welsh Liberal Democrats welcomed the news of dates that gyms and pubs could reopen saying it was ""good for the fitness industry and good for the hospitality industryâ. He said the progress out of lockdown was partly due to âtaking it steadily"" and monitoring the effect of each change on infection rates, an approach heâd like to see continue. âItâs very easy to set dates well in advance but if you do that you might have to change them,"" Mr Berman said. âItâs better to have a âgeneral roadmapâ and check how things are going because the last thing we want to do is go into another lockdown."" Plaid Cymru has said that Wales must avoid a ""further lockdown at all costs"". Reacting to the Welsh government's plans to ease Covid restrictions on daily life, party leader Adam Price said Wales must learn from other countries who had kept case rates and death numbers low. ""We have to avoid further lockdown at all costs,"" he told BBC Wales. ""The way that we do that is fundamentally by investing in that test, trace, isolate and support system. ""That is the means by which many of those countries that invested in that type of approach avoided lockdowns, precisely because they were able to identify outbreaks earlier and maintain them at a low level through suppressing the virus very, very actively."" The Welsh Conservatives welcomed the possibility of pubs reopening indoors on 17 May, and some of the other measures. However party leader Andrew RT Davies said First Minister Mark Drakeford had criticised the Tory roadmap out of lockdown as ""reckless"" but was now bringing forward the dates. ""The first minister said it was rubbish and reckless, but now weâre in an election period the first minister thinks itâs a very sensible thing to do,"" Mr Davies said. âThereâs nothing like a sinner who repenteth.â The Tory leader also called on the Welsh government to provide more financial support for the hospitality sector. Wearing face masks to the shops and hairdressers has become a normal part of life during the pandemic. But with cases falling when we will be able to stop wearing them and staying two metres apart from everyone? First Minister Mark Drakeford was asked the question during the briefing today. He said that if case rates continued to improve, ""we may be able to mitigate some of the measures that we are all taking"" to reduce infection rates. ""But I think that the population in Wales, which has stuck so carefully to the rules and done so much to protect one another, they will want to go on playing their part, rather than thinking that we can act as though coronavirus has gone away,"" he said. Under the changes announced today many of us may already getting ready to see our mates in the pub. But what would the rules be when we can finally go for meals and drinks again? From tomorrow six people, from any six households, can meet outside, including outdoor licensed premises from Monday. This means you can go for a drink with six of your friends or family, but should maintain social distancing from people you do not live with. First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hoped Wales would move to Alert Level Two on 17 May, allowing pubs to reopen indoors. Under this alert level, the second lowest, meaning case rates are fairly low, four people will be allowed to meet indoors. This means four people, from any four households, will be able to meet inside for a meal or a drink, but only in regulated premises, like cafes and pubs.  Allowing more family members and friends to meet indoors should not be considered until âit is safe for that to take place,â according to Wales' first minister. On 3 May, two households will be able to form an extended household, meaning they will be âable to meet in each otherâs houses, stay overnightâ. Asked when such ""bubbles"" might be extended to include more than two households, Mark Drakeford said: âThe advice and the evidence has been clear now for a long time that meeting indoors is amongst the most risky things we do. âProvided that is going well then, of course, we will look to extend that so that further households can be added in to that arrangement so that more family members can meet in ways that we would once have taken for granted. âBut we wonât do it until we are sure that the public health evidence and that the context of the time means that it is safe for that to take place.â This video can not be played Large crowds have been gathering outdoors while pubs in Wales remain closed First Minister Mark Drakeford has rejected suggestions that
the date for indoor pub and restaurant service should be brought forward. After a five-and-a-half month Covid shut-down, outdoor
hospitality can restart on Monday, but serving drinks or food indoors is likely to remain banned until 17 May. There have been concerns that the three-week gap will lead
to large groups gathering outside pubs and elsewhere. Crowds were broken up by police after gathering inCardiff Bay to drink in the sunshine over the recent bank holiday weekend. But Mr Drakeford said he would stick to the policy of
gradual easing of Covid restrictions, including waiting to see if changes led
to more cases before moving on to the next stage. âWe will have another significant set of easements today and
on the 3rd of May,â he said. âWe then need to pause to makes
sure once again that that package of measures doesnât have unintended and adverse
consequences. âThat has always been the advice of our Chief Medical
Officer and our Chief Scientific Advisers in Wales.â With an election on 6 May, the proposed changes on 17 May would need to
be confirmed by the next Welsh Government, although the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru as the main opposition parties have both said they back the proposals. Wales' first minister said he has set out âa forward-lookâ of how Covid restrictions could continue to be lifted in the weeks ahead but âthese are choices for the next government to makeâ. It it less than two weeks until the Welsh Parliament election on 6 May. Mark Drakeford, the leader of Welsh Labour, said it was his âassessmentâ that the hospitality sector â bars, pubs, restaurants and cafes â will be able to open indoors from May 17, together with all other tourist accommodation, indoor entertainment and attractions. He said that âat the same timeâ he anticipated that âwe will also be able to increase the number of people who can attend organised activities, including wedding receptions, to 30 indoors and 50 outdoors, from the same dateâ. Mr Drakeford stressed that since that was after the election, such changes would be ""choices for the next government to makeâ. However, he added: âI want the many thousands of businesses in these sectors to have these dates today, so they have as much notice as possible to plan ahead and prepare."" After months exericising over Zoom and from our homes, gyms in Wales will reopen for the first time this year on Monday. There have been repeated calls from the sector to allow members back indoors, with some saying the continued closures were damaging for people's mental and physical wellbeing. First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced up to 15 people would be allowed to attend exercise classes together from Monday, after the date was moved forward. Community centres will also reopen on the same day. Mr Drakeford said this would mean that Wales will have moved to âalert level three by May 3â. âThis is faster than we had originally expected and reflects the progress we have made in controlling the virus and rolling out vaccination across Wales,"" he said. From Monday up to 30 people will be able to attend wedding receptions, funerals and wakes in Wales, as long as they are held outside. The changes were announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford at the coronavirus briefing. Mr Drakeford said outdoor attractions, including funfairs, theme parks and outdoor swimming pools, could also reopen on Monday. On care home visits, he said: âWe have also updated our guidance on care home visits to allow for a second designated indoor visitor."" Mr Drakeford said there would be ""more flexibility around visits from young children"". ""This updated guidance will come into effect from Monday."" First Minister Mark Drakeford says the positive public health situation means there is  âmore headroomâ to make further changes to the current Covid restrictions in Wales. From tomorrow any six people are able to meet outdoors, including private gardens, and from Monday in beer gardens too. âMany cafes, restaurants, pubs and bars with outdoor areas are taking bookings ahead of the planned re-opening from Monday,"" he said. ""It is important they have as much notice as possible about the rule-of-six, so they can take bookings for these larger groups."" The Welsh Labour leader has been accused of âelectioneeringâ by opposition parties who say he should not be making these announcements during the Senedd election campaign. Wales has âthe most successful vaccination programme in the UKâ, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford, the leader of Welsh Labour, said the latest figures showed that more than 1.7 million adults aged 18 and over have had their first dose of the vaccine. He said that was ""more than two-thirds of the adult populationâ. âMore than 650,000 adults have completed the two-dose course â thatâs one in four adults in Walesâ, he added. Mr Drakeford said âreally good progressâ was being made on  vaccinating younger adults with around two-thirds of people in their 40s and more than 30% of people in their 30s having had a first dose. First Minister Mark Drakeford says Wales now has the lowest Covid rates in the UK. Speaking at the Welsh governmentâs three weekly review of the coronavirus regulations, Mr Drakeford said the all-Wales figure was now 14.7 cases per 100,000 people. âThree weeks ago the figure was 35. There are 14 local authorities with rates below 15 cases per 100,000 people and the positivity rate is down to 1.7%â, he said. ""Wales has the lowest rates of coronavirus in the whole of the United Kingdom."" Mr Drakeford said the pressure on the NHS was continuing to ease with the number of people needing hospital treatment for the virus falling to the lowest level since mid-September. âIndeed, the number of people in hospital for coronavirus-related reasons has more than halved in the last three weeks,â he added.

LivePost Office apologises as convictions quashed,"A group of 39 sub-postmasters have their convictions for stealing money quashed They had been convicted, with some imprisoned, after the Post Office installed the Horizon computer system A further three postmasters' convictions are ruled as ""safe"" as did not rely on Horizon evidence Lord Justice Holroyde says the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"" the system's defects The judges ruled the Post Office brought serious criminal charges against the sub-postmasters on the basis of Horizon data The Post Office prevented them from having a fair trial on the issue of whether that data was reliable, they ruled Post Office chairman Tim Parker says: ""The Post Office is extremely sorry for the impact on the lives of these postmasters and their families that was caused by historical failures"". The judgement is met with cheers from former postmasters outside the court In December 2019, the Post Office agreed to pay almost Â£58m to settle the dispute with more than 500 sub-postmasters Dearbail Jordan and Dan Ascher Former Post Office workers are celebrating today after 39 people had their criminal convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal in London. And that's where we'll leave our live coverage for now. You canread the full story herewhich is being updated throughout the day. We welcome the landmark decision by the Court of Appeal today to overturn these convictions, which marks another important milestone for postmasters affected by the Horizon dispute.  The Post Office has rightly apologised for its historical failings and is taking determined action to right the wrongs of the past, and we continue to monitor this work very closely.â Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy Former Post Office worker Tom Hedges, who was convicted of theft and false accounting and given a seven-month suspended sentence in 2011, opened a bottle of prosecco outside the Royal Courts of Justice after his conviction was quashed. ""It's a wonderful afternoon,"" he told the Press Association. ""When I told my mother, who's 93, I was coming to court she said 'get yourself down to Aldi and get some prosecco'."" ""She said 'just remember your name is Hedges not Rothschild, so get prosecco, not Bollinger!""' Neil Hudgell, the solicitor for 29 of the postmasters has accused the Post Office of a coverup. ""Ultimately, it has been found to have been an organisation that not only turned a blind eye to the failings in its hugely expensive IT system, but positively promoted a culture of cover-up and subterfuge in the pursuit of reputation and profit, "" he said. ""They readily accepted that loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary people as a price worth paying in that pursuit."" Allow Twitter content?

The solicitor who represented 29 of the postmasters has said it is ""almost impossible to describe the true impact"" that the scandal has had on the lives of those who had their reputations and livlihoods ""so unfairly destroyed"". Solicitor Neil Hudgell said: ""They are honest, hard-working people who served their communities but have had to live with the stigma of being branded criminals for many years, all the while knowing they have been innocent. ""Indeed, given its actions, everything the Post Office has sought to do over the last year or so, whether it be by way of apology and offers of redress, or by talking about a cultural change, completely unravelled when our clients' cases where heard."" He added: ""The Post Office failed to offer any sort of explanation as to why wholesale disclosure of evidence was withheld in cases, nor why a proper investigation was not carried out when known problems in the Horizon system started to appear."" ""This is a huge victory in the fight for justice for the subpostmasters affected by this appalling decades-long scandal, in the face of inaction from government,"" said Ed Miliband, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary. ""But there are so many other names to clear. For some who lost their homes and their reputations, it's too late. He said Labour was pushing for a ""proper Inquiry with teeth"" to get the bottom of how this scandal happened who was responsible. ""The government's inquiry risks being a whitewash,"" he said. Helen Pitcher, the chairwoman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which asked the Court of Appeal to review the convictions, said: ""This has been a serious miscarriage of justice which has had a devastating impact on these victims and their families."" ""Every single one of these convictions has clearly had a profound and life-changing impact for those involved,"" she said in a statement. ""The Post Office has rightly acknowledged the failures that led to these cases and conceded that the prosecutions were an abuse of process."" ""We sincerely hope that lessons will be learned from this to prevent anything similar happening elsewhere in the future."" There were emotional scenes outside the Court of Appeal after the judgement was handed down. Former post office worker Janet Skinner - who was imprisoned in 2007 for nine months over a shortfall of Â£59,000 at her Post Office in Hull - broke down in tears when she emerged from the court. Ms Skinner said she was ""relieved"" to have finally cleared her name. Earlier today, she told BBC Radio Humberside about the moment the judge told her that she would be going to prison. âI actually thought he meant, he was going to give me a suspended sentence or something and that was it,"" she said. ""Then they locked the door and then I knew that I wasnât coming out."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter It is impossible to overstate
the impact this judgement is likely to have on the Post Office. Its chief executive Nick Read has
apologised and paid tribute to the sub-postmasters whose convictions have been
overturned. But, the ruling does open the
road for dozens of people to seek damages against the Post Office for malicious
prosecution. On top of making good on the
historical shortfalls, this could leave the Post Office with a huge bill. One
which it could well need financial support from the government to pay. Earlier on Friday, former sub-postmaster Noel Thomas shared the pain and devastation that his conviction for stealing from the Post Office has caused him and his family - see our report at 9:51am. He is pictured here after the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction. He and his 38 colleagues who also saw their convictions overturned will be feeling fully vindicated today after a long fight. The Court of Appeal said that the Post Office prevented the postmasters from having a fair trial. It said the Post Office's failure to investigate or disclose data from the unreliable Horizon IT system prevented those postmasters, of which the court found 39 were wrongly convicted, from challenging those convictions. ""In short, [Post Office] as prosecutor brought serious criminal charges against the subpostmasters on the basis of Horizon data."" ""By its failures to discharge its clear duties it prevented them from having a fair trial on the issue of whether that data was reliable."" The convictions of 39 Post Office branch managers have been overturned, but for one family it is too little, too late. Tim Parker, chairman of the Post Office, said: ""The Post
Office is extremely sorry for the impact on the lives of these postmasters and
their families that was caused by historical failures."" The Post Office today sincerely apologises for serious failures in its historical conduct of prosecutions of postmasters, resulting in the Court of Appeal formally overturning convictions - that occurred between 2003 to 2013 - in uncontested appeals. The Court quashed 39 convictions, referred by the Criminal Cases Review Commission last year.  The Post Office announced at the earliest opportunity, in October 2020, that it would not oppose the overwhelming majority of these appeals.  The Court upheld the safety of convictions in three cases. The Post Office Lord Justice Holroyde said at the Court of Appeal ruling today that the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"" the system's defects. But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"", and ""effectively steamrolled over any subpostmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"". Prior to today's judgement, the Post Office said: ""We sincerely apologise to the postmasters affected by our historical failures. Throughout this appeals process we have supported the quashing of the
overwhelming majority of these convictions and the judgement will be an important milestone in addressing the past.â Three of the 42 sub-postmasters hoping to have their names cleared today will be disappointed. The judges decided that the cases brought against Neelam Hussain, Stanley Fell and Wendy Cousins did not depend on data from the flawed Horizon IT system. Therefore it said their convictions were safe. The Court of Appeal has quashed the convictions of 39 former Post Office workers who were found guilty of stealing money from the company, according to the Press Association. The former sub-postmasters and postmisstresses had been convicted of theft, fraud and false accounting because of the Post Office's defective Horizon accounting system. Jo Hamilton is one of those awaiting the decision by the Court of Appeal. She was accused by the Post Office of taking Â£36,000 from the village branch she ran in Hampshire. Ms Hamilton had to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. Declaring the criminal record also affected everyday life, such as failing to get car insurance. ""I think this is the biggest miscarriage of justice,"" she told PA. ""I was 45 when this started. It's taken up nearly a third of my life. You think it's never going to end."" ""I was given a 12-month supervision order and have a criminal record,"" she said.
""But I did nothing wrong. I told them about the problem but they said I was the only one."" Nick Wallis has been reporting on the Post Office scandal for over a decade. Allow Twitter content?

The ruling will determine whether these convictions were also ""an affront to the public conscience"". If judges say they were, the postmasters may pursue civil action against the Post Office for malicious prosecution, seeking significant sums in damages. Three more cases referred by the Criminal Cases Review Commission have yet to be heard. It is also reviewing 22 more cases, and inviting others to make an application, which could go directly to the Court of Appeal, if a conviction is believed to be unsafe. Â© 2025 BBC.

He added: ""The Post Office failed to offer any sort of explanation as to why wholesale disclosure of evidence was withheld in cases, nor why a proper investigation was not carried out when known problems in the Horizon system started to appear."" ""This is a huge victory in the fight for justice for the subpostmasters affected by this appalling decades-long scandal, in the face of inaction from government,"" said Ed Miliband, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary. ""But there are so many other names to clear. For some who lost their homes and their reputations, it's too late. He said Labour was pushing for a ""proper Inquiry with teeth"" to get the bottom of how this scandal happened who was responsible. ""The government's inquiry risks being a whitewash,"" he said. Helen Pitcher, the chairwoman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which asked the Court of Appeal to review the convictions, said: ""This has been a serious miscarriage of justice which has had a devastating impact on these victims and their families."" ""Every single one of these convictions has clearly had a profound and life-changing impact for those involved,"" she said in a statement. ""The Post Office has rightly acknowledged the failures that led to these cases and conceded that the prosecutions were an abuse of process."" ""We sincerely hope that lessons will be learned from this to prevent anything similar happening elsewhere in the future."" There were emotional scenes outside the Court of Appeal after the judgement was handed down. Former post office worker Janet Skinner - who was imprisoned in 2007 for nine months over a shortfall of Â£59,000 at her Post Office in Hull - broke down in tears when she emerged from the court. Ms Skinner said she was ""relieved"" to have finally cleared her name. Earlier today, she told BBC Radio Humberside about the moment the judge told her that she would be going to prison. âI actually thought he meant, he was going to give me a suspended sentence or something and that was it,"" she said.

the impact this judgement is likely to have on the Post Office. Its chief executive Nick Read has
apologised and paid tribute to the sub-postmasters whose convictions have been
overturned. But, the ruling does open the
road for dozens of people to seek damages against the Post Office for malicious
prosecution. On top of making good on the
historical shortfalls, this could leave the Post Office with a huge bill. One
which it could well need financial support from the government to pay. Earlier on Friday, former sub-postmaster Noel Thomas shared the pain and devastation that his conviction for stealing from the Post Office has caused him and his family - see our report at 9:51am. He is pictured here after the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction. He and his 38 colleagues who also saw their convictions overturned will be feeling fully vindicated today after a long fight. The Court of Appeal said that the Post Office prevented the postmasters from having a fair trial. It said the Post Office's failure to investigate or disclose data from the unreliable Horizon IT system prevented those postmasters, of which the court found 39 were wrongly convicted, from challenging those convictions. ""In short, [Post Office] as prosecutor brought serious criminal charges against the subpostmasters on the basis of Horizon data."" ""By its failures to discharge its clear duties it prevented them from having a fair trial on the issue of whether that data was reliable."" The convictions of 39 Post Office branch managers have been overturned, but for one family it is too little, too late. Tim Parker, chairman of the Post Office, said: ""The Post
Office is extremely sorry for the impact on the lives of these postmasters and
their families that was caused by historical failures."" The Post Office today sincerely apologises for serious failures in its historical conduct of prosecutions of postmasters, resulting in the Court of Appeal formally overturning convictions - that occurred between 2003 to 2013 - in uncontested appeals. The Court quashed 39 convictions, referred by the Criminal Cases Review Commission last year.  The Post Office announced at the earliest opportunity, in October 2020, that it would not oppose the overwhelming majority of these appeals.  The Court upheld the safety of convictions in three cases. The Post Office Lord Justice Holroyde said at the Court of Appeal ruling today that the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"" the system's defects. But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"", and ""effectively steamrolled over any subpostmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"". Prior to today's judgement, the Post Office said: ""We sincerely apologise to the postmasters affected by our historical failures. Throughout this appeals process we have supported the quashing of the
overwhelming majority of these convictions and the judgement will be an important milestone in addressing the past.â Three of the 42 sub-postmasters hoping to have their names cleared today will be disappointed. The judges decided that the cases brought against Neelam Hussain, Stanley Fell and Wendy Cousins did not depend on data from the flawed Horizon IT system. Therefore it said their convictions were safe. The Court of Appeal has quashed the convictions of 39 former Post Office workers who were found guilty of stealing money from the company, according to the Press Association. The former sub-postmasters and postmisstresses had been convicted of theft, fraud and false accounting because of the Post Office's defective Horizon accounting system. Jo Hamilton is one of those awaiting the decision by the Court of Appeal. She was accused by the Post Office of taking Â£36,000 from the village branch she ran in Hampshire. Ms Hamilton had to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. Declaring the criminal record also affected everyday life, such as failing to get car insurance. ""I think this is the biggest miscarriage of justice,"" she told PA. ""I was 45 when this started. It's taken up nearly a third of my life. You think it's never going to end."" ""I was given a 12-month supervision order and have a criminal record,"" she said.
""But I did nothing wrong. I told them about the problem but they said I was the only one."" Nick Wallis has been reporting on the Post Office scandal for over a decade. Allow Twitter content?

Drunk teacher took pupils on trip to strip clubRichard Glenn is banned for three years over the visit to the Costa Rica lapdancing venue.Tyne & Wear,"Richard Glenn got drunk during the school trip to Costa Rica in 2019 An IT teacher who threatened pupils and took some to a strip club while he was drunk during a school trip has been banned from teaching for three years. Richard Glenn's behaviour was so ""unacceptable"" he was sent home early during Longridge Towers School's trip to Costa Rica in July 2019, the Teaching Regulation Agency heard. Mr Glenn, 55, admitted gross misconduct and was dismissed in August 2019. The Northumberland private school costs up to Â£4,850 a term for day pupils. A misconduct panel heard,externalMr Glenn, who taught computer science and had been head of sixth form since 2007, was one of the leaders of the group of 16 to 18-year-olds that went to Costa Rica on 5 July 2019. The panel said pupils were ""relying on him for guidance"" in Costa Rica He was supposed to be there until 28 July, but after six days was sent home by the expedition's leader ""due to his behaviour"". His actions included: Drinking with pupils Allowing one or more pupils to drink alcohol despite being under the legal age of 18 Threatening to ""kick the head in"" of one pupil and ""kill"" another Telling one pupil: ""I'm not in trouble - you'll be in trouble"" After being aggressive to one pupil, he kissed the boy's forehead and told him ""you're all right"" Taking one or more pupils to a strip club Acting aggressively towards the woman leading the trip when she tried to help him back to his tent Exposing himself to the woman in a shared hotel room, although it was agreed this was not ""malicious or sexually motivated"" The panel said his behaviour ""placed one or more pupils in his care at risk"". It added there was ""no malice or sexual intent"" in taking the students to the lapdancing club, but Mr Glenn admitted it was ""inappropriate and unprofessional"" for him to fail to control the situation. He added he could not remember what happened ""due to his state of intoxication"" but he ""did not dispute the recollection of those present"", the report said. The private boarding school near Berwick charges up to Â£9,800 a term for boarders The panel was shown photos of drink tickets bought at the strip club and said it was ""satisfied"" that his conduct ""amounted to misconduct of a serious nature which fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession"". The panel's report said: ""Mr Glenn was, at various times during the school trip, under the influence of alcohol, and therefore not in a position to adequately take decisions or act in loco parentis should the need arise. ""This was in circumstances where pupils under his care were in an unfamiliar country, far from home, and relying on him for guidance and protection. ""Mr Glenn was an experienced teacher and pastoral leader who would have been expected to lead an overseas trip safely, and would have been well aware of the conduct expected of him."" After the three years have elapsed, Mr Glenn will need to apply for the ban to be lifted, the panel said. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

And that's where we'll leave our live coverage for now. You canread the full story herewhich is being updated throughout the day. We welcome the landmark decision by the Court of Appeal today to overturn these convictions, which marks another important milestone for postmasters affected by the Horizon dispute.  The Post Office has rightly apologised for its historical failings and is taking determined action to right the wrongs of the past, and we continue to monitor this work very closely.â Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy Former Post Office worker Tom Hedges, who was convicted of theft and false accounting and given a seven-month suspended sentence in 2011, opened a bottle of prosecco outside the Royal Courts of Justice after his conviction was quashed. ""It's a wonderful afternoon,"" he told the Press Association. ""When I told my mother, who's 93, I was coming to court she said 'get yourself down to Aldi and get some prosecco'."" ""She said 'just remember your name is Hedges not Rothschild, so get prosecco, not Bollinger!""' Neil Hudgell, the solicitor for 29 of the postmasters has accused the Post Office of a coverup. ""Ultimately, it has been found to have been an organisation that not only turned a blind eye to the failings in its hugely expensive IT system, but positively promoted a culture of cover-up and subterfuge in the pursuit of reputation and profit, "" he said. ""They readily accepted that loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary people as a price worth paying in that pursuit."" Allow Twitter content?

Desperation as Indian hospitals buckle under CovidFamilies of Covid patients are pleading for hospital care as emergency rooms and wards overflow.,"This video can not be played Inside a Delhi hospital running low on beds and oxygen India's healthcare system is buckling as a record surge in Covid-19 cases puts pressure on hospital beds and drains oxygen supplies. Families are left pleading for their relatives who are desperately ill, with some patients left untreated for hours. Crematoriums are organising mass funeral pyres. On Friday India reported 332,730 new cases of coronavirus, setting a world record for a second day running. Deaths were numbered at 2,263 in 24 hours. Dr Atul Gogia, a consultant at the Sir Ganga Ram hospital in Delhi, told the BBC there had been a ""huge surge"" in patients, leaving no space in the emergency room. ""We do not have that many oxygen points. Whatever oxygen points are there, they're full. Patients are coming in with their own oxygen cylinders or without oxygen. We want to help them but there are not enough beds and not enough oxygen points even to supply them oxygen if it is there,"" he said. ""All our telephone lines are jammed. People are continuously calling the helpline. There is a big rush outside the hospital: there are ambulances parked, patients wanting to get deboarded, but the problem is, there is no space. ""We try to mobilise, we try to discharge patients who become stable as early as possible so that we can increase the turnaround, but things are difficult right now."" Have India's rallies help spread coronavirus? Why India is running out of oxygen again Every morning, for the past few days, I have been waking up to my phone buzzing with desperate messages for help. People are seeking hospital beds, life-saving drugs, oxygen and plasma for their infected and sick friends and relatives. Often, after a period of silence, the same people announce the deaths of their ""patients"". My Twitter timeline is India's Covid-19 war-room, as the state appears to have largely withered away. Every essential to save a life is in short supply or available on the black market. Then there's the fear of the virus literally ""at your door"". Over the past week, three buildings in the gated complex where I live have become ""containment zones"", with entire skyscrapers sealed because of too many infections. The days and nights are filled with helplessness, anxiety and fear. The bad news is unrelenting. The Supreme Court of India has called this a ""national emergency"". This is beyond an emergency. It is a ""complete collapse of the goddamn system"", as one of India's leading virologists says. In hotspots like Delhi and Mumbai, life, itself, is now a privilege. Maharashtra, the worst-hit state in India, faces an oxygen shortfall. In the state capital, Mumbai,at least 13 patients died after a fire broke out in an intensive care unitof a hospital treating Covid patients. Two days earlier, 24 Covid patients died in another part of the state after a leak interrupted the flow of oxygen to their ventilators. Why second Covid wave is devastating India How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave On Friday morning, Max Healthcare, which runs 10 private hospitals aroundDelhi, put out an ""SOS"" message, saying it had less than an hour's supply remaining at two of its sites. The shortage was later resolved. Three other states -Gujarat, Uttar PradeshandHaryana- are also facing a critical shortage. The Indian Air Force is being used to lift oxygen tankers and supplies to different parts of the country. Crematoriums have resorted to mass funeral pyres as the number of bodies from Covid victims continues to rise A separation process takes air and splits it into various gases, including oxygen. The oxygen is then purified, super-cooled and stored as a liquid, which is less bulky than keeping it as a gas. The compressed oxygen is used to fill insulated tanks, which supply hospitals, or canisters for individual patients. A vaporiser is used to turn the oxygen back into a gas before it is delivered to patients. Hospitals are struggling to get enough oxygen for Covid patients Cases have surged during India's second wave, driven by a number of factors. Health protocols have been lax, with mask mandates sporadically enforced. Millions of people attended a Hindu festival, the Kumbh Mela, which culminated 10 days ago with a mass dip in the River Ganges. New strains of the virus have emerged, including a ""double mutant"" strain. Bollywood composer Shravan Rathod tested positive shortly after returning from the citywhere the Kumbh Mela was held and died not long after, his family confirmed. As well as the Indian double-mutant strain, the UK strain is the primary variant found in the state of Punjab, National Centre for Disease Control Director Sujeet Kumar Singh told local media. The UK strain is also particularly prevalent in Maharashtra and the city of Delhi, he added. Dr Saswati Sinha, a critical care specialist in the eastern city of Kolkata, said emergency rooms and wards were packed to capacity. ""We are getting direct calls from our patients, our acquaintances, our neighbours: they are pleading with us to be able to accommodate some of their next of kin. But unfortunately, our situation is such that, although we are trying our best, we still have a huge number of patients whom we are not able to accommodate,"" she told the BBC. ""In 20 years of working in intensive care, I have never seen anything of this kind, ever."" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met chief ministers of the most affected states and oxygen manufacturers on Friday. He asked states to work together to stop hoarding and black marketeering, saying that the government was also looking at diverting industrial oxygen to ease the crisis.

The shortage was later resolved. Three other states -Gujarat, Uttar PradeshandHaryana- are also facing a critical shortage. The Indian Air Force is being used to lift oxygen tankers and supplies to different parts of the country. Crematoriums have resorted to mass funeral pyres as the number of bodies from Covid victims continues to rise A separation process takes air and splits it into various gases, including oxygen. The oxygen is then purified, super-cooled and stored as a liquid, which is less bulky than keeping it as a gas. The compressed oxygen is used to fill insulated tanks, which supply hospitals, or canisters for individual patients. A vaporiser is used to turn the oxygen back into a gas before it is delivered to patients. Hospitals are struggling to get enough oxygen for Covid patients Cases have surged during India's second wave, driven by a number of factors. Health protocols have been lax, with mask mandates sporadically enforced. Millions of people attended a Hindu festival, the Kumbh Mela, which culminated 10 days ago with a mass dip in the River Ganges. New strains of the virus have emerged, including a ""double mutant"" strain. Bollywood composer Shravan Rathod tested positive shortly after returning from the citywhere the Kumbh Mela was held and died not long after, his family confirmed. As well as the Indian double-mutant strain, the UK strain is the primary variant found in the state of Punjab, National Centre for Disease Control Director Sujeet Kumar Singh told local media. The UK strain is also particularly prevalent in Maharashtra and the city of Delhi, he added. Dr Saswati Sinha, a critical care specialist in the eastern city of Kolkata, said emergency rooms and wards were packed to capacity. ""We are getting direct calls from our patients, our acquaintances, our neighbours: they are pleading with us to be able to accommodate some of their next of kin. But unfortunately, our situation is such that, although we are trying our best, we still have a huge number of patients whom we are not able to accommodate,"" she told the BBC. ""In 20 years of working in intensive care, I have never seen anything of this kind, ever."" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met chief ministers of the most affected states and oxygen manufacturers on Friday. He asked states to work together to stop hoarding and black marketeering, saying that the government was also looking at diverting industrial oxygen to ease the crisis.

More evidence of human-to-cat Covid infection,"The first case was a four-month-old Ragdoll kitten (stock photo) Scottish scientists have identified two cases where humans are thought to have passed Covid-19 to their cats. Researchers at the University of Glasgow said both cats developed the virus after their owners. They were of different breeds and lived in separate households. One displayed mild symptoms but the other had to be put down. Scientists now want to improve understanding of whether pets can play a role in infecting humans. The cases were found as part of a screening programme of the feline population in the UK. Researchers believe both pets were infected by their owners, who had Covid-19 symptoms before the cats became unwell. Coronavirus: Pets no risk to owners vets stress Coronavirus: Do I need to worry about my pet? Can my dog or cat catch coronavirus? The study, published in theVeterinary Record,external, said there is currently no evidence of cat-to-human transmission or that cats, dogs or other domestic animals play any appreciable role in the epidemiology of human Covid infections. But the scientists said domestic animals could potentially act as a ""viral reservoir"" allowing continued transmission, and said it was important to improve understanding of whether pets can play a role in infecting humans. Prof Margaret Hosie, from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research who was lead author of the study, said: ""These two cases of human-to-animal transmission, found in the feline population in the UK, demonstrate why it is important that we improve our understanding of animal Sars-CoV-2 infection. ""Currently, animal-to-human transmission represents a relatively low risk to public health in areas where human-to-human transmission remains high. ""However, as human cases decrease, the prospect of transmission among animals becomes increasingly important as a potential source of Sars-CoV-2 reintroduction to humans."" She added: ""It is therefore important to improve our understanding of whether exposed animals could play any role in transmission."" There have been reports of cats from Covid-positive households in countries including Hong Kong, Belgium, the USA, France and Spain Researchers at the centre worked in partnership with the Veterinary Diagnostic Service (VDS) at the university's School of Veterinary Medicine on the study. The first cat was a four-month-old female Ragdoll kitten from a household in which the owner developed symptoms that were consistent with Covid at the end of March 2020, although they were not tested. The kitten was taken to a vet with breathing difficulties in April 2020 but its condition deteriorated and it later had to be put down. Post-mortem lung samples revealed damage consistent with a viral pneumonia and there was evidence of Sars-CoV-2 infection. The second cat was a six-year-old female Siamese from a household where one owner tested positive for Covid-19. The cat was taken to the vet with nasal discharge and conjunctivitis, but its symptoms remained mild and the cat later recovered. Covid-19 infection was confirmed in a retrospective survey of swabs submitted to VDS between March and July 2020 for routine pathogen testing. Scientists believe the two cases are likely to be an underestimate of the true frequency of human-to-animal transmission, as animal testing is limited. The study was led from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research Since the pandemic began there have been reports of cats from Covid-positive households in countries including Hong Kong, Belgium, the USA, France and Spain that tested positive for the virus and were presumed to be infected from their owners. Prof James Wood, head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Cambridge University said: ""These are important and interesting findings, adding to the body of evidence that humans can infect their pets, in some cases, as here, leading to clinical disease in the animals. ""Cats and dogs have been reported to be infected. This is a high quality study, including whole genome sequencing to confirm transmission links."" The study was funded by the Wellcome ISSF Covid Response Fund and supported by the Medical Research Council. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

India on UK travel red list amid deadly Covid wave,"India has joined the UK's travel red list - effectively banning travel - as a deadly second wave of infections sweeps the country. British and Irish nationals can travel to the UK from India, but they must now isolate in a government-approved hotel. India has seen soaring infection rates, a rapidly rising death toll and the discovery of a new virus variant. The spike hasoverwhelmed hospitals, creating a critical shortage of oxygen, intensive care beds and ventilators. What are the travel quarantine rules? Why was India not already on the red list? Why India is running out of oxygen again On Friday, India recorded 332,730 coronavirus cases, the highest one-day tally anywhere in the world for the second day in a row. Daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by a record 2,263 in the previous 24 hours. At least two hospitals in the Indian capital Delhi arerunning out of oxygen, and at least 13 patients have died aftera fire broke out in the intensive care unitof a hospital set up to treat Covid patients near Mumbai. The rising number of cases has resulted in a deepening healthcare crisis that has gripped several states, and India's top court has asked the central government for a national plan by Friday on bolstering supply, oxygen, medicine, treatment and vaccines. Nayan Gangyan is facing a 10-day hotel quarantine when he flies back to London from northern India on Saturday. He travelled to Chandigarh a few weeks ago, when his parents both contracted coronavirus. He told BBC Breakfast he was left feeling ""helpless"" in the UK when his father's oxygen levels dropped, there were no beds available in hospital and his mother started to panic. ""It was at that point that I decided 'my family needs help and I need to go back come what may',"" he says. He says the situation in India is ""really bad"", with the government healthcare system ""completely overrun"". But they eventually managed to get his father admitted to a hospital where he had previously undergone a liver transplant, and he is doing ""much better now"". Now Nayan is preparing to return home to London. ""The flight as of now, it's running. I really hope that it does take off,"" he says. ""I've already booked my quarantine hotel so I'll be going straight there. I'll be landing [then] straight to the hotel and 10 days in the room."" His wife Vani, who has been watching from a distance from their London home, says it has been difficult ""not to be able to control or influence"" events. On India's red list status, she says: ""We got just over three days' notice so very little time for us to actually affect the outcome or do anything. ""We're just in the position where we have to be okay. After Nayan's ordeal in India he has to go through another ordeal."" Tina Patel and her husband arrived back in the UK on Thursday from Pune, Maharashtra, after travelling to India in March to visit her father-in-law, who was ill due to old age and later died. She told the BBC people in the city were ""desperate"" - trying to find hospital beds or a slot in the crematoriums. ""We left a city with ambulances wailing away day and night,"" she said. ""I left broken-hearted as there was nothing we could do but catch the BA flight last night and all we could do was to be thankful that we finally got home."" Friday's travel rule change means direct flights from India are still permitted, but UK and Irish nationals, as well as those with residency rights, must isolate in government-approved hotels - at their own cost - for 10 days. Travel to the UK is banned for all others who have been in red-list countries in the past 10 days. There are 40 countries on thegovernment's red list,externalacross the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice. There are specific rules for people arriving in each UK nation, includingEngland,external,Scotland,external,Northern Ireland,externalandWales,external. 'It feels like we're back to square one in India' What is the India Covid variant? Public Health England (PHE) confirmed on Thursday thata further 55 cases,externalof the virus variant first identified in India - known as B.1.617 - were found in the UK in the latest week to 14 April. PHE experts are currently unsure whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity. The final scheduled commercial flight ahead of the rule change - Vistara flight VTI017 - landed at London's Heathrow Airport at 18:48 on Thursday, according to FlightRadar24. Four airlines asked for a total of eight extra flights to arrive at the west London airport before the 04:00 deadlinebut were refused permission by airport authorities. Heathrow bosses are believed to have declined the requests to ensure pressures at the border, reported in recent weeks, were not exacerbated. Later scheduled arrivals from Delhi and Mumbai to Heathrow, and Delhi to Gatwick Airport, were cancelled on Thursday, airport data showed. This video can not be played Travellers returning from India: ""Oh my goodness, feeling so relieved"" Some of those who arrived before the red list change told the BBC they""couldn't afford to stay away"" and ""had to get back to work"". ""Eventually, yesterday, a friend in the UK managed to book me a ticket from Mumbai to Manchester,"" Biju Mathew, a social services manager from Walsall, said. Demand for flights from India to the UK quickly became overwhelming after the government's red list announcement, according to Suresh Kumar, chairman of specialist travel agents Indra Travel. ""A lot of people were hoping that the [UK] government would have made arrangements for people trying to get back,"" he said. ""They were disappointed."" This video can not be played Scenes outside a hospital in Delhi, where people are dying without getting the treatment they need Speaking on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who cancelled an official visit to India due to take place next Monday - said the addition to the red list was a ""purely precautionary"" step over a new coronavirus variant. He said: ""What we're seeing in India is a result of a variant under investigation, it hasn't yet been deemed a variant of concern - I think that was why there has been the delay."" The B.1.617 variant was first noted internationally in October and first identified in the UK on 22 February. Have you been affected by the issues in this story?

Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted?,"A law quashing the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters was introduced in May. Many were wrongly prosecuted after faulty software said money was missing from their Post Office branch accounts. More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted for stealing because of incorrect information from the Horizon computer system. It has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice. The Post Office itself took many cases to court, prosecuting 700 people between 1999 and 2015. Another 283 cases were brought by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Many sub-postmasters went to prison for false accounting and theft, and many were financially ruined. In 2017, a group of 555 sub-postmasters took legal action against the Post Office. In 2019,it agreed to pay them Â£58m in compensation,but much of the money went on legal fees. The Metropolitan Policeis investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences. Secret papers show Post Office knew case was false Although campaigners won the right for their cases to be reconsidered,only 102 convictions had been overturned,externalby March 2024. Legislation toclear victims' names and pay them compensationbecame law in May. It applies to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Convictions will be automatically quashed if they were: prosecuted by the Post Office or CPS for offences carried out in connection with Post Office business between 1996 and 2018 for relevant offences such as theft, fraud and false accounting against sub-postmasters, their employees, officers, family members or direct employees of the Post Office working in a Post Office that used the Horizon system software It is expected that most victims will have been cleared by the end of July. The Scottish parliamentalso passed its own bill,external. Joy and disbelief as Post Office convictions quashed How the Post Office scandal has affected Scotland In July, the new Labour government publisheddetails of a new compensation scheme,externalcalled the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS). Two compensation routes will be available, with one route offering Â£600,000 as a final settlement and another route for sub-postmasters who think they are owed more. All of those who qualify for compensation will be given an immediate Â£200,000 payout. Those whose wrongful convictions were quashed before the May legislation will not need to move to the new scheme and are entitled to the same compensation. Former Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake previously said the Conservative government had budgeted Â£1bn for compensation. More than 4,000 people were told they were eligible, under three schemes: The Group Litigation Order (GLO) Schemefor the 555 former postmasters (excluding those who had criminal convictions) who won their group lawsuit, but received relatively small payouts after legal costs. They will now be offered Â£75,000, but many are expected to push for more The Overturned Convictions Schemeoffers those eligible a fast-tracked Â£600,000 settlement, or the chance to negotiate a higher payment. The Horizon Shortfall Schemeis for sub-postmasters who were not convicted, or part of the GLO court action, but who believe they experienced shortfalls because of Horizon. This group will be offered a fixed payment of Â£75,000 Prof Chris Hodges, chair of the the independent Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, told the BBC that some individual compensation claims were ""well over Â£1m"". How do the Post Office compensation schemes work? Many former sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses say the scandal ruined their lives. Some used their own money to cover non-existent shortfalls because their contracts said they were responsible for unexplained losses. Many faced bankruptcy or lost their livelihoods. Marriages broke down, and some families believe the stress led to serious health conditions, addiction and even premature death. This video can not be played Victims of the Post Office scandal tell their own stories of how they were accused of criminality. 'I'm terrified' - Post Office victim still fears seeing old customers âI thought mum left me, sheâd been sent to prison' Horizon was developed bythe Japanese company Fujitsu, for tasks such as accounting and stocktaking. It was introduced by the Post Office in 1999. Sub-postmasters quickly complained about bugs in the system after it falsely reported shortfalls - often for many thousands of pounds - but their concerns were dismissed. The Horizon system isstill used by the Post Office,,externalwhich describes the latest version as ""robust"". A public inquirybegan in February 2021,externaland has heard evidence from Post Office and Fujitsu employees. The fifth phase began on Tuesday 9 April, with campaigner Alan Bates the first to appear. He told the inquiry thatthe Post Office has spent 23 years trying to ""discredit and silence"" him. Paula Vennells, chief executive between 2012 and 2019, gave evidence in May and apologised to the sub-postmasters and their families""who have suffered as a result of all that the inquiry has been looking into for so long"". Who is Paula Vennells? Alan Bates says Post Office run by 'thugs in suits' Ms Vennells resigned in 2019 over the scandal. In January 2024,she said she would hand back her CBE. In August 2023, current chief executive Nick Readsaid he would return bonus money awarded for his work on the Horizon inquiry. Post Office threatened BBC over whistleblower Secret papers show Post Office knew case was false Fujitsu Europe director Paul Patterson said the firmhad a ""moral obligation"" to help fund compensation payments. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has been criticised for refusing to meet Mr Bates when he was postal affairs minister, in May 2010. He sayshe was ""deeply misled by Post Office executives"". The BBC discovered that former Prime Minister David Cameron's governmentknew the Post Office had dropped a secret investigation that might have helped postmasters prove their innocence. Separately, former Business Secretary Kemi Badenochdenied claims from former Post Office chairman Henry Stauntonthat he was told to delay compensation payments to allow the government to ""limp into the election"".

Desperation as Indian hospitals buckle under CovidFamilies of Covid patients are pleading for hospital care as emergency rooms and wards overflow.AsiaConvicted Post Office workers have names clearedJudges quash convictions of 39 former postmasters after the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.Business,"This video can not be played Inside a Delhi hospital running low on beds and oxygen India's healthcare system is buckling as a record surge in Covid-19 cases puts pressure on hospital beds and drains oxygen supplies. Families are left pleading for their relatives who are desperately ill, with some patients left untreated for hours. Crematoriums are organising mass funeral pyres. On Friday India reported 332,730 new cases of coronavirus, setting a world record for a second day running. Deaths were numbered at 2,263 in 24 hours. Dr Atul Gogia, a consultant at the Sir Ganga Ram hospital in Delhi, told the BBC there had been a ""huge surge"" in patients, leaving no space in the emergency room. ""We do not have that many oxygen points. Whatever oxygen points are there, they're full. Patients are coming in with their own oxygen cylinders or without oxygen. We want to help them but there are not enough beds and not enough oxygen points even to supply them oxygen if it is there,"" he said. ""All our telephone lines are jammed. People are continuously calling the helpline. There is a big rush outside the hospital: there are ambulances parked, patients wanting to get deboarded, but the problem is, there is no space. ""We try to mobilise, we try to discharge patients who become stable as early as possible so that we can increase the turnaround, but things are difficult right now."" Have India's rallies help spread coronavirus? Why India is running out of oxygen again Every morning, for the past few days, I have been waking up to my phone buzzing with desperate messages for help. People are seeking hospital beds, life-saving drugs, oxygen and plasma for their infected and sick friends and relatives. Often, after a period of silence, the same people announce the deaths of their ""patients"". My Twitter timeline is India's Covid-19 war-room, as the state appears to have largely withered away. Every essential to save a life is in short supply or available on the black market. Then there's the fear of the virus literally ""at your door"". Over the past week, three buildings in the gated complex where I live have become ""containment zones"", with entire skyscrapers sealed because of too many infections. The days and nights are filled with helplessness, anxiety and fear. The bad news is unrelenting. The Supreme Court of India has called this a ""national emergency"". This is beyond an emergency. It is a ""complete collapse of the goddamn system"", as one of India's leading virologists says. In hotspots like Delhi and Mumbai, life, itself, is now a privilege. Maharashtra, the worst-hit state in India, faces an oxygen shortfall. In the state capital, Mumbai,at least 13 patients died after a fire broke out in an intensive care unitof a hospital treating Covid patients. Two days earlier, 24 Covid patients died in another part of the state after a leak interrupted the flow of oxygen to their ventilators.

They were convicted of stealing money, with some imprisoned, after the Post Office installed the Horizon computer system in branches. The system was flawed. Some of those whose lives were ruined now want those responsible to be ""punished"". The judgement was met with cheers from ex-postmasters outside court and was hailed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He called the original convictions an ""appalling injustice"". Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Man's life 'destroyed' by Post Office conviction 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' The clearing of the names of 39 peoplefollows the overturning of six other convictionsin December, This means more people have been affected than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK. Among them was Janet Skinner, who ran a post office in Hull. She was imprisoned in 2007 for nine months over a shortfall of Â£59,000 - a case which she said ""destroyed everything"". Like others, she said she had no idea fellow sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were being prosecuted and convicted. Former post office worker Janet Skinner (centre) outside the Royal Courts of Justice She was taken away from her two children to go to prison and - after her release - had a job offer taken away owing to her criminal conviction. Outside court, she said she was ""relieved"" at the judgement. Speaking after his name was cleared, Harjinder Butoy, who was convicted of theft and jailed for three years and four months in 2008, described the Post Office as ""a disgrace"". He said those responsible for the scandal ""need to be punished, seriously punished"", adding: ""They're just bullies, that's all they are. Somebody needs to really, really sort this out and charge them for this."" Hughie ""Noel"" Thomas, also cleared, said it had been 16 years to fight for justice. ""All I want is my money back. People have walked away from this who were responsible. I'd like to sit down with them and ask them the question 'why?',"" he said. Harjinder Butoy (left) hugs his father outside court Neil Hudgell, who represented 29 of the former sub-postmasters, said the Post Office ""has been found to have been an organisation that not only turned a blind eye to the failings in its hugely expensive IT system, but positively promoted a culture of cover-up and subterfuge in the pursuit of reputation and profit"". ""They readily accepted that loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary people as a price worth paying in that pursuit,"" he said. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells - at the the helm from 2012 to 2019 - said she supported a government inquiry. ""I was deeply saddened by the sub-postmasters' accounts heard during the Court of Appeal proceedings. I am truly sorry for the suffering caused to them as a result of the convictions which the Court of Appeal has today overturned. ""I fully support and am committed to co-operating with the ongoing Government Inquiry, as I did with last year's Select Committee Inquiry.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further while the Inquiry is ongoing."" Those affected have long called for a judge-led, full, public inquiry, rather than the government's own inquiry which is set to report in the summer. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, is reviewing another 22 cases. There were more than 700 prosecutions based on Horizon evidence. The commission and the Post Office are asking anyone else who believes their conviction to be unsafe to come forward. This video can not be played ""How do you die knowing that you've done nothing wrong?"" At the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Lord Justice Holroyde said the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"" the system's defects. But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"" and ""effectively steamrolled over any sub-postmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"", the judge added. The Court of Appeal also allowed the appeals on the basis that their prosecutions were an affront to justice - a decision that allows for the possibility of further claims for compensation against the Post Office.

Those whose convictions have been quashed are Josephine Hamilton, Hughie Noel Thomas, Allison Henderson, Alison Hall, Gail Ward, Julian Wilson, Jacqueline McDonald, Tracy Felstead, Janet Skinner, Scott Darlington, Seema Misra, Della Robinson, Khayyam Ishaq, David Thomas Hedges, Peter Anthony Holmes, Rubina Shaheen, Damien Owen, Mohammed Rasul, Wendy Buffrey, Kashmir Gill, Barry Capon, Vijay Parekh, Lynette Hutchings, Dawn O'Connell, Carl Page, Lisa Brennan, William Graham, Siobhan Sayer, Pauline Thomson, Tim Burgess, Nicholas Clark, Margery Williams, Tahir Mahmood, Ian Warren, David Yates, Harjinder Butoy, Gillian Howard, David Blakey and Pamela Lock. Following the convictions - including theft, fraud and false accounting - some of these former postmasters went to prison, were shunned by their communities and struggled to secure work. Some lost their homes and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions. Three have since died. They always said the fault was in the computer system, which had been used to manage post offices' finances since 1999. Investigative journalist Nick Wallis hasfollowed this saga for years,external, reporting on the case for BBC Panorama and Radio 4. ""Just over 10 years ago, I spoke on the phone to a man who was crying his eyes out,"" he said. ""His pregnant wife, Seema Misra - the sub-postmaster at West Byfleet Post Office in Surrey - had been sent to prison for theft. He swore she was an innocent victim of the Post Office's computer system, Horizon. ""After meeting dozens of sub-postmasters over the past decade, I have been struck by the dignity and quiet anger they convey in interviews and conversation - emotions never stray far from the surface. ""There will be some jubilation at the quashing of so many convictions today, but the trauma, the loss of reputation and the years of financial hardship for the dozens of people who were prosecuted by the Post Office will never leave them."" This video can not be played Noel Thomas was jailed for nine  months in 2006 for false accounting Post Office chief executive Nick Read said: ""I am in no doubt about the human cost of the Post Office's past failures and the deep pain that has been caused to people affected. ""Many of those postmasters involved have been fighting for justice for a considerable length of time and sadly there are some who are not here to see the outcome today and whose families have taken forward appeals in their memory. I am very moved by their courage. ""The quashing of historical convictions is a vital milestone in fully and properly addressing the past as I work to put right these wrongs as swiftly as possible and there must be compensation that reflects what has happened."" In three additional cases - those of Stanley Fell, Wendy Cousins and Neelam Hussain - the judges ruled the convictions were not based on Horizon evidence, so their appeals against conviction failed. The Horizon system is designed to record the transactions carried out in a post office branch The Horizon system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. But from an early stage, it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. Horizon-based evidence was used by the Post Office to successfully prosecute 736 people. But campaigners fought a long and hard series of legal battles for compensation in the civil courts, which have been followed by referrals by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

Starmer: PM can't distance himself from sleaze,"This video can not be played The PM queries those who say there's something ""dodgy or rum or weird or sleazy"" about securing more ventilators in a pandemic. Boris Johnson has said anyone who thinks there was something ""dodgy or rum"" in his dealings with Sir James Dyson is ""out of their mind"". The PM was responding to claims by Labour that he was personally involved in ""sleaze"" after texts between the two were revealed by the BBC. Downing Street declined to comment on ""speculation"" Mr Johnson's former aide Dominic Cummings had leaked the texts. The government has launched an internal inquiry into who was responsible. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""We don't get into detail of processes in terms of these inquiries, but the Cabinet Office is taking that work forward."" The BBC said it did not discuss the sources of stories. Cameron: Nonsense to say Greensill was desperate Labour urges probe into revamp of PM's official flat Why ministers have two mobile phones What is lobbying? A brief guide Mr Johnson was speaking on a visit to Derbyshire as allegations of cronyism abound at Westminster. This video can not be played Labour leader claims ""sleaze is back"" after allegations over lobbying of the PM and a former PM. On Tuesdaythe BBC published text messagesbetween Mr Johnson and Sir James, in which the prime minister agreed to ""fix"" concerns the businessman had over his employees' tax bills if they moved to the UK to make ventilators at the start of the pandemic. Asked whether this proved Labour's allegation that friends of the Conservatives were given privileged access, the prime minister said it was ""completely the right thing to do"" to ask manufacturers to help bolster supplies of equipment needed to treat Covid patients. ""To think that there's anything remotely dodgy or rum or weird or sleazy about trying to secure more ventilators at the time of a national pandemic and doing everything in your power to do that, I think you're out of your mind,"" he added. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was on a visit to Hartlepool, said it was ""increasingly obvious"" the prime minister was involved in ""sleaze"". Asked if media reports pointing to Mr Cummings as the source of leaks were part of an attempt to distract from lobbying allegations, Sir Keir said: ""Boris Johnson is desperate to try to keep this at arm's length but it's obvious that he can't. This is government by WhatsApp. ""They are all at it - whether it's access to the prime minister, whether it's the former prime minister accessing ministers and officials, whether it's the health secretary with shares in companies with the contracts with the NHS. The list just grows and grows... ""Sleaze is back and it's bigger than it was before."" Shadow Treasury minister Bridget Phillipson tweeted: ""Dominic Cummings is a distraction. Follow the money, not the soap opera."" Mr Cummings has not accepted invitations to respond to the reports and, so far, no evidence of his involvement in the leaks has been produced. Labour has called for an urgent investigation into the prime minister's conduct by the Liaison Committee of senior MPs. It said the text messages showed Mr Johnson had offered a ""tax break"" to a ""chum"". The head of the committee, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, turned down the call for an inquiry, saying three other parliamentary committees were already looking at the issues. He told Radio 4's Today programme ministers should not be ""locked away in ivory towers"" with people unable to contact them and should be able to carry out conversations about policy in private, as this would ""stifle proper conversation"". ""What's got to come out of this is obviously a system of managing conflicts of interest, which commands more public confidence, and is more rigorous, but also a balance,"" he added. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has written to the Cabinet Secretary, calling for officials to ""secure and publish"" all Mr Johnson's private correspondence on coronavirus contracts, and not just his texts with Sir James Dyson. He said ""such a narrow and limited internal investigation totally and utterly fails to address the scale of the scandal"".

Solicitor Neil Hudgell said: ""They are honest, hard-working people who served their communities but have had to live with the stigma of being branded criminals for many years, all the while knowing they have been innocent. ""Indeed, given its actions, everything the Post Office has sought to do over the last year or so, whether it be by way of apology and offers of redress, or by talking about a cultural change, completely unravelled when our clients' cases where heard.""

Earlier today, she told BBC Radio Humberside about the moment the judge told her that she would be going to prison. âI actually thought he meant, he was going to give me a suspended sentence or something and that was it,"" she said. ""Then they locked the door and then I knew that I wasnât coming out."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter It is impossible to overstate
the impact this judgement is likely to have on the Post Office. Its chief executive Nick Read has
apologised and paid tribute to the sub-postmasters whose convictions have been
overturned. But, the ruling does open the
road for dozens of people to seek damages against the Post Office for malicious
prosecution. On top of making good on the
historical shortfalls, this could leave the Post Office with a huge bill. One
which it could well need financial support from the government to pay. Earlier on Friday, former sub-postmaster Noel Thomas shared the pain and devastation that his conviction for stealing from the Post Office has caused him and his family - see our report at 9:51am. He is pictured here after the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction. He and his 38 colleagues who also saw their convictions overturned will be feeling fully vindicated today after a long fight. The Court of Appeal said that the Post Office prevented the postmasters from having a fair trial. It said the Post Office's failure to investigate or disclose data from the unreliable Horizon IT system prevented those postmasters, of which the court found 39 were wrongly convicted, from challenging those convictions. ""In short, [Post Office] as prosecutor brought serious criminal charges against the subpostmasters on the basis of Horizon data."" ""By its failures to discharge its clear duties it prevented them from having a fair trial on the issue of whether that data was reliable."" The convictions of 39 Post Office branch managers have been overturned, but for one family it is too little, too late. Tim Parker, chairman of the Post Office, said: ""The Post
Office is extremely sorry for the impact on the lives of these postmasters and
their families that was caused by historical failures."" The Post Office today sincerely apologises for serious failures in its historical conduct of prosecutions of postmasters, resulting in the Court of Appeal formally overturning convictions - that occurred between 2003 to 2013 - in uncontested appeals. The Court quashed 39 convictions, referred by the Criminal Cases Review Commission last year.  The Post Office announced at the earliest opportunity, in October 2020, that it would not oppose the overwhelming majority of these appeals.  The Court upheld the safety of convictions in three cases. The Post Office Lord Justice Holroyde said at the Court of Appeal ruling today that the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"" the system's defects. But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"", and ""effectively steamrolled over any subpostmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"". Prior to today's judgement, the Post Office said: ""We sincerely apologise to the postmasters affected by our historical failures. Throughout this appeals process we have supported the quashing of the
overwhelming majority of these convictions and the judgement will be an important milestone in addressing the past.â Three of the 42 sub-postmasters hoping to have their names cleared today will be disappointed. The judges decided that the cases brought against Neelam Hussain, Stanley Fell and Wendy Cousins did not depend on data from the flawed Horizon IT system. Therefore it said their convictions were safe. The Court of Appeal has quashed the convictions of 39 former Post Office workers who were found guilty of stealing money from the company, according to the Press Association. The former sub-postmasters and postmisstresses had been convicted of theft, fraud and false accounting because of the Post Office's defective Horizon accounting system. Jo Hamilton is one of those awaiting the decision by the Court of Appeal. She was accused by the Post Office of taking Â£36,000 from the village branch she ran in Hampshire. Ms Hamilton had to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. Declaring the criminal record also affected everyday life, such as failing to get car insurance. ""I think this is the biggest miscarriage of justice,"" she told PA. ""I was 45 when this started. It's taken up nearly a third of my life. You think it's never going to end."" ""I was given a 12-month supervision order and have a criminal record,"" she said.
""But I did nothing wrong. I told them about the problem but they said I was the only one."" Nick Wallis has been reporting on the Post Office scandal for over a decade. Allow Twitter content?

The Court upheld the safety of convictions in three cases. The Post Office Lord Justice Holroyde said at the Court of Appeal ruling today that the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"" the system's defects. But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"", and ""effectively steamrolled over any subpostmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"". Prior to today's judgement, the Post Office said: ""We sincerely apologise to the postmasters affected by our historical failures. Throughout this appeals process we have supported the quashing of the
overwhelming majority of these convictions and the judgement will be an important milestone in addressing the past.â Three of the 42 sub-postmasters hoping to have their names cleared today will be disappointed. The judges decided that the cases brought against Neelam Hussain, Stanley Fell and Wendy Cousins did not depend on data from the flawed Horizon IT system. Therefore it said their convictions were safe. The Court of Appeal has quashed the convictions of 39 former Post Office workers who were found guilty of stealing money from the company, according to the Press Association. The former sub-postmasters and postmisstresses had been convicted of theft, fraud and false accounting because of the Post Office's defective Horizon accounting system. Jo Hamilton is one of those awaiting the decision by the Court of Appeal. She was accused by the Post Office of taking Â£36,000 from the village branch she ran in Hampshire. Ms Hamilton had to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. Declaring the criminal record also affected everyday life, such as failing to get car insurance. ""I think this is the biggest miscarriage of justice,"" she told PA. ""I was 45 when this started. It's taken up nearly a third of my life. You think it's never going to end."" ""I was given a 12-month supervision order and have a criminal record,"" she said.
""But I did nothing wrong. I told them about the problem but they said I was the only one."" Nick Wallis has been reporting on the Post Office scandal for over a decade. Allow Twitter content?

The judgement is met with cheers from former postmasters outside the court In December 2019, the Post Office agreed to pay almost Â£58m to settle the dispute with more than 500 sub-postmasters Dearbail Jordan and Dan Ascher Former Post Office workers are celebrating today after 39 people had their criminal convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal in London. And that's where we'll leave our live coverage for now. You canread the full story herewhich is being updated throughout the day. We welcome the landmark decision by the Court of Appeal today to overturn these convictions, which marks another important milestone for postmasters affected by the Horizon dispute.  The Post Office has rightly apologised for its historical failings and is taking determined action to right the wrongs of the past, and we continue to monitor this work very closely.â Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy Former Post Office worker Tom Hedges, who was convicted of theft and false accounting and given a seven-month suspended sentence in 2011, opened a bottle of prosecco outside the Royal Courts of Justice after his conviction was quashed. ""It's a wonderful afternoon,"" he told the Press Association. ""When I told my mother, who's 93, I was coming to court she said 'get yourself down to Aldi and get some prosecco'."" ""She said 'just remember your name is Hedges not Rothschild, so get prosecco, not Bollinger!""' Neil Hudgell, the solicitor for 29 of the postmasters has accused the Post Office of a coverup. ""Ultimately, it has been found to have been an organisation that not only turned a blind eye to the failings in its hugely expensive IT system, but positively promoted a culture of cover-up and subterfuge in the pursuit of reputation and profit, "" he said. ""They readily accepted that loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary people as a price worth paying in that pursuit."" Allow Twitter content?

The solicitor who represented 29 of the postmasters has said it is ""almost impossible to describe the true impact"" that the scandal has had on the lives of those who had their reputations and livlihoods ""so unfairly destroyed"". Solicitor Neil Hudgell said: ""They are honest, hard-working people who served their communities but have had to live with the stigma of being branded criminals for many years, all the while knowing they have been innocent. ""Indeed, given its actions, everything the Post Office has sought to do over the last year or so, whether it be by way of apology and offers of redress, or by talking about a cultural change, completely unravelled when our clients' cases where heard."" He added: ""The Post Office failed to offer any sort of explanation as to why wholesale disclosure of evidence was withheld in cases, nor why a proper investigation was not carried out when known problems in the Horizon system started to appear."" ""This is a huge victory in the fight for justice for the subpostmasters affected by this appalling decades-long scandal, in the face of inaction from government,"" said Ed Miliband, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary. ""But there are so many other names to clear. For some who lost their homes and their reputations, it's too late. He said Labour was pushing for a ""proper Inquiry with teeth"" to get the bottom of how this scandal happened who was responsible. ""The government's inquiry risks being a whitewash,"" he said. Helen Pitcher, the chairwoman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which asked the Court of Appeal to review the convictions, said: ""This has been a serious miscarriage of justice which has had a devastating impact on these victims and their families."" ""Every single one of these convictions has clearly had a profound and life-changing impact for those involved,"" she said in a statement. ""The Post Office has rightly acknowledged the failures that led to these cases and conceded that the prosecutions were an abuse of process."" ""We sincerely hope that lessons will be learned from this to prevent anything similar happening elsewhere in the future."" There were emotional scenes outside the Court of Appeal after the judgement was handed down. Former post office worker Janet Skinner - who was imprisoned in 2007 for nine months over a shortfall of Â£59,000 at her Post Office in Hull - broke down in tears when she emerged from the court. Ms Skinner said she was ""relieved"" to have finally cleared her name. Earlier today, she told BBC Radio Humberside about the moment the judge told her that she would be going to prison. âI actually thought he meant, he was going to give me a suspended sentence or something and that was it,"" she said. ""Then they locked the door and then I knew that I wasnât coming out."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter It is impossible to overstate
the impact this judgement is likely to have on the Post Office. Its chief executive Nick Read has
apologised and paid tribute to the sub-postmasters whose convictions have been
overturned. But, the ruling does open the
road for dozens of people to seek damages against the Post Office for malicious
prosecution. On top of making good on the
historical shortfalls, this could leave the Post Office with a huge bill. One
which it could well need financial support from the government to pay. Earlier on Friday, former sub-postmaster Noel Thomas shared the pain and devastation that his conviction for stealing from the Post Office has caused him and his family - see our report at 9:51am. He is pictured here after the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction. He and his 38 colleagues who also saw their convictions overturned will be feeling fully vindicated today after a long fight. The Court of Appeal said that the Post Office prevented the postmasters from having a fair trial. It said the Post Office's failure to investigate or disclose data from the unreliable Horizon IT system prevented those postmasters, of which the court found 39 were wrongly convicted, from challenging those convictions. ""In short, [Post Office] as prosecutor brought serious criminal charges against the subpostmasters on the basis of Horizon data."" ""By its failures to discharge its clear duties it prevented them from having a fair trial on the issue of whether that data was reliable."" The convictions of 39 Post Office branch managers have been overturned, but for one family it is too little, too late. Tim Parker, chairman of the Post Office, said: ""The Post
Office is extremely sorry for the impact on the lives of these postmasters and
their families that was caused by historical failures."" The Post Office today sincerely apologises for serious failures in its historical conduct of prosecutions of postmasters, resulting in the Court of Appeal formally overturning convictions - that occurred between 2003 to 2013 - in uncontested appeals. The Court quashed 39 convictions, referred by the Criminal Cases Review Commission last year.  The Post Office announced at the earliest opportunity, in October 2020, that it would not oppose the overwhelming majority of these appeals.  The Court upheld the safety of convictions in three cases.

"Don't lock ministers in ivory towers, says top Tory","This video can not be played The PM queries those who say there's something ""dodgy or rum or weird or sleazy"" about securing more ventilators in a pandemic. Boris Johnson has said anyone who thinks there was something ""dodgy or rum"" in his dealings with Sir James Dyson is ""out of their mind"". The PM was responding to claims by Labour that he was personally involved in ""sleaze"" after texts between the two were revealed by the BBC. Downing Street declined to comment on ""speculation"" Mr Johnson's former aide Dominic Cummings had leaked the texts. The government has launched an internal inquiry into who was responsible. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""We don't get into detail of processes in terms of these inquiries, but the Cabinet Office is taking that work forward."" The BBC said it did not discuss the sources of stories. Cameron: Nonsense to say Greensill was desperate Labour urges probe into revamp of PM's official flat Why ministers have two mobile phones What is lobbying? A brief guide Mr Johnson was speaking on a visit to Derbyshire as allegations of cronyism abound at Westminster. This video can not be played Labour leader claims ""sleaze is back"" after allegations over lobbying of the PM and a former PM. On Tuesdaythe BBC published text messagesbetween Mr Johnson and Sir James, in which the prime minister agreed to ""fix"" concerns the businessman had over his employees' tax bills if they moved to the UK to make ventilators at the start of the pandemic. Asked whether this proved Labour's allegation that friends of the Conservatives were given privileged access, the prime minister said it was ""completely the right thing to do"" to ask manufacturers to help bolster supplies of equipment needed to treat Covid patients. ""To think that there's anything remotely dodgy or rum or weird or sleazy about trying to secure more ventilators at the time of a national pandemic and doing everything in your power to do that, I think you're out of your mind,"" he added. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was on a visit to Hartlepool, said it was ""increasingly obvious"" the prime minister was involved in ""sleaze"". Asked if media reports pointing to Mr Cummings as the source of leaks were part of an attempt to distract from lobbying allegations, Sir Keir said: ""Boris Johnson is desperate to try to keep this at arm's length but it's obvious that he can't. This is government by WhatsApp. ""They are all at it - whether it's access to the prime minister, whether it's the former prime minister accessing ministers and officials, whether it's the health secretary with shares in companies with the contracts with the NHS. The list just grows and grows... ""Sleaze is back and it's bigger than it was before."" Shadow Treasury minister Bridget Phillipson tweeted: ""Dominic Cummings is a distraction. Follow the money, not the soap opera."" Mr Cummings has not accepted invitations to respond to the reports and, so far, no evidence of his involvement in the leaks has been produced. Labour has called for an urgent investigation into the prime minister's conduct by the Liaison Committee of senior MPs. It said the text messages showed Mr Johnson had offered a ""tax break"" to a ""chum"". The head of the committee, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, turned down the call for an inquiry, saying three other parliamentary committees were already looking at the issues. He told Radio 4's Today programme ministers should not be ""locked away in ivory towers"" with people unable to contact them and should be able to carry out conversations about policy in private, as this would ""stifle proper conversation"". ""What's got to come out of this is obviously a system of managing conflicts of interest, which commands more public confidence, and is more rigorous, but also a balance,"" he added. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has written to the Cabinet Secretary, calling for officials to ""secure and publish"" all Mr Johnson's private correspondence on coronavirus contracts, and not just his texts with Sir James Dyson. He said ""such a narrow and limited internal investigation totally and utterly fails to address the scale of the scandal"".

More evidence of human-to-cat Covid infectionResearchers at Glasgow University identified two cases where they believe cats developed Covid-19 after their owners.Glasgow & West ScotlandComments,"The first case was a four-month-old Ragdoll kitten (stock photo) Scottish scientists have identified two cases where humans are thought to have passed Covid-19 to their cats. Researchers at the University of Glasgow said both cats developed the virus after their owners. They were of different breeds and lived in separate households. One displayed mild symptoms but the other had to be put down. Scientists now want to improve understanding of whether pets can play a role in infecting humans. The cases were found as part of a screening programme of the feline population in the UK. Researchers believe both pets were infected by their owners, who had Covid-19 symptoms before the cats became unwell. Coronavirus: Pets no risk to owners vets stress Coronavirus: Do I need to worry about my pet? Can my dog or cat catch coronavirus? The study, published in theVeterinary Record,external, said there is currently no evidence of cat-to-human transmission or that cats, dogs or other domestic animals play any appreciable role in the epidemiology of human Covid infections. But the scientists said domestic animals could potentially act as a ""viral reservoir"" allowing continued transmission, and said it was important to improve understanding of whether pets can play a role in infecting humans. Prof Margaret Hosie, from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research who was lead author of the study, said: ""These two cases of human-to-animal transmission, found in the feline population in the UK, demonstrate why it is important that we improve our understanding of animal Sars-CoV-2 infection. ""Currently, animal-to-human transmission represents a relatively low risk to public health in areas where human-to-human transmission remains high. ""However, as human cases decrease, the prospect of transmission among animals becomes increasingly important as a potential source of Sars-CoV-2 reintroduction to humans."" She added: ""It is therefore important to improve our understanding of whether exposed animals could play any role in transmission."" There have been reports of cats from Covid-positive households in countries including Hong Kong, Belgium, the USA, France and Spain Researchers at the centre worked in partnership with the Veterinary Diagnostic Service (VDS) at the university's School of Veterinary Medicine on the study. The first cat was a four-month-old female Ragdoll kitten from a household in which the owner developed symptoms that were consistent with Covid at the end of March 2020, although they were not tested. The kitten was taken to a vet with breathing difficulties in April 2020 but its condition deteriorated and it later had to be put down. Post-mortem lung samples revealed damage consistent with a viral pneumonia and there was evidence of Sars-CoV-2 infection. The second cat was a six-year-old female Siamese from a household where one owner tested positive for Covid-19. The cat was taken to the vet with nasal discharge and conjunctivitis, but its symptoms remained mild and the cat later recovered. Covid-19 infection was confirmed in a retrospective survey of swabs submitted to VDS between March and July 2020 for routine pathogen testing. Scientists believe the two cases are likely to be an underestimate of the true frequency of human-to-animal transmission, as animal testing is limited. The study was led from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research Since the pandemic began there have been reports of cats from Covid-positive households in countries including Hong Kong, Belgium, the USA, France and Spain that tested positive for the virus and were presumed to be infected from their owners. Prof James Wood, head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Cambridge University said: ""These are important and interesting findings, adding to the body of evidence that humans can infect their pets, in some cases, as here, leading to clinical disease in the animals. ""Cats and dogs have been reported to be infected. This is a high quality study, including whole genome sequencing to confirm transmission links."" The study was funded by the Wellcome ISSF Covid Response Fund and supported by the Medical Research Council. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"The Humpty Dance rapper Shock G dies, aged 57","The musician was known for his slick productions and comical alter-egos Shock G, the frontman of pioneering hip-hop group Digital Underground and co-producer of 2Pac's debut album, has died at the age of 57. Born Gregory Jacobs, he was known for his witty lyrics and comical alter-egos, but also played a crucial role in introducing 1970s funk to 90s hip-hop. His biggest hit was The Humpty Dance, a feel-good party anthem based on his goofy character, Humpty Hump. Chuck D, Snoop Dogg and Busta Rhymes have all paid tribute to the star. ""What a tough loss at such a precarious time,""wrote Public Enemy's Chuck D on Twitter,external. ""Brilliant beyond... such a beautiful free mind, Brother. #RestinBeats my man."" ""Rest, King, rest,"" added Busta Rhymeson Instagram.,external Snoop Dogg, whose early hits were inspired by Digital Underground, simply posted a photo of Humpty Hump's jewel-encrusted Groucho Marx glasses.

The news of Jacobs' death was confirmed by Chopmaster J, who co-founded Digital Underground with Shock G in 1987. He wrote:,external""34 years ago almost to the day we had a wild idea we can be a hip-hop band and take on the world. ""Through it all, the dream became a reality and the reality became a nightmare for some. And now he's awaken from the fame. Long live shock G Aka Humpty Hump and Rest In Peace my Brotha Greg Jacobs!!!"" Digital Underground's security manager, Nzazi Malonga, told the Associated Press that Jacobs, who had struggled with drug addiction, had been found unresponsive in a hotel room in Tampa, Florida. Digital Underground pictured in Berlin in 1989 The star's family later issued a statement saying the musician ""suddenly passed away"" on Thursday. ""The cause of death is currently unknown,"" they added. ""We truly, truly appreciate all the out-pouring of love and concern. Please keep us in your prayers at this very difficult time.""

Born in Brooklyn, New York, Jacobs dropped out of high school in the late 1970s and had a brief career as a radio DJ, before finishing his degree and going to college to study music. After relocating to San Francisco's Bay Area in the 1980s, he started working in a local music shop - which was where he met Chopmaster J and formed Digital Underground. Influenced by free-thinking musicians like George Clinton, Jimi Hendrix and Herbie Hancock, the band's approach was playful and experimental - making them something of an anomaly during the ascendance of groups like Public Enemy and NWA. ""Sometimes we'll combine any two, three or more styles and sometimes we'll stick to just one,"" Jacobs said in 1989. ""It depends on whoever is getting involved in the track. ""There's often plenty of different things happening in our songs, but that doesn't mean we're not into the idea of doing a simple rap over a basic beat. We like doing real straight stuff, real hardcore stuff too."" After several false starts, the band made waves with the independently-released Underwater Rimes - which became a surprise hit in the Netherlands and landed Digital Underground a deal with Tommy Boy Records, the iconic hip-hop label that was home to De La Soul, Afrika Bambaataa and Naughty By Nature. Their debut album, Sex Packets, was released in 1990 and quickly went platinum thanks to singles such as Doowutchyalike and The Humpty Dance. ""The Humpty Dance spoke to all the people that were like him,"" said Malonga. ""The fat people, the unattractive people. If you moved like him, you could be whatever you want."" The band's live shows pulsed with creative energy The song, which earned Digital Underground a Grammy nomination, was actually a last-minute addition to the album after another track, Underground System, was pulled over sample clearance issues. The Humpty Dance became an MTV staple thanks, in part, to the character of Humpty - voiced by Jacobs as a flamboyant, pimp-like character with a blubbery, stuttering voice. He was often played on stage by Kent Racker, leaving many fans unaware that Shock and Humpty were the same person. While the song marked the band's commercial peak, they remained a powerful force in hip-hop, releasing six albums before winding down in 2008. Their 1991 single Same Song boasts one of 2Pac's first appearances on a commercial recording. Jacobs had mentored the rapper at the start of his career, giving him work as a roadie while shopping his demo tape to record labels. Allow YouTube content?

He later produced and rapped on 2Pac's first top 10 single I Get Around, as well as 1995's So Many Tears - but he never took credit for the star's success. ""It's a lucky thing in the other direction,""he told Rolling Stone in 2017,external. ""Pac discovered us, man, we didn't discover his ass. No way."" Among his other credits, Jacob co-wrote LL Cool J's 1991 hit Mama Said Knock You Out, mixed Prince's single Love Sign, and appeared on a remix of Luniz's I Got 5 On It. He also toured and performed with George Clinton and P-Funk, including a set at Woodstock 1999. Shock G with George Clinton, whose music he introduced to a new audience in the 1990s ""Oh no, not Shock G,"" tweeted Parliament-Funkadelic bassist Bootsy Collins. ""He helped keep P Funk Alive! Prayers to family & friends. Dang."" And 2Pac's official page shared a 1995 quote from the rapper, which read: ""I look back [on my times with Shock G] with the greatest fondness. Those were like some of the best times of my life."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

We learnt that:  However First Minister Mark Drakeford has been accused by opposition parties of ""electioneering"" by announcing positive during a Senedd election campaign, including some proposed changes after polling day. We're planning to run our next live page on Thursday, covering the BBC Wales election leaders' debate to be shown on BBC One Wales at 2030 BST. Join us then for live coverage and reaction. This video can not be played Welsh elections 2021: Why does devolution matter to my vote? As some form of Covid restrictions remain in place, voters in Wales are going to the polls to elect members of the Senedd, or Welsh Parliament, on 6 May. Sixteen and 17-year-olds will able to vote for the first time. So what's at stake? Miriam Barker explains how the responsibilities are divided up between the Senedd in Cardiff Bay and the UK Parliament at Westminster. All political parties need to agree dates for the reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales as lockdown restrictions are eased, business leaders have warned. Some of the changes to lockdown measures come after the Senedd election on 6 May, so the decision will lie in the hands of whoever wins and will be running the Welsh government after that date. This includes the proposed reopening of pubs indoors on 17 May. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said a date after the election added ""even more uncertainty"" for business owners. Ben Francis, FSB Wales Policy Chair, said firms ""need to plan and make financial commitments safe in the knowledge that there is some agreement between the political parties on what will happen in May."" The staff at BrewDog Cardiff are readying themselves for a busy day on Monday. Pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales will be able to serve customers outside, with the prospect of indoor opening from 17 May. Allow Twitter content?

Barry Island was popular with visitors when the first lockdown was lifted last summer Wales is in for a ""better summer"" this year than in 2020, the first minister has forecast. Mark Drakeford was not talking about any potential for a heatwave, but about us being able to do more in our daily lives due to less tight lockdown measures. ""I remember saying some months ago, when I was being asked to look forward and my ambitions for dealing with coronavirus, I said what I hoped we will be able to do would be to lift restrictions earlier in the year than we were able to do last year, and for them to last longer over the summer,"" he said at today's press conference. ""Some of the things that I have announced today - indoor hospitality, the reopening of the whole of tourism accommodation and so on - we were doing that well into the summer last year, and we will be doing it in May, I hope, this year. ""So we are certainly further ahead than we were 12 months ago."" A commuter who lives near Cardiff took to Twitter to brag at the lovely meal he had at a beer garden in the Hereford area before coming home from work. Pubs in England have been allowed to serve customers outdoors for nearly two weeks now. Red Todd-Bennett from Llandough said it was ""too good an opportunity to turn down to have nice cold pint and a burger in the sun"". ""Monday seems like a lifetime away til the pubs open in Wales,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This video can not be played Some gym owners and members had held protests calling for an earlier opening date ahead of today's announcement From Monday, changes to coronavirus laws mean it will be legal to attend a protest in Wales. Mass gatherings are currently banned due to the coronavirus pandemic, and some protest organisers have said they have been fined. In a statement First Minister Mark Drakeford said changes to Covid laws mean that from 26 April, attending a protest will be added to the list of ""reasonable excuses"" for meeting others. This will only be allowed under alert levels one, two and three. Under the changes protests will have to be organised by ""a responsible body with appropriate mitigations, including
undertaking a risk assessment"". The
regulations are also being amended to permit all working in
other peoplesâ homes at alert levels one, two and three.  Rodney Berman of the Welsh Liberal Democrats welcomed the news of dates that gyms and pubs could reopen saying it was ""good for the fitness industry and good for the hospitality industryâ. He said the progress out of lockdown was partly due to âtaking it steadily"" and monitoring the effect of each change on infection rates, an approach heâd like to see continue. âItâs very easy to set dates well in advance but if you do that you might have to change them,"" Mr Berman said. âItâs better to have a âgeneral roadmapâ and check how things are going because the last thing we want to do is go into another lockdown."" Plaid Cymru has said that Wales must avoid a ""further lockdown at all costs"". Reacting to the Welsh government's plans to ease Covid restrictions on daily life, party leader Adam Price said Wales must learn from other countries who had kept case rates and death numbers low. ""We have to avoid further lockdown at all costs,"" he told BBC Wales. ""The way that we do that is fundamentally by investing in that test, trace, isolate and support system. ""That is the means by which many of those countries that invested in that type of approach avoided lockdowns, precisely because they were able to identify outbreaks earlier and maintain them at a low level through suppressing the virus very, very actively."" The Welsh Conservatives welcomed the possibility of pubs reopening indoors on 17 May, and some of the other measures. However party leader Andrew RT Davies said First Minister Mark Drakeford had criticised the Tory roadmap out of lockdown as ""reckless"" but was now bringing forward the dates. ""The first minister said it was rubbish and reckless, but now weâre in an election period the first minister thinks itâs a very sensible thing to do,"" Mr Davies said. âThereâs nothing like a sinner who repenteth.â The Tory leader also called on the Welsh government to provide more financial support for the hospitality sector. Wearing face masks to the shops and hairdressers has become a normal part of life during the pandemic. But with cases falling when we will be able to stop wearing them and staying two metres apart from everyone? First Minister Mark Drakeford was asked the question during the briefing today. He said that if case rates continued to improve, ""we may be able to mitigate some of the measures that we are all taking"" to reduce infection rates. ""But I think that the population in Wales, which has stuck so carefully to the rules and done so much to protect one another, they will want to go on playing their part, rather than thinking that we can act as though coronavirus has gone away,"" he said. Under the changes announced today many of us may already getting ready to see our mates in the pub. But what would the rules be when we can finally go for meals and drinks again? From tomorrow six people, from any six households, can meet outside, including outdoor licensed premises from Monday. This means you can go for a drink with six of your friends or family, but should maintain social distancing from people you do not live with. First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hoped Wales would move to Alert Level Two on 17 May, allowing pubs to reopen indoors. Under this alert level, the second lowest, meaning case rates are fairly low, four people will be allowed to meet indoors. This means four people, from any four households, will be able to meet inside for a meal or a drink, but only in regulated premises, like cafes and pubs.  Allowing more family members and friends to meet indoors should not be considered until âit is safe for that to take place,â according to Wales' first minister. On 3 May, two households will be able to form an extended household, meaning they will be âable to meet in each otherâs houses, stay overnightâ. Asked when such ""bubbles"" might be extended to include more than two households, Mark Drakeford said: âThe advice and the evidence has been clear now for a long time that meeting indoors is amongst the most risky things we do. âProvided that is going well then, of course, we will look to extend that so that further households can be added in to that arrangement so that more family members can meet in ways that we would once have taken for granted. âBut we wonât do it until we are sure that the public health evidence and that the context of the time means that it is safe for that to take place.â This video can not be played Large crowds have been gathering outdoors while pubs in Wales remain closed First Minister Mark Drakeford has rejected suggestions that
the date for indoor pub and restaurant service should be brought forward. After a five-and-a-half month Covid shut-down, outdoor
hospitality can restart on Monday, but serving drinks or food indoors is likely to remain banned until 17 May. There have been concerns that the three-week gap will lead
to large groups gathering outside pubs and elsewhere. Crowds were broken up by police after gathering inCardiff Bay to drink in the sunshine over the recent bank holiday weekend. But Mr Drakeford said he would stick to the policy of
gradual easing of Covid restrictions, including waiting to see if changes led
to more cases before moving on to the next stage. âWe will have another significant set of easements today and
on the 3rd of May,â he said. âWe then need to pause to makes
sure once again that that package of measures doesnât have unintended and adverse
consequences. âThat has always been the advice of our Chief Medical
Officer and our Chief Scientific Advisers in Wales.â With an election on 6 May, the proposed changes on 17 May would need to
be confirmed by the next Welsh Government, although the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru as the main opposition parties have both said they back the proposals. Wales' first minister said he has set out âa forward-lookâ of how Covid restrictions could continue to be lifted in the weeks ahead but âthese are choices for the next government to makeâ. It it less than two weeks until the Welsh Parliament election on 6 May. Mark Drakeford, the leader of Welsh Labour, said it was his âassessmentâ that the hospitality sector â bars, pubs, restaurants and cafes â will be able to open indoors from May 17, together with all other tourist accommodation, indoor entertainment and attractions. He said that âat the same timeâ he anticipated that âwe will also be able to increase the number of people who can attend organised activities, including wedding receptions, to 30 indoors and 50 outdoors, from the same dateâ. Mr Drakeford stressed that since that was after the election, such changes would be ""choices for the next government to makeâ. However, he added: âI want the many thousands of businesses in these sectors to have these dates today, so they have as much notice as possible to plan ahead and prepare."" After months exericising over Zoom and from our homes, gyms in Wales will reopen for the first time this year on Monday. There have been repeated calls from the sector to allow members back indoors, with some saying the continued closures were damaging for people's mental and physical wellbeing. First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced up to 15 people would be allowed to attend exercise classes together from Monday, after the date was moved forward. Community centres will also reopen on the same day. Mr Drakeford said this would mean that Wales will have moved to âalert level three by May 3â. âThis is faster than we had originally expected and reflects the progress we have made in controlling the virus and rolling out vaccination across Wales,"" he said. From Monday up to 30 people will be able to attend wedding receptions, funerals and wakes in Wales, as long as they are held outside. The changes were announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford at the coronavirus briefing. Mr Drakeford said outdoor attractions, including funfairs, theme parks and outdoor swimming pools, could also reopen on Monday. On care home visits, he said: âWe have also updated our guidance on care home visits to allow for a second designated indoor visitor."" Mr Drakeford said there would be ""more flexibility around visits from young children"". ""This updated guidance will come into effect from Monday."" First Minister Mark Drakeford says the positive public health situation means there is  âmore headroomâ to make further changes to the current Covid restrictions in Wales. From tomorrow any six people are able to meet outdoors, including private gardens, and from Monday in beer gardens too. âMany cafes, restaurants, pubs and bars with outdoor areas are taking bookings ahead of the planned re-opening from Monday,"" he said. ""It is important they have as much notice as possible about the rule-of-six, so they can take bookings for these larger groups."" The Welsh Labour leader has been accused of âelectioneeringâ by opposition parties who say he should not be making these announcements during the Senedd election campaign. Wales has âthe most successful vaccination programme in the UKâ, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford, the leader of Welsh Labour, said the latest figures showed that more than 1.7 million adults aged 18 and over have had their first dose of the vaccine. He said that was ""more than two-thirds of the adult populationâ. âMore than 650,000 adults have completed the two-dose course â thatâs one in four adults in Walesâ, he added. Mr Drakeford said âreally good progressâ was being made on  vaccinating younger adults with around two-thirds of people in their 40s and more than 30% of people in their 30s having had a first dose. First Minister Mark Drakeford says Wales now has the lowest Covid rates in the UK. Speaking at the Welsh governmentâs three weekly review of the coronavirus regulations, Mr Drakeford said the all-Wales figure was now 14.7 cases per 100,000 people. âThree weeks ago the figure was 35. There are 14 local authorities with rates below 15 cases per 100,000 people and the positivity rate is down to 1.7%â, he said. ""Wales has the lowest rates of coronavirus in the whole of the United Kingdom."" Mr Drakeford said the pressure on the NHS was continuing to ease with the number of people needing hospital treatment for the virus falling to the lowest level since mid-September. âIndeed, the number of people in hospital for coronavirus-related reasons has more than halved in the last three weeks,â he added.

Breaking|Breaking newsConvicted Post Office workers have names clearedThirty-nine Post Office workers convicted of theft have names cleared after one of the UKâs most widespread miscarriages of justiceBusiness,"This video can not be played ""It was all about clearing my name - I'm not a thief"": Former Post Office workers react outside court Judges have quashed the convictions of 39 former postmasters after the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice. They were convicted of stealing money, with some imprisoned, after the Post Office installed the Horizon computer system in branches. The system was flawed. Some of those whose lives were ruined now want those responsible to be ""punished"". The judgement was met with cheers from ex-postmasters outside court and was hailed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He called the original convictions an ""appalling injustice"". Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Man's life 'destroyed' by Post Office conviction 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' The clearing of the names of 39 peoplefollows the overturning of six other convictionsin December, This means more people have been affected than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK. Among them was Janet Skinner, who ran a post office in Hull. She was imprisoned in 2007 for nine months over a shortfall of Â£59,000 - a case which she said ""destroyed everything"". Like others, she said she had no idea fellow sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were being prosecuted and convicted. Former post office worker Janet Skinner (centre) outside the Royal Courts of Justice She was taken away from her two children to go to prison and - after her release - had a job offer taken away owing to her criminal conviction. Outside court, she said she was ""relieved"" at the judgement. Speaking after his name was cleared, Harjinder Butoy, who was convicted of theft and jailed for three years and four months in 2008, described the Post Office as ""a disgrace"". He said those responsible for the scandal ""need to be punished, seriously punished"", adding: ""They're just bullies, that's all they are. Somebody needs to really, really sort this out and charge them for this."" Hughie ""Noel"" Thomas, also cleared, said it had been 16 years to fight for justice. ""All I want is my money back. People have walked away from this who were responsible. I'd like to sit down with them and ask them the question 'why?',"" he said. Harjinder Butoy (left) hugs his father outside court Neil Hudgell, who represented 29 of the former sub-postmasters, said the Post Office ""has been found to have been an organisation that not only turned a blind eye to the failings in its hugely expensive IT system, but positively promoted a culture of cover-up and subterfuge in the pursuit of reputation and profit"". ""They readily accepted that loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary people as a price worth paying in that pursuit,"" he said. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells - at the the helm from 2012 to 2019 - said she supported a government inquiry. ""I was deeply saddened by the sub-postmasters' accounts heard during the Court of Appeal proceedings. I am truly sorry for the suffering caused to them as a result of the convictions which the Court of Appeal has today overturned. ""I fully support and am committed to co-operating with the ongoing Government Inquiry, as I did with last year's Select Committee Inquiry.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further while the Inquiry is ongoing."" Those affected have long called for a judge-led, full, public inquiry, rather than the government's own inquiry which is set to report in the summer. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, is reviewing another 22 cases. There were more than 700 prosecutions based on Horizon evidence. The commission and the Post Office are asking anyone else who believes their conviction to be unsafe to come forward. This video can not be played ""How do you die knowing that you've done nothing wrong?"" At the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Lord Justice Holroyde said the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"" the system's defects. But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"" and ""effectively steamrolled over any sub-postmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"", the judge added. The Court of Appeal also allowed the appeals on the basis that their prosecutions were an affront to justice - a decision that allows for the possibility of further claims for compensation against the Post Office.

Following the convictions - including theft, fraud and false accounting - some of these former postmasters went to prison, were shunned by their communities and struggled to secure work. Some lost their homes and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions. Three have since died. They always said the fault was in the computer system, which had been used to manage post offices' finances since 1999. Investigative journalist Nick Wallis hasfollowed this saga for years,external, reporting on the case for BBC Panorama and Radio 4. ""Just over 10 years ago, I spoke on the phone to a man who was crying his eyes out,"" he said. ""His pregnant wife, Seema Misra - the sub-postmaster at West Byfleet Post Office in Surrey - had been sent to prison for theft. He swore she was an innocent victim of the Post Office's computer system, Horizon. ""After meeting dozens of sub-postmasters over the past decade, I have been struck by the dignity and quiet anger they convey in interviews and conversation - emotions never stray far from the surface. ""There will be some jubilation at the quashing of so many convictions today, but the trauma, the loss of reputation and the years of financial hardship for the dozens of people who were prosecuted by the Post Office will never leave them."" This video can not be played Noel Thomas was jailed for nine  months in 2006 for false accounting Post Office chief executive Nick Read said: ""I am in no doubt about the human cost of the Post Office's past failures and the deep pain that has been caused to people affected. ""Many of those postmasters involved have been fighting for justice for a considerable length of time and sadly there are some who are not here to see the outcome today and whose families have taken forward appeals in their memory. I am very moved by their courage. ""The quashing of historical convictions is a vital milestone in fully and properly addressing the past as I work to put right these wrongs as swiftly as possible and there must be compensation that reflects what has happened."" In three additional cases - those of Stanley Fell, Wendy Cousins and Neelam Hussain - the judges ruled the convictions were not based on Horizon evidence, so their appeals against conviction failed. The Horizon system is designed to record the transactions carried out in a post office branch The Horizon system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. But from an early stage, it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. Horizon-based evidence was used by the Post Office to successfully prosecute 736 people. But campaigners fought a long and hard series of legal battles for compensation in the civil courts, which have been followed by referrals by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

"Covid pushes UK borrowing to highest since WW2The government borrowed Â£303bn in the year to March, reflecting the cost of measures to support the economy.BusinessComments","The cost of measures to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic has pushed government borrowing to the highest level since the end of World War Two. Government borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - hit Â£303.1bn in the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said. Compared to the previous year, borrowing is nearly Â£250bn higher. Measures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard. Borrowing hit Â£28bn in March alone - a record high for that month. Despite the record figure, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme the annual borrowing figure was ""slightly better than expected a month ago"". Where does the government borrow billions from? But, he added: ""The big story in a sense is they [the borrowing figures] are Â£250bn more than a year ago. ""And that, of course, is because of to some extent the recession of the last year but mostly because of the huge amount of additional government spending to support the economy over the last year."" Government borrowing of Â£303bn is at the same time, an extraordinary record, but also something a relief. For starters it is not Â£400bn, as anticipated only a few months ago, though this number will go up when some Covid support loans fail to be repaid. But its cause has been primarily an active government decision to spend more to support incomes during the pandemic. Of the Â£250bn difference in borrowing between this year and last, over Â£200bn comes from extra spending, the rest on a reduction in taxes. In the latest reported month, March, taxes were barely down on last year. Whereas VAT, fuel duty and business rates were down, self assessment, PAYE, stamp duty and capital gains taxes were up. That is part of a wider trend of the economy riding the second lockdown much more effectively than the first. It is epitomised by this morning's separate retail sales figures showing a boost even ahead of the physical reopening of shops. The ONS suggested Britons wanted to look good and deck out their gardens ahead of some restrictions being lifted. Others, less charitable,  suggested lockdown excess meant our clothes no longer fit. The chancellor's slimming regime for the public finances is a gentle one. Borrowing is predicted to continue at high levels this year, as jobs support continues until the autumn, and massive tax cuts are meant to persuade companies to invest in plant and machinery. It is a rebound in growth that will most effectively shrink these record borrowing numbers. That is why amid the sea of red ink, there is some reason for relief. Measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic contributed to a Â£203.2bn, or 27.5%, increase in central government day-to-day spending in the year to March, the ONS said. Meanwhile, tax and National Insurance receipts fell by Â£34.9bn, down 5% compared with the previous 12 months. The ONS also said public borrowing as a percentage of GDP, or national output rose, to 14.5% - also the highest since the end of the second world war when it reached 15.2% in 1946. The huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed public sector net debt up to Â£2.142 trillion, which is 97.7% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s. Clothes sales boosted retailers ahead of reopening Higher petrol prices drive up cost of living Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG, said: ""Rising debt is largely an unfortunate consequence of the government's focus on shielding the economy as much as possible from the impact of Covid-19. ""However, doing otherwise could have created long-lasting scars which would be far worse for fiscal sustainability."" Despite the record annual figure, the ONS said it was Â£24.3bn lower than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the fiscal watchdog, had forecast in March. Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said: ""If we are right in thinking the economic recovery will be faster and fuller than the OBR anticipates, borrowing will probably fall more quickly than most expect."" Separate research published on Friday added to hopes of a swift rebound for the economy, as it suggested that the easing of lockdown measures this month has triggered a surge in activity among UK businesses. A closely watched survey, produced by IHS Markit/CIPS, indicated that the looser pandemic restrictions had led to the fastest UK private sector growth since late 2013. The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60 in April,external, according to initial findings, up from 56.4 in March. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion. The service sector grew faster than manufacturing for the first time since the Covid pandemic began, the survey found, largely because of the reopening of non-essential shops in England and Wales from mid-April. ""Companies are reporting a surge in demand for both goods and services as the economy opens up from lockdowns and the encouraging vaccine rollout adds to a brighter outlook,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""Business activity should continue to grow strongly in May and June as virus restrictions are eased further, setting the scene for a bumper second quarter for the economy. ""There's also good news for the job market,"" he added. ""Firms have been encouraged to take on extra staff at a rate not seen for over three-and-a-half years. ""There are some causes for concern, however, as export performance remains relatively lacklustre, often linked to post-Brexit trading conditions, and prices continue to rise sharply.""

Tesla Autopilot 'tricked' to run without driver,"The Autopilot feature in Tesla vehicles can be tricked into operating without a driver, aninfluential consumer magazine,externalin the US has found. Consumer Reports engineers looked into claims that Autopilot can operate without a driver present. They tested the Model Y on a closed track and concluded the system could be ""easily tricked"". It comes days after a fatal Tesla crash in Texas. Police believe no one was in the driver's seat. Tesla's Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that Tesla says ""enhances safety and convenience behind the wheel"". The Consumer Reports team said they successfully - and repeatedly - tricked the car into driving their test track with no one in the driver's seat. ""In our evaluation, the system not only failed to make sure the driver was paying attention, but it also couldn't tell if there was a driver there at all,"" said Consumer Reports auto testing director Jake Fisher. ""It was a bit frightening when we realized how easy it was to defeat the safeguards, which we proved were clearly insufficient."" Tesla's website says the Autopilot system requires a ""fully attentive driver"" and using the system does not make the car autonomous. Some of the safety requirements for Autopilot mode include: keeping the driver's hands on the steering wheel, buckling the seatbelt and not opening any doors. On Saturday,two men were killed after a Tesla car crashedinto a tree and caught fire in Texas. The victims were found in the front passenger seat and in the back seat of the vehicle, leading police to believe nobody was in the driver's seat. However, Tesla boss Elon Musk said that ""data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled"". ""Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have,"" Mr Musk tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

India hospital fire as Covid cases hit record high,"Patients were evacuated from the hospital on Friday morning after the blaze was put out At least 13 patients have died after a fire broke out in the intensive care unit of an Indian hospital treating Covid patients near Mumbai. The blaze, which took place early on Friday, was extinguished and four survivors have been moved to nearby hospitals, said authorities. The incident comes amid a deadly second wave of infections in India. The spike has overwhelmed hospitals, creating a critical shortage of oxygen, intensive care beds and ventilators. On Friday India recorded 332,730 coronavirus cases, the highest one-day tally anywhere in the world for the second day in a row. Daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by a record 2,263 in the previous 24 hours. Delhi hospitals run out of oxygen amid Covid spike Why second Covid wave is devastating India How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave The fire happened at the Vijay Vallabh hospital in the Virar area of the western state of Maharashtra, which is about 70km (43 miles) north of Mumbai. It remains unclear how the blaze started, and Maharashtra's chief minister has ordered an inquiry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has offered condolences on Twitter calling the incident ""tragic"".

The rising number of cases has resulted in a deepening healthcare crisis that has gripped several states. Mr Modi is due to hold meetings with chief ministers of the most affected states and oxygen manufacturers on Friday. India's top court has asked the central government for a national plan by Friday, on bolstering supply, oxygen, medicine, treatment and vaccines. At least two hospitals in the Indian capital of Delhi are running out of oxygen The Supreme Court called the situation a ""national health emergency"" - six high courts across the country are hearing petitions involving medical shortages. Maharashtra is the worst hit state in the country in terms of cases and faces an oxygen shortfall. Two days earlier, 24 Covid patients died in another part of Maharashtra after they lost oxygen flow to their ventilators. A leak interrupted supply as a storage tank was being refilled at the Zakir Hussain hospital in Nashik city. 'It feels like we're back to square one in India' What is the India Covid variant? Which countries has India joined on the red list? In recent days, several other hospitals in Delhi said they had either run out of oxygen or supplies were dwindling rapidly. A number of people have died while waiting for oxygen, and the majority of intensive care beds in Delhi hospitals are full. Max Healthcare, which runs 10 private hospitals in the Delhi area, said it had waited more than seven hours for oxygen supplies at two facilities. Three other Indian states - Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana - are also facing a critical shortage of oxygen, while others are seeing depleting supplies. Medical-grade oxygen is purified and compressed until it is liquid and then delivered to hospital in tankers. The oxygen is then pumped around the hospital in pipes to assist patients whose blood oxygen levels are low.

Why wasn't India on the list?,"Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs Parliament's Home Affairs Committee, has criticised the delay in putting India on the government's travel-ban ""red list"". ""They should have put India on the red list at the same time as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Since then, we've had this three-week period in which thousands of people have returned from India and that probably includes hundreds of the new variant Covid cases,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. India was added to the red list on 23 April, but neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh had been on it since 9 April. One of the variants of coronavirus first identified in India has spread to the UK. Just under half of these cases involve international travel and the strain has now been designated a ""variant of concern"". What is the India Covid variant? The red list is the government'slist of 43 countries,externalfrom which there are strict restrictions on travel to England. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all have similar rules in place with the same list of countries. The restrictions are designed to protect the UK from new variants, against which vaccines may be less effective and which may spread more easily. Which countries are on the red list? What are the Indian, Brazil, South Africa and UK variants? India red list add 'may be too late', Prof Mark Walport says Travel to England is banned for anyone who has been in one of the countries in the past 10 days, except for UK citizens and residents, who have to isolate on arrival at government-approved hotels. Direct flights are banned from most red list countries, but not Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya and India. The government says this is to allow critical freight and make it easier for British nationals to return home. The decision is based on Joint Biosecurity Centre risk assessments, which include: how good a country's testing structures are, including checking for variants how many cases those systems have identified whether people in that country have been catching new variants at home or the cases have come from overseas evidence of whether that country has exported cases of new variants to other countries, including to the UK how good the country's travel links with the UK are The first point is important, because the genome sequencing needed to identify new variants is very sophisticated and relatively rare. But just because a country has found variants of concern, or has many cases of coronavirus, it will not necessarily be on the red list. On 18 May,external, the World Health Organization identified: 106 countries where the variant identified in South Africa had been found, of which 28 are on the red list 61 countries with the variant identified in Brazil, of which 19 are on the red list 48 countries with the variant identified in India, of which 6 are on the red list. Bangladesh had the South Africa but not the Brazil variant and Pakistan had neither when they were added to the red list on 9 April. India had both, as well as a new variant, but was not added for another two weeks. On 9 April: Pakistan had a seven-day average of 21 cases per million people Bangladesh had twice as many India had four times as many Health Secretary Matt Hancock said these figures depended on how much testing was being done and said ""far more"" was carried out in India. He said the decision to add Pakistan and Bangladesh earlier was based on a higher proportion of people arriving in the UK from these countries, testing positive for coronavirus. ""When we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India,"" Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May. Figures from NHS Test and Trace,externaldo not support that claim. For the period 25 March to 7 April, the positivity rate from Bangladesh was 3.7%, from India was 5.1% and from Pakistan was 6.2%. Mr Hancock was asked about this in Parliament on 19 May and said: ""The positivity rate in India, on which the decision to put Pakistan but not India on the red list was 1.6% in India and 4.6% in Pakistan, which is three times higher, as I said."" But those are not published figures. He didn't give the date for them and didn't mention Bangladesh this time. Checking Matt Hancock's claim about Covid cases from India ""Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,"" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology, at the University of Reading, said. Boris Johnson had planned a trade visit to India but cancelled iton 19 April- days before the country was added to the red list. One of the variants first identified in India was designated as a variant of concern on 7 May. By 17 May, 2,323 cases of this variant had been found in the UK, of which 483 had been in Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen. The WHO said,externalit appeared to have a higher rate of transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines may be less effective against it. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cited fears of the India variant on 14 May as one of the reasons why Glasgow and Moray willnot have restrictions eased as planned. In the four weeks before India was added to the red list, 6,560 people were tested on arrival in England from India. Of those, 425 tested positive for coronavirus, which is about 6%. The Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. Just under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according toa 13 May briefing from Public Health England,external. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England. Almost 60% of positive Covid19 tests are now sent for genome sequencing to identify new variants, which means the government has a good idea of where the cases are.

Why India is running out of oxygen,"Hospitals in Delhi have been forced to display signs saying they have run out of oxygen Twenty-five families in India's capital Delhi woke up to the news on Friday morning that someone they loved had died in the city's Sir Ganga Ram hospital, reportedly because coronavirus patients could not get enough oxygen. The hospital's medical director said a severe shortfall had slowed the flow of oxygen to 25 of the sickest patients, who needed a high pressure, stable supply. The tragedy came at the end of a week where several major hospitals in Delhi have repeatedly come close to running out of oxygen, which can help patients with the virus who need support with their breathing stay alive. On Tuesday, it tooka desperate public plea,externalfrom the chief minister and an intervention from the high court for the Indian central government to organise a late night refill. An oxygen tanker eventually arrived at Sir Ganga Ram hospital on Friday morning, shortly after a dire warning that 60 more patients were on the verge of death. But India's rising wave of cases is pushing its healthcare system to the brink - from the country's richest cities to its remotest corners. Maharashtra and Gujarat in the west, Haryana in the north, and Madhya Pradesh in central India are all facing an oxygen shortage. In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, some hospitals have put ""oxygen out of stock"" boards outside, and in the state capital Lucknow hospitals have asked patients to move elsewhere. Smaller hospitals and nursing homes in Delhi are doing the same. Desperate relatives in several cities are lining up outside oxygen refilling centres. One plant in the southern city of Hyderabad hired bouncers to manage the crowd. Many stricken with coronavirus are dying while they wait. Hospitals are struggling to accommodate breathless patients, or even keep alive those who were lucky enough to find a bed. Social media feeds and WhatsApp groups are full of frantic pleas for oxygen cylinders. For a week, India has been reliving this nightmare on repeat, waiting for the terrifying moment when there is no oxygen left at all. This video can not be played Relatives beg for help as oxygen runs out For anyone who has watched the pandemic unfold here - from doctors to officials to journalists - this feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu. Seven months ago, the country had grappled with a similaroxygen shortage amid a rapid surge in case numbers. But this time, it's much worse. Typically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply, leaving the rest for industrial use. But amid India's second wave nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. That's nearly three times higher than was consumed every day at the peak of the first wave in mid-September last year. Then, India was adding about 90,000 cases daily. Just two weeks ago, in early April, the single-day spike was around 144,000. Now, the daily caseload has more than doubled to well more than 300,000. ""The situation is so bad that we had to treat some patients in a cardiac ambulance for 12 hours until they could get an ICU bed,"" said Dr Siddheshwar Shinde, who runs a Covid hospital in Pune, a western district with India's second-highest active caseload and third-highest death toll from the virus. Last week, when there were no ventilators left, Dr Shinde began moving patients to other cities - unheard of in Pune, where patients usually arrive from nearby districts seeking treatment. Relatives of Covid patients have been queuing up in cities to refill cylinders The state of Maharashtra, where Pune is located, is among the worst-affected parts of India, and currently accounts for more than a third of active cases. The state is producing about 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen daily but all of it is already being used for Covid patients. And demand is rising along with cases, and outstripping supply. It shows no signs of letting up. ""Usually hospitals like ours were able to have enough oxygen supply. But in the past fortnight, keeping people breathing has become a task. Patients as young as 22 need oxygen support,"" said Dr Shinde. Doctors and epidemiologists believe the deluge of cases is delaying tests and consultation, leading to many people being admitted to hospital when their condition is severe. So the demand for high-flow oxygen - and therefore more oxygen - is higher than it was during the last wave. ""Nobody knows when this is going to end,"" Dr Shinde said. ""I think even the government did not foresee this."" Some governments did. The southern state of Kerala increased supply by monitoring demand closely and planning for a rise in cases. Kerala now has surplus oxygen that it is sending to other states. But Delhi and some other states do not have their own oxygen plants and are relying on imports. The Supreme Court has weighed in, asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration for a national Covid plan that addresses the oxygen crunch. The federal health ministry had invited bids for new oxygen plants in October last year - more than eight months after the beginning of pandemic in India. Of the 162 that were sanctioned, only 33 have been installed so far - 59 will be installed by the end of April and another 80 by the end of May, the ministry has said. A woman with access to oxygen waits for admission at the LNJP Hospital in Delhi The scramble to increase supply points to the lack of any emergency plan. Liquid oxygen, pale blue and extremely cold, with a temperature of around -183C, is a cryogenic gas that can only be stored and transported in special cylinders and tankers. About 500 factories in India extract and purify oxygen from air and send it to hospitals in liquid form. Most of it is supplied through tankers. Major hospitals usually have their own tank where oxygen is stored and then piped directly to beds. Smaller and temporary hospitals rely on steel and aluminium cylinders. Oxygen tankers often queue outside a plant for hours and it takes about two hours to fill one tanker. It takes several hours more for these tankers to travel to various towns within or across states. The tankers also have to follow a specific speed limit - no more than 25mph (40km/h) - and they often don't travel in the night to avoid accidents. The head of one of India's biggest oxygen suppliers has said part of the struggle has been getting oxygen from eastern India, where supply in industrial states such as Orissa and Jharkhand is high, to western or northern India such as Maharashtra or Delhi, where cases are rising fast. And the demand for oxygen at individual facilities is unpredictable, making it difficult to gauge a hospital's requirement and adequately get supply where it is needed. Transporting oxygen has become a huge logistical challenge ""Not every patient needs the same amount of oxygen for the same duration. How many patients need oxygen changes by hour in a hospital,"" said Dr Om Shrivastav, an infectious diseases expert at a Mumbai hospital. ""We are taking all the care we can. But I've not seen anything like this. I think nobody here has."" Before the crunch of the oxygen crisis, thefederal government was already facing criticismfor allowing election rallies and a massive Hindu festival, and failing to expand the vaccination drive quickly enough. Critics have accused various state governments of doing too little to prepare for the devastating second wave now washing through the county. Doctors and virologists who spoke to the BBC said the oxygen shortfall was more a symptom than a cause of the crisis - effective safety protocols and strong public messaging could have kept more people at home, and the virus at bay. But a sharp drop in cases by January lulled the country into a false sense of safety, they said, creating the conditions for a terrible second wave. Mr Modi's government has now started an ""oxygen express"", with trains carrying tankers to wherever there is demand, and the Indian Air Force is airlifting oxygen from military bases. They are also mulling plans to import 50,000 metric tonnes of of liquid oxygen. ""We have been telling authorities that we are willing to increase our capacity, but we need financial aid for that,"" said Rajabhau Shinde, who runs a small oxygen plant in Maharashtra. ""Nobody said anything and now suddenly, hospitals and doctors are pleading for more cylinders,"" he said. ""This should not have happened. As the saying goes, dig the well before you're thirsty. But we didn't do that."" Have you been affected by any of the issues raised in this story? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Why India is running out of oxygen again,"Hospitals in Delhi have been forced to display signs saying they have run out of oxygen Twenty-five families in India's capital Delhi woke up to the news on Friday morning that someone they loved had died in the city's Sir Ganga Ram hospital, reportedly because coronavirus patients could not get enough oxygen. The hospital's medical director said a severe shortfall had slowed the flow of oxygen to 25 of the sickest patients, who needed a high pressure, stable supply. The tragedy came at the end of a week where several major hospitals in Delhi have repeatedly come close to running out of oxygen, which can help patients with the virus who need support with their breathing stay alive. On Tuesday, it tooka desperate public plea,externalfrom the chief minister and an intervention from the high court for the Indian central government to organise a late night refill. An oxygen tanker eventually arrived at Sir Ganga Ram hospital on Friday morning, shortly after a dire warning that 60 more patients were on the verge of death. But India's rising wave of cases is pushing its healthcare system to the brink - from the country's richest cities to its remotest corners. Maharashtra and Gujarat in the west, Haryana in the north, and Madhya Pradesh in central India are all facing an oxygen shortage. In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, some hospitals have put ""oxygen out of stock"" boards outside, and in the state capital Lucknow hospitals have asked patients to move elsewhere. Smaller hospitals and nursing homes in Delhi are doing the same. Desperate relatives in several cities are lining up outside oxygen refilling centres. One plant in the southern city of Hyderabad hired bouncers to manage the crowd. Many stricken with coronavirus are dying while they wait. Hospitals are struggling to accommodate breathless patients, or even keep alive those who were lucky enough to find a bed. Social media feeds and WhatsApp groups are full of frantic pleas for oxygen cylinders. For a week, India has been reliving this nightmare on repeat, waiting for the terrifying moment when there is no oxygen left at all. This video can not be played Relatives beg for help as oxygen runs out For anyone who has watched the pandemic unfold here - from doctors to officials to journalists - this feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu. Seven months ago, the country had grappled with a similaroxygen shortage amid a rapid surge in case numbers. But this time, it's much worse. Typically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply, leaving the rest for industrial use. But amid India's second wave nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. That's nearly three times higher than was consumed every day at the peak of the first wave in mid-September last year. Then, India was adding about 90,000 cases daily. Just two weeks ago, in early April, the single-day spike was around 144,000. Now, the daily caseload has more than doubled to well more than 300,000. ""The situation is so bad that we had to treat some patients in a cardiac ambulance for 12 hours until they could get an ICU bed,"" said Dr Siddheshwar Shinde, who runs a Covid hospital in Pune, a western district with India's second-highest active caseload and third-highest death toll from the virus. Last week, when there were no ventilators left, Dr Shinde began moving patients to other cities - unheard of in Pune, where patients usually arrive from nearby districts seeking treatment. Relatives of Covid patients have been queuing up in cities to refill cylinders The state of Maharashtra, where Pune is located, is among the worst-affected parts of India, and currently accounts for more than a third of active cases. The state is producing about 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen daily but all of it is already being used for Covid patients. And demand is rising along with cases, and outstripping supply. It shows no signs of letting up. ""Usually hospitals like ours were able to have enough oxygen supply. But in the past fortnight, keeping people breathing has become a task. Patients as young as 22 need oxygen support,"" said Dr Shinde. Doctors and epidemiologists believe the deluge of cases is delaying tests and consultation, leading to many people being admitted to hospital when their condition is severe. So the demand for high-flow oxygen - and therefore more oxygen - is higher than it was during the last wave. ""Nobody knows when this is going to end,"" Dr Shinde said. ""I think even the government did not foresee this."" Some governments did. The southern state of Kerala increased supply by monitoring demand closely and planning for a rise in cases. Kerala now has surplus oxygen that it is sending to other states. But Delhi and some other states do not have their own oxygen plants and are relying on imports. The Supreme Court has weighed in, asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration for a national Covid plan that addresses the oxygen crunch. The federal health ministry had invited bids for new oxygen plants in October last year - more than eight months after the beginning of pandemic in India. Of the 162 that were sanctioned, only 33 have been installed so far - 59 will be installed by the end of April and another 80 by the end of May, the ministry has said. A woman with access to oxygen waits for admission at the LNJP Hospital in Delhi The scramble to increase supply points to the lack of any emergency plan. Liquid oxygen, pale blue and extremely cold, with a temperature of around -183C, is a cryogenic gas that can only be stored and transported in special cylinders and tankers. About 500 factories in India extract and purify oxygen from air and send it to hospitals in liquid form. Most of it is supplied through tankers. Major hospitals usually have their own tank where oxygen is stored and then piped directly to beds. Smaller and temporary hospitals rely on steel and aluminium cylinders. Oxygen tankers often queue outside a plant for hours and it takes about two hours to fill one tanker. It takes several hours more for these tankers to travel to various towns within or across states. The tankers also have to follow a specific speed limit - no more than 25mph (40km/h) - and they often don't travel in the night to avoid accidents. The head of one of India's biggest oxygen suppliers has said part of the struggle has been getting oxygen from eastern India, where supply in industrial states such as Orissa and Jharkhand is high, to western or northern India such as Maharashtra or Delhi, where cases are rising fast. And the demand for oxygen at individual facilities is unpredictable, making it difficult to gauge a hospital's requirement and adequately get supply where it is needed. Transporting oxygen has become a huge logistical challenge ""Not every patient needs the same amount of oxygen for the same duration. How many patients need oxygen changes by hour in a hospital,"" said Dr Om Shrivastav, an infectious diseases expert at a Mumbai hospital. ""We are taking all the care we can. But I've not seen anything like this. I think nobody here has."" Before the crunch of the oxygen crisis, thefederal government was already facing criticismfor allowing election rallies and a massive Hindu festival, and failing to expand the vaccination drive quickly enough. Critics have accused various state governments of doing too little to prepare for the devastating second wave now washing through the county. Doctors and virologists who spoke to the BBC said the oxygen shortfall was more a symptom than a cause of the crisis - effective safety protocols and strong public messaging could have kept more people at home, and the virus at bay. But a sharp drop in cases by January lulled the country into a false sense of safety, they said, creating the conditions for a terrible second wave. Mr Modi's government has now started an ""oxygen express"", with trains carrying tankers to wherever there is demand, and the Indian Air Force is airlifting oxygen from military bases. They are also mulling plans to import 50,000 metric tonnes of of liquid oxygen. ""We have been telling authorities that we are willing to increase our capacity, but we need financial aid for that,"" said Rajabhau Shinde, who runs a small oxygen plant in Maharashtra. ""Nobody said anything and now suddenly, hospitals and doctors are pleading for more cylinders,"" he said. ""This should not have happened. As the saying goes, dig the well before you're thirsty. But we didn't do that."" Have you been affected by any of the issues raised in this story? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Postmasters await 'stealing money' appeal verdict,"A group of 39 sub-postmasters have their convictions for stealing money quashed They had been convicted, with some imprisoned, after the Post Office installed the Horizon computer system A further three postmasters' convictions are ruled as ""safe"" as did not rely on Horizon evidence Lord Justice Holroyde says the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"" the system's defects The judges ruled the Post Office brought serious criminal charges against the sub-postmasters on the basis of Horizon data The Post Office prevented them from having a fair trial on the issue of whether that data was reliable, they ruled Post Office chairman Tim Parker says: ""The Post Office is extremely sorry for the impact on the lives of these postmasters and their families that was caused by historical failures"". The judgement is met with cheers from former postmasters outside the court In December 2019, the Post Office agreed to pay almost Â£58m to settle the dispute with more than 500 sub-postmasters Dearbail Jordan and Dan Ascher Former Post Office workers are celebrating today after 39 people had their criminal convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal in London. And that's where we'll leave our live coverage for now. You canread the full story herewhich is being updated throughout the day. We welcome the landmark decision by the Court of Appeal today to overturn these convictions, which marks another important milestone for postmasters affected by the Horizon dispute.  The Post Office has rightly apologised for its historical failings and is taking determined action to right the wrongs of the past, and we continue to monitor this work very closely.â Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy Former Post Office worker Tom Hedges, who was convicted of theft and false accounting and given a seven-month suspended sentence in 2011, opened a bottle of prosecco outside the Royal Courts of Justice after his conviction was quashed. ""It's a wonderful afternoon,"" he told the Press Association. ""When I told my mother, who's 93, I was coming to court she said 'get yourself down to Aldi and get some prosecco'."" ""She said 'just remember your name is Hedges not Rothschild, so get prosecco, not Bollinger!""' Neil Hudgell, the solicitor for 29 of the postmasters has accused the Post Office of a coverup. ""Ultimately, it has been found to have been an organisation that not only turned a blind eye to the failings in its hugely expensive IT system, but positively promoted a culture of cover-up and subterfuge in the pursuit of reputation and profit, "" he said. ""They readily accepted that loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary people as a price worth paying in that pursuit."" Allow Twitter content?

The solicitor who represented 29 of the postmasters has said it is ""almost impossible to describe the true impact"" that the scandal has had on the lives of those who had their reputations and livlihoods ""so unfairly destroyed"". Solicitor Neil Hudgell said: ""They are honest, hard-working people who served their communities but have had to live with the stigma of being branded criminals for many years, all the while knowing they have been innocent. ""Indeed, given its actions, everything the Post Office has sought to do over the last year or so, whether it be by way of apology and offers of redress, or by talking about a cultural change, completely unravelled when our clients' cases where heard."" He added: ""The Post Office failed to offer any sort of explanation as to why wholesale disclosure of evidence was withheld in cases, nor why a proper investigation was not carried out when known problems in the Horizon system started to appear."" ""This is a huge victory in the fight for justice for the subpostmasters affected by this appalling decades-long scandal, in the face of inaction from government,"" said Ed Miliband, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary. ""But there are so many other names to clear. For some who lost their homes and their reputations, it's too late. He said Labour was pushing for a ""proper Inquiry with teeth"" to get the bottom of how this scandal happened who was responsible. ""The government's inquiry risks being a whitewash,"" he said. Helen Pitcher, the chairwoman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which asked the Court of Appeal to review the convictions, said: ""This has been a serious miscarriage of justice which has had a devastating impact on these victims and their families."" ""Every single one of these convictions has clearly had a profound and life-changing impact for those involved,"" she said in a statement. ""The Post Office has rightly acknowledged the failures that led to these cases and conceded that the prosecutions were an abuse of process."" ""We sincerely hope that lessons will be learned from this to prevent anything similar happening elsewhere in the future."" There were emotional scenes outside the Court of Appeal after the judgement was handed down. Former post office worker Janet Skinner - who was imprisoned in 2007 for nine months over a shortfall of Â£59,000 at her Post Office in Hull - broke down in tears when she emerged from the court. Ms Skinner said she was ""relieved"" to have finally cleared her name. Earlier today, she told BBC Radio Humberside about the moment the judge told her that she would be going to prison. âI actually thought he meant, he was going to give me a suspended sentence or something and that was it,"" she said. ""Then they locked the door and then I knew that I wasnât coming out."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter It is impossible to overstate
the impact this judgement is likely to have on the Post Office. Its chief executive Nick Read has
apologised and paid tribute to the sub-postmasters whose convictions have been
overturned. But, the ruling does open the
road for dozens of people to seek damages against the Post Office for malicious
prosecution. On top of making good on the
historical shortfalls, this could leave the Post Office with a huge bill. One
which it could well need financial support from the government to pay. Earlier on Friday, former sub-postmaster Noel Thomas shared the pain and devastation that his conviction for stealing from the Post Office has caused him and his family - see our report at 9:51am. He is pictured here after the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction. He and his 38 colleagues who also saw their convictions overturned will be feeling fully vindicated today after a long fight. The Court of Appeal said that the Post Office prevented the postmasters from having a fair trial. It said the Post Office's failure to investigate or disclose data from the unreliable Horizon IT system prevented those postmasters, of which the court found 39 were wrongly convicted, from challenging those convictions. ""In short, [Post Office] as prosecutor brought serious criminal charges against the subpostmasters on the basis of Horizon data."" ""By its failures to discharge its clear duties it prevented them from having a fair trial on the issue of whether that data was reliable."" The convictions of 39 Post Office branch managers have been overturned, but for one family it is too little, too late. Tim Parker, chairman of the Post Office, said: ""The Post
Office is extremely sorry for the impact on the lives of these postmasters and
their families that was caused by historical failures."" The Post Office today sincerely apologises for serious failures in its historical conduct of prosecutions of postmasters, resulting in the Court of Appeal formally overturning convictions - that occurred between 2003 to 2013 - in uncontested appeals. The Court quashed 39 convictions, referred by the Criminal Cases Review Commission last year.  The Post Office announced at the earliest opportunity, in October 2020, that it would not oppose the overwhelming majority of these appeals.  The Court upheld the safety of convictions in three cases. The Post Office Lord Justice Holroyde said at the Court of Appeal ruling today that the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"" the system's defects. But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"", and ""effectively steamrolled over any subpostmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"". Prior to today's judgement, the Post Office said: ""We sincerely apologise to the postmasters affected by our historical failures. Throughout this appeals process we have supported the quashing of the
overwhelming majority of these convictions and the judgement will be an important milestone in addressing the past.â Three of the 42 sub-postmasters hoping to have their names cleared today will be disappointed. The judges decided that the cases brought against Neelam Hussain, Stanley Fell and Wendy Cousins did not depend on data from the flawed Horizon IT system. Therefore it said their convictions were safe. The Court of Appeal has quashed the convictions of 39 former Post Office workers who were found guilty of stealing money from the company, according to the Press Association. The former sub-postmasters and postmisstresses had been convicted of theft, fraud and false accounting because of the Post Office's defective Horizon accounting system. Jo Hamilton is one of those awaiting the decision by the Court of Appeal. She was accused by the Post Office of taking Â£36,000 from the village branch she ran in Hampshire. Ms Hamilton had to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. Declaring the criminal record also affected everyday life, such as failing to get car insurance. ""I think this is the biggest miscarriage of justice,"" she told PA. ""I was 45 when this started. It's taken up nearly a third of my life. You think it's never going to end."" ""I was given a 12-month supervision order and have a criminal record,"" she said.
""But I did nothing wrong. I told them about the problem but they said I was the only one."" Nick Wallis has been reporting on the Post Office scandal for over a decade. Allow Twitter content?

Joe Biden to 'propose hiking tax on rich',"Joe Biden speaking at a presidential podium. US President Joe Biden is reportedly set to propose a tax hike on the wealthiest Americans. The proposal would raise the top marginal rate and increase taxes on investment gains for the rich. The tax rise would help pay for childcare and education, but would not be used for healthcare, according to reports. The news triggered a selloff on Wall Street, with major indexes slipping during Thursday's trading session. Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan Minimum wage fight: 'There's no recovery without raising it' The White House said the American Family Plan, which Mr Biden is expected to lay out in full next week, will not affect any family earning less than $400,000 a year. ""His view is that that should be on the backs... of the wealthiest Americans who can afford it and corporations and businesses who can afford it,"" said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. The proposal would increase the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37%, according to the New York Times and Bloomberg. The move would effectively reverse Donald Trumpâs 2017 income tax cut for highest income earners. The plan would also nearly double taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for people earning more than $1m. Itâs a dramatic increase from the current rate of 20%. In some states which impose their own capital gains tax, the total bill some investors could face might exceed 50%. This video can not be played President Biden urged nations to help ""overcome the existential crisis of our time"" The plan is widely expected to encounter resistance from Republicans in Congress. Although the Democrats hold a slim majority, they may not support the plan unanimously. Nevertheless, the news was enough to cause a few jitters on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 420 points before reining in its losses slightly. ""If it had a chance of passing, we'd be down 2,000 points,"" Thomas Hayes, from Great Hill Capital told Reuters. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index also slipped 0.9%.

India hospital fire kills 13 amid Covid oxygen crisis,"Patients were evacuated from the hospital on Friday morning after the blaze was put out At least 13 patients have died after a fire broke out in the intensive care unit of an Indian hospital treating Covid patients near Mumbai. The blaze, which took place early on Friday, was extinguished and four survivors have been moved to nearby hospitals, said authorities. The incident comes amid a deadly second wave of infections in India. The spike has overwhelmed hospitals, creating a critical shortage of oxygen, intensive care beds and ventilators. On Friday India recorded 332,730 coronavirus cases, the highest one-day tally anywhere in the world for the second day in a row. Daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by a record 2,263 in the previous 24 hours. Delhi hospitals run out of oxygen amid Covid spike Why second Covid wave is devastating India How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave The fire happened at the Vijay Vallabh hospital in the Virar area of the western state of Maharashtra, which is about 70km (43 miles) north of Mumbai. It remains unclear how the blaze started, and Maharashtra's chief minister has ordered an inquiry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has offered condolences on Twitter calling the incident ""tragic"".

The rising number of cases has resulted in a deepening healthcare crisis that has gripped several states. Mr Modi is due to hold meetings with chief ministers of the most affected states and oxygen manufacturers on Friday. India's top court has asked the central government for a national plan by Friday, on bolstering supply, oxygen, medicine, treatment and vaccines. At least two hospitals in the Indian capital of Delhi are running out of oxygen The Supreme Court called the situation a ""national health emergency"" - six high courts across the country are hearing petitions involving medical shortages. Maharashtra is the worst hit state in the country in terms of cases and faces an oxygen shortfall. Two days earlier, 24 Covid patients died in another part of Maharashtra after they lost oxygen flow to their ventilators. A leak interrupted supply as a storage tank was being refilled at the Zakir Hussain hospital in Nashik city. 'It feels like we're back to square one in India' What is the India Covid variant? Which countries has India joined on the red list? In recent days, several other hospitals in Delhi said they had either run out of oxygen or supplies were dwindling rapidly. A number of people have died while waiting for oxygen, and the majority of intensive care beds in Delhi hospitals are full. Max Healthcare, which runs 10 private hospitals in the Delhi area, said it had waited more than seven hours for oxygen supplies at two facilities. Three other Indian states - Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana - are also facing a critical shortage of oxygen, while others are seeing depleting supplies. Medical-grade oxygen is purified and compressed until it is liquid and then delivered to hospital in tankers. The oxygen is then pumped around the hospital in pipes to assist patients whose blood oxygen levels are low.

Covid costs push UK borrowing to highest since WW2,"The cost of measures to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic has pushed government borrowing to the highest level since the end of World War Two. Government borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - hit Â£303.1bn in the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said. Compared to the previous year, borrowing is nearly Â£250bn higher. Measures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard. Borrowing hit Â£28bn in March alone - a record high for that month. Despite the record figure, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme the annual borrowing figure was ""slightly better than expected a month ago"". Where does the government borrow billions from? But, he added: ""The big story in a sense is they [the borrowing figures] are Â£250bn more than a year ago. ""And that, of course, is because of to some extent the recession of the last year but mostly because of the huge amount of additional government spending to support the economy over the last year."" Government borrowing of Â£303bn is at the same time, an extraordinary record, but also something a relief. For starters it is not Â£400bn, as anticipated only a few months ago, though this number will go up when some Covid support loans fail to be repaid. But its cause has been primarily an active government decision to spend more to support incomes during the pandemic. Of the Â£250bn difference in borrowing between this year and last, over Â£200bn comes from extra spending, the rest on a reduction in taxes. In the latest reported month, March, taxes were barely down on last year. Whereas VAT, fuel duty and business rates were down, self assessment, PAYE, stamp duty and capital gains taxes were up. That is part of a wider trend of the economy riding the second lockdown much more effectively than the first. It is epitomised by this morning's separate retail sales figures showing a boost even ahead of the physical reopening of shops. The ONS suggested Britons wanted to look good and deck out their gardens ahead of some restrictions being lifted. Others, less charitable,  suggested lockdown excess meant our clothes no longer fit. The chancellor's slimming regime for the public finances is a gentle one. Borrowing is predicted to continue at high levels this year, as jobs support continues until the autumn, and massive tax cuts are meant to persuade companies to invest in plant and machinery. It is a rebound in growth that will most effectively shrink these record borrowing numbers. That is why amid the sea of red ink, there is some reason for relief. Measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic contributed to a Â£203.2bn, or 27.5%, increase in central government day-to-day spending in the year to March, the ONS said. Meanwhile, tax and National Insurance receipts fell by Â£34.9bn, down 5% compared with the previous 12 months. The ONS also said public borrowing as a percentage of GDP, or national output rose, to 14.5% - also the highest since the end of the second world war when it reached 15.2% in 1946. The huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed public sector net debt up to Â£2.142 trillion, which is 97.7% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s. Clothes sales boosted retailers ahead of reopening Higher petrol prices drive up cost of living Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG, said: ""Rising debt is largely an unfortunate consequence of the government's focus on shielding the economy as much as possible from the impact of Covid-19. ""However, doing otherwise could have created long-lasting scars which would be far worse for fiscal sustainability."" Despite the record annual figure, the ONS said it was Â£24.3bn lower than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the fiscal watchdog, had forecast in March. Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said: ""If we are right in thinking the economic recovery will be faster and fuller than the OBR anticipates, borrowing will probably fall more quickly than most expect."" Separate research published on Friday added to hopes of a swift rebound for the economy, as it suggested that the easing of lockdown measures this month has triggered a surge in activity among UK businesses. A closely watched survey, produced by IHS Markit/CIPS, indicated that the looser pandemic restrictions had led to the fastest UK private sector growth since late 2013. The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60 in April,external, according to initial findings, up from 56.4 in March. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion. The service sector grew faster than manufacturing for the first time since the Covid pandemic began, the survey found, largely because of the reopening of non-essential shops in England and Wales from mid-April.

"Covid costs push UK borrowing to highest since WW2The government borrowed Â£303bn in the year to March, reflecting the cost of measures to support the economy.Business","The cost of measures to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic has pushed government borrowing to the highest level since the end of World War Two. Government borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - hit Â£303.1bn in the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said. Compared to the previous year, borrowing is nearly Â£250bn higher. Measures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard. Borrowing hit Â£28bn in March alone - a record high for that month. Despite the record figure, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme the annual borrowing figure was ""slightly better than expected a month ago"". Where does the government borrow billions from? But, he added: ""The big story in a sense is they [the borrowing figures] are Â£250bn more than a year ago.

Covid patients die in Indian hospital ICU fire,"Patients were evacuated from the hospital on Friday morning after the blaze was put out At least 13 patients have died after a fire broke out in the intensive care unit of an Indian hospital treating Covid patients near Mumbai. The blaze, which took place early on Friday, was extinguished and four survivors have been moved to nearby hospitals, said authorities. The incident comes amid a deadly second wave of infections in India. The spike has overwhelmed hospitals, creating a critical shortage of oxygen, intensive care beds and ventilators. On Friday India recorded 332,730 coronavirus cases, the highest one-day tally anywhere in the world for the second day in a row. Daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by a record 2,263 in the previous 24 hours. Delhi hospitals run out of oxygen amid Covid spike Why second Covid wave is devastating India How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave The fire happened at the Vijay Vallabh hospital in the Virar area of the western state of Maharashtra, which is about 70km (43 miles) north of Mumbai. It remains unclear how the blaze started, and Maharashtra's chief minister has ordered an inquiry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has offered condolences on Twitter calling the incident ""tragic"".

The rising number of cases has resulted in a deepening healthcare crisis that has gripped several states. Mr Modi is due to hold meetings with chief ministers of the most affected states and oxygen manufacturers on Friday. India's top court has asked the central government for a national plan by Friday, on bolstering supply, oxygen, medicine, treatment and vaccines. At least two hospitals in the Indian capital of Delhi are running out of oxygen The Supreme Court called the situation a ""national health emergency"" - six high courts across the country are hearing petitions involving medical shortages. Maharashtra is the worst hit state in the country in terms of cases and faces an oxygen shortfall. Two days earlier, 24 Covid patients died in another part of Maharashtra after they lost oxygen flow to their ventilators. A leak interrupted supply as a storage tank was being refilled at the Zakir Hussain hospital in Nashik city. 'It feels like we're back to square one in India' What is the India Covid variant? Which countries has India joined on the red list? In recent days, several other hospitals in Delhi said they had either run out of oxygen or supplies were dwindling rapidly. A number of people have died while waiting for oxygen, and the majority of intensive care beds in Delhi hospitals are full. Max Healthcare, which runs 10 private hospitals in the Delhi area, said it had waited more than seven hours for oxygen supplies at two facilities. Three other Indian states - Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana - are also facing a critical shortage of oxygen, while others are seeing depleting supplies. Medical-grade oxygen is purified and compressed until it is liquid and then delivered to hospital in tankers. The oxygen is then pumped around the hospital in pipes to assist patients whose blood oxygen levels are low.

'50+1' ownership considered in football review,"Fans protested at Chelsea on Tuesday before it was announced the six English clubs would not join a European Super League New ownership structures at clubs will be assessed as part of a fan-led review into English football. The review, brought forward by the UK government due to controversies over the proposed European Super League, will consider ownership, finance and supporter involvement in the game. It will also assess if an independent regulator may have beneficial impact. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said the fan-led review ""must be a watershed moment in our national game"". Tracey Crouch MP will chair the review and report its recommendations back to the government and Football Association. She said it will ""take the necessary steps to retain the game's integrity, competitiveness and, most importantly, the bond that clubs have with its supporters and the local community"". Recent events - which saw six Premier League clubs sign up and later withdraw from a new European Super League - prompted fans to air frustrations over the power owners have in taking big decisions at clubs. The review will consider ownership models including those used in Germany, where the 50+1 rule means clubs cannot play in the Bundesliga if one commercial investor owns more than a 49% stake. The Bundesliga says the rule""protects against reckless owners and safeguards the democratic customs of German clubs"".,external ""While foreign ownership has undoubtedly benefited the development of the game, the review will seek to test whether existing oversight is sufficient to protect the interests of the game,"" the UK government said. Fans protested at Manchester United's training ground on Thursday and held a '51%' banner In addition, the review hopes to scrutinise the Owners' and Directors' Tests currently in place, assess the flow of money through the English football pyramid, and consider if club finances could be scrutinised on a more regular basis. In the wake of news breaking on the decision by Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham and Arsenal to join a European Super League, former England defender Gary Neville said he felt the game needed an independent regulator. The fan-led review will assess how this could work and what relationship it could have with bodies - such as the Football Association - in the game. Time will also be spent considering possible interventions that could protect club identity, such as historical features like club badges. This video can not be played ""We will do whatever it takes to protect our national game"" â Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden All six clubs intent on a breakaway reversed their decision on Tuesday but many in the game have been left frustrated by their actions. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said there was anger among the 14 other Premier League clubs when they met this week and he expects ""more government intervention"" as a result of the controversy. ""First, we have asked the PL and FA to make sure they conduct a full investigation,"" Barber told BT Sport. ""The second step must be to ensure it can't happen again. ""Clearly the one thing we are very clear on is when we work in football, we work within the regulatory framework. We know there are rules we have to abide by and if these rules are breached there will be sanctions. In this situation, where the game has been damaged - this has been a PR catastrophe for the whole game - there have to be some consequences for that. ""The actions of the last 72 hours proves our framework has not been strong enough. There are so many people concerned by what could happen, we need more stringent control and clear sanctions for what would happen if anyone tried it again. The consequences could have been catastrophic.""

India joins UK's 'red list' as travel ban begins,"India has joined the UK's travel red list - effectively banning travel - as a deadly second wave of infections sweeps the country. British and Irish nationals can travel to the UK from India, but they must now isolate in a government-approved hotel. India has seen soaring infection rates, a rapidly rising death toll and the discovery of a new virus variant. The spike hasoverwhelmed hospitals, creating a critical shortage of oxygen, intensive care beds and ventilators. What are the travel quarantine rules? Why was India not already on the red list? Why India is running out of oxygen again On Friday, India recorded 332,730 coronavirus cases, the highest one-day tally anywhere in the world for the second day in a row. Daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by a record 2,263 in the previous 24 hours. At least two hospitals in the Indian capital Delhi arerunning out of oxygen, and at least 13 patients have died aftera fire broke out in the intensive care unitof a hospital set up to treat Covid patients near Mumbai.

Nayan Gangyan is facing a 10-day hotel quarantine when he flies back to London from northern India on Saturday. He travelled to Chandigarh a few weeks ago, when his parents both contracted coronavirus. He told BBC Breakfast he was left feeling ""helpless"" in the UK when his father's oxygen levels dropped, there were no beds available in hospital and his mother started to panic. ""It was at that point that I decided 'my family needs help and I need to go back come what may',"" he says. He says the situation in India is ""really bad"", with the government healthcare system ""completely overrun"". But they eventually managed to get his father admitted to a hospital where he had previously undergone a liver transplant, and he is doing ""much better now"". Now Nayan is preparing to return home to London. ""The flight as of now, it's running. I really hope that it does take off,"" he says. ""I've already booked my quarantine hotel so I'll be going straight there. I'll be landing [then] straight to the hotel and 10 days in the room."" His wife Vani, who has been watching from a distance from their London home, says it has been difficult ""not to be able to control or influence"" events. On India's red list status, she says: ""We got just over three days' notice so very little time for us to actually affect the outcome or do anything. ""We're just in the position where we have to be okay. After Nayan's ordeal in India he has to go through another ordeal."" Tina Patel and her husband arrived back in the UK on Thursday from Pune, Maharashtra, after travelling to India in March to visit her father-in-law, who was ill due to old age and later died. She told the BBC people in the city were ""desperate"" - trying to find hospital beds or a slot in the crematoriums. ""We left a city with ambulances wailing away day and night,"" she said. ""I left broken-hearted as there was nothing we could do but catch the BA flight last night and all we could do was to be thankful that we finally got home."" Friday's travel rule change means direct flights from India are still permitted, but UK and Irish nationals, as well as those with residency rights, must isolate in government-approved hotels - at their own cost - for 10 days. Travel to the UK is banned for all others who have been in red-list countries in the past 10 days. There are 40 countries on thegovernment's red list,externalacross the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice.

'It feels like we're back to square one in India' What is the India Covid variant? Public Health England (PHE) confirmed on Thursday thata further 55 cases,externalof the virus variant first identified in India - known as B.1.617 - were found in the UK in the latest week to 14 April. PHE experts are currently unsure whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity. The final scheduled commercial flight ahead of the rule change - Vistara flight VTI017 - landed at London's Heathrow Airport at 18:48 on Thursday, according to FlightRadar24. Four airlines asked for a total of eight extra flights to arrive at the west London airport before the 04:00 deadlinebut were refused permission by airport authorities. Heathrow bosses are believed to have declined the requests to ensure pressures at the border, reported in recent weeks, were not exacerbated. Later scheduled arrivals from Delhi and Mumbai to Heathrow, and Delhi to Gatwick Airport, were cancelled on Thursday, airport data showed.

""Eventually, yesterday, a friend in the UK managed to book me a ticket from Mumbai to Manchester,"" Biju Mathew, a social services manager from Walsall, said. Demand for flights from India to the UK quickly became overwhelming after the government's red list announcement, according to Suresh Kumar, chairman of specialist travel agents Indra Travel. ""A lot of people were hoping that the [UK] government would have made arrangements for people trying to get back,"" he said. ""They were disappointed."" This video can not be played Scenes outside a hospital in Delhi, where people are dying without getting the treatment they need Speaking on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who cancelled an official visit to India due to take place next Monday - said the addition to the red list was a ""purely precautionary"" step over a new coronavirus variant. He said: ""What we're seeing in India is a result of a variant under investigation, it hasn't yet been deemed a variant of concern - I think that was why there has been the delay."" The B.1.617 variant was first noted internationally in October and first identified in the UK on 22 February. Have you been affected by the issues in this story?

""It was at that point that I decided 'my family needs help and I need to go back come what may',"" he says. He says the situation in India is ""really bad"", with the government healthcare system ""completely overrun"". But they eventually managed to get his father admitted to a hospital where he had previously undergone a liver transplant, and he is doing ""much better now"". Now Nayan is preparing to return home to London. ""The flight as of now, it's running. I really hope that it does take off,"" he says. ""I've already booked my quarantine hotel so I'll be going straight there. I'll be landing [then] straight to the hotel and 10 days in the room."" His wife Vani, who has been watching from a distance from their London home, says it has been difficult ""not to be able to control or influence"" events. On India's red list status, she says: ""We got just over three days' notice so very little time for us to actually affect the outcome or do anything. ""We're just in the position where we have to be okay. After Nayan's ordeal in India he has to go through another ordeal."" Tina Patel and her husband arrived back in the UK on Thursday from Pune, Maharashtra, after travelling to India in March to visit her father-in-law, who was ill due to old age and later died. She told the BBC people in the city were ""desperate"" - trying to find hospital beds or a slot in the crematoriums. ""We left a city with ambulances wailing away day and night,"" she said. ""I left broken-hearted as there was nothing we could do but catch the BA flight last night and all we could do was to be thankful that we finally got home."" Friday's travel rule change means direct flights from India are still permitted, but UK and Irish nationals, as well as those with residency rights, must isolate in government-approved hotels - at their own cost - for 10 days. Travel to the UK is banned for all others who have been in red-list countries in the past 10 days. There are 40 countries on thegovernment's red list,externalacross the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice. There are specific rules for people arriving in each UK nation, includingEngland,external,Scotland,external,Northern Ireland,externalandWales,external. 'It feels like we're back to square one in India' What is the India Covid variant? Public Health England (PHE) confirmed on Thursday thata further 55 cases,externalof the virus variant first identified in India - known as B.1.617 - were found in the UK in the latest week to 14 April. PHE experts are currently unsure whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity. The final scheduled commercial flight ahead of the rule change - Vistara flight VTI017 - landed at London's Heathrow Airport at 18:48 on Thursday, according to FlightRadar24. Four airlines asked for a total of eight extra flights to arrive at the west London airport before the 04:00 deadlinebut were refused permission by airport authorities. Heathrow bosses are believed to have declined the requests to ensure pressures at the border, reported in recent weeks, were not exacerbated. Later scheduled arrivals from Delhi and Mumbai to Heathrow, and Delhi to Gatwick Airport, were cancelled on Thursday, airport data showed. This video can not be played Travellers returning from India: ""Oh my goodness, feeling so relieved"" Some of those who arrived before the red list change told the BBC they""couldn't afford to stay away"" and ""had to get back to work"". ""Eventually, yesterday, a friend in the UK managed to book me a ticket from Mumbai to Manchester,"" Biju Mathew, a social services manager from Walsall, said. Demand for flights from India to the UK quickly became overwhelming after the government's red list announcement, according to Suresh Kumar, chairman of specialist travel agents Indra Travel. ""A lot of people were hoping that the [UK] government would have made arrangements for people trying to get back,"" he said. ""They were disappointed."" This video can not be played Scenes outside a hospital in Delhi, where people are dying without getting the treatment they need Speaking on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who cancelled an official visit to India due to take place next Monday - said the addition to the red list was a ""purely precautionary"" step over a new coronavirus variant. He said: ""What we're seeing in India is a result of a variant under investigation, it hasn't yet been deemed a variant of concern - I think that was why there has been the delay."" The B.1.617 variant was first noted internationally in October and first identified in the UK on 22 February. Have you been affected by the issues in this story?

'50+1' ownership considered in football reviewThe UK government's fan-led review into English football will consider how the ownership of clubs is structured.BBC SportComments,"Fans protested at Chelsea on Tuesday before it was announced the six English clubs would not join a European Super League New ownership structures at clubs will be assessed as part of a fan-led review into English football. The review, brought forward by the UK government due to controversies over the proposed European Super League, will consider ownership, finance and supporter involvement in the game. It will also assess if an independent regulator may have beneficial impact. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said the fan-led review ""must be a watershed moment in our national game"". Tracey Crouch MP will chair the review and report its recommendations back to the government and Football Association. She said it will ""take the necessary steps to retain the game's integrity, competitiveness and, most importantly, the bond that clubs have with its supporters and the local community"". Recent events - which saw six Premier League clubs sign up and later withdraw from a new European Super League - prompted fans to air frustrations over the power owners have in taking big decisions at clubs. The review will consider ownership models including those used in Germany, where the 50+1 rule means clubs cannot play in the Bundesliga if one commercial investor owns more than a 49% stake. The Bundesliga says the rule""protects against reckless owners and safeguards the democratic customs of German clubs"".,external ""While foreign ownership has undoubtedly benefited the development of the game, the review will seek to test whether existing oversight is sufficient to protect the interests of the game,"" the UK government said. Fans protested at Manchester United's training ground on Thursday and held a '51%' banner In addition, the review hopes to scrutinise the Owners' and Directors' Tests currently in place, assess the flow of money through the English football pyramid, and consider if club finances could be scrutinised on a more regular basis. In the wake of news breaking on the decision by Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham and Arsenal to join a European Super League, former England defender Gary Neville said he felt the game needed an independent regulator. The fan-led review will assess how this could work and what relationship it could have with bodies - such as the Football Association - in the game. Time will also be spent considering possible interventions that could protect club identity, such as historical features like club badges. This video can not be played ""We will do whatever it takes to protect our national game"" â Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden All six clubs intent on a breakaway reversed their decision on Tuesday but many in the game have been left frustrated by their actions. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said there was anger among the 14 other Premier League clubs when they met this week and he expects ""more government intervention"" as a result of the controversy. ""First, we have asked the PL and FA to make sure they conduct a full investigation,"" Barber told BT Sport. ""The second step must be to ensure it can't happen again. ""Clearly the one thing we are very clear on is when we work in football, we work within the regulatory framework. We know there are rules we have to abide by and if these rules are breached there will be sanctions. In this situation, where the game has been damaged - this has been a PR catastrophe for the whole game - there have to be some consequences for that. ""The actions of the last 72 hours proves our framework has not been strong enough. There are so many people concerned by what could happen, we need more stringent control and clear sanctions for what would happen if anyone tried it again. The consequences could have been catastrophic.""

Charities sound alarm over buy-now-pay-later debtThe Citizens Advice network says people often regret using the increasingly popular payments method.,"A group of charities has sounded the alarm over the growing use of buy-now-pay-later to buy goods. Citizens Advice, a network of legal, money and consumer groups, said many users were getting into debt and struggling to pay for food and bills. Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) is increasingly popular among young people buying online, and at some High Street outlets. However, Citizens Advice said many consumers regretted using it. The charity network did not want to name BNPL firms, but called for tougher regulation. It found that 45% of 18-to-34 year olds have used the payment option in the last 12 months. The repayment option is often advertised at online checkouts as an easy way of splitting or delaying payments on items such as clothing or electronics, with incentives such as it being ""interest-free"". However, the charity network said it can be a ""slippery slope into debt"". The charity network said that, overall, 27% of UK adults have used these firms in the last 12 months, rising to 37% of disabled people and 45% of people with a mental health problem. The average person was repaying Â£63 a month, but CA found almost two-in-five (5.7 million) who have used BNPL in the last year didn't think it was ""proper borrowing"" and six million didn't fully understand what they were signing up for. One consumer who signed up for more than she expected is Sharonjit, whose story was cited  by Citizen's Advice as an example of the trouble people can get into. Aged 32, she bought Â£600 worth of clothes and used a BNPL firm to pay in instalments. She didn't receive the goods and cancelled her payment to the firm while she waited for the issue to be resolved by the retailer. She said: ""The whole thing has been so stressful. I'm constantly on edge. I've just been barraged with calls, emails and letters from a debt collector - all for buying some clothes online. ""The firm said they were referring me on to someone and I had no idea it was a debt collector. I had no idea buy-now-pay-later could [hit] my credit score. ""I've never had issues shopping this way before. But this time it's like as soon as something went wrong they've washed their hands of me."" And the charity warned that four-in-10 of those who've used BNPL in the last 12 months are struggling to repay. It found a quarter of consumers regretted paying using these platforms, with consumers frequently saying they cannot afford repayments or are spending more than they expected. Citizens Advice said firms must overhaul their checkout processes and improve affordability checks. Both the Financial Ombudsman Service and Financial Conduct Authority had a greater role to play in the protection of consumers and regulation of the industry, it said. Alistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""Buy Now Pay Later borrowing can be like quicksand - easy to unwittingly slip into and much more difficult to get out of. ""It shouldn't be possible for people to sign up for credit without realising, and the fact this is happening so often signals that a drastic overhaul is needed. ""This industry more than trebled in 2020, and while these products work for many shoppers, the regulator has rightly recognised the potential for harm. It must ensure robust consumer protection keeps pace with changes in how we shop,"" Mr Cromwell said. Several big - and smaller - names now operate in the fast-growing BNPL market, including Klarna, Clearpay, and Laybuy. PayPal launched a BNPL service last year. However, firms stress that not all operate to the same standards. Alex Marsh, UK head of the one of the most popular BNPL firms, Klarna, said: ""There is now a variety of buy now pay later providers in the market and the findings in this report do not represent the experiences of the more than 12 million consumers who choose to use Klarna's interest free, fee-free services each year. ""We make it crystal clear for our consumers at check out that this is a credit product, we perform a credit check each time they use our service, and we are available 24/7 to support the small number of customers who unfortunately find themselves in difficulty."" Another firm, Openpay, said it had strict rules to protect consumers. Andy Harding, the firm's UK managing director of payments said: ""Openpay has never run a marketing campaign specifically targeting young people and Openpay is never the default payment option at checkout - a practice that can lead to people using BNPL services unwittingly."" He added that Openpay has a financial hardship policy in place for any customers experiencing financial difficulty, including as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
