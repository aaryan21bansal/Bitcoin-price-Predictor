Cryptocurrency heist hacker returns $260m in funds,"The hacker behind one of the largest cryptocurrency heists to date has returned almost half of the $600m (Â£433m) stolen assets. On Tuesday, the firm affected, Poly Networkwrote a letter on Twitter, asking the individual to get in touch ""to work out a solution"". The hacker then posted messages pledging to return funds, claiming to be ""not very interested in money"". On Wednesday, Poly Network said it had received $260m back. The company, a blockchain platform which lets users swap different types of digital tokens,posted on Twitter,externalthat it had been sent back three cryptocurrencies, including $3.3m worth of Ethereum, $256m worth of Binance Coin and $1m worth of Polygon. A total of $269m in Ether tokens and $84m in Polygon tokens has yet to be recovered. A blockchain is a ledger, or log, of every single transaction made of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. The ledger is distributed to all the users in the network to verify all new transactions when they occur, instead of being held by any one single authority. The hackerpublished a three-page-long Q&A session,externalon one of the blockchains essentially in the form of a self-interview, according to Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, a London-based blockchain analytics and compliance firm. The hacker claimed to have always planned to return the tokens and said the heist was carried out to highlight vulnerabilities in Poly Network software. ""I know it hurts when people are attacked, but shouldn't they learn something from those hacks?"" the hacker wrote in the notes embedded on the Ethereum blockchain. The technology underpining all crypto-currencies is blockchain - a distributed log of every single transaction made of a digital currency, that is sent to all users on the network The hacker claimed to have spent all night looking for a vulnerability to exploit. They said they were worried that Poly Network would patch the security flaw quietly without telling anyone, so they decided to take millions of dollars in cryptocurrency tokens to make a point. But they stressed that they did not want to cause a ""real panic [in] the crypto-world"", so they only took ""important coins"", leaving behind Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started off as a joke. Hackers steal $600m in major cryptocurrency heist Hacker returns $25m in âstolenâ crypto-currencies ""Either they just intended to commit theft and steal the assets, or they were acting like a white hat hacker to expose a bug, to help Poly Network make themselves more strong and secure,"" Mr Robinson, who routinely advises governments and law enforcement agencies about crypto-related crimes, told the BBC. He added that the nature of blockchain technology makes it hard for cyber-criminals to profit from stealing digital currencies, because everyone can see the money being moved across the network into the hackers' wallets. ""I wonder whether this hacker stole the funds, realised how much publicity and attention they were getting, realised wherever they moved the funds they would be watched, and decided to give it back,"" said Mr Robinson. ""The blockchain itself has operated here flawlessly, but the problem is on blockchains like Ethereum, you can write your own smart contracts. Various services have started offering this, including Poly Network. ""So whenever a human being writes code, there's a chance they will make a mistake."" Despite the volatility in prices and frequent news of cryptocurrency heists, more and more young people are buying and selling crypto-currencies online Poly Network's platform works by facilitating movement between several blockchains when people trade one cryptocurrency for another, such as trading Binance Coin for Ether. ""The Poly Network is the thing that facilitates the movement between these chains - ultimately, it's software, it's code, and code always has imperfections and defects in it,"" James Chappell, co-founder of London-based cyber-security firm Digital Shadows, told the BBC. ""And that's true of banks, or any financial system. Unfortunately, what seems to have happened here is a party has spotted a weakness in the implementation and exploited it to fool the network into transferring these tokens incorrectly."" Similar attacks have happened to several other services in the last 12 months. These include: Yearn Finance, which had $11m stolen by hackers in February; Alpha Finance, which had $37m stolen in the same month; and Meerkat Finance, which was drained of $32m by hackers in March. After a rollercoaster 24 hours for the crypto community, it seems the hacker intends to return all or most of the stolen money. As the criminal posted online: ""The pain suffered is temporary, but memorable."" The claim that it was all an elaborate way to force Poly Network to fix security failings is being treated with scepticism. Why the taunting and boasting online if the motive was honourable? There's some suggestion that the net may have been closing in, asone cyber-security company says,externalit was close to working out the identity of a suspect. It might have been the case that the hacker bit off way more than they could chew and got scared, so returned the money. Regardless, the authorities will still no doubt be working hard to find them. But what this story mostly points to is just how powerful hackers can be and how powerless the unregulated, decentralised cryptocurrency world is when someone swipes a large fortune from under its nose.

'Draconian' regatta dress code for women dropped,"Previously women could not wear trousers in the Steward's Enclosure at the Henley Royal Regatta Women can now wear trousers at the Henley Royal Regatta everywhere after it changed its ""draconian"" dress code. Previously women could only wear a dress or skirt with a hemline below the knee to gain access to the Steward's Enclosure at the annual event in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. For the first time in decades women can now wear trousers and trouser suits. Regatta chairman Sir Steve Redgrave said organisers believed women should wear trousers if they wished to. The five-time Olympic champion said the dress code at the Steward's Enclosure was only adopted in the late 1970s. ""We felt with the introduction of all the new events for females, if they would like to wear trousers, they should be allowed to wear trousers,"" said Sir Steve. ""Within investitures they now allow trousers as well, so we've eased our dress code for that same sort of reason."" The event takes place annually in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire It comes after a petition last year by University of Oxford rower Georgia Grant who called the dress code ""draconian"". Ms Grant said: ""It's quite a small change, but I think for them to sort of concede on it and change something which has existed for years, that's a huge step and it made me feel quite excited about attending the event."" She added her petition had led to transgender and disabled attendees sharing their struggles over their difficulty choosing what to wear, and that the next step should be ""de-gendering"" the dress requirements. The Steward's Enclosure is only open to stewards who organise the regatta, members - who can reportedly wait years to be given membership - and their guests. It is described by one rowing website as the ""equivalent of the Royal Enclosure at Ascot"", and has the best view of the finish line. Men are required to wear lounge suits, or jackets, or blazers with trousers, together with a tie or a cravat. Spectators Izzie Mayhew-Smith and Lucy O'Neill said they were pleased with the change Izzie Mayhew-Smith, who was wearing trousers to the Steward's Enclosure, said: ""It was a lot easier to find something to wear in my wardrobe, and I think it's good because men can wear trousers so we should be able to as well. ""The regatta becoming more modernised will maybe encourage more people to come and it's not just something for older people that's old fashioned."" Lucy O'Neill added: ""Trousers are just more comfortable personally and it's easier to walk around and sit down, so I've enjoyed wearing my trousers today."" In previous years women could only wear trousers in the Regatta Enclosure - which did not have a formal dress code. A trouser ban remains for women at some private member clubs alongside the river where spectators can view the regatta. The annual five-day event, which is taking place from 11-15 August, has resumed after it wascancelled last year for the first time in its historyoutside of the World Wars due to Covid-19. Henley Royal Regatta sees rowers battle it out on the River Thames over five days of racing, attracting huge crowds. It was first staged in 1839 and attracts participants ranging from Olympians, university and school teams, to amateur clubs.

GCSE pupils set for record grades after exams axed,"Sharing the exam news at Ark Burlington Danes Academy in west London GCSE students have received another set of record grades, in the second year of Covid disruption to exams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Top grades (7/As and above) rose to 28.9% from 26.2% last year, while grades 4/Cs and above  - seen as passes - rose to 77.1% up from 76.3%. This is a smaller rise than last year, the first time exams were cancelled and teacher assessed grades were used. Exams regulators have insisted the process has been fair and thorough. Teachers submitted grades for the more than half a million pupils on GCSE courses this year, using evidence such as mock exams, course work and tests. There were more top GCSE grades, but the increase was not as sharp as at A-level Girls moved further ahead of boys - 33.4% of girls' results grade 7/A, 24.4% for boys Northern Ireland had highest grades In England, independent schools had biggest increase in top grades -  61.2% of results at grade 7/A, compared with 26.1% in comprehensives, 28.1% in academies Pupils eligible for free school meals slipped slightly further behind London had most top grades in England, north east the least 3,606 pupils got all grade 9s Olympic twins celebrate grades success GCSEs 2021: The big divides becoming even wider There are different devolved systems for GCSEs: English exam boards use a numeric 1-9 for grades Wales uses alphabetic A to G grading system pupils in Northern Ireland take a combination of both How does the GCSE grading system work? The two years of replacement grades, after exams were cancelled in the pandemic, have had significantly higher results, for GCSEs and A-levels. Exam officials say it reflects that no one has had a bad day in an exam and that pupils had multiple chances to show their best potential. England's exam watchdog Ofqual said the system was fair, each centre had its assessment policy reviewed and samples of work were checked during a ""quality assurance"" process. Exam boards say that below 1% of grades were changed in the checking process. Opening exam results in Core's city academy in Birmingham As well as getting GCSEs, more than half a million vocational qualifications were also issued, including for 230,000 BTec students. Record top GCSE grades in Northern Ireland Wales has another year of rising GCSE grades A-levels have record top grades BBC Bitesize guide to GCSE results day Examageddon: BBC podcast on how exams felt for parents Schools Minister Nick Gibb defended the way GCSE results had been awarded, saying this had been a ""very different year"" and it was right that exams were cancelled. ""This was the best alternative to exams,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""I think people can be confident of the grades that have been awarded this year."" Mr Gibb said longer term, he wanted to get back to a pre-pandemic system where there are no ""significant changes"" year-on-year in the grades awarded to students. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said the exam results were a ""stark warning"" of a widening social divide. This video can not be played GCSE results day: ""It's amazing, I can't believe it"" ""Children on free school meals have been abandoned by this government and students in state schools are again being outstripped by their more advantaged private school peers,"" she said. Jon Andrews of the Education Policy Institute think tank warned the higher results should not ""distract us from the huge learning losses that students have faced"". This video can not be played Schools minister: ""People can be confident of the grades awarded"" ""There is a risk that higher grades awarded to young people conceal the underlying losses that they have experienced from the pandemic."" Prof Alan Smithers, of the Centre of Education and Employment Research, at Buckingham University, said it would be difficult for the government to reverse the trend of increasing grades over the coming years - as the higher grades are popular with parents and schools. ""It will be quite a task for the government to put the genie back into the bottle,"" he said. This video can not be played It is ""pretty astonishing"" that the education secretary is still in his job, says the Labour leader. But head teachers say the replacement grades used this year will allow pupils to progress to the next stage of their education. National Association of Head Teachers leader Paul Whiteman said it was important that these pupils have access to any additional academic or pastoral support they need as they progress into the next stage of their education. Geoff Barton, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""It is important to focus on the achievements of this cohort rather than fixate on comparisons with other years, which are somewhat meaningless."" Syeda in Dagenham got all grade 9s in her GCSE results Syeda had been hoping for high grades after sitting 62 assessments, instead of the usual exams, at Sydney Russell School in Dagenham, east London. And her hopes have been realised. ""I did it. I got all 9s in my GCSEs and two distinctions,"" she said. ""It's the best possible results and I'm so proud of myself. I think there is a big sense of relief."" Her mum, Shahima came to the school with her to share the experience. She says: ""I'm extremely, extremely proud of Syeda. She's put so much effort and hard work into this and lots of sleepless nights."" ""It has been a bit crazy for everyone involved in this process this year,"" she says. Roman says he would have preferred the regular exam system Roman is celebrating four grade 7s and four grade 8s in his GCSEs. ""I'm definitely satisfied, but in a sense I feel I've been bumped down a few grades due to some exams being very different and out of the ordinary this year compared to other years."" He says the challenges he's faced over the past two years have had an impact. ""It's been a rollercoaster. So many ups and downs and so many battles, both mental battles and physical ones."" He says he would actually have preferred to sit exams as he feels one exam at the end would have been easier than the constant pressure of lots of tests. ""I don't think anyone could have ever imagined stuff like this,"" she says ""But the fact is that we have got through it - and hopefully our results tomorrow will prove that we have worked hard."" To those people who criticise the value of this year's grades, Syeda says: ""I would tell them they should try and be in our place."" ""I don't think anyone can know what it is like unless you are experiencing it yourself."" She is aiming to sit A-levels next year and study English literature at the University of Cambridge.

Weight Watchers shares dive as people pause diets,"Oprah Winfrey onstage during her 2020 Vision tour, sponsored by Weight Watchers International Shares in WW International, formerly known as Weight Watchers, have dived 25% after the firm said people were putting diets on hold after lockdown. The weight loss firm, which is backed by talk show host Oprah Winfrey, had 4.9 million subscribers at the end of June, down from 5 million last year. Boss Mindy Grossman said part of this was a seasonal effect. But she also said people are less worried about what they eat as they venture out of their homes again. ""While people are acknowledging their need for recommitting to weight loss and wellness, our recent consumer research shows that, at the moment, they're also asking for a pause to enjoy social reconnection,"" said Ms Grossman. ""With both traffic and search under pressure, this sentiment shift appears to be across the weight loss and wellness category."" What's gone wrong at Weight Watchers? Weight Watchers drops 'weight' from name Like other dieting companies, WW benefited during the pandemic as consumers stuck at home decided to get back into shape. Many people had put on weight as they stopped commuting to work and increasingly turned to food and alcohol to manage stress. However, in the three months to 30 June, subscriber numbers fell or were flat in all its key markets, including North America, the UK and the rest of Europe. Sales of its branded products slipped 6.9%. Founded in 1963 in New York City, WW International provides a weight-management programme and food plan to subscribers. It also makes money out of branded goods and services such as magazines and snacks and drinks. Its high profile ambassadors include actress Kate Hudson, comedian James Corden, and Ms Winfrey, who bought a 10% stake in the company in 2015 and is a member of its board.

Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for power,"Taliban fighters in Balkh and elsewhere have made a rapid advance in recent weeks The Taliban fighters we meet are stationed just 30 minutes from one of Afghanistan's largest cities, Mazar-i-Sharif. The ""ghanimat"" or spoils of war they're showing off include a Humvee, two pick-up vans and a host of powerful machine guns. Ainuddin, a stony-faced former madrassa (religious school) student who's now a local military commander, stands at the centre of a heavily-armed crowd. The insurgents have been capturing new territory on what seems like a daily basis as international troops have all but withdrawn. Caught in the middle is a terrified population. Tens of thousands of ordinary Afghans have had to flee their homes - hundreds have been killed or injured in recent weeks. The displaced people hoping for safety in Kabul I ask Ainuddin how he can justify the violence, given the pain it's inflicting on the people he claims to be fighting on behalf of? ""It's fighting, so people are dying,"" he replies coolly, adding that the group is trying its best ""not to harm civilians"". The Taliban fighters showed off the Humvee they had captured I point out that the Taliban are the ones who have started the fighting. ""No,"" he retorts. ""We had a government and it was overthrown. They [the Americans] started the fighting."" Ainuddin and the rest of the Taliban feel momentum is with them, and that they are on the cusp of returning to dominance after being toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001. ""They are not giving up Western cultureâ¦ so we have to kill them,"" he says of the ""puppet government"" in Kabul. Shortly after we finish speaking we hear the sound of helicopters above us. The Humvee and the Taliban fighters quickly disperse. It's a reminder of the continuing threat the Afghan air force poses to the insurgents, and that the battle is still far from over. We're in Balkh, a town with ancient roots, thought to be the birthplace of one of Islam's most famous mystic poets, Jalaluddin Rumi. We passed through here earlier this year, when it was still controlled by the government, but the outlying villages were held by the Taliban. Now it's one of around 200 district centres to have been captured by the militants in this latest, unprecedented offensive. A member of a Taliban ""red unit"" or special forces (kneeling, bottom left) poses with other Taliban in Balkh One senior Taliban official said the focus in the north had been deliberate - not only because the region has traditionally seen strong anti-Taliban resistance, but also because it is more diverse. Despite its core leadership being heavily dominated by members of the Pashtun majority, the official said the Taliban wanted to emphasise they incorporated other ethnicities too. Haji Hekmat, a local Taliban leader and our host in Balkh, is keen to show us how daily life is still continuing. Young schoolgirls throng the streets (though elsewhere there are reports of girls being banned from attending). The bazaar remains crowded, with both male and female shoppers. We had been told by local sources that women were allowed to attend only with a male companion, but when we visit that does not seem to be the case. Elsewhere Taliban commanders have reportedly been far stricter. All the women we see, however, are wearing the all-encompassing burqa, covering both their hair and face. Haji Hekmat insists no-one is being ""forced"" and that the Taliban are simply ""preaching"" that this is how women should dress. This young girl had her face uncovered in the bazaar - but older female shoppers wore burqas But I've been told taxi drivers have been given instructions not to drive any woman into the town unless she's fully veiled. The day after we leave, reports emerge of a young woman being murdered because of her clothing. Haji Hekmat, though, rejects allegations Taliban members were responsible. Many in the bazaar express their support for the group and their gratitude towards them for improving security. But with Taliban fighters accompanying us at all times, it's difficult to know what residents really think. The group's hardline views are at times in tune with more conservative Afghans, but the Taliban are now pushing for control of a number of larger cities. EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? IN MAPS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:An al-Qaeda resurgence? In the shadow of Mazar-e-Sharif's intricately tiled Blue Mosque, men and women strolled around last week in a visibly more relaxed social atmosphere. Residents the BBC spoke to in nearby Mazar-i-Sharif were fearful of the Taliban resurgence The government are still in control in the city and almost everyone I spoke to expressed concern about what the Taliban's resurgence will mean, particularly for the ""freedoms"" younger generations have grown up with. But back in Balkh district the Taliban are formalising their own rival government. They've taken over all the official buildings in the town, bar one large, now abandoned police compound. It used to be the headquarters of a bitter rival, the local police chief, and was partly destroyed in a suicide bombing by the militants as they fought for control of the area. The face of the Taliban's district governor, Abdullah Manzoor, lights up with a broad grin when he talks about the operation, whilst his men chuckle. The fight here, as in so many places in Afghanistan, is deeply personal as well as ideological. Some things haven't changed since the Taliban takeover; orange-clad street cleaners are still reporting for work, as are some bureaucrats. They're overseen by a newly appointed Taliban mayor, seated at a broad wooden desk, with a small white flag of the ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"" positioned in one corner. The Taliban mayor in Balkh says business rates have gone down since the group took over the area He used to be in charge of ammunition supplies, now it's taxes - and he tells me proudly the group charges business owners less than the government used to. The transition from military to civilian life is a work in progress, though. A Taliban fighter still grasping his gun, who moves to pose behind the mayor during our interview, is ushered away by more senior figures. In other places, however, the insurgents' hardline interpretation of Islamic scripture is more visible. At the local radio station, they used to play a mixture of Islamic music and general popular hits. Now it's only religious chants. Haji Hekmat says they banned music promoting ""vulgarity"" from being played in public, but insists individuals can still listen to what they want. I've been told, however, of a local man being caught listening to music in the bazaar. To punish him, Taliban fighters are said to have made him walk barefoot in the baking sun, until he lost consciousness. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. Haji Hekmat insists no such thing happened. As we leave the station, he gestures to some of the young men working there, pointing out they don't have beards. ""See! We're not forcing anyone,"" he says, grinning. It's clear the group do want to portray a softer image to the world. But in other parts of the country the Taliban are reported to be behaving much more strictly. The differences may depend on the attitudes of local commanders. With reports of extra-judicial revenge killings and other human rights abuses in some of the areas they've captured, the Taliban have been warned by Western officials they risk turning the country into a pariah state if they try to seize it by force. What many associate most closely with the Taliban's previous stint in power, is the brutal punishments meted out under their interpretation of Sharia law. Last month in the southern province of Helmand, the group hanged two men accused of child kidnapping from a bridge, justifying it by saying the men had been convicted. In Balkh, on the day we visit a Taliban court session, all the cases are related to land disputes. Whilst many fear their form of justice, for others it at least offers the possibility of a quicker resolution than the notoriously corrupt government system. ""I've had to pay so many bribes,"" complains one of the litigants as he discusses his previous attempts to resolve the case. The Taliban judge, Haji Badruddin, says he's not yet ordered any corporal punishment in the four months he's been in office, and emphasises the group has a system of appeal courts to review serious verdicts. But he defends even the harshest penalties. ""In our Sharia it's clear, for those who have sex and are unmarried, whether it's a girl or a boy, the punishment is 100 lashes in public. ""But for anyone who's married, they have to be stoned to deathâ¦ For those who steal: if it's proved, then his hand should be cut off."" He pushes back against criticism of the punishments as incompatible with the modern world. ""People's children are being kidnapped. Is that better? Or is it better that one person's hand is chopped off and stability is brought in the community?"" â¯For now, despite the Taliban's rapid advance, the government remains in control of Afghanistan's biggest cities. The coming months are likely to see protracted and increasingly deadly violence as the two sides wrestle for control. I ask Haji Hekmat if he's sure the Taliban can win militarily? ""Yes,"" he replies. ""If peace talks are not successful, we will win, God willing."" Those talks however, have stalled, and the Taliban's repeated demand for the creation of an ""Islamic government"" appears tantamount to a call for their opponents to surrender. ""We have defeated both the foreigners,"" says Haji Hekmat, ""and now our internal enemies."" Afghan army chief replaced as Taliban advance Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan?

"Fleeing the Taliban, to sleep on streets","Humanitarian organisations warn that women and children will be badly affected With violence surging in Afghanistan, and the Taliban taking new territories in the north, thousands of people are fleeing their homes to seek safety in the capital Kabul. When they get there, many of these people face sleeping in abandoned warehouses or on the streets. They're struggling to find food, shelter and other basic necessities, such as medicine and sanitary items. But they feel they have little choice - it is either hardship in Kabul, or potential death in their home region. Now, thousands have gathered in makeshift camps on scrubland on the city's outskirts. Asadullah, a 35-year-old street vendor from Kunduz province, travelled to the capital with his wife and two young daughters earlier this week after the Taliban set fire to his home. ""I was a street worker, I sold food and spices... but when the Taliban attacked we came to Kabul,"" he tells the BBC. ""Now we have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child."" Asadullah was a street worker in Kunduz province, selling food and spices Asadullah, his two daughters (pictured) and wife slept on the streets after arriving in Kabul Asadullah and his young family spent the night on the streets. ""All of our home and belongings caught fire, so we came to Kabul and pray to God to help us. Rockets and mortars hit our home... there were heavy clashes in the past seven days, we had no bread to eat and all the bakeries, shops and bazaars were closed."" A woman, who didn't give her name, told the BBC she fled her home in the northern city of Pul-e-Khumri with her husband and children. Her husband, she says, was wounded in the war. ""We had a good life, but because of the bomb blasts we lost our home and came here,"" she says. ""We left our home with only one dress and no money."" This woman said her family had a good life in Pul-e-Khumri, but they've now lost everything Humanitarian organisations have been warning of a rise in internally displaced persons in Afghanistan since US-led forces began withdrawing from the country earlier this year, following 20 years of military operations. The campaign began in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks on American soil. Now, most of the foreign troops have pulled out. Since then, clashes between the Taliban and government forces have escalated. The Taliban have taken at least eight of the country's 34 provincial capitals, and are threatening to seize more. The Washington Post has also cited unnamed US officials saying that even Kabul could fall to the Taliban within the next 90 days, based on US military assessments. This unrest has caused a rise in people fleeing their homes for the capital. In July the UN warned that around 270,000 more people were internally displaced in the country after troops started to leave - this number is estimated to have surged in just the last few days. Amid all of this more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, according to the UN. Thousands of people are camped in scrubland on the outskirts of Kabul NGOs say that this mass displacement will hit women and children particularly hard. ""We're seeing a lot of increased reporting around health protection needs, gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse and trafficking,"" Jared Rowell, Country Director of the Danish Refugee Council in Afghanistan, tells the BBC. ""Early marriage will become a larger problem too as girls and young women are sold off in order to get cash to provide for their families. Those types of issues, which have always been a problem, are going to get more and more severe."" EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? As well as food, shelter and health and sanitary items, Mr Rowell says, displaced people in Kabul are in desperate need of cash. ""It's really important people have access to multi-purpose cash,"" he says. ""Meaning an agency like DRC would give them a cash distribution that they have the autonomy to determine what they spend that money on in order to best support their needs. ""Cash is also particularly important at this point in time, especially when they're relocating to a large city like Kabul with high food prices and markets with fluctuating prices due to the current instability."" For Asadullah, his main hope now is that his family can one day return to their normal life in Kunduz. ""We want to go back and continue our lives there,"" he says. ""We hope that one day peace will come to Afghanistan, and our country will be free."" Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan? How the Taliban swept across Afghanistan Who are the Taliban?

Why is there a war in Afghanistan?,"Fighting has been going on for 40 years - most Afghans can't remember a time of peace After 20 years of war, the Taliban has swept to victory in Afghanistan. The group completedtheir shockingly rapid advance across the countryby capturing Kabul on 15 August. It came after foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban, two decades after US forces removed the militants from power in 2001. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions. Taliban forces have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West. But questions are already being asked about how the group will govern the country, and what their rule means for women, human rights, and political freedoms. Back in 2001, the US was responding tothe 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. Officials identified Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, and its leader Osama Bin Laden, as responsible. Bin Laden was in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamists who had been in power since 1996. When they refused to hand him over, the US intervened militarily, quickly removing the Taliban and vowing to support democracy and eliminate the terrorist threat. The Afghan conflict became America's longest war The militants slipped away and later regrouped. Nato allies had joined the US and a new Afghan government took over in 2004 but deadly Taliban attacks continued. President Barack Obama's ""troop surge"" in 2009 helped push back the Taliban but it was not long term. In 2014, at the end of what was the bloodiest year since 2001, Nato's international forces ended their combat mission, leaving responsibility for security to the Afghan army. That gave the Taliban momentum and they seized more territory. Peace talks between the US and the Taliban started tentatively, with the Afghan government pretty much uninvolved, and the agreement on a withdrawal came in February 2020 in Qatar. The US-Taliban deal did not stop the Taliban attacks - they switched their focus instead to Afghan security forces and civilians, and targeted assassinations. Their areas of control grew. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan.

Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults.

Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. They emerged in the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, predominantly in the south-west and the Pakistan border areas. This video can not be played Full interview: Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen speaks to the BBC's Yalda Hakim They vowed to fight corruption and improve security, but also followed an austere form of Islam. By 1998, they had taken control of almost all of the country. What has the conflict cost the US? In numbers: Life in Afghanistan as US leaves Who's who in the Taliban leadership When the BBC visited the Taliban They enforced their own hardline version of Sharia, or Islamic law, and introduced brutal punishments. Men were made to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka. TV, music and cinema were banned. After their overthrow they regrouped in Pakistani border areas. In terms of lives lost, it is obviously not easy to say exactly. The number of coalition casualties is much better recorded than Taliban and Afghan civilians. Research by Brown University estimates losses in the Afghan security forces at 69,000. It puts the number of civilians and militants killed at about 51,000 each. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers have died since 2001 - about two-thirds of them Americans. More than 20,000 US soldiers have been injured. According to the UN, Afghanistan has the third-largest displaced population in the world. Since 2012, some five million people have fled and not been able to return home, either displaced within Afghanistan or taking refuge in neighbouring countries. Brown University research also puts the US spending on the conflict - including military and reconstruction funds in both Afghanistan and Pakistan - at $978bn (Â£706bn) up to 2020. How the Taliban plan to govern Afghanistan remains unclear. Women face an uncertain future. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen says the group will respect the rights of women and minorities ""as per Afghan norms and Islamic values"". The militants had declared an amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government. But there are fears over women's freedom to work, to dress as they choose, or even to leave home alone under Taliban rule. During the 1990s the Taliban forced women to dress in certain ways and denied them equal rights Another major fear is that the country will once again become a training ground for terrorism. Taliban officials insist that they will fully adhere to the US deal and prevent any group from using Afghan soil as a base for attacks against the US and its allies. They say they aim only to implement an ""Islamic government"" and will not pose a threat to any other country. But many analysts say the Taliban and al-Qaeda are inseparable, with the latter's fighters heavily embedded and engaged in training activity. It is also important to remember that the Taliban are not a centralised and unified force. Some leaders may want to keep the West muted by not stirring up trouble but hardliners may be reluctant to break links with al-Qaeda. Just how powerful al-Qaeda is and whether it could now rebuild its global network is also unclear. Then there is the regional branch of the Islamic State group - ISKP (Khorasan Province) - which the Taliban oppose. Like al-Qaeda, ISKP has been degraded by the US and Nato but could use the post-withdrawal period to regroup. Its fighter numbers could be only between a few hundred and 2,000 but it may try to gain footholds in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and parts of Tajikistan, which could be a serious regional concern.

"Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for powerAfghanistan's ex-rulers still back brutal punishments, the BBC finds as it goes behind Taliban lines.Asia","Taliban fighters in Balkh and elsewhere have made a rapid advance in recent weeks The Taliban fighters we meet are stationed just 30 minutes from one of Afghanistan's largest cities, Mazar-i-Sharif. The ""ghanimat"" or spoils of war they're showing off include a Humvee, two pick-up vans and a host of powerful machine guns. Ainuddin, a stony-faced former madrassa (religious school) student who's now a local military commander, stands at the centre of a heavily-armed crowd. The insurgents have been capturing new territory on what seems like a daily basis as international troops have all but withdrawn. Caught in the middle is a terrified population. Tens of thousands of ordinary Afghans have had to flee their homes - hundreds have been killed or injured in recent weeks. The displaced people hoping for safety in Kabul I ask Ainuddin how he can justify the violence, given the pain it's inflicting on the people he claims to be fighting on behalf of? ""It's fighting, so people are dying,"" he replies coolly, adding that the group is trying its best ""not to harm civilians"". The Taliban fighters showed off the Humvee they had captured I point out that the Taliban are the ones who have started the fighting. ""No,"" he retorts. ""We had a government and it was overthrown. They [the Americans] started the fighting."" Ainuddin and the rest of the Taliban feel momentum is with them, and that they are on the cusp of returning to dominance after being toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001. ""They are not giving up Western cultureâ¦ so we have to kill them,"" he says of the ""puppet government"" in Kabul. Shortly after we finish speaking we hear the sound of helicopters above us. The Humvee and the Taliban fighters quickly disperse. It's a reminder of the continuing threat the Afghan air force poses to the insurgents, and that the battle is still far from over. We're in Balkh, a town with ancient roots, thought to be the birthplace of one of Islam's most famous mystic poets, Jalaluddin Rumi. We passed through here earlier this year, when it was still controlled by the government, but the outlying villages were held by the Taliban. Now it's one of around 200 district centres to have been captured by the militants in this latest, unprecedented offensive. A member of a Taliban ""red unit"" or special forces (kneeling, bottom left) poses with other Taliban in Balkh One senior Taliban official said the focus in the north had been deliberate - not only because the region has traditionally seen strong anti-Taliban resistance, but also because it is more diverse. Despite its core leadership being heavily dominated by members of the Pashtun majority, the official said the Taliban wanted to emphasise they incorporated other ethnicities too. Haji Hekmat, a local Taliban leader and our host in Balkh, is keen to show us how daily life is still continuing. Young schoolgirls throng the streets (though elsewhere there are reports of girls being banned from attending). The bazaar remains crowded, with both male and female shoppers. We had been told by local sources that women were allowed to attend only with a male companion, but when we visit that does not seem to be the case. Elsewhere Taliban commanders have reportedly been far stricter. All the women we see, however, are wearing the all-encompassing burqa, covering both their hair and face. Haji Hekmat insists no-one is being ""forced"" and that the Taliban are simply ""preaching"" that this is how women should dress. This young girl had her face uncovered in the bazaar - but older female shoppers wore burqas But I've been told taxi drivers have been given instructions not to drive any woman into the town unless she's fully veiled. The day after we leave, reports emerge of a young woman being murdered because of her clothing. Haji Hekmat, though, rejects allegations Taliban members were responsible. Many in the bazaar express their support for the group and their gratitude towards them for improving security. But with Taliban fighters accompanying us at all times, it's difficult to know what residents really think. The group's hardline views are at times in tune with more conservative Afghans, but the Taliban are now pushing for control of a number of larger cities. EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? IN MAPS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:An al-Qaeda resurgence? In the shadow of Mazar-e-Sharif's intricately tiled Blue Mosque, men and women strolled around last week in a visibly more relaxed social atmosphere. Residents the BBC spoke to in nearby Mazar-i-Sharif were fearful of the Taliban resurgence The government are still in control in the city and almost everyone I spoke to expressed concern about what the Taliban's resurgence will mean, particularly for the ""freedoms"" younger generations have grown up with. But back in Balkh district the Taliban are formalising their own rival government. They've taken over all the official buildings in the town, bar one large, now abandoned police compound. It used to be the headquarters of a bitter rival, the local police chief, and was partly destroyed in a suicide bombing by the militants as they fought for control of the area. The face of the Taliban's district governor, Abdullah Manzoor, lights up with a broad grin when he talks about the operation, whilst his men chuckle. The fight here, as in so many places in Afghanistan, is deeply personal as well as ideological. Some things haven't changed since the Taliban takeover; orange-clad street cleaners are still reporting for work, as are some bureaucrats. They're overseen by a newly appointed Taliban mayor, seated at a broad wooden desk, with a small white flag of the ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"" positioned in one corner. The Taliban mayor in Balkh says business rates have gone down since the group took over the area He used to be in charge of ammunition supplies, now it's taxes - and he tells me proudly the group charges business owners less than the government used to. The transition from military to civilian life is a work in progress, though. A Taliban fighter still grasping his gun, who moves to pose behind the mayor during our interview, is ushered away by more senior figures. In other places, however, the insurgents' hardline interpretation of Islamic scripture is more visible. At the local radio station, they used to play a mixture of Islamic music and general popular hits. Now it's only religious chants. Haji Hekmat says they banned music promoting ""vulgarity"" from being played in public, but insists individuals can still listen to what they want. I've been told, however, of a local man being caught listening to music in the bazaar. To punish him, Taliban fighters are said to have made him walk barefoot in the baking sun, until he lost consciousness. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. Haji Hekmat insists no such thing happened. As we leave the station, he gestures to some of the young men working there, pointing out they don't have beards. ""See! We're not forcing anyone,"" he says, grinning. It's clear the group do want to portray a softer image to the world. But in other parts of the country the Taliban are reported to be behaving much more strictly. The differences may depend on the attitudes of local commanders. With reports of extra-judicial revenge killings and other human rights abuses in some of the areas they've captured, the Taliban have been warned by Western officials they risk turning the country into a pariah state if they try to seize it by force. What many associate most closely with the Taliban's previous stint in power, is the brutal punishments meted out under their interpretation of Sharia law. Last month in the southern province of Helmand, the group hanged two men accused of child kidnapping from a bridge, justifying it by saying the men had been convicted. In Balkh, on the day we visit a Taliban court session, all the cases are related to land disputes. Whilst many fear their form of justice, for others it at least offers the possibility of a quicker resolution than the notoriously corrupt government system. ""I've had to pay so many bribes,"" complains one of the litigants as he discusses his previous attempts to resolve the case. The Taliban judge, Haji Badruddin, says he's not yet ordered any corporal punishment in the four months he's been in office, and emphasises the group has a system of appeal courts to review serious verdicts. But he defends even the harshest penalties. ""In our Sharia it's clear, for those who have sex and are unmarried, whether it's a girl or a boy, the punishment is 100 lashes in public. ""But for anyone who's married, they have to be stoned to deathâ¦ For those who steal: if it's proved, then his hand should be cut off."" He pushes back against criticism of the punishments as incompatible with the modern world. ""People's children are being kidnapped. Is that better? Or is it better that one person's hand is chopped off and stability is brought in the community?"" â¯For now, despite the Taliban's rapid advance, the government remains in control of Afghanistan's biggest cities. The coming months are likely to see protracted and increasingly deadly violence as the two sides wrestle for control. I ask Haji Hekmat if he's sure the Taliban can win militarily? ""Yes,"" he replies. ""If peace talks are not successful, we will win, God willing."" Those talks however, have stalled, and the Taliban's repeated demand for the creation of an ""Islamic government"" appears tantamount to a call for their opponents to surrender. ""We have defeated both the foreigners,"" says Haji Hekmat, ""and now our internal enemies."" Afghan army chief replaced as Taliban advance Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan?

TV and radio restored for some after mast fire,"The 1,032ft (315m) tall mast, seen here in three different images, caught fire on Tuesday TV and radio services have been restored in some Teesside homes after being disrupted by a mast fire. The blaze at theBilsdale mast on Tuesdayimpacted Freeview, DAB and FM radio signals across North Yorkshire, Teesside and County Durham. However, after a blackout of more than 24 hours, BBC TV channels for somehouseholds in Hartlepool, Redcar and Middlesbrough are back on. BBC Tees FM is also back on air for some areas. Mast operators, Arqiva, said it had managed to restore TV and radio services for hundreds of thousands of people. A spokesman said,external: ""We are assessing all options open to us but the process is a gradual one. ""We apologise for the inconvenience but ask that you bear with us as our teams work hard to deliver solutions for as many people as possible as quickly and safely as we can."" The fire has disrupted Freeview, FM and DAB services North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said on Wednesday a 300m cordon around the site would remain in place until the operator could ""confirm that the tower is structurally secure"". A spokesperson added: ""When the site is safe, we will return for a closer examination. This will allow us to positively confirm that the fire has been extinguished and to begin the process of investigating the cause of the fire. ""At this time there is nothing to suggest that the first is the result of any criminal activity but this cannot be confirmed until a closer examination has been carried out."" The transmitter mast can be seen for miles around A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire Police previously said Airwave, the radio service used by all the emergency services, had not been affected by the mast fire. The 1,032ft (315m) tall tower was built in 1969 and provides coverage for 500,000 homes across northern England, from Tadcaster to Seaham. Arqiva said about 200,000 of those use Freeview as their main TV platform. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

Woman gives partner 'gift of life' kidney donation,"Vicky Compton offered to donate one of her kidneys to boyfriend Eddie Huntley after finding out they were a match A man whose girlfriend donated one of her kidneys to him says she has given him the ""gift of life"". For the past year Eddie Huntley had been undergoing dialysis three times a week and was in need of a transplant. But after tests showed his girlfriend Vicky Compton was a match, she offered to step in. The couple, who met in Scarborough about seven years ago before moving to Sheffield, say they are both doing well and looking forward to the future. Before the transplant, Mr Huntley was having dialysis three times a week Mr Huntley, a musician, developed a rare disease in childhood calledHenoch-Schonlein purpura,external(HSP), which affects blood vessels and can sometimes lead to kidney problems. Ms Compton said her boyfriend's kidneys rapidly declined in July 2019 and a year later he was on dialysis and the transplant waiting list. ""Knowing Ed needed a kidney transplant I went to get tested [and] I was a match,"" she said. ""It was just a case of well it's a match so we'll move forward with it,"" she said. Mr Huntley - pictured after the transplant - said he had been given the ""gift of life"" Talking about the difference it would make, she said with her boyfriend's three times a week dialysis, making plans had been hard. ""Holidays are back open to us, visiting friends and family - these things are achievable now,"" she added.

Hiker's body and belongings retrieved by police,"Esther Dingley sent this selfie at the top of a mountain on 22 November French Police have retrieved the body and belongings of a British hiker found by her boyfriend months after she went missing in the Pyrenees. Esther Dingley, from Durham, vanished on a solo trek in November sparking major searches by French and Spanish police and her partner Daniel Colegate. A bone found by a hiker in July wasconfirmed to be hersand Mr Colegatefound the other remains on Monday. An accident has been said to be ""the most likely hypothesis"". Sources close to the investigation have confirmed to the BBC's Chris Bockman in Toulouse that human remains and hiking material were retrieved from a site in the Pyrenees and taken to the French city to be examined. Forensic experts, who handle both criminal and accidental deaths, were led to the site by Mr Colegate, who has walked hundreds of miles in the search for Ms Dingley. LBT Global, a charity which is supporting Ms Dingley's family, said her death had been most likely caused by an accident ""given the location and other early indications"". Daniel Colegate and Esther Dingley were on an open-ended campervan tour of Europe Ms Dingley, who was an experienced hiker, was trekking alone when shelast communicated with her partnerfrom the top of Pic De Sauvegarde at about 16:00 on 22 November.

Google may cut pay of US staff working from home,"Google employees in the US who opt to work from home permanently may get a pay cut. The technology giant has developed a pay calculator that lets employees see the effects of working remotely or moving offices. Some remote employees, especially those with a long commute, could have their pay cut without changing address. Google has no plans at this time to implement the policy in the UK. Employees in many businesses have proved that working from home permanently is viable during the Covid pandemic. Many companies are looking ahead to how employees will work as the pandemic recedes, even as the US continues to battle the Delta variant of the disease. Covid: Should I be working from home or going back to the office? Working from home job adverts rise Silicon Valley firms, some of which are keen to get employees back to their desks, are experimenting with employee pay structures. Big tech companies including Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter have offered less pay for employees based in locations where it is more inexpensive to live. But smaller firms such as Reddit and Zillow have said they will pay the same no matter where employees are based, saying that this improves diversity. A Google spokesperson said: ""Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from. ""Our new Work Location Tool was developed to help employees make informed decisions about which city or state they work from and any impact on compensation if they choose to relocate or work remotely."" One Google employee, who works in Seattle but has a two-hour commute, complained to Reuters of being faced with a 10% pay cut for choosing to work from home full-time. ""It's as high a pay cut as I got for my most recent promotion,"" the employee said. ""I didn't do all that hard work to get promoted to then take a pay cut."" Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said Google's move raises alarms about who will feel the impact most acutely, including families. ""What's clear is that Google doesn't have to do this,"" Prof Rosenfeld said. ""Google has paid these workers at 100% of their prior wage, by definition. So it's not like they can't afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving."" A Google employee in Stamford, Connecticut, which is an hour away from New York by train, would be paid 15% less working remotely, while there were 5% and 10% differences in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas. Google will not change employees' pay if they work fully remotely from the same city. In the UK, it's a fundamental part of employment law that employers cannot alter aspects of contracts such as rates of pay without the consent of employees, or without terminating those contracts and renegotiating them, said Emma Bartlett, a partner at employment lawyers CM Murray. From an employee perspective, it would be demoralising to be paid less for doing the same job, she said, and from a business perspective, it would have the potential to create two tiers of employment, with some employees expected to be in the office, and some not. If people stayed home working for childcare reasons, and women continue to take the main responsibility for childcare, then this could have the effect of widening the gender pay gap, she said. Workers may be treated differently in other respects, she added, and organisations would have to work hard to make sure employees were not treated differently in terms of training, promotion, and access to clients. Some businesses, such as US technology giant Cisco, have put in place a hybrid working plan that has no mandates about how often employees go into the office. Cisco expects that less than a quarter of its workforce will want to be in an office for three or more days a week. But other firms, such as Goldman Sachs, want workers to return to offices. The investment bank's boss, David Solomon, said in February that working from home was ""an aberration"" rather than ""the new normal"". The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents human resource professionals in the UK, said it was always ""the safest option"" for firms to seek express written agreement from employees before changing the level of their pay. In its guidance to employers, it says that imposing a pay cut is a ""high-risk"" approach, since workers can bring claims for breach of contract or even constructive unfair dismissal. Rachel Suff, senior employment relations adviser at the CIPD, said: ""Rather than making sweeping decisions on issues like pay and how, where and when people work, businesses should aim to balance individual needs with the needs of the organisation. ""It would be quite near-sighted for employers to think about adjusting pay at this early point in hybrid working, given there are so many things to still be ironed out and many people are still yet to return to a physical workspace. ""Given the tight labour market, businesses also need to stay attractive and cutting pay could prove to be a false economy if it turns talent away."" What are the new working from home rules?

The vaccine fertility myths that just won't go away,"False and misleading claims about Covid-19 vaccines, fertility and miscarriages are still circulating online, despite not being supported by evidence. Doctors are extremely cautious about what they recommend during pregnancy, so the original advice was to avoid the jab. But now, so much safety data has become available that this advice has changed and the vaccine is now actively encouraged (as getting Covid itself can put a pregnancy at risk). We have looked at some of the more persistent claims - and why they are wrong. This theory comes from a misreading of astudy submitted to the Japanese regulator,external. The study involved giving rats a much higher dose of vaccine than that given to humans (1,333 times higher). Only 0.1% of the total dose ended up in the animals' ovaries, 48 hours after injection. Far more - 53% after one hour and 25% after 48 hours - was found at the injection site (in humans, usually the arm). The next most common place was the liver (16% after 48 hours), which helps get rid of waste products from the blood. The vaccine is delivered using a bubble of fat containing the virus's genetic material, which kick-starts the body's immune system. And those promoting this claim cherry-picked a figure which actually referred to the concentration of fat found in the ovaries. Fat levels in the ovaries did increase in the 48 hours after the jab, as the vaccine contents moved from the injection site around the body. But, crucially, there was no evidence it still contained the virus's genetic material. We don't know what happened after 48 hours as that was the limit of the study. Some posts have highlighted miscarriages reported to vaccine-monitoring schemes, including the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card scheme in the UK and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the US. Anyone can report symptoms or health conditions they experience after being vaccinated. Not everyone will choose to report, so this is a self-selecting database. There were indeed miscarriages reported in these databases - they are unfortunately common events - but this does not mean the jab caused them. A study has founddata showing the miscarriage rate among vaccinated people,externalwas in line with the rate expected in the general population - 12.5%. Dr Victoria Male, a reproductive immunologist at Imperial College London, says these reporting systems are very good for spotting side-effects from the vaccine that are normally rare in the general population - that's how a specific type of blood clot was linked in some rare cases to the AstraZeneca vaccine. If you suddenly start seeing unusual symptoms in vaccinated people, it raises a red flag. The unfounded claims about vaccines and fertility True stories, fake claims about periods and the vaccine They are not so good at monitoring side-effects that are common in the population - such as changes to periods, miscarriages and heart problems. Seeing them in the data doesn't necessarily raise these red flags because you'd expect to see them anyway, vaccine or not. It's only if we start getting many more miscarriages than are seen in unvaccinated people that this data would prompt an investigation - and that's not been the case so far. Some people have also shared graphs showing a big rise in the overall number of people reporting their experiences to these schemes compared with previous years, for other vaccines and drugs. This has been used to imply the Covid vaccine is less safe. But the rise can't tell us that, it can only tell us that lots of people are reporting - possibly because an unprecedented proportion of the population is being vaccinated and it is a much talked-about subject. A widely shared petition from Michael Yeadon, a scientific researcher who has made other misleading statements about Covid, claimed the coronavirus's spike protein contained within the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines was similar to a protein called syncytin-1, involved in forming the placenta. He speculated that this might cause antibodies against the virus to attack a developing pregnancy, too. Some experts believe this was the origin of the whole belief that Covid vaccines might harm fertility. In fact syncytin-1 and the coronavirus's spike protein are just about as similar as any two random proteins so there is no real reason to believe the body might confuse them. But now evidence has been gathered to help disprove his theory. US fertility doctor Randy Morris, who wanted to respond directly to the concerns he'd heard, beganmonitoring his patients who were undergoing IVF treatment,externalto see whether vaccination made any difference to their chances of a successful pregnancy. Out of 143 people in Dr Morris's study, vaccinated, unvaccinated and previously infected women were about equally likely to have a successful embryo implantation and for the pregnancy to continue to term. The women were similar in most other respects. The study is small, but it adds to a large volume of other evidence - and were the claim true, you would expect that to show up even in a study of this size. Dr Morris pointed out that people spreading these fears had not explained why they believed antibodies produced in response to the vaccine could harm fertility but the same antibodies from a natural infection would not. The problem is, while scientists are rushing to provide evidence to reassure people, by the time they can report their findings people online have moved on to the next thing. As Dr Morris explained: ""The hallmark of a conspiracy theory is as soon as it's disproven, you move the goalpost.""

Gang guilty of random murder of NHS worker,"David Gomoh, who graduated with a marketing degree from London South Bank University, was stabbed at least nine times Four gang members have been convicted of the murder of a ""charismatic and intelligent"" NHS worker who was stabbed in the street in east London. David Gomoh, 24, was attacked as he talked on the phone to his girlfriend on 26 April 2020. He staggered back home and died in front of his family. He had no links to any gangs but was randomly targeted in Canning Town as part of a feud. His killers will be sentenced on 17 September. Vagnei Colubali, 22, from Cambridge, Mohammad Jalloh, 19, from Pinner, north-west London, and David Ture, 19, of no fixed address, were found guilty along with a 17-year-old Telford boy who cannot be named because of his age. Vagnei Colubali, Mohammad Jalloh, and David Ture (l-r) will be sentenced on 17 September, along with a 17-year-old Mr Gomoh's mother Marian said: ""David's murder is without doubt the hardest thing my family and I have been through. ""Nothing will bring back a life that was so full of promise and hope, a life that was brutally taken away from us; but we are grateful that now we can begin to mourn and build a fitting legacy for David."" The four killers were all connected to a gang based in north Newham, the Old Bailey heard. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC, said Mr Gomoh's death was part of a ""petty but fatal game of one-upmanship"" played out on the streets of London. ""This was a ride out into enemy territory and they were hunting for someone, anyone, to attack"". Mr Gomoh, who worked at St Barts hospital, was walking from his home in Custom House, east London, to go to the local supermarket. The four killers fled the murder scene in a stolen car His girlfriend heard the killers ask Mr Gomoh where he was from, followed by sounds of a scuffle. CCTV cameras on a bus captured the moment a stolen car - a Dodge Caliber - stopped beside Mr Gomoh and he turned to run. The killers were then driven away. Mr Gomoh as a boy During the investigation police found sketches by Ture, which revealed a ""picture-book story"" of the murder. The drawings found in Ture's bedroom showed a number of young men carrying out a stabbing in the area of Mr Gomoh's murder and the clothing worn by the defendants that night - elements of which helped identify some of the other killers. Police found DNA evidence on two pairs of sunglasses, one at the scene and another in the abandoned stolen car, linking the 17-year-old and Jalloh to the killing. Jurors heard Jalloh had two convictions for carrying knives and that Ture had previously pleaded guilty to wounding with a knife. Ture's ""childish doodles"" were found by the police in his bedroom drawer and showed the group at ""Threemasons (sic) Road"" - the location of the killing Ture also drew one of the gang members with an Armani man bag, which Colubali was seen wearing on CCTV The four defendants first attacked a separate man, who they chased with their weapons, but he got away, jurors heard. All four defendants were found guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent with regard to the earlier attack. Det Ch Insp Laurence Smith said; ""The four defendants set out that night ready and armed for savage violence. ""What they had not worked out was who their victim would be. ""They did not know David, they did not care who he was, or whether he was involved in a rival gang. ""He was simply a fair target in their petty game.""

Curbing methane emissions will 'buy us time',"An aggressive campaign to cut methane emissions can buy the world extra time to tackle climate change, experts say. One of the key findings in the newly released IPCC report is that emissions of methane have made a huge contribution to current warming. Thestudysuggested that 30-50% of the current rise in temperatures is down to this powerful, but short-lived gas. Major sources of methane include agriculture, and leaks from oil and gas production and landfills. Five things we have learned from the IPCC report Greece wildfires force island evacuations Time nearly up to stop climate catastrophe - Sharma Poor countries struggle to cope with climate impact For decades, the main focus of efforts to curb global warming has been the ever-rising emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activities, such as generating power and clearing forests. There's been good scientific reasons for this, as CO2 is the biggest driver of temperatures responsible for around 70% of the warming that's taken place since the industrial revolution. Methane (CH4), though, hasn't had the same focus. That may be changing, as earlier this year,a major UN study highlighted its environmental impact. Now, as this week'sIPCC report,externalpoints out graphically, methane's influence has been calculated as adding about 0.5C to the warming the world is experiencing right now. So where is all this methane coming from? Around 40% of the gas comes from natural sources such as wetlands - but the bigger share now comes from a range of human activities. ""It's a combination of sources, from agriculture, including cattle and rice production, another large source of methane is rubbish dumps,"" said Prof Peter Thorne, an IPCC author from Maynooth University in Ireland. Methane bubbles up from a wetland in Sweden ""One of the biggest is from the production, transport and use of natural gas - which is really misnamed and should be called fossil gas."" Since 2008, there's been a big spike in methane emissions, which researchers believe is linked to theboom in fracking for gas,externalin parts of the US. In 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era. What worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Over a 100-year period it is 28-34 times as warming as CO2. Over a 20-year period it is around 84 times as powerful per unit of mass as carbon dioxide. However, one key positive about CH4 is that it doesn't last as long in the air as CO2. ""If you emit a tonne of methane today, in a decade's time, I would expect half that tonne to remain in the atmosphere,"" said Prof Thorne. ""In two decades, time, there would be a quarter of a tonne, so basically, if we managed to stop emitting methane today by the end of this century, emissions would be down to natural levels, that they were in about 1750."" In the short term, experts believe that if methane emissions were cut by 40-45% over the next decade, you'd shave 0.3C off the increase in global temperature by 2040. In a world where every fraction of a degree counts, that's a potentially huge difference to hopes of keeping the 1.5C threshold alive. What excites many researchers is the belief that are a range of relatively simple actions that can quickly curb the production of methane. ""It's relatively cheap to bring down some of the sources,"" said Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway University of London. ""In particular, I'm talking about leaks from the gas industry, which now are so much easier to find, than they were 10-20 years ago, because the instruments are so much better."" ""Some things we can do quite quickly - in the tropics, you can put soil on top of these huge urban landfills and you can do a lot about stopping crop waste fires."" Quick fixes really do work. In the US, efforts to collect gas from landfill sites saw methane emissions cut by 40% between 1990 and 2016. Collecting gas at landfill sites in the US has slashed methane from dumps In agriculture there are also many technical changes related to manure and animal feed that can make a difference in lowering emissions. But getting the really big cuts will require political action. In countries like Ireland and New Zealand, where farming plays a huge role in the economy, these changes are contentious. To succeed, they will have to be fair and equitable. ""You can't just say that people can no longer keep cattle or sheep,"" said Prof Thorne. ""It needs policies to aid a transition to other means of managing the land, but it is not going to happen by people pronouncing you can't keep livestock any longer, it needs to be a much more nuanced approach."" Consumer choice when it comes to dairy and meat will certainly impact this sector. The oil and gas industry also faces a massive challenge in curbing methane. Regulations to date have failed to stop leaks, but there's a growing interest among fossil fuel companies in using technology that can rapidly identify and stem the emissions. ""If you look at it from an objective standpoint, the industry is improving, they are improving the leaks, they are improving the number of incidents, but it's not quick enough,"" said Arnel Santos, a 25-year oil industry veteran with Shell and now chief operating office of energy technology company mCloud Technologies. ""We need to go faster with respect to this challenge, to really show we can quickly deploy technology to augment what they're doing, because the improvements to date will not be quick enough with what we're seeing."" Agriculture is one of the sources of methane that is difficult to tackle Perhaps the biggest change that's required is to separate out methane from other warming gases on the international stage. There are worries that because UN climate negotiators deal with all greenhouse gases in the same process, there are concerns they may make trade-offs, comparisons and compromises on methane that muddy efforts to reduce these emissions. Many are now calling for a separate process for methane, along the lines of the Montreal Protocol, thatsuccessfully brought countries together to regulate ozone-depleting gases. ""To halt long-term warming, we need to halt carbon dioxide emissions,"" said Prof Thorne. ""But to aid us on that path, we could treat these gases differently. And if we were to treat methane differently, it might buy us time to adapt to the changes that are occurring."" ""It's carbon dioxide that absolutely needs to get to net zero. But if we are to halt long term warming, methane can absolutely help us on the way.""

The displaced people hoping for safety,"Humanitarian organisations warn that women and children will be badly affected With violence surging in Afghanistan, and the Taliban taking new territories in the north, thousands of people are fleeing their homes to seek safety in the capital Kabul. When they get there, many of these people face sleeping in abandoned warehouses or on the streets. They're struggling to find food, shelter and other basic necessities, such as medicine and sanitary items. But they feel they have little choice - it is either hardship in Kabul, or potential death in their home region. Now, thousands have gathered in makeshift camps on scrubland on the city's outskirts. Asadullah, a 35-year-old street vendor from Kunduz province, travelled to the capital with his wife and two young daughters earlier this week after the Taliban set fire to his home. ""I was a street worker, I sold food and spices... but when the Taliban attacked we came to Kabul,"" he tells the BBC. ""Now we have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child."" Asadullah was a street worker in Kunduz province, selling food and spices Asadullah, his two daughters (pictured) and wife slept on the streets after arriving in Kabul Asadullah and his young family spent the night on the streets. ""All of our home and belongings caught fire, so we came to Kabul and pray to God to help us. Rockets and mortars hit our home... there were heavy clashes in the past seven days, we had no bread to eat and all the bakeries, shops and bazaars were closed."" A woman, who didn't give her name, told the BBC she fled her home in the northern city of Pul-e-Khumri with her husband and children. Her husband, she says, was wounded in the war. ""We had a good life, but because of the bomb blasts we lost our home and came here,"" she says. ""We left our home with only one dress and no money."" This woman said her family had a good life in Pul-e-Khumri, but they've now lost everything Humanitarian organisations have been warning of a rise in internally displaced persons in Afghanistan since US-led forces began withdrawing from the country earlier this year, following 20 years of military operations. The campaign began in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks on American soil. Now, most of the foreign troops have pulled out. Since then, clashes between the Taliban and government forces have escalated. The Taliban have taken at least eight of the country's 34 provincial capitals, and are threatening to seize more. The Washington Post has also cited unnamed US officials saying that even Kabul could fall to the Taliban within the next 90 days, based on US military assessments. This unrest has caused a rise in people fleeing their homes for the capital. In July the UN warned that around 270,000 more people were internally displaced in the country after troops started to leave - this number is estimated to have surged in just the last few days. Amid all of this more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, according to the UN. Thousands of people are camped in scrubland on the outskirts of Kabul NGOs say that this mass displacement will hit women and children particularly hard. ""We're seeing a lot of increased reporting around health protection needs, gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse and trafficking,"" Jared Rowell, Country Director of the Danish Refugee Council in Afghanistan, tells the BBC. ""Early marriage will become a larger problem too as girls and young women are sold off in order to get cash to provide for their families. Those types of issues, which have always been a problem, are going to get more and more severe."" EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? As well as food, shelter and health and sanitary items, Mr Rowell says, displaced people in Kabul are in desperate need of cash. ""It's really important people have access to multi-purpose cash,"" he says. ""Meaning an agency like DRC would give them a cash distribution that they have the autonomy to determine what they spend that money on in order to best support their needs. ""Cash is also particularly important at this point in time, especially when they're relocating to a large city like Kabul with high food prices and markets with fluctuating prices due to the current instability."" For Asadullah, his main hope now is that his family can one day return to their normal life in Kunduz. ""We want to go back and continue our lives there,"" he says. ""We hope that one day peace will come to Afghanistan, and our country will be free."" Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan? How the Taliban swept across Afghanistan Who are the Taliban?

But before we do, here's a round-up of the main developments today:   German authorities have appealed for thousands of people to get another dose of their Covid vaccine, after a police investigation found that a Red Cross nurse may have injected them with saline solution instead. Around 8,600 may have been affected by the nurse's actions at a vaccination centre in Friesland, northern Germany. Officials said dud jabs were administered in spring this year and would have had no adverse health impact on anyone affected. âI am totally shocked by this episode,â said Sven Ambrosy, a local councillor, ina post on Facebook.,external""The most important thing for us is to inform these people, answer their questions and offer further vaccination."" It is not clear if the suspect has been arrested or charged over the incident. Local broadcaster NDR said the case had been handed to a special police unit that investigates politically-motivated crimes. Premier League fans will face random spot-checks of their Covid-19 status at grounds in the first few matchdays of the season, the league says. The top flight hasannounced protocols for the new season,external, saying fans must be prepared to prove they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours. Fans will be able to show their Covid-19 status using the NHS Covid pass through the NHS app or website. The league is preparing in case it becomes mandatory for all fans to have their coronavirus status checked. The 2021/2022 season begins on Friday, when Brentford host Arsenal at 20:00 BST in the opening game. Read more Europe's drugs regulator has said it is looking into whether three new conditions may be side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says it is studying a small number of cases of erythema multiforme, a type of allergic skin reaction, and glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, disorders related to the kidneys. The EMA did not say how many cases have been reported, but it has requested more data from Pfizer and Moderna to study any potential relations. Last month, the EMA found a possible link between mRNA vaccines and a very rare form of heart inflammation. But the regulator, and the World Health Organisation, have stressed the benefits from these vaccines outweighs any risks. The Australian Olympics Committee (AOC) has said it is ""cruel"" for Olympians to quarantine for 28 days after the return home. Athletes returning via Sydney to the state of South Australia are facing an extra two-week quarantine - on top of the 14 days already required for all overseas arrivals. ""While other countries are celebrating the return of their athletes, we are subjecting ours to the most cruel and uncaring treatment,"" the AOC said in a statement. The government of South Australia said it had turned down the AOC's request for the additional requirements to be waived because of ""the high risk of the Delta strain."" Read more here. More than 47.1 million people - 89.1% of the UK adult population - have had their first dose of a Covid jab, according to the latest government figures. Of those, more than 39.8 million people - or 75.3% of adults - have also had their second jab. Another 29,612 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK and a further 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures. But these figures do not include data from Wales due to a technical issue. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, has toldBBC Radio 5 Livethat some PCR testing companies are âgaming the systemâ and
pricing people out of the market. He also questioned why people who have received both jabs
needed to take the tests in the first place. ""If you look at whatâs happening across Europe for
fully-jabbed passengers, PCR tests arenât required, quarantine isnât required
and pre-departure tests arenât required so we are an outlier across Europe and I
think thatâs impacting on bookings. ""Weâre only about 19% of where we were in 2019. ""Thereâs a reason why the Europeans arenât doing this,â he

France has announced it will end free non-prescription coronavirus tests from mid-October, in a bid to encourage more people to get vaccinated. The government will also set up a campaign for people to receive booster jabs from the middle of September, with the first jabs available at the end of this month. It comes a day after neighbouring Germany announced that it, too, would be ending free tests. President Emmanuel Macron has held a virtual meeting with senior cabinet ministers today, as cases continue to surge in France and its overseas territories. To help curb the spread, the government made it mandatory for anyone entering a restaurant, train or other public space to show a health pass - proving they have been vaccinated or tested negative for Covid. An 11-year-old boy has spent his 500th night camping outside, as part of a fundraising challenge which started during lockdown. Max Woosey began sleeping in his garden in Devon on 28 March 2020 - shortly after lockdown measures were first introduced in the UK - when he heard hospice fundraising events were getting cancelled because of the pandemic. He was inspired by a family friend who died of cancer and left Max his tent. Since then, he has raised more than Â£640,000 for the North Devon Hospice, which cared for his neighbour. Max has camped out at a variety of locations, ranging from his back garden to London Zoo and 10 Downing Street. To mark the latest milestone, he built a woodland shelter with his parents and best friends. ""I thought for my 500th night it would be a bit more crazy and a bit more fun,"" he says. Read more. Kenyan civil servants have until 23 August to get themselves vaccinated, or they'll face disciplinary action, according to a government letter that's been made public. ""Some public servants have deliberately avoided getting vaccinated so that they can stay away from work under the guise of working from home,"" writes Jospeh Kinyua, Kenya's Head of Public Service. The move has not been entirely welcomed by Kenya's civil servants. âVaccination is voluntary - why are civil servants the only ones being punished?â says Tom Odege, secretary general of the Kenya Union of Civil Servants, speaking to Bloomberg News. âThe government should instead encourage civil servants to get vaccinated.â Kenya is seeing a surge in cases but vaccine rollouts remain slow. Less than 3% of the country's 47 million residents are fully inoculated. The government has extended a night-time curfew until further notice, in an attempt to curb Covid cases. On Thursday parliament will also debate a motion to deny people access to private and public spaces if they aren't fully vaccinated or don't possess proof of a negative Covid test.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid has asked the competition watchdog to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. Tim Hawkins is chief strategy officer of Manchester Airport Group which owns and runs Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports. He questioned whether the UK needed the tests when lots of countries aren't requiring them. ""It's certainly having a big drag effect on people's travel over the summer. Those are additional costs that people haven't factored in. ""Why do we need them at all? Lots of countries aren't requiring those tests but the UK is,"" he added. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. A group of high-level health officials in Thailand have called on the government to issue legal protections for healthcare personnel working to combat Covid. Leaders from a dozen public health bodies signed a statement calling for the measures, theBangkok Post reports.,external They said health workers should be shielded from liability because they often had to work with limited knowledge and resources, and were at risk of making honest mistakes. The statement added that protections would boost their confidence in the workplace, so they could continue serving the public interest. Thailand's government says it is in the process of drafting an executive decree to shield health workers from liability, in consultation with medical staff. In response to critics of the decree, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Tuesday that it is intended to protect healthcare professionals, not the government. We've already heard that Google in the US is considering cutting the pay of staff who work from home, but what is the work from home guidance in the UK? In England, people are are no longer being asked to work from home and a gradual return to workplaces is encouraged by the government. However, in the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep working at home where possible. You can ask to keep working from home in the future, but your employer doesn't have to agree. However, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development - which represents HR professionals - says there could be much greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work in future. ""People generally want a mix of workplace and home working, and the possibility of more choice in their working routines, meaning hybrid working can provide an effective balance for many workers."" The CIPD adds that the lifting of Covid restrictions ""shouldn't signal a mass return to workplaces,"" and ""it should be down to individual organisations, consulting with their people, to agree working arrangements"". On Monday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengrejected the idea that civil servants should be paid lessif they continue working from home.

So what are the current rules in the UK? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&Bs, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales.

Francis Goncalves told BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell the abusers believe him to be an actor, set up by broadcasters to spread a hoax. âPeople should be going to the doctor for advice on these things, but they listen to social media,â he said. All three of Francisâ relatives were scared by misinformation in regards to the Covid jab. Francis said it was difficult to counter the anti-vaccine rhetoric they were hearing as he didnât feel he had the medical background to change their mind.

More businesses can now apply for free Covid testing kits under a Scottish government scheme. Organisations with 10 or more employees can sign up for the lateral flow kits.

"As it happened: UK reports 29,612 new Covid cases and 104 deathsLatest government figures also show almost 40 million people are fully vaccinated.UK","UK reports 29,612 new Covid cases on Wednesday and 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Almost 40 million Britons have had both doses of a Covid jab - 75.3% of the adult population 47.1 million have had a first dose - 89.1% of the adult population Judging whether to give teenagers a Covid jab is a ""delicate balance"", a member of the government's vaccine advisory groups says Prof Adam Finn, from the JCVI, says the rollout is moving cautiously down through the age groups Children aged 16 and 17 in the UK started being invited for their first dose last week Facebook has removed hundreds of accounts which it says were involved in anti-vax disinformation campaigns operated from Russia Ukraine, one of the European countries worst affected by Covid, extends restrictions until 1 October because of the Delta variant Edited by James Clarke and Rob Corp We're now closing our live page for today.

But before we do, here's a round-up of the main developments today:   German authorities have appealed for thousands of people to get another dose of their Covid vaccine, after a police investigation found that a Red Cross nurse may have injected them with saline solution instead. Around 8,600 may have been affected by the nurse's actions at a vaccination centre in Friesland, northern Germany. Officials said dud jabs were administered in spring this year and would have had no adverse health impact on anyone affected. âI am totally shocked by this episode,â said Sven Ambrosy, a local councillor, ina post on Facebook.,external""The most important thing for us is to inform these people, answer their questions and offer further vaccination."" It is not clear if the suspect has been arrested or charged over the incident. Local broadcaster NDR said the case had been handed to a special police unit that investigates politically-motivated crimes. Premier League fans will face random spot-checks of their Covid-19 status at grounds in the first few matchdays of the season, the league says. The top flight hasannounced protocols for the new season,external, saying fans must be prepared to prove they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours. Fans will be able to show their Covid-19 status using the NHS Covid pass through the NHS app or website. The league is preparing in case it becomes mandatory for all fans to have their coronavirus status checked. The 2021/2022 season begins on Friday, when Brentford host Arsenal at 20:00 BST in the opening game. Read more Europe's drugs regulator has said it is looking into whether three new conditions may be side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says it is studying a small number of cases of erythema multiforme, a type of allergic skin reaction, and glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, disorders related to the kidneys. The EMA did not say how many cases have been reported, but it has requested more data from Pfizer and Moderna to study any potential relations. Last month, the EMA found a possible link between mRNA vaccines and a very rare form of heart inflammation. But the regulator, and the World Health Organisation, have stressed the benefits from these vaccines outweighs any risks. The Australian Olympics Committee (AOC) has said it is ""cruel"" for Olympians to quarantine for 28 days after the return home. Athletes returning via Sydney to the state of South Australia are facing an extra two-week quarantine - on top of the 14 days already required for all overseas arrivals. ""While other countries are celebrating the return of their athletes, we are subjecting ours to the most cruel and uncaring treatment,"" the AOC said in a statement. The government of South Australia said it had turned down the AOC's request for the additional requirements to be waived because of ""the high risk of the Delta strain."" Read more here. More than 47.1 million people - 89.1% of the UK adult population - have had their first dose of a Covid jab, according to the latest government figures. Of those, more than 39.8 million people - or 75.3% of adults - have also had their second jab. Another 29,612 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK and a further 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures. But these figures do not include data from Wales due to a technical issue. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, has toldBBC Radio 5 Livethat some PCR testing companies are âgaming the systemâ and
pricing people out of the market. He also questioned why people who have received both jabs
needed to take the tests in the first place. ""If you look at whatâs happening across Europe for
fully-jabbed passengers, PCR tests arenât required, quarantine isnât required
and pre-departure tests arenât required so we are an outlier across Europe and I
think thatâs impacting on bookings. ""Weâre only about 19% of where we were in 2019. ""Thereâs a reason why the Europeans arenât doing this,â he

France has announced it will end free non-prescription coronavirus tests from mid-October, in a bid to encourage more people to get vaccinated. The government will also set up a campaign for people to receive booster jabs from the middle of September, with the first jabs available at the end of this month. It comes a day after neighbouring Germany announced that it, too, would be ending free tests. President Emmanuel Macron has held a virtual meeting with senior cabinet ministers today, as cases continue to surge in France and its overseas territories. To help curb the spread, the government made it mandatory for anyone entering a restaurant, train or other public space to show a health pass - proving they have been vaccinated or tested negative for Covid. An 11-year-old boy has spent his 500th night camping outside, as part of a fundraising challenge which started during lockdown. Max Woosey began sleeping in his garden in Devon on 28 March 2020 - shortly after lockdown measures were first introduced in the UK - when he heard hospice fundraising events were getting cancelled because of the pandemic. He was inspired by a family friend who died of cancer and left Max his tent. Since then, he has raised more than Â£640,000 for the North Devon Hospice, which cared for his neighbour. Max has camped out at a variety of locations, ranging from his back garden to London Zoo and 10 Downing Street. To mark the latest milestone, he built a woodland shelter with his parents and best friends. ""I thought for my 500th night it would be a bit more crazy and a bit more fun,"" he says. Read more. Kenyan civil servants have until 23 August to get themselves vaccinated, or they'll face disciplinary action, according to a government letter that's been made public. ""Some public servants have deliberately avoided getting vaccinated so that they can stay away from work under the guise of working from home,"" writes Jospeh Kinyua, Kenya's Head of Public Service. The move has not been entirely welcomed by Kenya's civil servants. âVaccination is voluntary - why are civil servants the only ones being punished?â says Tom Odege, secretary general of the Kenya Union of Civil Servants, speaking to Bloomberg News. âThe government should instead encourage civil servants to get vaccinated.â Kenya is seeing a surge in cases but vaccine rollouts remain slow. Less than 3% of the country's 47 million residents are fully inoculated. The government has extended a night-time curfew until further notice, in an attempt to curb Covid cases. On Thursday parliament will also debate a motion to deny people access to private and public spaces if they aren't fully vaccinated or don't possess proof of a negative Covid test. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent The ""high cost, poor quality and lack of sequencing from PCR tests"" needs to be urgently addressed by the government, a  Commons committee chairman says. In a letter to Health Secretary Sajid Javid,external, Huw Merriman, the chairman of the transport select committee, says ""there needs to be a clear and compelling justification for the use of PCR tests"" in international travel as they are creating ""an unnecessary barrier to affordable international travel"". He argues that although the government has justified the use of PCR tests as they can be sequenced to identify variants of concern, the level of sequencing has dropped from 49% in early March to 5% in early July.

But before we do, here's a round-up of the main developments today:   German authorities have appealed for thousands of people to get another dose of their Covid vaccine, after a police investigation found that a Red Cross nurse may have injected them with saline solution instead. Around 8,600 may have been affected by the nurse's actions at a vaccination centre in Friesland, northern Germany.

The top flight hasannounced protocols for the new season,external, saying fans must be prepared to prove they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours. Fans will be able to show their Covid-19 status using the NHS Covid pass through the NHS app or website.

The 2021/2022 season begins on Friday, when Brentford host Arsenal at 20:00 BST in the opening game. Read more Europe's drugs regulator has said it is looking into whether three new conditions may be side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says it is studying a small number of cases of erythema multiforme, a type of allergic skin reaction, and glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, disorders related to the kidneys. The EMA did not say how many cases have been reported, but it has requested more data from Pfizer and Moderna to study any potential relations. Last month, the EMA found a possible link between mRNA vaccines and a very rare form of heart inflammation. But the regulator, and the World Health Organisation, have stressed the benefits from these vaccines outweighs any risks. The Australian Olympics Committee (AOC) has said it is ""cruel"" for Olympians to quarantine for 28 days after the return home. Athletes returning via Sydney to the state of South Australia are facing an extra two-week quarantine - on top of the 14 days already required for all overseas arrivals. ""While other countries are celebrating the return of their athletes, we are subjecting ours to the most cruel and uncaring treatment,"" the AOC said in a statement. The government of South Australia said it had turned down the AOC's request for the additional requirements to be waived because of ""the high risk of the Delta strain."" Read more here. More than 47.1 million people - 89.1% of the UK adult population - have had their first dose of a Covid jab, according to the latest government figures. Of those, more than 39.8 million people - or 75.3% of adults - have also had their second jab. Another 29,612 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK and a further 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures. But these figures do not include data from Wales due to a technical issue. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, has toldBBC Radio 5 Livethat some PCR testing companies are âgaming the systemâ and
pricing people out of the market. He also questioned why people who have received both jabs
needed to take the tests in the first place. ""If you look at whatâs happening across Europe for
fully-jabbed passengers, PCR tests arenât required, quarantine isnât required
and pre-departure tests arenât required so we are an outlier across Europe and I
think thatâs impacting on bookings. ""Weâre only about 19% of where we were in 2019. ""Thereâs a reason why the Europeans arenât doing this,â he

Smaller numbers also took part in the parade in 2020 Northern Ireland's annual Apprentice Boys Relief of Derry parade will take place on Saturday but on a reduced scale due to the pandemic, organisers have said. Governor of the Apprentice Boys, Graeme Stenhouse, said only 18 local clubs and bands would be permitted to take part in the parade this year.

France has announced it will end free non-prescription coronavirus tests from mid-October, in a bid to encourage more people to get vaccinated. The government will also set up a campaign for people to receive booster jabs from the middle of September, with the first jabs available at the end of this month. It comes a day after neighbouring Germany announced that it, too, would be ending free tests. President Emmanuel Macron has held a virtual meeting with senior cabinet ministers today, as cases continue to surge in France and its overseas territories. To help curb the spread, the government made it mandatory for anyone entering a restaurant, train or other public space to show a health pass - proving they have been vaccinated or tested negative for Covid. An 11-year-old boy has spent his 500th night camping outside, as part of a fundraising challenge which started during lockdown. Max Woosey began sleeping in his garden in Devon on 28 March 2020 - shortly after lockdown measures were first introduced in the UK - when he heard hospice fundraising events were getting cancelled because of the pandemic. He was inspired by a family friend who died of cancer and left Max his tent. Since then, he has raised more than Â£640,000 for the North Devon Hospice, which cared for his neighbour. Max has camped out at a variety of locations, ranging from his back garden to London Zoo and 10 Downing Street. To mark the latest milestone, he built a woodland shelter with his parents and best friends. ""I thought for my 500th night it would be a bit more crazy and a bit more fun,"" he says. Read more. Kenyan civil servants have until 23 August to get themselves vaccinated, or they'll face disciplinary action, according to a government letter that's been made public. ""Some public servants have deliberately avoided getting vaccinated so that they can stay away from work under the guise of working from home,"" writes Jospeh Kinyua, Kenya's Head of Public Service. The move has not been entirely welcomed by Kenya's civil servants. âVaccination is voluntary - why are civil servants the only ones being punished?â says Tom Odege, secretary general of the Kenya Union of Civil Servants, speaking to Bloomberg News. âThe government should instead encourage civil servants to get vaccinated.â Kenya is seeing a surge in cases but vaccine rollouts remain slow. Less than 3% of the country's 47 million residents are fully inoculated. The government has extended a night-time curfew until further notice, in an attempt to curb Covid cases. On Thursday parliament will also debate a motion to deny people access to private and public spaces if they aren't fully vaccinated or don't possess proof of a negative Covid test. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent The ""high cost, poor quality and lack of sequencing from PCR tests"" needs to be urgently addressed by the government, a  Commons committee chairman says. In a letter to Health Secretary Sajid Javid,external, Huw Merriman, the chairman of the transport select committee, says ""there needs to be a clear and compelling justification for the use of PCR tests"" in international travel as they are creating ""an unnecessary barrier to affordable international travel"". He argues that although the government has justified the use of PCR tests as they can be sequenced to identify variants of concern, the level of sequencing has dropped from 49% in early March to 5% in early July.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid has asked the competition watchdog to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. Tim Hawkins is chief strategy officer of Manchester Airport Group which owns and runs Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports. He questioned whether the UK needed the tests when lots of countries aren't requiring them. ""It's certainly having a big drag effect on people's travel over the summer. Those are additional costs that people haven't factored in. ""Why do we need them at all? Lots of countries aren't requiring those tests but the UK is,"" he added. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. A group of high-level health officials in Thailand have called on the government to issue legal protections for healthcare personnel working to combat Covid. Leaders from a dozen public health bodies signed a statement calling for the measures, theBangkok Post reports.,external They said health workers should be shielded from liability because they often had to work with limited knowledge and resources, and were at risk of making honest mistakes. The statement added that protections would boost their confidence in the workplace, so they could continue serving the public interest. Thailand's government says it is in the process of drafting an executive decree to shield health workers from liability, in consultation with medical staff. In response to critics of the decree, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Tuesday that it is intended to protect healthcare professionals, not the government. We've already heard that Google in the US is considering cutting the pay of staff who work from home, but what is the work from home guidance in the UK? In England, people are are no longer being asked to work from home and a gradual return to workplaces is encouraged by the government. However, in the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep working at home where possible. You can ask to keep working from home in the future, but your employer doesn't have to agree. However, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development - which represents HR professionals - says there could be much greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work in future. ""People generally want a mix of workplace and home working, and the possibility of more choice in their working routines, meaning hybrid working can provide an effective balance for many workers."" The CIPD adds that the lifting of Covid restrictions ""shouldn't signal a mass return to workplaces,"" and ""it should be down to individual organisations, consulting with their people, to agree working arrangements"". On Monday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengrejected the idea that civil servants should be paid lessif they continue working from home. Read more inour explainer on the UK's working from home guidance Though you can't trust the British weather, many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer as travelling abroad is not as straightforward at the moment. So what are the current rules in the UK? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&Bs, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. But there are still some restrictions inNorthern Ireland.

Athletes returning via Sydney to the state of South Australia are facing an extra two-week quarantine - on top of the 14 days already required for all overseas arrivals. ""While other countries are celebrating the return of their athletes, we are subjecting ours to the most cruel and uncaring treatment,"" the AOC said in a statement.

More than 47.1 million people - 89.1% of the UK adult population - have had their first dose of a Covid jab, according to the latest government figures. Of those, more than 39.8 million people - or 75.3% of adults - have also had their second jab. Another 29,612 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK and a further 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures.

France has announced it will end free non-prescription coronavirus tests from mid-October, in a bid to encourage more people to get vaccinated. The government will also set up a campaign for people to receive booster jabs from the middle of September, with the first jabs available at the end of this month. It comes a day after neighbouring Germany announced that it, too, would be ending free tests. President Emmanuel Macron has held a virtual meeting with senior cabinet ministers today, as cases continue to surge in France and its overseas territories. To help curb the spread, the government made it mandatory for anyone entering a restaurant, train or other public space to show a health pass - proving they have been vaccinated or tested negative for Covid. An 11-year-old boy has spent his 500th night camping outside, as part of a fundraising challenge which started during lockdown. Max Woosey began sleeping in his garden in Devon on 28 March 2020 - shortly after lockdown measures were first introduced in the UK - when he heard hospice fundraising events were getting cancelled because of the pandemic. He was inspired by a family friend who died of cancer and left Max his tent. Since then, he has raised more than Â£640,000 for the North Devon Hospice, which cared for his neighbour. Max has camped out at a variety of locations, ranging from his back garden to London Zoo and 10 Downing Street. To mark the latest milestone, he built a woodland shelter with his parents and best friends. ""I thought for my 500th night it would be a bit more crazy and a bit more fun,"" he says. Read more. Kenyan civil servants have until 23 August to get themselves vaccinated, or they'll face disciplinary action, according to a government letter that's been made public. ""Some public servants have deliberately avoided getting vaccinated so that they can stay away from work under the guise of working from home,"" writes Jospeh Kinyua, Kenya's Head of Public Service. The move has not been entirely welcomed by Kenya's civil servants. âVaccination is voluntary - why are civil servants the only ones being punished?â says Tom Odege, secretary general of the Kenya Union of Civil Servants, speaking to Bloomberg News. âThe government should instead encourage civil servants to get vaccinated.â Kenya is seeing a surge in cases but vaccine rollouts remain slow. Less than 3% of the country's 47 million residents are fully inoculated. The government has extended a night-time curfew until further notice, in an attempt to curb Covid cases. On Thursday parliament will also debate a motion to deny people access to private and public spaces if they aren't fully vaccinated or don't possess proof of a negative Covid test.

Leaders from a dozen public health bodies signed a statement calling for the measures, theBangkok Post reports.,external They said health workers should be shielded from liability because they often had to work with limited knowledge and resources, and were at risk of making honest mistakes. The statement added that protections would boost their confidence in the workplace, so they could continue serving the public interest. Thailand's government says it is in the process of drafting an executive decree to shield health workers from liability, in consultation with medical staff. In response to critics of the decree, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Tuesday that it is intended to protect healthcare professionals, not the government. We've already heard that Google in the US is considering cutting the pay of staff who work from home, but what is the work from home guidance in the UK? In England, people are are no longer being asked to work from home and a gradual return to workplaces is encouraged by the government. However, in the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep working at home where possible. You can ask to keep working from home in the future, but your employer doesn't have to agree. However, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development - which represents HR professionals - says there could be much greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work in future. ""People generally want a mix of workplace and home working, and the possibility of more choice in their working routines, meaning hybrid working can provide an effective balance for many workers."" The CIPD adds that the lifting of Covid restrictions ""shouldn't signal a mass return to workplaces,"" and ""it should be down to individual organisations, consulting with their people, to agree working arrangements"".

All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&Bs, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider.

But before we do, here's a round-up of the main developments today:   German authorities have appealed for thousands of people to get another dose of their Covid vaccine, after a police investigation found that a Red Cross nurse may have injected them with saline solution instead. Around 8,600 may have been affected by the nurse's actions at a vaccination centre in Friesland, northern Germany. Officials said dud jabs were administered in spring this year and would have had no adverse health impact on anyone affected. âI am totally shocked by this episode,â said Sven Ambrosy, a local councillor, ina post on Facebook.,external""The most important thing for us is to inform these people, answer their questions and offer further vaccination."" It is not clear if the suspect has been arrested or charged over the incident. Local broadcaster NDR said the case had been handed to a special police unit that investigates politically-motivated crimes. Premier League fans will face random spot-checks of their Covid-19 status at grounds in the first few matchdays of the season, the league says. The top flight hasannounced protocols for the new season,external, saying fans must be prepared to prove they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours. Fans will be able to show their Covid-19 status using the NHS Covid pass through the NHS app or website. The league is preparing in case it becomes mandatory for all fans to have their coronavirus status checked. The 2021/2022 season begins on Friday, when Brentford host Arsenal at 20:00 BST in the opening game. Read more Europe's drugs regulator has said it is looking into whether three new conditions may be side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says it is studying a small number of cases of erythema multiforme, a type of allergic skin reaction, and glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, disorders related to the kidneys. The EMA did not say how many cases have been reported, but it has requested more data from Pfizer and Moderna to study any potential relations. Last month, the EMA found a possible link between mRNA vaccines and a very rare form of heart inflammation.

David Cameron denies lobbying for genetics firm,"David Cameron has denied commercially lobbying the government on behalf of a genetics company he worked for. It comes after it emerged he encouraged Health Secretary Matt Hancock to speak at a conference co-hosted by the firm, Illumina, shortly before it won a Â£123m government contract. According to the Times newspaper,,externalMr Cameron wrote to Mr Hancock personally to recommend he attend the conference. Mr Cameron's spokesman confirmed both men had attended the conference. The former Prime Minister also mentioned hisattendance at the conference on his Twitter account.,external Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The conference was co-hosted by Illumina and Genomics England. In the letter, seen by the Times, Mr Cameron wrote to Mr Hancock: ""I understand Jay [Flatley, then executive chairman of Illumina] has sent this direct to your office, but I wanted to i) ensure that you had seen it personally; and ii) strongly endorse their invitation to this significant conference."" The BBC understands that Mr Cameron did forward a copy of a letter of invitation to the conference to Mr Hancock, after a previous one had been sent directly. The Times reported that a week after the conference at the Four Seasons Hotel, in Hampshire, in September 2019, the company was given a multi-million-pound contract for genetic sequencing without competition. The contract is with Genomics England, a company wholly owned by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). The DHSC said that the contract was ""was awarded in the correct way, through the proper process"". Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner said: ""There is rampant cronyism, sleaze and dodgy lobbying that is polluting our democracy under Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. They hand public money to their mates without a second thought."" Mr Hancock said that he ""had no involvement in the awarding of these contracts and all normal processes were followed"". Mr Cameron's spokesman said: ""David Cameron's work for Illumina has never involved any discussion of commercial contracts. ""It has predominantly involved promoting the benefits of genomic sequencing and the world-leading example of Genomics England to other countries around the world. He has done this in Australia, the US, the Gulf, India and more recently in online calls with interested parties in Japan and Holland. He said the former Prime Minister had made clear that promoting the science of genomics would occasionally bring him into contact with UK Government Ministers, officials and others, including at international gatherings. ""For instance, he and the former Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock, both spoke at an international genomics conference in September 2019 and this was publicised at the time, including on David Cameron's own Twitter account. ""As has been made clear on numerous occasions, David Cameron has never lobbied the Government on behalf of Illumina or been involved in any contract or commercial discussions,"" he added. The Department for Health and Social Care said it carried out ""extensive due diligence"". ""This contract, signed to help save lives through better diagnosis, was awarded in the correct way, through the proper process and any suggestion of undue ministerial involvement in the decision making is completely wrong. ""Extensive due diligence was carried out and as set out in the transparency notice the contact was directly awarded because Illumina was the only company considered to have the technical capability to deliver this crucial work. It said that the 2019 contract ""was a follow-on contract to the original sequencing contract with Illumina in 2014.""

TV for 1m people off indefinitely after mast fire,"The 1,032ft (315m) tall mast, seen here in three different images, caught fire on Tuesday TV and radio services for more than a million people will remain off air indefinitely after a transmitter fire. The blaze at the Bilsdale mast on Tuesday disrupted Freeview, DAB and FM radio signals across North Yorkshire, Teesside and parts of County Durham. Operator Arqiva said it would bring in temporary equipment but could not say when services would be restored. Witness Ron Needham, 71, reported seeing ""a huge black cloud of smoke come from the buildings at the bottom"". He had been hiking on the North York Moors with his wife Sue, 69, when they stopped for lunch at the base of the mast. They noticed ""nothing untoward"" but after continuing for about a mile-and-a-half noticed smoke coming from the top ""like a chimney"", Mr Needham said. Despite the loss of transmission from the tower, BBC television remains available oniPlayer. Radio stations can still be listened to onBBC Sounds. The transmitter mast can be seen for miles around Firefighters were sent to the site at 13:19 BST on Tuesday after a call from an engineer working on the transmitter near Helmsley. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said there were ""concerns about the structural integrity of the mast"" and a 300m (980ft) exclusion zone was in place around it. It also said the cause of the blaze was being investigated but did not believe it was as a result of a ""criminal act"". Arqiva confirmed no-one was injured in the fire and thanked emergency services ""for their swift action"". ""We have started the process to gradually restore services using a combination of temporary structures and existing infrastructure elsewhere in the region, and will be moving through this process as quickly and safely as possible,"" a spokesperson said. A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire Police said Airwave, the radio service used by all the emergency services, had not been affected by the mast fire. The 1,032ft (315m) tall tower was built in 1969 and provides coverage for 500,000 homes across northern England, from Tadcaster to Seaham. Arqiva said about 200,000 of those use Freeview as their main TV platform. Six fire crews attended the scene to extinguish the blaze People have contacted the BBC about how the loss of transmission has affected them, with one viewer saying they were ""stuck at home with severe disabilities"".

Curbing methane emissions will 'buy us time'Scientists say that rapid cuts in methane could be a key tactic in the battle against climate change.Science & Environment,"An aggressive campaign to cut methane emissions can buy the world extra time to tackle climate change, experts say. One of the key findings in the newly released IPCC report is that emissions of methane have made a huge contribution to current warming. Thestudysuggested that 30-50% of the current rise in temperatures is down to this powerful, but short-lived gas. Major sources of methane include agriculture, and leaks from oil and gas production and landfills. Five things we have learned from the IPCC report Greece wildfires force island evacuations Time nearly up to stop climate catastrophe - Sharma Poor countries struggle to cope with climate impact For decades, the main focus of efforts to curb global warming has been the ever-rising emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activities, such as generating power and clearing forests. There's been good scientific reasons for this, as CO2 is the biggest driver of temperatures responsible for around 70% of the warming that's taken place since the industrial revolution. Methane (CH4), though, hasn't had the same focus. That may be changing, as earlier this year,a major UN study highlighted its environmental impact. Now, as this week'sIPCC report,externalpoints out graphically, methane's influence has been calculated as adding about 0.5C to the warming the world is experiencing right now. So where is all this methane coming from? Around 40% of the gas comes from natural sources such as wetlands - but the bigger share now comes from a range of human activities. ""It's a combination of sources, from agriculture, including cattle and rice production, another large source of methane is rubbish dumps,"" said Prof Peter Thorne, an IPCC author from Maynooth University in Ireland. Methane bubbles up from a wetland in Sweden ""One of the biggest is from the production, transport and use of natural gas - which is really misnamed and should be called fossil gas."" Since 2008, there's been a big spike in methane emissions, which researchers believe is linked to theboom in fracking for gas,externalin parts of the US. In 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era. What worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Over a 100-year period it is 28-34 times as warming as CO2. Over a 20-year period it is around 84 times as powerful per unit of mass as carbon dioxide. However, one key positive about CH4 is that it doesn't last as long in the air as CO2. ""If you emit a tonne of methane today, in a decade's time, I would expect half that tonne to remain in the atmosphere,"" said Prof Thorne. ""In two decades, time, there would be a quarter of a tonne, so basically, if we managed to stop emitting methane today by the end of this century, emissions would be down to natural levels, that they were in about 1750."" In the short term, experts believe that if methane emissions were cut by 40-45% over the next decade, you'd shave 0.3C off the increase in global temperature by 2040. In a world where every fraction of a degree counts, that's a potentially huge difference to hopes of keeping the 1.5C threshold alive. What excites many researchers is the belief that are a range of relatively simple actions that can quickly curb the production of methane. ""It's relatively cheap to bring down some of the sources,"" said Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway University of London. ""In particular, I'm talking about leaks from the gas industry, which now are so much easier to find, than they were 10-20 years ago, because the instruments are so much better."" ""Some things we can do quite quickly - in the tropics, you can put soil on top of these huge urban landfills and you can do a lot about stopping crop waste fires."" Quick fixes really do work. In the US, efforts to collect gas from landfill sites saw methane emissions cut by 40% between 1990 and 2016. Collecting gas at landfill sites in the US has slashed methane from dumps In agriculture there are also many technical changes related to manure and animal feed that can make a difference in lowering emissions. But getting the really big cuts will require political action. In countries like Ireland and New Zealand, where farming plays a huge role in the economy, these changes are contentious. To succeed, they will have to be fair and equitable. ""You can't just say that people can no longer keep cattle or sheep,"" said Prof Thorne. ""It needs policies to aid a transition to other means of managing the land, but it is not going to happen by people pronouncing you can't keep livestock any longer, it needs to be a much more nuanced approach."" Consumer choice when it comes to dairy and meat will certainly impact this sector. The oil and gas industry also faces a massive challenge in curbing methane. Regulations to date have failed to stop leaks, but there's a growing interest among fossil fuel companies in using technology that can rapidly identify and stem the emissions. ""If you look at it from an objective standpoint, the industry is improving, they are improving the leaks, they are improving the number of incidents, but it's not quick enough,"" said Arnel Santos, a 25-year oil industry veteran with Shell and now chief operating office of energy technology company mCloud Technologies. ""We need to go faster with respect to this challenge, to really show we can quickly deploy technology to augment what they're doing, because the improvements to date will not be quick enough with what we're seeing."" Agriculture is one of the sources of methane that is difficult to tackle Perhaps the biggest change that's required is to separate out methane from other warming gases on the international stage. There are worries that because UN climate negotiators deal with all greenhouse gases in the same process, there are concerns they may make trade-offs, comparisons and compromises on methane that muddy efforts to reduce these emissions. Many are now calling for a separate process for methane, along the lines of the Montreal Protocol, thatsuccessfully brought countries together to regulate ozone-depleting gases. ""To halt long-term warming, we need to halt carbon dioxide emissions,"" said Prof Thorne. ""But to aid us on that path, we could treat these gases differently. And if we were to treat methane differently, it might buy us time to adapt to the changes that are occurring."" ""It's carbon dioxide that absolutely needs to get to net zero. But if we are to halt long term warming, methane can absolutely help us on the way.""

Disability blogger stranded after hotel shower fall,"Jennie Berry posted about her ordeal to show ""the harsh reality"" disabled people face A disability campaigner was left naked and feeling vulnerable when she fell in a hotel bathroom where an emergency alarm cord was tied up out of reach. Jennie Berry, a wheelchair user from Hartlepool, lay on the floor for 20 minutes after the accessible shower seat broke in her room on Saturday. The 28-year-old managed to ""wriggle"" to a second alarm but when staff turned up they were unaware of how to lift her. The Mama Shelter London apologised and said it would increase training.

"First Scottish pupils back at school for new termThe return to classrooms comes days after most Covid restrictions were lifted, but many safety protocols remain.ScotlandComments","The first school pupils in Scotland are set to to return from their summer break days after most Covid restrictions were lifted. Pupils will be back in classrooms in Angus for the first time since the move beyond level zero on Monday. The majority of Scottish schools return on Wednesday and Thursday next week. But there will be no return to the ""normal"" school day as many Covid safety protocols will remain in place for at least six weeks. This includes all teachers and senior pupils being asked to wear face coverings while indoors. There must also be physical distancing of at least one metre (3ft) between all staff, as well as staff and pupils. Most Covid rules to end in Scotland from 9 August Is the coronavirus pandemic over at last? Class ""bubbles"" will be scrapped but thelatest Scottish government guidelines,externaladvise staff to continue to avoid assemblies or large groupings of children. And parents will only be allowed inside school buildings where ""agreed by school and strictly necessary"", for example where a child needs support with the transition from nursery to P1. The government says it is taking a ""precautionary approach"" to the new term as there will be large numbers of unvaccinated children and young people in schools. In the guidance, it describes schools as a ""unique environment"" in this respect, and not comparable to other situations in society where large gatherings can take place. However, the blanket self-isolation of whole classes following a positive Covid testwill no longer be ""routine"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said children identified as close contacts will not have to isolate if they test negative, after thousands of pupils had to do so in the summer term. At one point in June there were more than 24,000 in self-isolation, only slightly lower than a peak of almost 30,000 last autumn. The return of schools last August saw the beginning of an upward trend of positive Covid cases. Angus is the only council area with schools going back on Wednesday 11 August. East Dunbartonshire and Western Isles will follow on Thursday 12 August, while the other start dates are: Aberdeen City - Tuesday 17 August Aberdeenshire - Tuesday 17 August AngusWednesday 11 August Argyll and ButeMonday 16 August Clackmannanshire - Wednesday 18 August Dumfries and Galloway - Thursday 19 August Dundee - Tuesday 17 August East Ayrshire - Thursday 19 August East Dunbartonshire - Thursday 12 August East Lothian - Wednesday 18 August East Renfrewshire - Wednesday 18 August Edinburgh - Wednesday 18 August Falkirk - Wednesday 18 August Fife - Wednesday 18 August Glasgow - Monday 16 August Highland - Tuesday 17 August Inverclyde - Wednesday 18 August Midlothian - Wednesday 18 August Moray - Tuesday 17 August North Ayrshire - Wednesday 18 August North Lanarkshire - Monday 16 August Orkney Islands - Tuesday 17 August Perth and Kinross - Wednesday 18 August Renfrewshire - Monday 16 August Scottish Borders - Wednesday 18 August Shetland Islands - Wednesday 18 August South Ayrshire - Thursday 19 August South Lanarkshire - Monday 16 August Stirling -Wednesday 18 August West Dunbartonshire - Tuesday 17 August Western Isles - Thursday 12 August West Lothian - Tuesday 17 August In other changes to the guidance, only pupils aged 12 and over will have to wear face coverings on school transport. This brings the school transport rules in line with wider society, after the government announced thatchildren under the age of 12 would no longer need to wear masksin indoor public places. The easing of restrictions since the end of the last term means all drama, music, PE and dance can go ahead - with the mitigations of good ventilation and hygiene. Residential school trips can also take place, though there remain limits on the number of children who can share a room or a tent. Ahead of the return this term, all school staff and secondary school pupils have been asked to take a lateral flow test one or two days before they return. They should then take them twice a week. After six weeks, ""once all staff have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated"" the asymptomatic testing programme will be reviewed, the guidance states. In the future one option under consideration is that asymptomatic testing of school children is only used in areas where the virus is prevalent in the local community. Teenagers aged 16 and 17 are now being offered the Pfizer vaccine in Scotland The cautious approach to the return to school is largely due to levels of vaccination among pupils. Most children returning to school will not have been vaccinated as thejab is only being offered to 16 and 17-year-oldsand anyone 12 or over who is athigher risk of falling ill from Covid. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes that the UK's vaccine advisory group will recommend the jab for more young people in the future. Schools in Angus are returning before other council areas having taken the decision to end the previous term earlier than normal. The school rolls across the area will include 1,064 new Primary 1 pupils. Councillor Ron Sturrock, vice convener of the council's children and learning committee, said: ""Our schools have worked hard to make sure they are fully prepared, and I know they are really looking forward to welcoming pupils back.""

But before we do, here's a round-up of the main developments today:   German authorities have appealed for thousands of people to get another dose of their Covid vaccine, after a police investigation found that a Red Cross nurse may have injected them with saline solution instead. Around 8,600 may have been affected by the nurse's actions at a vaccination centre in Friesland, northern Germany.

Read more Europe's drugs regulator has said it is looking into whether three new conditions may be side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says it is studying a small number of cases of erythema multiforme, a type of allergic skin reaction, and glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, disorders related to the kidneys. The EMA did not say how many cases have been reported, but it has requested more data from Pfizer and Moderna to study any potential relations. Last month, the EMA found a possible link between mRNA vaccines and a very rare form of heart inflammation. But the regulator, and the World Health Organisation, have stressed the benefits from these vaccines outweighs any risks. The Australian Olympics Committee (AOC) has said it is ""cruel"" for Olympians to quarantine for 28 days after the return home. Athletes returning via Sydney to the state of South Australia are facing an extra two-week quarantine - on top of the 14 days already required for all overseas arrivals. ""While other countries are celebrating the return of their athletes, we are subjecting ours to the most cruel and uncaring treatment,"" the AOC said in a statement. The government of South Australia said it had turned down the AOC's request for the additional requirements to be waived because of ""the high risk of the Delta strain."" Read more here. More than 47.1 million people - 89.1% of the UK adult population - have had their first dose of a Covid jab, according to the latest government figures. Of those, more than 39.8 million people - or 75.3% of adults - have also had their second jab. Another 29,612 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK and a further 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures. But these figures do not include data from Wales due to a technical issue. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, has toldBBC Radio 5 Livethat some PCR testing companies are âgaming the systemâ and
pricing people out of the market. He also questioned why people who have received both jabs
needed to take the tests in the first place. ""If you look at whatâs happening across Europe for
fully-jabbed passengers, PCR tests arenât required, quarantine isnât required

Smaller numbers also took part in the parade in 2020 Northern Ireland's annual Apprentice Boys Relief of Derry parade will take place on Saturday but on a reduced scale due to the pandemic, organisers have said. Governor of the Apprentice Boys, Graeme Stenhouse, said only 18 local clubs and bands would be permitted to take part in the parade this year.

France has announced it will end free non-prescription coronavirus tests from mid-October, in a bid to encourage more people to get vaccinated. The government will also set up a campaign for people to receive booster jabs from the middle of September, with the first jabs available at the end of this month. It comes a day after neighbouring Germany announced that it, too, would be ending free tests. President Emmanuel Macron has held a virtual meeting with senior cabinet ministers today, as cases continue to surge in France and its overseas territories. To help curb the spread, the government made it mandatory for anyone entering a restaurant, train or other public space to show a health pass - proving they have been vaccinated or tested negative for Covid. An 11-year-old boy has spent his 500th night camping outside, as part of a fundraising challenge which started during lockdown. Max Woosey began sleeping in his garden in Devon on 28 March 2020 - shortly after lockdown measures were first introduced in the UK - when he heard hospice fundraising events were getting cancelled because of the pandemic. He was inspired by a family friend who died of cancer and left Max his tent. Since then, he has raised more than Â£640,000 for the North Devon Hospice, which cared for his neighbour. Max has camped out at a variety of locations, ranging from his back garden to London Zoo and 10 Downing Street. To mark the latest milestone, he built a woodland shelter with his parents and best friends. ""I thought for my 500th night it would be a bit more crazy and a bit more fun,"" he says. Read more. Kenyan civil servants have until 23 August to get themselves vaccinated, or they'll face disciplinary action, according to a government letter that's been made public. ""Some public servants have deliberately avoided getting vaccinated so that they can stay away from work under the guise of working from home,"" writes Jospeh Kinyua, Kenya's Head of Public Service. The move has not been entirely welcomed by Kenya's civil servants. âVaccination is voluntary - why are civil servants the only ones being punished?â says Tom Odege, secretary general of the Kenya Union of Civil Servants, speaking to Bloomberg News. âThe government should instead encourage civil servants to get vaccinated.â Kenya is seeing a surge in cases but vaccine rollouts remain slow. Less than 3% of the country's 47 million residents are fully inoculated. The government has extended a night-time curfew until further notice, in an attempt to curb Covid cases. On Thursday parliament will also debate a motion to deny people access to private and public spaces if they aren't fully vaccinated or don't possess proof of a negative Covid test. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent The ""high cost, poor quality and lack of sequencing from PCR tests"" needs to be urgently addressed by the government, a  Commons committee chairman says. In a letter to Health Secretary Sajid Javid,external, Huw Merriman, the chairman of the transport select committee, says ""there needs to be a clear and compelling justification for the use of PCR tests"" in international travel as they are creating ""an unnecessary barrier to affordable international travel"". He argues that although the government has justified the use of PCR tests as they can be sequenced to identify variants of concern, the level of sequencing has dropped from 49% in early March to 5% in early July.

Today, BBC Radio 5 Live has been looking at the cost of PCR tests for people travelling abroad. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has asked the competition watchdog to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. Tim Hawkins is chief strategy officer of Manchester Airport Group which owns and runs Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports. He questioned whether the UK needed the tests when lots of countries aren't requiring them. ""It's certainly having a big drag effect on people's travel over the summer. Those are additional costs that people haven't factored in. ""Why do we need them at all? Lots of countries aren't requiring those tests but the UK is,"" he added. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. A group of high-level health officials in Thailand have called on the government to issue legal protections for healthcare personnel working to combat Covid. Leaders from a dozen public health bodies signed a statement calling for the measures, theBangkok Post reports.,external They said health workers should be shielded from liability because they often had to work with limited knowledge and resources, and were at risk of making honest mistakes. The statement added that protections would boost their confidence in the workplace, so they could continue serving the public interest. Thailand's government says it is in the process of drafting an executive decree to shield health workers from liability, in consultation with medical staff. In response to critics of the decree, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Tuesday that it is intended to protect healthcare professionals, not the government. We've already heard that Google in the US is considering cutting the pay of staff who work from home, but what is the work from home guidance in the UK? In England, people are are no longer being asked to work from home and a gradual return to workplaces is encouraged by the government. However, in the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep working at home where possible. You can ask to keep working from home in the future, but your employer doesn't have to agree. However, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development - which represents HR professionals - says there could be much greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work in future. ""People generally want a mix of workplace and home working, and the possibility of more choice in their working routines, meaning hybrid working can provide an effective balance for many workers."" The CIPD adds that the lifting of Covid restrictions ""shouldn't signal a mass return to workplaces,"" and ""it should be down to individual organisations, consulting with their people, to agree working arrangements"". On Monday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengrejected the idea that civil servants should be paid lessif they continue working from home. Read more inour explainer on the UK's working from home guidance Though you can't trust the British weather, many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer as travelling abroad is not as straightforward at the moment. So what are the current rules in the UK? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&Bs, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. But there are still some restrictions inNorthern Ireland.

Francis Goncalves told BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell the abusers believe him to be an actor, set up by broadcasters to spread a hoax. âPeople should be going to the doctor for advice on these things, but they listen to social media,â he said. All three of Francisâ relatives were scared by misinformation in regards to the Covid jab. Francis said it was difficult to counter the anti-vaccine rhetoric they were hearing as he didnât feel he had the medical background to change their mind. He urged people to ""take a step back, consider the information, consider the source, consider the quality"".  More businesses can now apply for free Covid testing kits under a Scottish government scheme. Organisations with 10 or more employees can sign up for the lateral flow kits. Testing regimes will be voluntary and firms can distribute the kits among employees or use them in workplaces. Workplace testing was previously targeted at crucial parts of the public sector, national infrastructure and private sector companies with a high risk of transmission.

France has announced it will end free non-prescription coronavirus tests from mid-October, in a bid to encourage more people to get vaccinated. The government will also set up a campaign for people to receive booster jabs from the middle of September, with the first jabs available at the end of this month. It comes a day after neighbouring Germany announced that it, too, would be ending free tests. President Emmanuel Macron has held a virtual meeting with senior cabinet ministers today, as cases continue to surge in France and its overseas territories. To help curb the spread, the government made it mandatory for anyone entering a restaurant, train or other public space to show a health pass - proving they have been vaccinated or tested negative for Covid. An 11-year-old boy has spent his 500th night camping outside, as part of a fundraising challenge which started during lockdown. Max Woosey began sleeping in his garden in Devon on 28 March 2020 - shortly after lockdown measures were first introduced in the UK - when he heard hospice fundraising events were getting cancelled because of the pandemic. He was inspired by a family friend who died of cancer and left Max his tent. Since then, he has raised more than Â£640,000 for the North Devon Hospice, which cared for his neighbour. Max has camped out at a variety of locations, ranging from his back garden to London Zoo and 10 Downing Street. To mark the latest milestone, he built a woodland shelter with his parents and best friends. ""I thought for my 500th night it would be a bit more crazy and a bit more fun,"" he says. Read more.

Leaders from a dozen public health bodies signed a statement calling for the measures, theBangkok Post reports.,external They said health workers should be shielded from liability because they often had to work with limited knowledge and resources, and were at risk of making honest mistakes. The statement added that protections would boost their confidence in the workplace, so they could continue serving the public interest. Thailand's government says it is in the process of drafting an executive decree to shield health workers from liability, in consultation with medical staff. In response to critics of the decree, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Tuesday that it is intended to protect healthcare professionals, not the government. We've already heard that Google in the US is considering cutting the pay of staff who work from home, but what is the work from home guidance in the UK? In England, people are are no longer being asked to work from home and a gradual return to workplaces is encouraged by the government. However, in the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep working at home where possible. You can ask to keep working from home in the future, but your employer doesn't have to agree. However, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development - which represents HR professionals - says there could be much greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work in future. ""People generally want a mix of workplace and home working, and the possibility of more choice in their working routines, meaning hybrid working can provide an effective balance for many workers."" The CIPD adds that the lifting of Covid restrictions ""shouldn't signal a mass return to workplaces,"" and ""it should be down to individual organisations, consulting with their people, to agree working arrangements"". On Monday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengrejected the idea that civil servants should be paid lessif they continue working from home. Read more inour explainer on the UK's working from home guidance Though you can't trust the British weather, many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer as travelling abroad is not as straightforward at the moment. So what are the current rules in the UK? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&Bs, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. But there are still some restrictions inNorthern Ireland.

Francis Goncalves told BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell the abusers believe him to be an actor, set up by broadcasters to spread a hoax. âPeople should be going to the doctor for advice on these things, but they listen to social media,â he said. All three of Francisâ relatives were scared by misinformation in regards to the Covid jab. Francis said it was difficult to counter the anti-vaccine rhetoric they were hearing as he didnât feel he had the medical background to change their mind. He urged people to ""take a step back, consider the information, consider the source, consider the quality"".  More businesses can now apply for free Covid testing kits under a Scottish government scheme. Organisations with 10 or more employees can sign up for the lateral flow kits. Testing regimes will be voluntary and firms can distribute the kits among employees or use them in workplaces. Workplace testing was previously targeted at crucial parts of the public sector, national infrastructure and private sector companies with a high risk of transmission. It comes after most Covid restrictions across Scotland were lifted on Monday. Read more. Â© 2025 BBC.

Deliveroo orders double as lockdown habits endure,"Deliveroo has said demand for its services has strengthened despite Covid restrictions easing. The food delivery firm saw orders double to 148.8 million in the first half of this year, while the value of its transactions also doubled. At the same time, it narrowed its pre-tax losses to Â£104.8m, as against Â£128.4m a year earlier. It was the first set of results from the company since it floated on the stock market in March. Deliveroo initially listed on the London stock exchange at 390p a share, butthe price fell sharply on the opening day of trading, 31 March. On Monday, its shares rallied on the news thatGerman rival Delivery Herohad bought a 5% stake in the company worth Â£284m. But in Wednesday trading, it was down 3.3% at 351p. Cooped-up consumers flocked to order from Deliveroo during the earlier stages of the pandemic, when restaurants were closed and people switched to home deliveries. The firm said it expected customer behaviour to moderate later in the year, but it remained ""excited about the opportunity ahead"". It added that its outlook for the remainder of the year continued to be ""optimistic but prudent, combining confidence in continued year-on-year growth in orders with an expectation that average order values revert towards pre-pandemic levels"". Deliveroo said its gross transaction value for the six months was Â£3.4bn, a 99% rise from the same period in 2020. It repeated an earlier forecast that gross transaction value for the whole of 2021 would be 50% to 60% up on last year. Founder and chief executive Will Shu said: ""We are seeing strong growth and engagement across our marketplace as lockdowns continue to ease. ""Demand has been high amongst consumers. We have widened our consumer base, seen people continuing to order frequently and we now work with more food merchants than any other platform in the UK. ""At the same time, more riders are choosing to continue to work with the company because they value the work we offer."" By Rob Young, business correspondent Food delivery companies have been some of the standout winners of the pandemic. With people cooped up at home and dining in restaurants banned, a takeaway was for many the highlight of the lockdown week. Some analysts have questioned how much of that surge in business will persist as restaurants reopen. Interestingly, Deliveroo says orders are ""proving resilient"" since the re-emergence of the hospitality industry. But it doesn't expect that to remain the case forever. There are warnings that consumer behaviour ""may moderate"" later in the year and that the value (but not necessarily the number) of orders will return ""towards"" pre-pandemic levels. The company has diversified, though - it now delivers groceries from the likes of Waitrose, Co-op and Aldi. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has described Deliveroo as a ""true British tech success story"". By many measures, it is. But it's not yet a financial success. Despite the huge increase in business over the past year, Deliveroo still didn't make a profit. Its losses were smaller than a year ago, but the company ended the first half Â£104.8m in the red. Investors - who were lukewarm on the company's shares when they started trading in March - may be wondering: if Deliveroo can't make a profit when eating in restaurants isn't allowed, when can it? Deliveroo said it now covered 72% of the UK population. This was ahead of its plans, which had envisaged 67% coverage by the end of this year. In all, it operates in 11 countries, including Australia, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. However, it said it had now decided to pull out of Spain, because ""achieving a top-tier market position would require a disproportionate level of investment with highly uncertain long-term potential returns"". The move comes after the Spanish government announced plans to give more employment rights to workers at food delivery firms and other online services.

But before we do, here's a round-up of the main developments today:   German authorities have appealed for thousands of people to get another dose of their Covid vaccine, after a police investigation found that a Red Cross nurse may have injected them with saline solution instead. Around 8,600 may have been affected by the nurse's actions at a vaccination centre in Friesland, northern Germany. Officials said dud jabs were administered in spring this year and would have had no adverse health impact on anyone affected. âI am totally shocked by this episode,â said Sven Ambrosy, a local councillor, ina post on Facebook.,external""The most important thing for us is to inform these people, answer their questions and offer further vaccination."" It is not clear if the suspect has been arrested or charged over the incident. Local broadcaster NDR said the case had been handed to a special police unit that investigates politically-motivated crimes.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says it is studying a small number of cases of erythema multiforme, a type of allergic skin reaction, and glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, disorders related to the kidneys. The EMA did not say how many cases have been reported, but it has requested more data from Pfizer and Moderna to study any potential relations. Last month, the EMA found a possible link between mRNA vaccines and a very rare form of heart inflammation. But the regulator, and the World Health Organisation, have stressed the benefits from these vaccines outweighs any risks. The Australian Olympics Committee (AOC) has said it is ""cruel"" for Olympians to quarantine for 28 days after the return home. Athletes returning via Sydney to the state of South Australia are facing an extra two-week quarantine - on top of the 14 days already required for all overseas arrivals.

In response to critics of the decree, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Tuesday that it is intended to protect healthcare professionals, not the government. We've already heard that Google in the US is considering cutting the pay of staff who work from home, but what is the work from home guidance in the UK? In England, people are are no longer being asked to work from home and a gradual return to workplaces is encouraged by the government. However, in the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep working at home where possible. You can ask to keep working from home in the future, but your employer doesn't have to agree. However, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development - which represents HR professionals - says there could be much greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work in future. ""People generally want a mix of workplace and home working, and the possibility of more choice in their working routines, meaning hybrid working can provide an effective balance for many workers."" The CIPD adds that the lifting of Covid restrictions ""shouldn't signal a mass return to workplaces,"" and ""it should be down to individual organisations, consulting with their people, to agree working arrangements"". On Monday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengrejected the idea that civil servants should be paid lessif they continue working from home. Read more inour explainer on the UK's working from home guidance Though you can't trust the British weather, many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer as travelling abroad is not as straightforward at the moment. So what are the current rules in the UK? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&Bs, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. But there are still some restrictions inNorthern Ireland.

Francis Goncalves told BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell the abusers believe him to be an actor, set up by broadcasters to spread a hoax. âPeople should be going to the doctor for advice on these things, but they listen to social media,â he said. All three of Francisâ relatives were scared by misinformation in regards to the Covid jab. Francis said it was difficult to counter the anti-vaccine rhetoric they were hearing as he didnât feel he had the medical background to change their mind. He urged people to ""take a step back, consider the information, consider the source, consider the quality"".  More businesses can now apply for free Covid testing kits under a Scottish government scheme. Organisations with 10 or more employees can sign up for the lateral flow kits. Testing regimes will be voluntary and firms can distribute the kits among employees or use them in workplaces. Workplace testing was previously targeted at crucial parts of the public sector, national infrastructure and private sector companies with a high risk of transmission. It comes after most Covid restrictions across Scotland were lifted on Monday. Read more. Â© 2025 BBC.

First Scottish pupils back at school for new term,"The first school pupils in Scotland are set to to return from their summer break days after most Covid restrictions were lifted. Pupils will be back in classrooms in Angus for the first time since the move beyond level zero on Monday. The majority of Scottish schools return on Wednesday and Thursday next week. But there will be no return to the ""normal"" school day as many Covid safety protocols will remain in place for at least six weeks. This includes all teachers and senior pupils being asked to wear face coverings while indoors. There must also be physical distancing of at least one metre (3ft) between all staff, as well as staff and pupils. Most Covid rules to end in Scotland from 9 August Is the coronavirus pandemic over at last? Class ""bubbles"" will be scrapped but thelatest Scottish government guidelines,externaladvise staff to continue to avoid assemblies or large groupings of children. And parents will only be allowed inside school buildings where ""agreed by school and strictly necessary"", for example where a child needs support with the transition from nursery to P1. The government says it is taking a ""precautionary approach"" to the new term as there will be large numbers of unvaccinated children and young people in schools. In the guidance, it describes schools as a ""unique environment"" in this respect, and not comparable to other situations in society where large gatherings can take place. However, the blanket self-isolation of whole classes following a positive Covid testwill no longer be ""routine"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said children identified as close contacts will not have to isolate if they test negative, after thousands of pupils had to do so in the summer term. At one point in June there were more than 24,000 in self-isolation, only slightly lower than a peak of almost 30,000 last autumn. The return of schools last August saw the beginning of an upward trend of positive Covid cases. Angus is the only council area with schools going back on Wednesday 11 August. East Dunbartonshire and Western Isles will follow on Thursday 12 August, while the other start dates are: Aberdeen City - Tuesday 17 August Aberdeenshire - Tuesday 17 August AngusWednesday 11 August Argyll and ButeMonday 16 August Clackmannanshire - Wednesday 18 August Dumfries and Galloway - Thursday 19 August Dundee - Tuesday 17 August East Ayrshire - Thursday 19 August East Dunbartonshire - Thursday 12 August East Lothian - Wednesday 18 August East Renfrewshire - Wednesday 18 August Edinburgh - Wednesday 18 August Falkirk - Wednesday 18 August Fife - Wednesday 18 August Glasgow - Monday 16 August Highland - Tuesday 17 August Inverclyde - Wednesday 18 August Midlothian - Wednesday 18 August Moray - Tuesday 17 August North Ayrshire - Wednesday 18 August North Lanarkshire - Monday 16 August Orkney Islands - Tuesday 17 August Perth and Kinross - Wednesday 18 August Renfrewshire - Monday 16 August Scottish Borders - Wednesday 18 August Shetland Islands - Wednesday 18 August South Ayrshire - Thursday 19 August South Lanarkshire - Monday 16 August Stirling -Wednesday 18 August West Dunbartonshire - Tuesday 17 August Western Isles - Thursday 12 August West Lothian - Tuesday 17 August In other changes to the guidance, only pupils aged 12 and over will have to wear face coverings on school transport. This brings the school transport rules in line with wider society, after the government announced thatchildren under the age of 12 would no longer need to wear masksin indoor public places. The easing of restrictions since the end of the last term means all drama, music, PE and dance can go ahead - with the mitigations of good ventilation and hygiene. Residential school trips can also take place, though there remain limits on the number of children who can share a room or a tent. Ahead of the return this term, all school staff and secondary school pupils have been asked to take a lateral flow test one or two days before they return. They should then take them twice a week. After six weeks, ""once all staff have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated"" the asymptomatic testing programme will be reviewed, the guidance states. In the future one option under consideration is that asymptomatic testing of school children is only used in areas where the virus is prevalent in the local community. Teenagers aged 16 and 17 are now being offered the Pfizer vaccine in Scotland The cautious approach to the return to school is largely due to levels of vaccination among pupils. Most children returning to school will not have been vaccinated as thejab is only being offered to 16 and 17-year-oldsand anyone 12 or over who is athigher risk of falling ill from Covid. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes that the UK's vaccine advisory group will recommend the jab for more young people in the future. Schools in Angus are returning before other council areas having taken the decision to end the previous term earlier than normal. The school rolls across the area will include 1,064 new Primary 1 pupils. Councillor Ron Sturrock, vice convener of the council's children and learning committee, said: ""Our schools have worked hard to make sure they are fully prepared, and I know they are really looking forward to welcoming pupils back.""

But before we do, here's a round-up of the main developments today:   German authorities have appealed for thousands of people to get another dose of their Covid vaccine, after a police investigation found that a Red Cross nurse may have injected them with saline solution instead. Around 8,600 may have been affected by the nurse's actions at a vaccination centre in Friesland, northern Germany. Officials said dud jabs were administered in spring this year and would have had no adverse health impact on anyone affected. âI am totally shocked by this episode,â said Sven Ambrosy, a local councillor, ina post on Facebook.,external""The most important thing for us is to inform these people, answer their questions and offer further vaccination."" It is not clear if the suspect has been arrested or charged over the incident. Local broadcaster NDR said the case had been handed to a special police unit that investigates politically-motivated crimes. Premier League fans will face random spot-checks of their Covid-19 status at grounds in the first few matchdays of the season, the league says. The top flight hasannounced protocols for the new season,external, saying fans must be prepared to prove they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours. Fans will be able to show their Covid-19 status using the NHS Covid pass through the NHS app or website. The league is preparing in case it becomes mandatory for all fans to have their coronavirus status checked. The 2021/2022 season begins on Friday, when Brentford host Arsenal at 20:00 BST in the opening game. Read more Europe's drugs regulator has said it is looking into whether three new conditions may be side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says it is studying a small number of cases of erythema multiforme, a type of allergic skin reaction, and glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, disorders related to the kidneys. The EMA did not say how many cases have been reported, but it has requested more data from Pfizer and Moderna to study any potential relations. Last month, the EMA found a possible link between mRNA vaccines and a very rare form of heart inflammation. But the regulator, and the World Health Organisation, have stressed the benefits from these vaccines outweighs any risks. The Australian Olympics Committee (AOC) has said it is ""cruel"" for Olympians to quarantine for 28 days after the return home. Athletes returning via Sydney to the state of South Australia are facing an extra two-week quarantine - on top of the 14 days already required for all overseas arrivals. ""While other countries are celebrating the return of their athletes, we are subjecting ours to the most cruel and uncaring treatment,"" the AOC said in a statement. The government of South Australia said it had turned down the AOC's request for the additional requirements to be waived because of ""the high risk of the Delta strain."" Read more here. More than 47.1 million people - 89.1% of the UK adult population - have had their first dose of a Covid jab, according to the latest government figures. Of those, more than 39.8 million people - or 75.3% of adults - have also had their second jab. Another 29,612 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK and a further 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures. But these figures do not include data from Wales due to a technical issue. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, has toldBBC Radio 5 Livethat some PCR testing companies are âgaming the systemâ and
pricing people out of the market. He also questioned why people who have received both jabs
needed to take the tests in the first place. ""If you look at whatâs happening across Europe for
fully-jabbed passengers, PCR tests arenât required, quarantine isnât required
and pre-departure tests arenât required so we are an outlier across Europe and I
think thatâs impacting on bookings. ""Weâre only about 19% of where we were in 2019. ""Thereâs a reason why the Europeans arenât doing this,â he

Smaller numbers also took part in the parade in 2020 Northern Ireland's annual Apprentice Boys Relief of Derry parade will take place on Saturday but on a reduced scale due to the pandemic, organisers have said. Governor of the Apprentice Boys, Graeme Stenhouse, said only 18 local clubs and bands would be permitted to take part in the parade this year. Last year the parade was reduced to just 30 representatives. Organisers said large numbers ""would be irresponsible"" in the current climate.

France has announced it will end free non-prescription coronavirus tests from mid-October, in a bid to encourage more people to get vaccinated. The government will also set up a campaign for people to receive booster jabs from the middle of September, with the first jabs available at the end of this month. It comes a day after neighbouring Germany announced that it, too, would be ending free tests. President Emmanuel Macron has held a virtual meeting with senior cabinet ministers today, as cases continue to surge in France and its overseas territories. To help curb the spread, the government made it mandatory for anyone entering a restaurant, train or other public space to show a health pass - proving they have been vaccinated or tested negative for Covid. An 11-year-old boy has spent his 500th night camping outside, as part of a fundraising challenge which started during lockdown. Max Woosey began sleeping in his garden in Devon on 28 March 2020 - shortly after lockdown measures were first introduced in the UK - when he heard hospice fundraising events were getting cancelled because of the pandemic. He was inspired by a family friend who died of cancer and left Max his tent. Since then, he has raised more than Â£640,000 for the North Devon Hospice, which cared for his neighbour. Max has camped out at a variety of locations, ranging from his back garden to London Zoo and 10 Downing Street. To mark the latest milestone, he built a woodland shelter with his parents and best friends. ""I thought for my 500th night it would be a bit more crazy and a bit more fun,"" he says. Read more. Kenyan civil servants have until 23 August to get themselves vaccinated, or they'll face disciplinary action, according to a government letter that's been made public. ""Some public servants have deliberately avoided getting vaccinated so that they can stay away from work under the guise of working from home,"" writes Jospeh Kinyua, Kenya's Head of Public Service. The move has not been entirely welcomed by Kenya's civil servants. âVaccination is voluntary - why are civil servants the only ones being punished?â says Tom Odege, secretary general of the Kenya Union of Civil Servants, speaking to Bloomberg News. âThe government should instead encourage civil servants to get vaccinated.â Kenya is seeing a surge in cases but vaccine rollouts remain slow. Less than 3% of the country's 47 million residents are fully inoculated. The government has extended a night-time curfew until further notice, in an attempt to curb Covid cases. On Thursday parliament will also debate a motion to deny people access to private and public spaces if they aren't fully vaccinated or don't possess proof of a negative Covid test. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent The ""high cost, poor quality and lack of sequencing from PCR tests"" needs to be urgently addressed by the government, a  Commons committee chairman says. In a letter to Health Secretary Sajid Javid,external, Huw Merriman, the chairman of the transport select committee, says ""there needs to be a clear and compelling justification for the use of PCR tests"" in international travel as they are creating ""an unnecessary barrier to affordable international travel"". He argues that although the government has justified the use of PCR tests as they can be sequenced to identify variants of concern, the level of sequencing has dropped from 49% in early March to 5% in early July.

Today, BBC Radio 5 Live has been looking at the cost of PCR tests for people travelling abroad. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has asked the competition watchdog to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. Tim Hawkins is chief strategy officer of Manchester Airport Group which owns and runs Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports. He questioned whether the UK needed the tests when lots of countries aren't requiring them. ""It's certainly having a big drag effect on people's travel over the summer. Those are additional costs that people haven't factored in. ""Why do we need them at all? Lots of countries aren't requiring those tests but the UK is,"" he added.

Facebook removes anti-vax influencer campaign,"Facebook has removed hundreds of accounts which it says were involved in anti-vax disinformation campaigns operated from Russia. The company said the network of accounts targeted India, Latin America and the US. They attempted to recruit influencers to spread false claims to undermine public confidence in particular Covid-19 vaccines, it added. In itslatest report,externalon ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"", Facebook said it found links between the network and a botched disinformation campaign from influencer marketing agency Fazze - which is part of a Russian-based company called AdNow. Last month aBBC Trending investigationreported how in May this year influencers had been offered money by Fazze to spread false claims about the risks associated with the Pfizer vaccine. According to Facebook, that was the second wave of attempts by the network to smear Western vaccines. Their investigation found that from November 2020 the same network attempted to falsely paint the AstraZeneca vaccine as dangerous because it uses a harmless adenovirus taken from chimpanzees. This meme was shared by fake accounts in the network Posts from accounts in the network spread memes that used images from the Planet of Apes films to give the impression the vaccine would turn people into monkeys. These posts appeared on Facebook in Hindi around the same time the Indian government was discussing emergency authorisation for the AstraZeneca vaccine. The campaign used fake accounts, some of which Facebook says probably originated from account farms in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Facebook said it had removed 65 Facebook accounts and 243 Instagram accounts for violating their policy against foreign interference. Ben Nimmo, Facebook's threat intelligence lead, described the campaign as ""a disinformation laundromat"" which planted content on a few online forums and then amplified that content on other platforms. The operation spanned over a dozen platforms. Misleading posts appeared on Reddit and Medium, and petitions appeared on change.org expressing concern about the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. According to Facebook's report, these links were then shared by a handful of influencers on Instagram who used the same hashtags and made references to the fact that the AstraZeneca vaccine was derived from chimpanzee adenovirus. Both waves of the campaign were unsuccessful and failed to gain much traction - despite the diverse methods used. ""In addition to the previously-exposed efforts to enlist social media influencers, this operation appears to have used a whole range of tactics in a wider effort to seed misleading narratives online about Western-made Covid vaccines,"" said Jack Stubbs, Director of Investigations at social media analytics firm Graphika. ""There was a claimed hack-and-leak, the use of pay-to-publish pseudo-news sites, and a network of fake personas on Facebook and Instagram."" Mirko Dortschmann was one of the YouTubers who blew the whistle on the campaign Despite the best efforts of the campaign, Facebook's report observed sloppy practices, including mixing languages - such as posting Hindi language memes accompanied by hashtags in Portuguese. BBC Trending's investigation showed Fazze was part of a Russian company, AdNow. The BBC made repeated attempts to obtain a comment from AdNow's headquarters in Moscow, but received no response. However, a director of AdNow's British arm told the BBC that Fazze was being shut down. In response to accusations by a German politician that discrediting Western vaccines was in the interests of the Kremlin, the Russian Embassy in the UK said: ""We treat Covid-19 as a global threat and, thus, are not interested in undermining global efforts in the fight against it, with vaccinating people with the Pfizer vaccine as one of the ways to cope with the virus."" The BBC has again attempted to contact Fazze for comment but the emails sent to Fazze addresses still bounce back from AdNow's domain. Facebook says Fazze is now banned from their platform.

The government of South Australia said it had turned down the AOC's request for the additional requirements to be waived because of ""the high risk of the Delta strain."" Read more here. More than 47.1 million people - 89.1% of the UK adult population - have had their first dose of a Covid jab, according to the latest government figures. Of those, more than 39.8 million people - or 75.3% of adults - have also had their second jab. Another 29,612 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK and a further 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures. But these figures do not include data from Wales due to a technical issue. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, has toldBBC Radio 5 Livethat some PCR testing companies are âgaming the systemâ and
pricing people out of the market. He also questioned why people who have received both jabs
needed to take the tests in the first place. ""If you look at whatâs happening across Europe for
fully-jabbed passengers, PCR tests arenât required, quarantine isnât required
and pre-departure tests arenât required so we are an outlier across Europe and I
think thatâs impacting on bookings. ""Weâre only about 19% of where we were in 2019. ""Thereâs a reason why the Europeans arenât doing this,â he

Smaller numbers also took part in the parade in 2020 Northern Ireland's annual Apprentice Boys Relief of Derry parade will take place on Saturday but on a reduced scale due to the pandemic, organisers have said. Governor of the Apprentice Boys, Graeme Stenhouse, said only 18 local clubs and bands would be permitted to take part in the parade this year. Last year the parade was reduced to just 30 representatives. Organisers said large numbers ""would be irresponsible"" in the current climate. There is currently no limit on the number of people at outdoor public gatherings in Northern Ireland, although the risks need to be determined by the organiser. Read more. France has announced it will end free non-prescription coronavirus tests from mid-October, in a bid to encourage more people to get vaccinated. The government will also set up a campaign for people to receive booster jabs from the middle of September, with the first jabs available at the end of this month. It comes a day after neighbouring Germany announced that it, too, would be ending free tests. President Emmanuel Macron has held a virtual meeting with senior cabinet ministers today, as cases continue to surge in France and its overseas territories. To help curb the spread, the government made it mandatory for anyone entering a restaurant, train or other public space to show a health pass - proving they have been vaccinated or tested negative for Covid. An 11-year-old boy has spent his 500th night camping outside, as part of a fundraising challenge which started during lockdown. Max Woosey began sleeping in his garden in Devon on 28 March 2020 - shortly after lockdown measures were first introduced in the UK - when he heard hospice fundraising events were getting cancelled because of the pandemic. He was inspired by a family friend who died of cancer and left Max his tent. Since then, he has raised more than Â£640,000 for the North Devon Hospice, which cared for his neighbour. Max has camped out at a variety of locations, ranging from his back garden to London Zoo and 10 Downing Street. To mark the latest milestone, he built a woodland shelter with his parents and best friends. ""I thought for my 500th night it would be a bit more crazy and a bit more fun,"" he says. Read more. Kenyan civil servants have until 23 August to get themselves vaccinated, or they'll face disciplinary action, according to a government letter that's been made public. ""Some public servants have deliberately avoided getting vaccinated so that they can stay away from work under the guise of working from home,"" writes Jospeh Kinyua, Kenya's Head of Public Service. The move has not been entirely welcomed by Kenya's civil servants. âVaccination is voluntary - why are civil servants the only ones being punished?â says Tom Odege, secretary general of the Kenya Union of Civil Servants, speaking to Bloomberg News. âThe government should instead encourage civil servants to get vaccinated.â Kenya is seeing a surge in cases but vaccine rollouts remain slow. Less than 3% of the country's 47 million residents are fully inoculated. The government has extended a night-time curfew until further notice, in an attempt to curb Covid cases. On Thursday parliament will also debate a motion to deny people access to private and public spaces if they aren't fully vaccinated or don't possess proof of a negative Covid test. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent The ""high cost, poor quality and lack of sequencing from PCR tests"" needs to be urgently addressed by the government, a  Commons committee chairman says. In a letter to Health Secretary Sajid Javid,external, Huw Merriman, the chairman of the transport select committee, says ""there needs to be a clear and compelling justification for the use of PCR tests"" in international travel as they are creating ""an unnecessary barrier to affordable international travel"". He argues that although the government has justified the use of PCR tests as they can be sequenced to identify variants of concern, the level of sequencing has dropped from 49% in early March to 5% in early July.

Today, BBC Radio 5 Live has been looking at the cost of PCR tests for people travelling abroad. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has asked the competition watchdog to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. Tim Hawkins is chief strategy officer of Manchester Airport Group which owns and runs Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports. He questioned whether the UK needed the tests when lots of countries aren't requiring them. ""It's certainly having a big drag effect on people's travel over the summer. Those are additional costs that people haven't factored in. ""Why do we need them at all? Lots of countries aren't requiring those tests but the UK is,"" he added. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. A group of high-level health officials in Thailand have called on the government to issue legal protections for healthcare personnel working to combat Covid. Leaders from a dozen public health bodies signed a statement calling for the measures, theBangkok Post reports.,external They said health workers should be shielded from liability because they often had to work with limited knowledge and resources, and were at risk of making honest mistakes. The statement added that protections would boost their confidence in the workplace, so they could continue serving the public interest. Thailand's government says it is in the process of drafting an executive decree to shield health workers from liability, in consultation with medical staff. In response to critics of the decree, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Tuesday that it is intended to protect healthcare professionals, not the government. We've already heard that Google in the US is considering cutting the pay of staff who work from home, but what is the work from home guidance in the UK? In England, people are are no longer being asked to work from home and a gradual return to workplaces is encouraged by the government. However, in the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep working at home where possible. You can ask to keep working from home in the future, but your employer doesn't have to agree. However, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development - which represents HR professionals - says there could be much greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work in future. ""People generally want a mix of workplace and home working, and the possibility of more choice in their working routines, meaning hybrid working can provide an effective balance for many workers."" The CIPD adds that the lifting of Covid restrictions ""shouldn't signal a mass return to workplaces,"" and ""it should be down to individual organisations, consulting with their people, to agree working arrangements"". On Monday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengrejected the idea that civil servants should be paid lessif they continue working from home. Read more inour explainer on the UK's working from home guidance Though you can't trust the British weather, many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer as travelling abroad is not as straightforward at the moment. So what are the current rules in the UK? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&Bs, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. But there are still some restrictions inNorthern Ireland.

Francis Goncalves told BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell the abusers believe him to be an actor, set up by broadcasters to spread a hoax. âPeople should be going to the doctor for advice on these things, but they listen to social media,â he said. All three of Francisâ relatives were scared by misinformation in regards to the Covid jab. Francis said it was difficult to counter the anti-vaccine rhetoric they were hearing as he didnât feel he had the medical background to change their mind. He urged people to ""take a step back, consider the information, consider the source, consider the quality"".  More businesses can now apply for free Covid testing kits under a Scottish government scheme. Organisations with 10 or more employees can sign up for the lateral flow kits. Testing regimes will be voluntary and firms can distribute the kits among employees or use them in workplaces. Workplace testing was previously targeted at crucial parts of the public sector, national infrastructure and private sector companies with a high risk of transmission. It comes after most Covid restrictions across Scotland were lifted on Monday. Read more. Â© 2025 BBC.

Messi joins PSG on two-year dealLionel Messi signs a two-year deal with Paris St-Germain after leaving Barcelona.,"Lionel Messi joins fellow superstars Neymar and Kylian Mbappe at PSG Lionel Messi has signed a two-year contract with Paris St-Germain after leaving Barcelona. The 34-year-old's deal also has the option of a third year. Messi left Barca - the only club he has played for - as they were unable to afford a new deal under La Liga's financial fair play rules. ""I am impatient to start a new chapter of my career in Paris. The club and its vision are in perfect harmony with my ambitions,"" said the Argentina star. ""I know how talented the players and staff are here. I am determined to build, alongside them, something great for the club and for the fans. I can't wait to set foot on the Parc des Princes pitch."" 'Messi feels betrayed' - The inside track on superstar's 'heartbreaking' Barca exit Lionel Messi completes PSG move - reaction Bonus Football Daily podcast: Messi officially signs for PSG PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi said: ""I am delighted that Lionel Messi has chosen to join Paris St-Germain and we are proud to welcome him to Paris, with his family. ""He did not hide his desire to continue to evolve at the highest level and to win trophies. The ambition of the club is of course identical. ""The addition of Leo to our world-class team confirms the relevance and success of our recruitment. Together with our great coach and his staff, I look forward to seeing our team make history for all of our supporters around the world."" This video can not be played Lionel Messi: Ten great goals for Barcelona Considered one of the greatest players of all time, Messi scored a record 672 goals in 778 games for Barca, the club he joined as a 13-year-old. The striker has won the Ballon d'Or a record six times and lifted 35 trophies with the Catalan club. He becomes PSG's fourth free-transfer signing this summer after the arrivals of Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, Spain defender Sergio Ramos and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Highly rated Morocco right-back Achraf Hakimi also joined from Inter Milan. Messi, who will wear the number 30 shirt, will play in a front three alongside the two most expensive players of all time - Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. A PSG news conference will take place in the auditorium of the Parc des Princes on Wednesday at 10:00 BST. Messi could make his PSG debut at home to Strasbourg on Saturday. Pictures of Lionel Messi are being taken down at the Nou Camp Keeping Messi at the Nou Camp had been president Joan Laporta's top priority this summer, but attempts to agree a new contract were severely complicated by the club's financial problems. He officially became a free agent when his previous deal expired on 1 July, but it was still widely anticipated he would stay. However, Barcelona confirmed last week that Messi would be leaving the club because of""financial and structural obstacles"". On Sunday he broke down in tears at a news conference in which he admitted he did not want to leave Barcelona, but had no choice. Messi had agreed a new deal - on 50% of his old wages - to stay at Barcelona but the club could not afford to implement it because they were so far above the wage limit allowed by La Liga. ""He used to earn 140m euros gross a year at Barca, that's around Â£125m,"" BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Take off about 40-50% for tax. ""He agreed to stay at Barcelona by reducing his wages by 50%, not more than that because that's illegal [under Spanish law]. Basically the league wouldn't believe he was reducing his wages to zero, which is what Barcelona may have tried to do as they are 1bn euros in debt. Basically they cannot afford him."" The news sparked a scramble for his services, with Manchester City and Chelsea among those to be linked, but it is PSG who have won the race to secure the Argentine superstar's signature, seen as one of the most noteworthy captures in football's history. He will now form a formidable-looking strike force alongside his former Barca team-mate Neymar, France World Cup winner Mbappe and another Argentine, Mauro Icardi. Messi also joins international team-mates Angel di Maria and Leandro Paredes in the French capital, just three weeks after the trio helped Argentina win the Copa America for the first time in 28 years. Where will Messi, Neymar, Mbappe rank in the great forward lines? PSG are yet to win the Champions League in a decade of Qatari ownership and subsequent heavy investment, with the 2020 final defeat against Bayern Munich the closest they have come. Mauricio Pochettino's side also finished second to Lille in Ligue 1 last season. ""Clearly what PSG's ownership want is a team that is in the Champions League final every year,"" said Balague. ""With Messi you have an advantage. Mauricio Pochettino being in charge and his contract being renewed as well means they have an idea how to do that, and Messi will complement that. ""They will win the league, that's almost a given now, even though they lost last season. It will be a less competitive league which means he will be fresh of course, or should be, for the Champions League campaign."" 25 August 2020- Messi sends a fax to the club saying he wishes toexercise a clause in his contract, allowing him to leave for free with immediate effect. 4 September 2020-Messi says he is staying at Barcelonabecause it is ""impossible"" for any team to pay his 700m euro (Â£624m) release clause, which the club insist would have to be met. 27 October 2020- Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who had fallen out with Messi over his failed transfer request,resigns. 28 December 2020- Messi says he hopesto one day play in the United States, but is unsure of his future when his contract runs out. 31 January 2021- Barcelona say they will take ""appropriate legal action"" against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after itpublished details of Messi's contract, worth Â£492m over four years. 16 May 2021- Manager Ronald Koeman says he hopes Messi has not played his final home game for the club after a2-1 defeat by Celta Vigoended their title hopes and meant they finished outside the top two for the first time since 2007-08. 22 May 2021- Paris St-Germain are believed to be""looking closely"" at Messi's contractsituation. 28 May 2021- Barcelona president Joan Laporta says a new contract for Lionel Messi is""not done yet""but that ""things are going well"". 1 July 2021- Messi's Barcelona contract expires and hebecomes a free agent. 15 July 2021-Messi agrees to stay with Barcaon a deal until 2026 that includes reducing his wages. 5 August 2021- Barcelona announce Lionel Messiwill leave the club""because of financial and structural obstacles"". 8 August 2021- A tearful Messiconfirms his departure from Barcaand says a move to Paris St-Germain is ""a possibility"". 10 August 2021- BBC Sport's Guillem Balaguereveals Messi has signed for PSG- a deal confirmed by the club that night.
