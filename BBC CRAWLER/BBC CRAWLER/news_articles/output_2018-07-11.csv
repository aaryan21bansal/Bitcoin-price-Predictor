Trump wants Nato to double funding target,"This video can not be played In 2018, Donald Trump told Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg that Germany is ""totally controlled by Russia"" US President Donald Trump has urged Nato allies to commit 4% of their annual output (GDP) to military spending - double the current target. The White House confirmed he had made the remarks during the Western military alliance's summit in Brussels. The meeting also saw Mr Trump single out Germany for criticism over its defence spending. Nato's secretary-general said the main focus should be on all members reaching the current target of 2% of GDP. Jens Stoltenberg declined to answer a specific question about Mr Trump's remarks, but told reporters: ""I think we should first get to 2%, focus on that now... the good thing is that we are moving to that."" For decades after the end of the Cold War, he said, Nato countries had cut defence budgets as tensions fell - and now needed to increase them at a time when tensions were rising. Can Nato survive Donald Trump? What does the US contribute to Nato? Previous US presidents have urged Europe to take more responsibility for their defence and reduce the burden on US taxpayers of maintaining forces in Europe long after the end of the Cold War - but none as bluntly as Mr Trump. Confirming Mr Trump's comments, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: ""President Trump wants to see our allies share more of the burden and at a very minimum meet their already stated obligations."" The Brussels meeting comes less than a week beforeMr Trump is due to hold his first summit with Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, reviving concerns among US allies over his proximity to the Russian president. German troops in Lithuania this summer Mr Trump's main objection is that all but a handful of member states have still not increased their defence budgets to meet a goal of spending at least 2% of their annual economic output on defence by 2024. Of Nato's 29 members, just five meet that target this year: the US, Greece, Estonia, the UK and Latvia. However, several, such as Poland and France, are close to the mark. Allow Twitter content?

At a news conference after the first meetings of leaders at the summit, Mr Stoltenberg insisted that more united Nato than divided it. ""We have had discussions, we do have disagreements, but most importantly we have decisions that are pushing this alliance forward and making us stronger. ""In the history of Nato we have had many disagreements and we have been able to overcome them again and again, because at the end of the day we all agree that North America and Europe are safer together."" All 29 Nato members released a declaration,externalwhich reaffirmed a commitment to increase military spending. The communique also condemned ""Russian aggression"", including the annexation of Crimea, the use of a nerve agent in southern England and ""election interference"". The BBC's James Cook, at the summit, says the question is, will President Trump take up those concerns directly with President Putin? Our correspondent adds that some European diplomats worry he will not, harbouring a suspicion that Mr Trump's commitment to the multilateral institutions which buttress the liberal world order is only skin deep. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent So is this mission accomplished at Nato for Donald Trump? Has he achieved his goal of persuading his European allies to spend more on defence? He began the day by calling them ""delinquents"" and ended it with smiles. The Nato summit communique contained the usual words about ""turning a corner"" in terms of defence spending, while recognising ""the need to do more"". How much more and how quickly still remains an issue, with Mr Trump suggesting that the benchmark Nato spending goal of 2% of GDP devoted to defence should be doubled to 4%. That is a level that all the allies apart from the US would struggle to attain. But the real underlying issue remains Mr Trump's commitment to Nato. Does he see it merely as a set of transactional relationships, or as an organisation enshrining the transatlantic partnership that has been the central element of European and US security since World War Two? Mr Trump clashed with Mrs Merkel ahead of the summit. The US president accused Germany of only spending ""a little bit over 1%"" of its economic output on defence compared to the 4.2% spent by the US ""in actual numbers"". Germany spends 1.24% of GDP on defence and the US 3.5%,external, according to the latest Nato estimate. The US leader also said: ""Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they will be getting from 60% to 70% of their energy from Russia, and a new pipeline, and you tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not and I think it's a very bad thing for Nato."" EU figures suggestRussia is responsible for between 50% and 75% of Germany's gas imports,external, but gas makes up less than 20% of Germany's energy mix for power production. Reality Check: How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? Mr Trump made more conciliatory remarks on Wednesday after he and Mrs Merkel met on the sidelines of the Brussels summit, saying defence spending and trade had been discussed. ""We have a very, very good relationship with the chancellor. We have a tremendous relationship with Germany,"" Mr Trump said. But he later repeated his criticism of Germany and other allies in a tweet: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs Merkel has responded by comparing German independence now with the time when she grew up in the former East Germany, a satellite of the then Soviet Union. Mrs Merkel told reporters: ""I am very happy that today we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions.""

Sky battle rages as Comcast offers ÃÂ£26bn,"Rurpert Murdoch's Fox is in a battle for control of Sky The battle for control of Sky has escalated after US media giant Comcast raised its offer for the broadcaster. The new offer, which values Sky at Â£26bn, trumped an earlier bid from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox. With 20 million subscribers in Europe, Sky is an attractive target. Its future is part of bigger battle among media companies such as Disney and Comcast as they respond to the challenge of newcomers such as Netflix. Comcast said it had ""long admired Sky"", adding: ""We believe it is an outstanding company and a great fit. Today's announcement further underscores Comcast's belief and its commitment to owning Sky."" It was now offering Â£14.75 a share for Sky compared with Â£14 from Fox. Comcast said its sweetened offer has been recommended by Sky's independent committee of directors. Rupert Murdoch's Fox has been waiting for approval from UK authorities before putting its offer to Sky shareholders. Fox expects the Culture Secretary, Jeremy Wright, to give it the go-ahead later on Thursday, with the condition that it sells Sky News. Fox increases Sky bid to Â£24.5bn Disney increases bid for Murdoch's Fox assets What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal? Comcast gatecrashed Mr Murdoch's attempt to buy the 61% of Sky his company did not already own in February while the Fox deal awaited government approval. Last month, the then Culture Secretary, Matt Hancock, said there would be no public interest concerns with a Comcast takeover of Sky. The skirmish for control of Sky is being fought in the shadow of an even bigger battle - a struggle for control of prized entertainment assets owned by Fox, including its stake in Sky. Disney and Comcast are locked in a battle for those businesses, which include movie studios, cable channels, National Geographic and a 30% stake in video website Hulu, as well as Indian network Star. In June,Disney raised its offerfor the assets to $71.3bn (Â£54bn) in cash and shares. Under the deal, Fox would keep Fox Sports, Fox News and Fox Television Stations and make them into a new company called ""New Fox"". Established media companies like Disney are looking for deals that would help them meet the challenge of fast-growing rivals including Netflix and Amazon. Hong Kong-based hedge fund Case Equity Partners, which has a stake in Sky, said the fact Disney was in a slightly more favourable position for Fox's US media assets meant that Comcast would fight even harder to win Sky.

New mums' data 'illegally sold to Labour',"Many families sign up to Emma's Diary because of the free products and discount coupons it offers A company that offers pregnant women and new parents health advice and gifts, faces a fine for illegally sharing more than a million people's personal data with the Labour Party. The UK's data watchdogintends to issue the owner of the Emma's Diary service,externala Â£140,000 penalty. It said Lifecycle Marketing had sold the data for use in the 2017 general election campaign without disclosing it might do so. The firm disputes the findings. It said it had not been given an opportunity to respond to the Information Commissioner's Office's complaints before the report was published ""As a result, details of the ICO's findings, including those being reported by the press, contain significant factual inaccuracies which we trust will be corrected,"" said a spokeswoman for Lifecycle Marketing. ""This includes the untrue claim that we sold data from expectant mothers to the Labour Party. Furthermore, Lifecycle has never been, nor ever will be, involved in collecting data from mothers in maternity wards."" It is common for political parties to buy personal information to target their campaigns, but appropriate consent must have been obtained by the providers. Labour has said that it will review its ""approach to acquiring data from third parties"" in light of the report. One legal expert said the intervention was likely to cause wider concern. Labour gained 32 seats in the 2017 general election ""After the Obama campaigns, political parties saw the need to step up their data game, and at the time the playing field was not worked out,"" said Sam Fowles from Cornerstone Barristers. ""They will certainly be worried now about whether they overstepped the mark in light of this."" The Information Commissioner's Office revealed its planned punishmentin a footnote to a report about the misuse of personal data during the Brexit referendum,external. It said it would not normally announce its intention to impose a fine until it had completed its inquiries, but believed in this case that there was an ""overriding public interest to do so"". Facebook faces maximum fine for data misuse Who are the firms selling your data? Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal The ICO said that on 5 May 2017, Lifecycle Marketing has supplied 1,065,200 records to the data broker Experian Marketing Services for use by Labour. Each record included: the name of the parent who had joined Emma's Diary their home address whether children up to the age of five were present the birth dates of the mother and children The ICO said the Buckinghamshire-based Lifecycle Marketing had understood the data would be used by a mail campaign promoting Labour's family-friendly policies in 106 constituencies. Emma's Diary is promoted by the Royal College of General Practitioners among others, and its information packs are distributed by many GPs and midwives. Many families sign up to Emma's Diary online or via its registration forms The benefits of joining include tailored emails with pregnancy and breastfeeding advice, as well as discount vouchers for high street stores and gift packs including nappies, baby wipes and other similar items. A companion app also allows mothers-to-be to keep a journal of their pregnancies and make a time-lapse video of their growing bumps. The business' privacy policy stated that in return for such benefits, users permit third parties to contact them for marketing purposes. But while the policy had listed several business sectors and specific companies that might get the data, the ICO said there had been no mention of political parties. In fact, the watchdog added, the policy was only amended to do so in January 2018 after the ICO had told the company it was under investigation. This, the regulator concluded, breached the Data Protection Act's ""fairness"" requirement that organisations be transparent about how gathered personal data might be used. It added that there may also have been a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. In considering the size of its penalty, the watchdog said it had taken into account that it understood Lifecycle Marketing had not shared personal data with a political party on any other occasion, and had expected the information to be deleted after the general election vote. But it added that it was not clear how the firm could be confident that the data had indeed been permanently erased. The ICO added that it would make a final ruling after hearing back from Lifecycle Marketing, and would confirm the size of the penalty on or after 30 July. ""[We] will be submitting our written representations to challenge the ICO's findings in accordance with the usual process,"" said a spokeswoman for Lifecycle Marketing in response. The Royal College of General Practitioners acknowledged it had a ""long-running relationship"" with Emma's Diary but added that it ""does not hold or receive data and has had no involvement in the case being investigated"". Experian Marketing Services said that it was aware of the ICO's concerns and would ""remain vigilant when it comes to data security and integrity"". A new law - GDPR - has introduced tougher penalties for data breaches The ICO has said it wants the UK's 11 main political parties to have their data-sharing practices audited later this year and said it also has ""outstanding enquiries with a number of data brokers"". ""[In the past] there had been a much looser interpretation of the fairness principle, and it wasn't applied as tightly and rigorously as it has been in this case,"" Mr Fowles explained. ""Now we see this is the direction of travel for the Information Commissioner, companies and political parties are going to have to think very carefully about what they told people when they took data from them.""

Grenfell 'first time' stay-put was dropped,"Jo Smith was on call on the night of the fire last June The fire room control manager who chose to abandon the ""stay put"" policy during the Grenfell fire said it was the first time such a decision had been made. The ""stay-put"" advice to residents was in place until 02:47 BST - nearly two hours after the fire started. But Jo Smith told an inquiry it was altered within 15 minutes of her arrival at the control room. She said information being fed to her led her to believe residents ""had no way of waiting to be rescued"". A ""stay put"" policy is based on the theory that buildings can be designed to prevent fire spreading, so a blaze in one flat should not be able to spread to another. But expert reports submitted to the inquiry suggest that since 1974, major changes to Grenfell Tower destroyed that protection. Ms Smith, a senior operations manager for the London Fire Brigade with 23 years experience, was on call on the night of the fire on 14 June 2017. After arriving at the control room in Stratford, she said she found two operators who had been speaking to single callers for about 45 minutes each. She said this indicated the situation was getting worse and made her ""increasingly uncomfortable with the 'stay put' policy"". Ms Smith said her experience of working during the Lakanal House fire - the 2009 London tower block fire in which six people were killed - formed part of her decision to change strategy. ""I was aware of the previous Lakanal incident in which residents were in cleaner situations, less smoke, who were unable to be rescued,"" she said in her witness statement. Why was 'stay put' advice so disastrous? What happened at Grenfell Tower? Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair Referring to the change from 'stay-put' to 'escape', Ms Smith told the inquiry: ""In practice, it's only ever been done once, to my knowledge."" The new advice to evacuate was then passed to fire brigade colleagues on the ground and residents on emergency calls. Residents were advised to ""get out, hold hands and get wet towels to put around themselves"". The inquiry heard that phone operator BT became involved in some of the calls, which would not happen in a normal incident, Ms Smith said. They too were told of the change in policy to pass on to residents. The control room received 344 calls relating to Grenfell on the night of the fire, the inquiry heard. Ms Smith described the influx as ""utterly relentless"". She said a conscious decision was made ""not to put the television news on during the incident"" which was broadcasting images of the burning tower. It was put to her that some operators had suggested seeing pictures of what was going on would have informed the advice they were giving. But Ms Smith said it would ""cause further distress"". ""A number of us felt it was detrimental to have that on the screens whilst they were talking to callers,"" she added. Ms Smith will continue giving evidence on Thursday, when the inquiry continues.

Belfast explosion believed to be a pipe bomb,"Police remove the remnants of a device from Clandeboye Drive A device that exploded in the Short Strand area of east Belfast is believed to have been a pipe bomb, police have said. The PSNI said they found the remnants of a device in Clandeboye Drive after reports of a ""loud bang"" at about 13:30 BST on Wednesday. The explosion came after contractors removed material from a bonfire on Cluan Place. A Sinn FÃ©in councillor described the incident as ""a sectarian attack"". Sinn FÃ©in councillor Mairead O'Donnell said the attack had raised tensions ""This was a reckless indiscriminate attack on homes in Clandeboye and it's fortunate that no one has been injured,"" said Mariead O'Donnell. ""This attack has naturally raised tensions in the local community and I am calling on people to remain calm."" Louise McCann, a resident on Clandeboye Drive, said she heard a ""deafening bang"".

'You gave us something to believe in',"England's World Cup semi-final was their first since 1990 - and ended in the pain of extra-time defeat Well, it was brilliant while it lasted, but England are coming home. England's bid to reach a first World Cup final since 1966 came to an end as they lost in extra time to Croatia in Moscow. But the mood on social media remained as positive as it has been for the past three weeks. Former England players shared their thoughts on the current team and focused on the future. The Duke of Cambridge, president of the Football Association, tweeted his support for the boys. Stars of the music industry were full of praise for Gareth Southgate and his youthful team's performance over the tournament. Pride was the feeling among stars of stage and screen. You'll have to forgive the sentimentality in all of this, but the Three Lions have lifted the mood of the English nation. They have reignited a passion in even the most cynical England fan who had suffered years of hurt. Jeremy Vine, the BBC Radio 2 and Eggheads presenter, has plans for Southgate and his waistcoat... But no one could have put it better than those in the England camp themselves... No, thank YOU.

"UK's Brexit blueprint to be publishedThe ""principled and practical"" package honours the referendum and meets business needs, ministers say.UK Politics","Donald Trump has raised questions about whether the UK's current Brexit plan is ""what they voted for"". The US president said ""Brexit is Brexit"" but it was turning out ""a little bit differently"" with the UK ""partially involved"" with the EU. ""Maybe they're taking a little bit of a different route,"" he went on. His comments at a press conference in Brussels were made before his visit to the UK - as details of Theresa May's Brexit plan were published. Asked about his remarks, Mrs May said her plan ""absolutely delivers on the Brexit people voted for"". Live: MPs updated on Brexit plans At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Trump 'fine' with protests as he lands in UK Mr Trump backed a Leave vote ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, when he was a US presidential candidate, and he was asked for his views at the Nato summit press conference. ""It's not for me to say,"" the US president said. ""I'd like to see them be able to work it out so it can go quickly, whatever they work out."" It's not the first Mr Trump has had his say on the UK's relationship with the EU: In May 2016, before the EU referendum, he said he thought the UK was ""better off without"" the European Union ""I'm not making that as a recommendation, just my feeling,"" he said, describing the migration crisis as a ""horrible thing for Europe"" and blaming the EU for driving it. In August 2016, after the UK had voted to leave, he tweeted: ""They will soon be calling me Mr Brexit!"" In January 2017, shortly after becoming president, he gave aninterview to Tory MP Michael Gove,external- a prominent Leave campaigner and former journalist - saying: ""I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing."" Also in that interview, the president said the EU was ""a vehicle for Germany"" and that the UK was ""so smart in getting out"". And asked why thought the UK voted to leave, he said that ""people don't want to have other people coming in and destroying their country"" Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, had encouraged a Remain vote, warning of the consequences for trade if the UK left the EU. Mrs May is under pressure over her proposals for a future trading relationship between the UK and EU. Senior ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned, saying they cannot support the proposals. Some Tory backbenchers and other Brexit campaigners are also unhappy, saying it means the UK will be too closely tied to the EU. The government has now published aWhite Paper,externalgiving more details of its plans. They are aimed at avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, securing frictionless trade with the EU while also leaving the single market and customs union and regaining control of the UK's borders. The UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services. There are also plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"", with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK. The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, after the 2016 referendum in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Brexit. The two sides are negotiating outstanding issues related to its departure as well as the outline of their future relationship once a proposed transition period comes to an end, on 31 December 2020. Both are aiming for an agreement by October, to allow enough time for the UK and European parliaments to vote on what is decided. Dominic Raab, who became Brexit secretary on Monday after Mr Davis quit, told people who are ""criticising or carping"" about the plan that they needed to come up with credible alternatives of their own. The White Paper is not the final deal, as the detailed talks are yet to take place with the EU. The EU has welcomed its publication and said it will respond when it has seen the plans in detail.

Kylie Jenner 'on track to be billionaire',"The reality television star is set to hit the milestone earlier than Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Kylie Jenner is worth $900m (Â£680m) at just 20 years of age, says Forbes. The business magazine said the social media star is on track to become ""the youngest-ever self-made billionaire"". The fashion guru, the youngest of the Kardashian clan, started selling her own cosmetics three years ago. Her most famous sibling, Kim Kardashian West, 37, has a notably lower net worth of $350m. Ms Jenner, who is still currently not old enough even to legally drink alcohol in the US, will turn 21 in August as her Forbes cover edition hits newsstands. ""What her half-sister Kim Kardashian West did for booty, Jenner has done for full lips,"" Forbes writes, describing her famous pout. Earlier this week Ms Jenner, a mother of one daughter named Stormi, announced she would stop receiving lip injections, known as dermal fillers. The influential beauty mogul has more than 110m followers on Instagram She admitted during an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians in 2015 that her natural lips had been ""an insecurity"" that she wanted to change with temporary lip fillers. She later launched her brand Kylie Cosmetics, which included a line of lip products designed to help customers make their lips look bigger through over-lining and filling. Kylie Jenner and the celebrity plastic surgery effect Kylie's baby breaks Instagram like record Snapchat shares tumble after Kylie Jenner tweet Have YouTube stars boosted beauty sales? Unlike those of traditional cosmetic brands, her products are almost exclusively sold online. Her cosmetics have proven exceptionally popular with fans, selling out almost instantly at every website re-stock and leading to server crashes. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Jenner's company, which she wholly owns, is worth $800m, according to Forbes. She is number 27 on Forbes' list of richest self-made women in America, leap-frogging Barbra Streisand ($400m), Beyonce Knowles ($335m) and Taylor Swift ($320m). Ms Jenner is on track to become a billionaire earlier than Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, who achieved that status at age 23. Evan Spiegel, the owner of Snapchat, also became a billionaire in his early 20s, but it is unclear exactly when he met that goal. ""wow. i can't believe I'm posting my very own @forbes cover,"" she wrote to her 110m Instagram followers on Wednesday. ""thank you for this article and the recognition. I'm so blessed to do what i love everyday. i couldn't have dreamt this up!"" Dictionary.com tweeted a definition, seemingly directed at the Forbes piece, that ""self-made means having succeeded in life unaided"". Ms Jenner first rose to fame at the age of 10 when she appeared with her family on their eponymous reality show. On social media, some users scoffed at Forbes' use of the term ""self-made"", pointing out that Ms Jenner's parents were already wealthy and famous. Allow Twitter content?

Tory rebels target May's Brexit plan,"Conservative Eurosceptics have launched a new attempt to change the government's Brexit strategy by targeting a key piece of legislation. Amendments tabled to the customs bill threaten to undermine Theresa May's plan for future UK-EU relations. Some Brexiteers are unhappy at the plan, agreed by the cabinet at Chequers last week, saying it will keep the UK tied to EU rules. The PM says it honours the Leave vote and protects jobs. With numbers tight in the Commons, the prime minister - who relies on Northern Ireland's DUP to win key votes - would be vulnerable to any rebellion among Eurosceptic MPs as she tries to pass key laws needed for Brexit preparation. Don't jeopardise Brexit, Hague warns MPs Tory vice-chairs quit over PM's Brexit plan The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU after that. The delay has been partly blamed on deep disagreements within the Conservative Party over what shape Brexit should take. This has focused on whether the UK should prioritise business interests and keep a close relationship with the EU in order to minimise friction for cross-border trade - which critics say will mean the UK still abiding by EU rules and leaving ""in name only"". The Chequers proposals, which have yet to be negotiated with the EU, prompted the resignations of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, who both said they could not support them. Analysis by BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg Brexiteers are trying to force the government to drop its Chequers compromise, and dangling the threat of voting down legislation if Theresa May doesn't budge. Brexiteer ministers are this afternoon, I'm told, still trying to get ""edits"" to the final White Paper, the souped-up version of the Chequers plan. Their fellow Leavers on the backbenches are clearly going to kick up a stink if Number 10 won't move, and if they choose to, they have the numbers to defeat the government time and again. Read Laura's full blog More details will be set out on Thursday. So far Downing Street has said it would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to minimise friction for trade at borders. This has angered some Conservative backbenchers, who say it will prevent the UK from having its own independent trade policy, and they want to see the Chequers blueprint rewritten. The customs bill - formally known as the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill, will give the government the power to adopt a new customs policy after it leaves the EU. The world's media react to Boris Johnson's exit At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan The legislation returns to the Commons on Monday. One of the Eurosceptic rebel amendments demands that the UK should not be allowed to collect customs duties on behalf of the EU, unless the EU does the same for the UK. But in the Chequers agreement, there are plans for a ""combined customs territory"" where the UK would charge EU tariffs for goods which will end up heading into the EU. Other amendments would make it impossible for Northern Ireland to be in a separate customs arrangement to the rest of the UK - an arrangement previously suggested by the EU - and would require the UK to have a separate VAT regime from the EU. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said the amendment would ""put into law the government's often stated position that Northern Ireland should be treated the same way as the rest of the country"", and ""ensure reciprocity of customs collection, and treating the UK and EU as equals"". ""They will put into law the government's stated position that we will not be part of the EU VAT regime,"" he added.

The places you will watch the game,"Tonight's the night that could see England into a first World Cup Final since the glory days of 1966. Whether you plan to get together with a crowd of like-minded mates or want to quietly focus your good vibes on the match alone at home, chances are you've decided where to watch the game against Croatia. Giant screens are hastily being erected in public spaces across the country, while pubs, bars and fan zones are also going to be busy with white-shirted (or navy-waistcoated) viewers anxiously clutching a pint or two. Here are some of the places fans will either be shedding tears of joy - or weeping over what nearly was. The Bohemians will be hoping for a kind of magic from Southgate's men Queen tribute bandThe Bohemians,externalare currently on cruise ship Navigator of the Seas on their way to Gibraltar. Lead singer Rob ""Freddie Mercury"" Comber says the group will be able to watch the first 20 minutes and the final half hour of the game, but they're due to perform throughout the middle. ""If it goes to penalties we'll miss them too, as we'll be due back on stage - so hopefully we won't need them. ""Come on lads - we can have Croatia."" Boston Pizza, a bar in Saskatoon, is where Tony Newton - who took this picture during the Sweden game - will be watching the Croatia clash Tony Newton, who was born in Barnsley, has lived in Canada since 1976. He will be watching the semi-final in a bar in the middle of a prairie. He says he's been following the Three Lions since the 1982 World Cup and has planned ahead for the game by booking time off work. ""I will be cheering on the lads. It's coming home,"" he says. Dave Wharton, now living near Lake Ontario, has a specific setup for viewing Dave Wharton, another expat in Canada, watches the matches in Ajax, Ontario, by streaming the local sports channel on his laptop while keeping an eye on the BBC Live Text on the desktop computer behind it. ""It's a real treat to read the analysis from familiar figures like Lineker, Shearer, Rio, Waddle, Nevin, Klinsmann, Jenas, Lawro etc. I also love reading the banter, seeing the photos and social media stuff, and the comments from viewers. ""Maybe if I start swimming up the St Lawrence Seaway now, then hop on an ocean liner in Montreal, I could make it to Moscow by Sunday."" Paul Smith will be taking it easy in St Margaret's Bay Paul Smith will be enjoying the view as well as the game at his home in Nova Scotia. ""I will be in sunny St Margaret's Bay with the best excuse in the world not to stack wood, not to garden, not to mow the grass, not to work on my deck - as a matter of fact not do anything apart from having a beer or two."" Clive Smith's home in Perth, Western Australia, gives off a slight expat vibe Clive Smith and his family will be getting up at 02:00 in Perth, Western Australia to watch the game against Croatia. Mr Smith, whose living room displays a clear England supporter streak, says they ""can't wait for the next instalment of 'football's coming home"". What are England fans singing? How much do you know about the players? Mapping England's World Cup squad Another expat now in Australia, Craig Appleton will be watching at home in Victoria - which for him means a midnight kickoff. ""There are lots of very tired, very excited yet very happy English Aussies,"" Mr Appleton says. ""They are silently and sleepily sidling through their workdays, waiting to watch a genuinely impressive display. This is uncharted territory... even locals and ex-Scots are impressed and want England to win. It's a strange world indeed at the moment."" Pat Gallagher, in Boston, Massachusetts says he will be taking the afternoon off. ""The game kicks off at 2pm Eastern Time in the US. I'm on the lookout for a dark blue waistcoat. ""Growing up in south London, and a lifelong Palace fan, I always knew Gareth [Southgate] was on a path to greatness. A true fighter, and the missed penalty in '96 is a indicator of his drive to pick up and carry on. The other fellas on the squad are doing a pretty good job, too. And John and Tina Gilmartin, from Balbriggan in Fingal, are due to land at Philadelphia airport five minutes before kickoff - and their next flight, to Scottsdale, is at 20:45 BST, giving them a comfortable hour and 50 minutes to enjoy England's performance. ""Football is coming home,"" Mr Gilmartin promises. Pete Harris is expecting Cleckheaton golf club's clubhouse to be ""rowdy"" during tonight's match Pete Harris from Leeds has his whole day mapped out. ""After a slog round Cleckheaton golf club in the afternoon, I'll be having a light evening meal and will then settle in the 19th for beers and the best spot for the 52-inch screens. I'm expecting it to be rowdy."" Dan Roberts hopes an England victory will be the second reason to celebrate Dan Roberts from Truro, Cornwall, says he is simply going to a local pub with two of his best mates. But he's got a special reason to celebrate. ""I had cancer during the World Cup 2014 (although didn't miss anything there) and again before the Euros 2016.

Earliest evidence of humans outside Africa,"Scientists say they've found the earliest known evidence of a human presence outside Africa. Stone tools discovered in China suggest primitive humans - or a close relative - were in the region as early as 2.12 million years ago. They are about 270,000 years older than the previous earliest evidence, which consists of bones and tools from Dmanisi in Georgia. The research, by a Chinese-British team,appears in the journal Nature.,external The stone artefacts were discovered at Shangchen on a plateau in northern China. They comprise different types of stone tools constructed for a variety of purposes. All show signs of having been used. Most were made of quartzite and quartz rock that probably came from the foothills of the Qinling Mountains, five to 10 km to the south of the dig site. But we don't know for sure which species of human relative made them. Sites where evidence of human presence has been found Humans left Africa at many times during their history. Living people outside Africa, for example, trace their origins to an exodus that occurred 60,000 years ago. But there had been no evidence of occupation by human relatives in Eurasia until the Dmanisi evidence at 1.8 million years ago. Writing in Nature, palaeoanthropologist John Kappelman, who was not involved with the new study, commented: ""The roughly 14,000-kilometre trek from eastern Africa to eastern Asia represents a range expansion of dramatic proportions."" Africa has traditionally been seen as the engine of human evolution - where key species arose before spreading out through the rest of the world. However, some scientists have proposed a more important role in this story for Asia. With these new finds, some researchers will wonder how much further back the human story goes in Asia. Co-author Prof Robin Dennell, from the University of Exeter, UK, said he believes evidence from Ethiopia offers some clues. Early human relatives (hominins) learnt how to produce sharp stone ""flakes"" around 2.6 million years ago. ""That way they acquired a simple but effective tool kit that could strip meat off a carcass before they were chased off by bigger and stronger predators (e.g. lions, hyaena). This opened up a new world for them,"" Prof Dennell told BBC News. He added: ""With those new skills, they were able to expand out of Africa into the grasslands and open woodlands of Asia, in much the same type of environment as in East Africa. The Asian fauna at that point had never encountered a bipedal, tool-using, carnivorous ape before, and I suspect hominins found it easy to acquire meat."" The researchers found evidence for occupation of the plateau by ancient humans between 1.3 and 2.1 million years ago If our ancient relatives were in China by two million years ago, there must be earlier evidence in more westerly parts of Asia, closer to the exit point from Africa. Robin Dennell explained: ""I think the hominin record in Asia could go back to 2.5 - 2.6 Ma (million years) - around the time that hominins opened up a new niche by flaking stone."" He said the discovery showed Asia was ""absolutely fundamental"" in human evolution. ""We are now moving beyond a Eurocentric view of human evolution in Eurasia: the Asian record for human evolution is proving to be as complex and fascinating as in Europe and Africa,"" said Prof Dennell. Some 80 artefacts were found in fossil soil that developed in a warm and wet climate. A further 16 tools were found in fossil soil that came from times when it was colder and drier. All in all, the scientists believe humans lived on the Loess Plateau in China for a significant amount of time - from 1.3 to 2.1 million years ago. It's likely they also survived there under a variety of climatic conditions. Dr Kappelman, from the University of Texas, Austin, wrote: ""The hominin dispersal probably occurred under the variable climates of the Pleistocene ice age. Does a migration to higher latitudes suggest the evolution of behavioural adaptations to colder climates? Perhaps. ""Rather than maintaining a continuous occupation of the Loess Plateau, the hominin population might have increased or dwindled, depending on the climate."" Homo floresiensis, dubbed the ""Hobbit"", is a tiny, extinct species of human that lived until about 12,000 years ago on the Indonesian island of Flores. One of the adults measured just 1.1m (3.7ft) tall. Many scientists think the Hobbit is a diminutive form ofHomo erectus- long thought to be the first human species to leave Africa. Under this scenario,H. erectusarrived on Flores hundreds of thousands of years ago and shrank in size after becoming isolated there. Others point out that aspects of the Hobbit's anatomy look too primitive forH. erectusto be the ancestor. They wonder whether the Hobbit's progenitor was an australopithecine - an earlier and more ape-like relative that roamed Africa, but has never been found outside the continent. Robin Dennell said: ""My preference is that the makers of the 2.1 Ma (million-year-old) artefacts at Shangchen were a primitive form ofHomo(human) - which is not very unlike an australopithecine at that point in time. ""This discovery does lend some support to the possibility thatH. floresiensishas a primitive australopithecine-type ancestor. Obviously, we need the skeletal evidence, as well as an open mind - there is so much that we don't know, and the Shangchen evidence is just another piece in a very complex jigsaw.""

Govia Thameslink boss in first class row,"A Govia Thameslink manager is under fire for telling passengers to stay out of a crowded train's first class cabin. Emma FitzPatrick tweeted a picture of Mark Boon, head of network operations for Govia Thameslink Railway. She said he told passengers not to occupy the ""empty"" first class section on a ""very packed"" train on Tuesday morning ""while he took up two seats"". Govia Thameslink said all passengers needed a first-class ticket to travel in that section. Ms FitzPatrick and Mr Boon were on a Southern service that arrived at London Victoria shortly before midday on Tuesday. Mr Boon sat at a table in first class and placed his bag on the empty seat next to him, telling passengers without first class tickets they would need to remain in the standard class section.

Ms Fitzpatrick added: ""I still can't believe it! He even handed his business card out to the people that he was turning away!"" A spokesperson for Govia Thameslink Railway, which operates Southern services, said: ""Passengers need a first class ticket to travel in first class and there were other people with first class tickets in this compartment. ""This was an 11am off-peak service running just six minutes late and, while the front coaches were busy, there were seats and space in the rear coaches, as Mr Boon explained."" Ms FitzPatrick's tweets sparked a storm of criticism on social media, with some questioning whether Mr Boon had the authority to prevent standard ticket holders from using the first class compartment. The row comes as Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said on Wednesday that improvements to Govia Thameslink services were ""simply not happening quickly enough"" and that passengers ""deserve far better"". The operator is at risk of losing its franchise following widespread disruptions to services followingtimetable changes implemented in late May. Govia Thameslink also operates Great Northern and Gatwick Express services as well as Thameslink and Southern. The Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, Caroline Lucas, told Mr Lidington - who was standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons - that her constituents were used to chaos from GTR.

Men dominate BBC's star salaries listGary Lineker and Chris Evans are among the top earners - but many stars have taken pay cuts.Entertainment & ArtsComments,"Gary Lineker is now top of the list, followed by Chris Evans and Graham Norton The top 12 earners on the BBC's latest list of star salaries are all men. Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has overtaken Chris Evans as the best-paid personon the list, earning between Â£1.75m-Â£1.76m in 2017-18. Evans, Graham Norton, Jeremy Vine and John Humphrys are among those to have seen their pay drop since last year. Claudia Winkleman is still the top woman, on Â£370,000-Â£379,999. Mary Berry and Newsnight's Emily Maitlis are among eight women to have joined the list. Winkleman was eighth last year but has now dropped to 13th as a result of a shake-up of the corporation's structure. Shows like Strictly Come Dancing, which are made by BBC Studios, are no longer included on the list because BBC Studios is now considered a commercial entity. The BBC said the published salaries do not yet fully reflect some pay rises and pay cuts, which will not filter through until next year's list. Last year, Sarah Montague and Emily Maitlis were revealed to earn less than male co-hosts This is the second year that the BBC has published the salaries of its best-paid presenters, although actors, comedians and some hosts have been removed this time as a result of the BBC Studios change. Last year, the top seven were all men and the list sparked an outcry about gender inequality, with some men shown to have been paid more than female co-hosts. There were also complaints about a lack of ethnic diversity. This year, the figures at the top of the list are all white again, although the BBC said the overall number of BAME stars on the list is rising. BBC star salaries: See who earned what BBC cuts gender pay gap to 7.6% Six male BBC presenters agree pay cut Amol Rajan on BBC Studios going commercial This year's list includes on-air presenters who earned more than Â£150,000 in the financial year 2017/18 from news, sport and radio as well as some TV entertainment shows. Director general Tony Hall said the BBC was ""making progress"" and that he wants a 50/50 split on the list as a whole, but that ""these things take time"". The BBC has pledged to close the gap by 2020. But Woman's Hour presenter Jane Garvey, who is one of the eight women to join the list, told Radio 4's PM programme the pace of change was ""absolutely glacial"". She said: ""There needs to be a proper conversation about why in 2018 we are still fighting the same old battle on equal pay and why the work of women just isn't valued in the same way as the work of men."" Radio 2 said Steve Wright's pay cut will be reflected next year The other new entries include Europe editor Katya Adler and Radio 4 presenter Sarah Montague, with Maitlis earning between Â£220,000-Â£229,999 to make her the highest new name. Four men have also joined, including BBC media editor Amol Rajan on Â£200,000-Â£209,999, which also covers other radio presenting work. Of the 12 people who have moved down the salary bands because their pay has dropped since the previous list, eight are men. But four of the five to have moved up the pay bands are also men. Those moving into a higher salary bracket include Radio 2's Steve Wright and Ken Bruce; Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw; and Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen. The only woman to move up a pay band is Sophie Raworth. BBC Radio 2 said: ""Steve has just signed a fresh two year contract with Radio 2 which will show a considerable pay reduction - the BBC annual report is a year behind for him as his old contract had yet to expire."" Some names have dropped down or been removed from the list since last year because they work for BBC Studios, which has been classed as a commercial entity since April 2017. As part of its latest disclosures, the corporation also published figures for 2018-19 to show it is on the way to rectifying the gender imbalance. Excluding BBC Studios, 59% of on-air figures earning more than Â£150,000 in the current financial year are men, it said. That compares with 76% in 2016-17. Claudia Winkleman is still the best-paid woman on the list Lord Hall said: ""I've made it absolutely clear that's not good enough and I want to get to 50/50, and that will mean changes in the range of what people are paid right across [the organisation]."" He added: ""We are making progress and you must understand that. We're trying to get a balanced range of men and women and their pay right across the organisation. Read the BBC annual report in full,external ""I am concentrating on what is a huge change, which is going from 25% of women to 40% of women being in the top, over Â£150,000 pay... These things take time."" The salary details were published in the BBC's latest annual report, and come a week afterthe corporation saidits overall median gender pay gap had reduced from 9.3% to 7.6%. And it comes two weeks after former China editorCarrie Gracie received an apologyand back pay from the BBC after discovering on last year's list that she had been paid less than her male counterparts. In last year's report, Claudia Winkleman was the best-paid woman, earning between Â£450,000-Â£499,999. This year, she is still the top earning female star, but has slid down the rankings with earnings between Â£370,000-Â£379,999. That means the top of this year's list appears more male-dominated than last time. Winkleman's Strictly co-host Tess Daly has dropped off the list all together, as have The One Show's Matt Baker and Casualty's Derek Thompson, among others. That's because most entertainment, factual and drama programmes are made by BBC Studios which, as a commercial entity, no longer has to declare the salaries it pays its staff because it is competing with other production companies. BBC Studios chief creative officer Mark Linsey said: ""We are at a significant disadvantage if we don't have a level playing field. It's a bunfight out there for talent."" So Claudia's actual earnings will exceed the amount given in this year's annual report. The same can be said for the likes of Graham Norton, Mary Berry and Fiona Bruce, who also make shows for BBC Studios. This year's list doesn't fully reflect the pay cuts for some male presenters - and pay rises for some women. In a number of cases, these will be enacted over several years. For example, John Humphrys has seen his published salary drop from Â£600,000-Â£649,999 to Â£400,000-Â£409,999. But in 2018-19 - which will be shown on next year's list - his pay for the Today programme will be in the Â£250,000-Â£299,999 bracket. Similarly, Nicky Campbell and Huw Edwards have also taken pay cuts, which have started to filter through to the list - but are being staggered over a number of years. Meanwhile, the BBC annual report also revealed that the corporation received 48 complaints of sexual harassment and assault in 2017/18. Nine resulted in formal cases or disciplinary action, the BBC said. The remaining 39 did not for a variety of reasons - including the complaint being withdrawn or the individual being complained about no longer working for the BBC.

Grenfell 'first time' stay-put was droppedThe fire manager who decided to change the advice to residents says it had never happened before.UK,"Jo Smith was on call on the night of the fire last June The fire room control manager who chose to abandon the ""stay put"" policy during the Grenfell fire said it was the first time such a decision had been made. The ""stay-put"" advice to residents was in place until 02:47 BST - nearly two hours after the fire started. But Jo Smith told an inquiry it was altered within 15 minutes of her arrival at the control room. She said information being fed to her led her to believe residents ""had no way of waiting to be rescued"". A ""stay put"" policy is based on the theory that buildings can be designed to prevent fire spreading, so a blaze in one flat should not be able to spread to another. But expert reports submitted to the inquiry suggest that since 1974, major changes to Grenfell Tower destroyed that protection. Ms Smith, a senior operations manager for the London Fire Brigade with 23 years experience, was on call on the night of the fire on 14 June 2017. After arriving at the control room in Stratford, she said she found two operators who had been speaking to single callers for about 45 minutes each. She said this indicated the situation was getting worse and made her ""increasingly uncomfortable with the 'stay put' policy"". Ms Smith said her experience of working during the Lakanal House fire - the 2009 London tower block fire in which six people were killed - formed part of her decision to change strategy. ""I was aware of the previous Lakanal incident in which residents were in cleaner situations, less smoke, who were unable to be rescued,"" she said in her witness statement. Why was 'stay put' advice so disastrous? What happened at Grenfell Tower? Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair Referring to the change from 'stay-put' to 'escape', Ms Smith told the inquiry: ""In practice, it's only ever been done once, to my knowledge."" The new advice to evacuate was then passed to fire brigade colleagues on the ground and residents on emergency calls. Residents were advised to ""get out, hold hands and get wet towels to put around themselves"". The inquiry heard that phone operator BT became involved in some of the calls, which would not happen in a normal incident, Ms Smith said. They too were told of the change in policy to pass on to residents. The control room received 344 calls relating to Grenfell on the night of the fire, the inquiry heard. Ms Smith described the influx as ""utterly relentless"". She said a conscious decision was made ""not to put the television news on during the incident"" which was broadcasting images of the burning tower. It was put to her that some operators had suggested seeing pictures of what was going on would have informed the advice they were giving. But Ms Smith said it would ""cause further distress"". ""A number of us felt it was detrimental to have that on the screens whilst they were talking to callers,"" she added. Ms Smith will continue giving evidence on Thursday, when the inquiry continues.

Northern customers on some routes where over 5% of trains have been cancelled or seriously delayed can make a claim. It is in addition to the existing Delay Repay on offer from the Department for Transport and Transport for the North. The new scheme has two levels and covers disruption from electrification works and timetable changes. Season ticket refunds for rail delays Passenger trains return to Lakes Line Northern axe trains in timetable reshuffle The first level covers delays on specified routes caused by electrification works on the Blackpool to Preston line between 1 April 2018 and 30 June. The second level relates to disruption on certain routes caused by new timetables introduced on 20 May. Commuters have been faced with cancellations across the network David Brown, managing director at Northern, said: ""Customers have been affected by a number of issues during the past few months, most notably the knock-on effects of the delay to the electrification of the Blackpool to Preston Line, delays to the electrification of the Manchester to Preston via Bolton line and, of course, the problems on some routes following the introduction of the May timetable. ""This compensation scheme aims to provide some recompense for those whose journeys have been impacted the most.""

The doctor who chose to stay in the cave,"Dr Richard Harris spent three days underground with the young Thais and their coach It was his rare combination of talents that led Australian doctor Richard Harris deep into the Tham Luang cave in Thailand. When the Wild Boars football team was located deep inside the cave, after being missing for a week, the Adelaide anaesthetist abandoned his holiday in Thailand and volunteered to help.

One tragic expedition in 2011, involved the retrieval of the body of his friend, Agnes Milowka, who ran out of air during a cave dive in South Australia. Dr Harris had previously led cave rescue operations Ms Bishop said the doctor is also known to authorities for his work on medical assistance teams in natural disasters in the Pacific region, and has taken part in Australian aid missions in Vanuatu.

She also praised his diving partner, Craig Challen, a vet from Perth who accompanied Dr Harris into the caves.

Heroes who saved the Wild Boars,"Foreign divers, including Ivan Karadzic (2nd left) and Erik Brown (3rd right), were part of the extensive rescue operations The rescuers who worked to save the group trapped in a Thai cave were a mix of international divers collaborating with Thai navy Seals. The 12 boys and their football coach were first found by British diversbut the effort to get them out was a truly global operation. Several Thai navy divers took part in the rescue.One ex-navy diver, Saman Gunan, diedin the cave last Friday. Little information has been released about exactly who was involved and how, largely because most participants have been reluctant to talk. It is thought that dozens of divers - Thai and foreign - were part of the efforts. Here are just some of them: The last to leave the Tham Luang caves were three divers and a medic - all Thai Navy Seals Numerous Thai special forces were part of the rescue efforts. Most notable are a doctor - widely identified as Pak Loharnshoon - and three yet-to-be-named divers who volunteered to stay by the boys' side after they were found underground a week ago. Dr Pak is seen applying medicine to a boy's minor wounds in a video shared by the Thai navy Seals Facebook page last week. Four Thai Navy Seals personnel were the last to leave the cave on Tuesday evening. The Navy Seals unit was led by Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yuukongkaew. When divers were still trying to find the boys, he was the one updating reporters on the slow progress being made. Rear Adm Arphakorn was in charge of the Navy Seals during their risky operation Briton John Volanthen's voice was the first the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground. He and fellow British diver Mr Stanton were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper. The trio arrived in Thailand three days after the football team went missing. This video can not be played The moment divers discover the missing boys Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant, and Mr Stanton, a former firefighter, are part of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team. They have participated in a number of cave diving rescue operations, including in Norway, France and Mexico. The cave divers who went back for their friends Dr Harris, from Adelaide in Australia, has decades of diving experience. He was the one who examined the boys in the cave and gave the green light so the rescue operation could go ahead. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Had the boys been too weak, a rescue attempt by diving out would have been too dangerous. According to media reports, Dr Harris has taken part in cave diving explorations in Australia, China, Christmas Island and New Zealand. A anaesthetist by training, he has also been specialising in expedition medicine and retrieval operations. In 2011, he recovered the body of his friend, experienced cave diver Agnes Milowka, who ran out of air during an extremely difficult expedition in South Australia. It is thought that his assistance in the Thai rescue was specifically requested by the British divers. The doctor who stayed with the boys Petty Officer Saman Gunan, 38, was a retired Thai navy diver who volunteered in the rescue efforts. He lost consciousness on his way out of the Tham Luang cave complex, where he had been delivering air tanks on 6 July. This video can not be played Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: ""He loved helping others"" His dive partner tried to revive him but could not, and his body was brought out of the cave. His widow told the BBC: ""He's been praised as a hero because of who he was. He loved helping others, doing charity work and getting things done."" Rear Adm Arphakorn said he would not let PO Gunan's ""life be in vain."" ""We will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste."" Belgian Ben Reymenants runs a dive shop in Phuket. He is thought to be part of the group that first found the boys on the Monday. Ben Reymenants with governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn and fellow diver Maksym Polejaka Claus Rasmussen is a Danish national who has been living for years in Thailand, working for several different dive schools. He is currently an instructor working with Ben Reymenants' company, Blue Label Diving. He has been diving across Asia and also worked in several other countries in South East Asia. A picture Mr Paasi posted on Facebook, showing Claus Rasmussen in the cave Finnish national Mikko Paasi is the founder of a diving centre on the small Thai island of Koh Tao, where he specialises in technical diving. That means he focuses on wreck and cave diving. On 2 July, the day the boys and their coach were found,Mikko's wife said on Facebook she bought her husband's flight to Chiang Rai,externalto join the rescue efforts on what was their eighth wedding anniversary. Mikko Paasi is one of several divers who worked to get the boys to safety Ivan Karadzic, a Dane, moved to Koh Tao a few years after Mr Paasi, and they now run the diving centre together. He told the BBC about his fear on seeing the first boy and a diver approach him from a distance - not knowing if it was a ""casualty or kid"" - and then his relief on realising the boy was safe. This video can not be played Rescue diver in Thai cave: ""I was very scared"" On Mr Gunan's death in the run up to the final rescue efforts, Mr Karadzic wrote on his Facebook wall: ""Rest in peace.

"First hospital video emerges of Thai boysThe boys are seen in hospital, as reports say they were sedated for their cave rescue.Asia","This video can not be played The boys give peace signs as they recover in hospital The first footage has emerged from the hospital where 12 Thai boys and their coach are being treated after their dramatic rescue from a flooded cave. Several boys can be seen in facemasks and hospital gowns, at least one giving a peace sign for the camera. Meanwhile, reports say the boys and the coach were sedated to stop them panicking during the dangerous rescue. The Thai Navy Seals also released new video showing the three-day rescue operation that captivated the world. Divers who took part in the operation said the boys were heavily sedated to avoid anxiety as they went through the dark, narrow, underwater passageways. Former Navy seal Chaiyananta Peeranarong told AFP news agency: ""Some of them were asleep, and some of them were wiggling their fingers, kind of groggy - but they were breathing. My job was to transfer them along."" Each boy was strapped to one of two rescue divers tasked with shepherding him, and bundled onto stretchers to be carried through the dry parts. This video can not be played Rescuers carry one of the boys on a stretcher Earlier on Wednesday, the head of the Thai Navy Seals told the BBC that ""hope became reality"" with the rescue of the boys and their coach from the Tham Luang cave. ""We had a little bit of hope that they might still be alive but we had to do it, we just had to move forward,"" Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew said. ""There was only a tiny bit of hope, but that's all we had to work with."" The boys were rescued during a complex three-day operation Families were able to see the boys from a separate room The group was trapped in the cave by rising water andrescued in a dramatic operation that captivated the world. The complex, three-day rescue saw four boys emerge on Sunday, four on Monday, and the final four boys plus their coach on Tuesday. They survived the nine days before they were found by drinking water dripping from the cave walls, officials said. The doctor who stayed with the boys Heroes who saved the Wild Boars Football teams offer support to rescued boys A picture released by the Seal team shows a person being stretchered out of the cave The boys lost on average 2kg (4.4lb) during their ordeal but are said to be in good physical condition. They will remain in hospital in the nearby city of Chiang Rai for a week, followed by a week's recuperation at home. The first four boys have already been visited by their families, officials said, and the others will be allowed to receive visitors soon. Joy and relief as Thai cave boys rescued How the Thai boys were rescued Heroic diver gave his life to the rescue This video can not be played Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew, head of the Thai navy seals: ""There was only a tiny bit of hope"" There were cheers around the cave as the dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers involved in the operation left the site. In Chiang Rai, the news was greeted by the honking of car horns while people gathered outside the hospital broke into applause. On social media, Thais showed their feelings about the rescuers by using hashtags including #Heroes and #Thankyou. Offers of hospitality for the boys, the coach and their rescuers have come in from international football clubs including Manchester United and Benfica. Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team entered the cave system in dry weather, during an excursion with their coach. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded the cave complex. The story of the rescue - told for children They were huddled in darkness on a ledge when they were found by British divers. Elation at the discovery of the group quickly turned to concern as it became clear how difficult it would be to rescue boys who could not swim and had been weakened by their time underground. Getting to and from the chamber where the group were trapped was an exhausting round trip even for experienced divers. The process involved a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes. The boys and their coach were trapped underground for a total of 17 days. They reportedly entered the cave to celebrate one of the team's birthday, and the snacks they brought with them are thought to have helped sustain them. Once found, they were given ""easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor"", said Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew. The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Rescuers brought them food, light and letters from their parents to help them cope Authorities said they seemed to cope well with the mental strain of their time underground. Rescue teams brought them lights andletters from their parentsto help them cope. Their coach, Ekapol Chantawong, reportedly taught the team how to meditate to cope with the stress. He trained for a decade as a Buddhist monk before turning to football. Details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. CaptainDuganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.

Ryan Davidson, 25, has been looking for permanent housing for two years. He told BBC News he now had hope for the future. ""James was walking past me, so I asked him for spare change,"" he said. ""He stopped and seemed like a genuine, nice guy. ""We chatted for a while and then he said he had a company and could offer me a job - I couldn't believe it."" James Minns, who owns a paint-coating company in the city, had been enjoying a meal to celebrate his wedding anniversary, with his wife and two friends, moments earlier. ""I saw Ryan's big smile and we started talking,"" James told BBC News. ""If you were offered a job, would you take it?"" James asked. ""100%,"" replied Ryan. James told Ryan where his factory was and they shook hands on the job offer, with Ryan promising to turn up for work on the factory floor. But what James thought was an innocent Facebook post about the encounter soon began gathering pace. ""I logged into my Facebook on Friday and there were hundreds of notifications and thousands of friend requests - I couldn't believe it,""  James told BBC News. ""Fingers crossed he takes the opportunity,"" postedone Facebook user,external. Another post read: ""Our county needs more companies like you to believe in these people."" One of the people who responded to James after seeing the post was Ryan's aunt. And she was able to provide a mobile phone number on which he could be contacted. James rang Ryan on Friday to confirm his start time on Monday. And his optimism increased when Ian Cutts, a local milkman, who had also seen the Facebook post, offered to collect Ryan for his first day and give him a lift to the factory.

Woman killed dad after abuse images find,"Barbara Coombes killed her father and then lied to her family and the authorities for years A woman beat her ""violent bully"" father to death with a shovel and buried his body in her garden after finding his hoard of child abuse images. The remains of Kenneth Coombes were found in Reddish in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in January. Barbara Coombes, 63, of Matlock Road in Reddish, pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility at Manchester Crown Court. She was jailed for nine years by Mr Justice Timothy King. The court heard Coombes had killed her father in 2006, concealing his body until she walked into a local police station on 7 January and told officers: ""I murdered my father 12 years ago."" She had earlier found a box of photographs belonging to the 87-year-old, which contained indecent images of children. Police forensic tents could be seen outside the home in January The patch of garden where Kenneth Coombes' remains were discovered The mother-of-one, who had suffered 40 years of physical and verbal torment from her ""formidable"" ex-military father, then ""snapped"", the court heard. Coombes had been in the garden digging at the time. Feeling ""utterly disgusted and mortified"" she walked into the living room of the family home and hit him over the back of the head with the shovel. When he turned around she then struck him a second time, slashing his throat with the blade edge of the tool. As he bled to death, she wrapped her father in carpet and put him in the garden before ordering a ton of soil and burying him the next day. The court heard how Coombes had suffered ""a lifetime"" of extreme physical and verbal abuse from Mr Coombes, who was described as a violent bully, the court heard. Police and forensic officers pictured at the scene of the discovery in January Psychiatric reports found the she had post-traumatic stress disorder and a severe depressive illness. Michelle Colborne QC said although the story of abuse Coombes had suffered came from herself, there was evidence to show her account was not ""contrived"". Coombes also continued claiming her father's pension and benefits on his behalf, receiving Â£189,125 over the following 12 years. At an earlier hearing, she admitted preventing the lawful burial of Mr Coombes and two fraud charges. Police pictured on the street in Reddish where Barbara Coombes lived The court heard that although she successfully lied to her father's GP, hospital doctors and benefits advisers for more than a decade, ""the net began to tighten"" in autumn 2017. A local housing association officer, Lynn Williams, visited the family home to arrange a ""winter welfare"" visit for Mr Coombes, who by then would have been 99. Coombes tried to rebuff the visits and suspicions were raised. It prompted Coombes to walk into a police station in Cheadle Heath and confess to officers.

Trump wants Nato to double spending target,"This video can not be played In 2018, Donald Trump told Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg that Germany is ""totally controlled by Russia"" US President Donald Trump has urged Nato allies to commit 4% of their annual output (GDP) to military spending - double the current target. The White House confirmed he had made the remarks during the Western military alliance's summit in Brussels. The meeting also saw Mr Trump single out Germany for criticism over its defence spending. Nato's secretary-general said the main focus should be on all members reaching the current target of 2% of GDP. Jens Stoltenberg declined to answer a specific question about Mr Trump's remarks, but told reporters: ""I think we should first get to 2%, focus on that now... the good thing is that we are moving to that."" For decades after the end of the Cold War, he said, Nato countries had cut defence budgets as tensions fell - and now needed to increase them at a time when tensions were rising. Can Nato survive Donald Trump? What does the US contribute to Nato? Previous US presidents have urged Europe to take more responsibility for their defence and reduce the burden on US taxpayers of maintaining forces in Europe long after the end of the Cold War - but none as bluntly as Mr Trump. Confirming Mr Trump's comments, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: ""President Trump wants to see our allies share more of the burden and at a very minimum meet their already stated obligations."" The Brussels meeting comes less than a week beforeMr Trump is due to hold his first summit with Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, reviving concerns among US allies over his proximity to the Russian president. German troops in Lithuania this summer Mr Trump's main objection is that all but a handful of member states have still not increased their defence budgets to meet a goal of spending at least 2% of their annual economic output on defence by 2024. Of Nato's 29 members, just five meet that target this year: the US, Greece, Estonia, the UK and Latvia. However, several, such as Poland and France, are close to the mark. Allow Twitter content?

At a news conference after the first meetings of leaders at the summit, Mr Stoltenberg insisted that more united Nato than divided it. ""We have had discussions, we do have disagreements, but most importantly we have decisions that are pushing this alliance forward and making us stronger. ""In the history of Nato we have had many disagreements and we have been able to overcome them again and again, because at the end of the day we all agree that North America and Europe are safer together."" All 29 Nato members released a declaration,externalwhich reaffirmed a commitment to increase military spending. The communique also condemned ""Russian aggression"", including the annexation of Crimea, the use of a nerve agent in southern England and ""election interference"". The BBC's James Cook, at the summit, says the question is, will President Trump take up those concerns directly with President Putin? Our correspondent adds that some European diplomats worry he will not, harbouring a suspicion that Mr Trump's commitment to the multilateral institutions which buttress the liberal world order is only skin deep. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent So is this mission accomplished at Nato for Donald Trump? Has he achieved his goal of persuading his European allies to spend more on defence? He began the day by calling them ""delinquents"" and ended it with smiles. The Nato summit communique contained the usual words about ""turning a corner"" in terms of defence spending, while recognising ""the need to do more"". How much more and how quickly still remains an issue, with Mr Trump suggesting that the benchmark Nato spending goal of 2% of GDP devoted to defence should be doubled to 4%. That is a level that all the allies apart from the US would struggle to attain. But the real underlying issue remains Mr Trump's commitment to Nato. Does he see it merely as a set of transactional relationships, or as an organisation enshrining the transatlantic partnership that has been the central element of European and US security since World War Two? Mr Trump clashed with Mrs Merkel ahead of the summit. The US president accused Germany of only spending ""a little bit over 1%"" of its economic output on defence compared to the 4.2% spent by the US ""in actual numbers"". Germany spends 1.24% of GDP on defence and the US 3.5%,external, according to the latest Nato estimate. The US leader also said: ""Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they will be getting from 60% to 70% of their energy from Russia, and a new pipeline, and you tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not and I think it's a very bad thing for Nato."" EU figures suggestRussia is responsible for between 50% and 75% of Germany's gas imports,external, but gas makes up less than 20% of Germany's energy mix for power production. Reality Check: How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? Mr Trump made more conciliatory remarks on Wednesday after he and Mrs Merkel met on the sidelines of the Brussels summit, saying defence spending and trade had been discussed. ""We have a very, very good relationship with the chancellor. We have a tremendous relationship with Germany,"" Mr Trump said.

Trump and Merkel in new war of words,"This video can not be played In 2018, Donald Trump told Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg that Germany is ""totally controlled by Russia"" US President Donald Trump has clashed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over Russian influence and defence spending, ahead of a Nato summit. Mr Trump said Germany was ""totally controlled by Russia"" because of the high level of natural gas it imported, and this was a ""bad thing for Nato"". Mrs Merkel hit back, comparing German independence now with the time when she grew up in the former East Germany. She also defended her country's contribution to the Western alliance. The last summit both leaders attended ended in acrimony in a row over trade. Mr Trump later made more conciliatory remarks after he and Mrs Merkel had met on the sidelines of the summit in Brussels on Wednesday. The summit comes less than a week beforeMr Trump is due to hold his first summit with Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, reviving concerns among US allies over his proximity to the Russian president. Reality Check: How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? Can Nato survive Donald Trump? What does the US contribute to Nato? President Trump shocked some by quipping that the Nato summit might prove harder than next Monday's summit with Mr Putin. He has said the US is being ""taken advantage of"" by other members of the Nato alliance, which was set up in 1949 to counter the Soviet Union, of which Russia is the main successor state. European Council President Donald Tusk accused him of criticising Europe ""almost daily"", tweeting: ""Dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don't have that many."" Germany has the EU's biggest economy and has long been accused by US administrations of failing to contribute its fair share to Nato operations but Mr Trump's comments were particularly stinging. At a breakfast meeting in Brussels with Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, the US leader said: ""Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they will be getting from 60% to 70% of their energy from Russia, and a new pipeline, and you tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not and I think it's a very bad thing for Nato."" EU figures suggestRussia is responsible for between 50% and 75% of Germany's gas imports,external, butgas makes up less than 20% of Germany's energy mix for power production. Germany has given political support for a new Baltic Sea pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which will increase the flow of Russian gas to EU states. The project has been sharply criticised by Poland and others. The US president also accused Germany of only spending ""a little bit over 1%"" of its economic output on defence compared to the 4.2% spent by the US ""in actual numbers"". Germany spends 1.24% of GDP on defence and the US 3.5%,external, according to the latest Nato estimate. ""I want to say that I have experience of when a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union,"" she told reporters. ""I am very happy that today we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions. ""That is very good, especially for people in eastern Germany."" Mrs Merkel (centre) led efforts to negotiate with Mr Trump over trade at last month's G7 summit in Canada What's happening in this G7 picture? US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU She added that Germany had put a huge proportion of its troops at Nato's disposal. ""We are still very heavily involved in Afghanistan and thus we also defend the interests of the United States of America... and Germany was pleased to do it and did it out of conviction,"" she said. At the G7 summit in Canada last month, the German chancellor led efforts to reach agreement with Mr Trump on trade butthe American leader rejected the G7 summit joint communique after he left. Mr Stoltenberg sought to play down Mr Trump's accusations, saying he expected Nato leaders would agree they were ""stronger together than apart"". He also tried to separate arguments about trade - not a primary Nato concern - from discussions about military matters. ""There are disagreements on trade. This is serious. My task is to try to minimise the negative impact on Nato,"" Mr Stoltenberg told a forum on the sidelines of the summit. Mr Trump told reporters that military spending and a planned gas pipeline from Russia to Germany had been discussed. ""We have a very, very good relationship with the chancellor. We have a tremendous relationship with Germany,"" he said. Mrs Merkel said she had discussed migration and trade with Mr Trump, and that she looked forward to further discussions as the US and Germany remained partners. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent In describing Germany as being ""totally controlled by Russia"" and linking this to what the US sees as Berlin's unsatisfactory defence budget, President Trump is underscoring two longstanding US concerns. US leaders have long warned of what they see as Europe's uncomfortable dependence upon Russian energy supplies. And they have also been arguing for more than a decade that the Europeans should spend more on defence. Mr Trump has given these twin themes a new and more abrasive tone. While he may well be overstating Germany's dependence upon Russian energy, even many European leaders are well aware of the potential influence that this could give Moscow. It's an area where short-term economic and longer-term security considerations are at variance. No wonder then that when the US sanctions Russia for its behaviour in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea it included steps to hamper anyone who helped build or support new Russian pipelines westwards. German troops in Lithuania this summer Mr Trump's main objection is that all but a handful of member states have still not increased their defence budgets to meet a goal of spending at least 2% of their annual economic output on defence by 2024.

Novichok victim speaks to police officers,"A man who was poisoned by Novichok has spoken ""briefly"" to officers trying to find the source of the nerve agent, Scotland Yard has said. Charlie Rowley, 45, is no longer in a critical condition, Salisbury District Hospital said, after making ""further progress overnight"". It comes a day after the hospital said he had regained consciousness. Dawn Sturgess, 44, who was also exposed to Novichok in Amesbury on 30 June, died on Sunday. Police are investigating a possible link to the case of Russians Sergei and Yulia Skripal, who were poisoned with the same substance in nearby Salisbury in March. The UK government has blamed Russia for the incident, but the country's authorities deny any involvement. Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said people in the Amesbury and Salisbury area should not ""pick up any foreign object which could contain liquid or gel, in the interests of their own safety"". How can you detect Novichok and other questions Why the Novichok source must be found Lorna Wilkinson, Salisbury District Hospital's director of nursing, said Mr Rowley's condition was now serious, but stable. ""Our staff will continue to work hard to provide the care that Charlie needs,"" she said. ""Charlie still has some way to go to recover, but the progress we've seen so far gives us cause for optimism."" Wiltshire gets extra Â£5m funding after attack Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? In a statement, Scotland Yard said: ""Officers from the investigation team have spoken briefly to Charlie and will be looking to further speak with him in the coming days as they continue to try and establish how he and Dawn came to be contaminated with the nerve agent. ""Any contact officers have with Charlie will be done in close consultation with the hospital and his doctors."" The Met Police's assistant commissioner for specialist operations told a meeting in Amesbury that officers were working on the theory that Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley had found a container housing Novichok. Neil Basu said scientific advice suggested that the nerve agent could remain active for decades. ""If it was sealed in a container and it was in a landfill site it would effectively be safe because it would not be touched by anyone and it would last for probably - I've been told by scientists - 50 years,"" he said. Dawn Sturgess died on Sunday after being taken ill on 30 June Police cannot say with certainty that both poisoning incidents in the county are linked, Mr Basu said, but it is a main line of inquiry. ""This is a very rare substance banned by the international community and for there to be two separate, distinct incidents in one small English county is implausible to say the least,"" he said. He said scientists at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down will work hard to determine whether the nerve agents in the two incidents were from the same batch. But, he warned, it may never be possible to establish a definitive link. ""I would love to be able to say that we have identified and caught the people responsible and how we are certain there are no traces of nerve agent left anywhere in Wiltshire,"" Mr Basu said. ""But the brutal reality is that I cannot offer you any reassurance or guarantee at this time."" This video can not be played How Russian media is reporting on the latest Novichok poisonings Police are continuing to hunt for a contaminated container which they believe was handled by the pair. The BBC understands Mr Rowley's flat is regarded as the key location in the search, but Mr Basu added: ""The brutal fact is we don't know where they found it. ""I am hoping Charlie recovers, and when he recovers he will be able to tell us and perhaps shed some light on it which will narrow our search dramatically."" Ms Sturgess, 44, lived in Salisbury, and the couple had been in the city before going to Mr Rowley's flat in nearby Amesbury on Friday 29 June. They both then fell ill on Saturday 30, and Ms Sturgess died eight days later. She had two sons, aged 19 and 23, and an 11-year-old daughter. Murder inquiry after Novichok woman dies Novichok victim was 'a gentle soul' Public Health England has offered advice for people who may have visited one of five areas identified by police. Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy, and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Anyone who was there between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 June should continue to follow advice, including washing their clothes in a washing machine. By Prof Alistair Hay, expert in environmental toxicology All nerve agents poison in the same way, which is to inhibit the enzyme involved in regulating the body's messages along nerves and between nerves and muscle. The effect is devastating, with muscles compromised and nerves linked to other organs rendered ineffective. Glands also stop working properly and breathing becomes more difficult. How badly affected people are varies greatly - for example, some people are able to break down the chemicals three times as fast as others. The dose received and how long it takes to get medical treatment also influences how sick people become.

Reality Check: Do England play better in white or red?,"As England prepare for their World Cup semi-final against Croatia, fans will be looking for any omen that could point towards a first World Cup final since 1966. You may think it's all down to the players on the pitch - but some fans believe the colour of the kit could influence the outcome. That's because England's ""lucky"" red shirt is so closely associated with their one and (so far) only World Cup success. But do England have a better record when playing in red? England currently have an impressive 17-game undefeated streak in red. Their last loss in a red shirt was in 2010, in a4-1 World Cup defeat to Germany,external. But in the semi-final with Croatia, the Three Lions will be playing in all white - despite being the designated ""away"" team. Croatia will not wear their famous red and white chequered shirts in Wednesday's match According to FIFA, the team assigned as the ""home"" side gets to wear their regular strip. If the ""away"" team's kit colour clashes, the away side wears their reserve kit. But because the Croatians normally play in red and white chequered shirts - which clash with both of England's strips - they will instead play in blue and black. See more stories and videos like this England do have a history of playing in white at the World Cup semi-final stage: they did so in 1966 and in 1990. However, some fans would prefer it if England were marching out in red for this semi-final encounter: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At Reality Check we have analysed the almost 600 games (including friendlies) England have played between their 1966 World Cup success and their 2018 World Cup quarter-final win against Sweden. In that period (1966-2018) England played in white 449 times. They won 258 times (57%), drew 109 (24%) and lost 82 (18%). England also played in red 104 times - winning 53 of those matches (51%), drawing 31 (30%) and losing 20 (19%). So the likelihood of losing a game is still around one in five regardless of whether England play in white or red - in fact England's record is slightly better in white. Over the years England have also occasionally played in different iterations of blue, such as 1996 when they wore ""indigo-blue"" - although most people watching thought it was closer to grey. In blue, the loss record is still 20% - only a couple of percentage points higher than white. Gareth Southgate was wearing England's ""indigo blue"" kit in the Euro 96 semi-final loss to Germany In 1973, England played three games in yellow. However, there were no Brazil-like performances - they failed to win a single game. But can the colour of a team's kit really influence performance? In 2008 Durham and Plymouth university researcherspublished a paper,externalarguing red kits were associated with long-term success in the English professional game. They said since 1947, English football teams in the top four divisions with a red home kit have been champions more often than would normally be expected (Arsenal, Liverpool, and Manchester United all play in red). Do footballers get paid for internationals? Should you enter your office sweepstake? Does form count at the World Cup? One theory is that wearing red could give a team a psychological advantage -  because the colour is often associated with aggression and could make a team more confident as well as making opponents feel intimidated. But a more practical reason could be that red, as well as other bright colours, simply improves visibility. This makes it easier to pick out teammates, especially when passing the ball. A2015 Dutch study,externalfor the Journal of Sport Science undertook video experiments to see how easy it was to spot players on the pitch in different coloured kits. And the good news - from England's point of view - is that, according to the research, white provides the best vision against a green football field. So in white or red, the chances of football coming home are roughly the same. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Man unlawfully kept from daughter gets Â£40k,"The man - referred to as AJS - was held at Wormwood Scrubs in London The Home Office has admitted that it unlawfully detained an Indian man for three months under immigration powers, separating him from his young daughter. The father has been awarded Â£40,000 damages for ""false imprisonment"" and ""disruption"" to contact with the child, a Lithuanian national who is now four. The Home Office will also pay the child Â£10,000 damages and the family's legal costs will be met. Without legal intervention, the child could have been placed for adoption. Stephanie Harrison, QC, for the man known only as AJS, told the High Court the case pointed to ""systemic failures"" on the part of the Home Office. In June 2017, after AJS had served a prison sentence for wounding, the Home Office ordered him to be detained pending his deportation - despite a local authority recommending that he be reunited with his daughter so that he could care for her. He was held under immigration powers at Wormwood Scrubs prison in London and then the Verne immigration removal centre, Dorset - 250 miles from where his daughter was living, in local authority care. The Verne opened as an adult male immigration removal centre in 2014 In July 2017, a family court judge endorsed the local authority's plan for AJS to look after his daughter, saying that, if he was not released within four months an application would be made for the girl to be placed for adoption. The Home Office refused to move AJS so he could maintain contact with the girl, twice refused him bail and, when he was finally let out, placed him on an electronic tag with a curfew which meant it was impractical for the pair to be reunited. The High Court heard that the Home Office now accepted it had acted unlawfully. The process has begun for the man and his daughter to live together so that he can look after her. Mr Justice Blair described the outcome as ""reassuring and heart-warming"".

First hospital video emerges of Thai boys,"This video can not be played The boys give peace signs as they recover in hospital The first footage has emerged from the hospital where 12 Thai boys and their coach are being treated after their dramatic rescue from a flooded cave. Several boys can be seen in facemasks and hospital gowns, at least one giving a peace sign for the camera. Meanwhile, reports say the boys and the coach were sedated to stop them panicking during the dangerous rescue. The Thai Navy Seals also released new video showing the three-day rescue operation that captivated the world. Divers who took part in the operation said the boys were heavily sedated to avoid anxiety as they went through the dark, narrow, underwater passageways. Former Navy seal Chaiyananta Peeranarong told AFP news agency: ""Some of them were asleep, and some of them were wiggling their fingers, kind of groggy - but they were breathing. My job was to transfer them along."" Each boy was strapped to one of two rescue divers tasked with shepherding him, and bundled onto stretchers to be carried through the dry parts. This video can not be played Rescuers carry one of the boys on a stretcher Earlier on Wednesday, the head of the Thai Navy Seals told the BBC that ""hope became reality"" with the rescue of the boys and their coach from the Tham Luang cave. ""We had a little bit of hope that they might still be alive but we had to do it, we just had to move forward,"" Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew said. ""There was only a tiny bit of hope, but that's all we had to work with."" The boys were rescued during a complex three-day operation Families were able to see the boys from a separate room The group was trapped in the cave by rising water andrescued in a dramatic operation that captivated the world. The complex, three-day rescue saw four boys emerge on Sunday, four on Monday, and the final four boys plus their coach on Tuesday. They survived the nine days before they were found by drinking water dripping from the cave walls, officials said. The doctor who stayed with the boys Heroes who saved the Wild Boars Football teams offer support to rescued boys A picture released by the Seal team shows a person being stretchered out of the cave The boys lost on average 2kg (4.4lb) during their ordeal but are said to be in good physical condition. They will remain in hospital in the nearby city of Chiang Rai for a week, followed by a week's recuperation at home. The first four boys have already been visited by their families, officials said, and the others will be allowed to receive visitors soon. Joy and relief as Thai cave boys rescued How the Thai boys were rescued Heroic diver gave his life to the rescue This video can not be played Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew, head of the Thai navy seals: ""There was only a tiny bit of hope"" There were cheers around the cave as the dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers involved in the operation left the site. In Chiang Rai, the news was greeted by the honking of car horns while people gathered outside the hospital broke into applause. On social media, Thais showed their feelings about the rescuers by using hashtags including #Heroes and #Thankyou. Offers of hospitality for the boys, the coach and their rescuers have come in from international football clubs including Manchester United and Benfica. Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team entered the cave system in dry weather, during an excursion with their coach. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded the cave complex. The story of the rescue - told for children They were huddled in darkness on a ledge when they were found by British divers. Elation at the discovery of the group quickly turned to concern as it became clear how difficult it would be to rescue boys who could not swim and had been weakened by their time underground. Getting to and from the chamber where the group were trapped was an exhausting round trip even for experienced divers. The process involved a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes. The boys and their coach were trapped underground for a total of 17 days. They reportedly entered the cave to celebrate one of the team's birthday, and the snacks they brought with them are thought to have helped sustain them. Once found, they were given ""easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor"", said Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew. The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Rescuers brought them food, light and letters from their parents to help them cope Authorities said they seemed to cope well with the mental strain of their time underground. Rescue teams brought them lights andletters from their parentsto help them cope. Their coach, Ekapol Chantawong, reportedly taught the team how to meditate to cope with the stress. He trained for a decade as a Buddhist monk before turning to football. Details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. CaptainDuganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.

My job was to transfer them along."" Each boy was strapped to one of two rescue divers tasked with shepherding him, and bundled onto stretchers to be carried through the dry parts. This video can not be played Rescuers carry one of the boys on a stretcher Earlier on Wednesday, the head of the Thai Navy Seals told the BBC that ""hope became reality"" with the rescue of the boys and their coach from the Tham Luang cave. ""We had a little bit of hope that they might still be alive but we had to do it, we just had to move forward,"" Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew said. ""There was only a tiny bit of hope, but that's all we had to work with."" The boys were rescued during a complex three-day operation Families were able to see the boys from a separate room The group was trapped in the cave by rising water andrescued in a dramatic operation that captivated the world. The complex, three-day rescue saw four boys emerge on Sunday, four on Monday, and the final four boys plus their coach on Tuesday. They survived the nine days before they were found by drinking water dripping from the cave walls, officials said. The doctor who stayed with the boys Heroes who saved the Wild Boars Football teams offer support to rescued boys A picture released by the Seal team shows a person being stretchered out of the cave The boys lost on average 2kg (4.4lb) during their ordeal but are said to be in good physical condition. They will remain in hospital in the nearby city of Chiang Rai for a week, followed by a week's recuperation at home. The first four boys have already been visited by their families, officials said, and the others will be allowed to receive visitors soon. Joy and relief as Thai cave boys rescued How the Thai boys were rescued Heroic diver gave his life to the rescue This video can not be played Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew, head of the Thai navy seals: ""There was only a tiny bit of hope"" There were cheers around the cave as the dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers involved in the operation left the site. In Chiang Rai, the news was greeted by the honking of car horns while people gathered outside the hospital broke into applause. On social media, Thais showed their feelings about the rescuers by using hashtags including #Heroes and #Thankyou. Offers of hospitality for the boys, the coach and their rescuers have come in from international football clubs including Manchester United and Benfica. Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team entered the cave system in dry weather, during an excursion with their coach. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded the cave complex. The story of the rescue - told for children They were huddled in darkness on a ledge when they were found by British divers. Elation at the discovery of the group quickly turned to concern as it became clear how difficult it would be to rescue boys who could not swim and had been weakened by their time underground. Getting to and from the chamber where the group were trapped was an exhausting round trip even for experienced divers. The process involved a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes. The boys and their coach were trapped underground for a total of 17 days. They reportedly entered the cave to celebrate one of the team's birthday, and the snacks they brought with them are thought to have helped sustain them. Once found, they were given ""easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor"", said Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew. The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Rescuers brought them food, light and letters from their parents to help them cope Authorities said they seemed to cope well with the mental strain of their time underground. Rescue teams brought them lights andletters from their parentsto help them cope. Their coach, Ekapol Chantawong, reportedly taught the team how to meditate to cope with the stress. He trained for a decade as a Buddhist monk before turning to football. Details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. CaptainDuganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.

Man unlawfully kept from daughter gets ÃÂ£40k,"The man - referred to as AJS - was held at Wormwood Scrubs in London The Home Office has admitted that it unlawfully detained an Indian man for three months under immigration powers, separating him from his young daughter. The father has been awarded Â£40,000 damages for ""false imprisonment"" and ""disruption"" to contact with the child, a Lithuanian national who is now four. The Home Office will also pay the child Â£10,000 damages and the family's legal costs will be met. Without legal intervention, the child could have been placed for adoption. Stephanie Harrison, QC, for the man known only as AJS, told the High Court the case pointed to ""systemic failures"" on the part of the Home Office. In June 2017, after AJS had served a prison sentence for wounding, the Home Office ordered him to be detained pending his deportation - despite a local authority recommending that he be reunited with his daughter so that he could care for her. He was held under immigration powers at Wormwood Scrubs prison in London and then the Verne immigration removal centre, Dorset - 250 miles from where his daughter was living, in local authority care. The Verne opened as an adult male immigration removal centre in 2014 In July 2017, a family court judge endorsed the local authority's plan for AJS to look after his daughter, saying that, if he was not released within four months an application would be made for the girl to be placed for adoption. The Home Office refused to move AJS so he could maintain contact with the girl, twice refused him bail and, when he was finally let out, placed him on an electronic tag with a curfew which meant it was impractical for the pair to be reunited. The High Court heard that the Home Office now accepted it had acted unlawfully. The process has begun for the man and his daughter to live together so that he can look after her. Mr Justice Blair described the outcome as ""reassuring and heart-warming"".

'No blame' over girl's car drowning death,"This video can not be played Kiara Moore drowned when her parents' car rolled into the River Teifi in March The father of a two-year-old girl who died when her parents' car rolled into a river has said there was ""no point in blaming anyone"". Kiara Moore was found by divers in the River Teifi in Cardigan, Ceredigion in March - a week before her third birthday. Her father, Jet, said he would ""imagine"" she was still alive and still read her favourite book regularly. ""There is no point in blaming anyone,"" he said. ""It was a freak accident."" In May, Dyfed-Powys Police said inquiries had concluded andno chargeswould be brought. ""It doesn't seem that she has gone,"" said Mr Moore, in an interview with BBC Wales. ""You still imagine she's there - maybe that's my way of dealing with it, but her happiness and fun is still with me."" Mr Moore and his partner, Kim Rowlands, initially thought their car had been stolen whenit vanished from the slipway outside their business on 19 Marchwith their daughter inside. But after a police search the silver Mini was found in the river, along with Kiara's body. Jet Moore said his daughter had died in a ""freak accident"" and he thought about her every day In a Facebook post written shortly after her death, which has since been deleted, her mother Kim said her ""beautiful baby girl"" had died, adding: ""Due to my own stupidity, I will have to live with the guilt of this for the rest of my life. ""Mummy loves you baby girl and I'm so sorry."" Mr Moore said: ""There is no blame for that day. There is no point in blaming anyone. ""If you go back to that day there was so many little things that happened that, if you were to try and do it again, wouldn't happen. ""At worst, what could I blame? I could blame the handbrake on the car, maybe, if I felt the need to. ""Sometimes your mind wanders off to what happened. Could any of us have changed anything? We could have not got out of bed that day, we could have not gone to work. But that's all could ofs - there's no point really of dwelling."" Mum 'so sorry' for girl's river death Social media warning after child's death Mr Moore said he worried that he would forget his daughter, and hoped something positive would come out of her death. ""She was, I suppose, hopefully like me a bit, just enjoyed being outside constantly, enjoyed being around people,"" he said. ""She absolutely loved water, whether that was a swimming pool or out and about with us, and then on the farm with grandad, getting muddy, jumping in the puddles, being a bit like Peppa Pig."" The family hiked up Snowdon to scatter Kiara's ashes after her sudden death, which Mr Moore said was something her mother Kim really wanted to do He said he continues to read one of her favourite books, Dear Zoo, to remember his daughter, said the family carried a little Donald Duck toy in her memory when they went on adventures. The first trip they took as a family after her death was up Snowdon, in north Wales, where they scattered her ashes. ""She was everywhere with us, so wherever we have been since, we can say: 'Oh yeah, Kiara was here doing this or that.' In three years she did a lot,"" he said. Mr Moore continues to run his outdoor pursuits business close to where his daughter's body was found, but said being on the water had given him a sort of therapy. ""[The water] has given me so much, but it's also taken away something so special,"" he said. ""It took us a while to decide whether we were going to come back, but the river and the area is a beautiful area. The accident that happened on that day was a freak accident. ""I'm still constantly thinking about her and that it happened, but then I also try and lead my mind into a positive way of how much fun she also had. ""You've got two choices in my mind - you give up or you carry on"", he said, ""I couldn't just sit indoors and give up."" Mr Moore isappealing for help and support,externalto set up a foundation in Kiara's name to offer adventure therapy to other bereaved families. ""There are definitely moments when it is not so positive, when it is hard,"" he said. ""The hope for any of your kids is that they go on to do great things. She hasn't got that now, but in three years she inspired a lot of people,even at her funeral I think there were 500 people there, and for a three year old, to have that many people at your funeral, that's pretty impressive. ""There's absolutely nothing we can do about what happened that day, it's one of those awful accidents, we can't change that, but I guess we can move forward and make hopefully the best of what we can as a life in the future. ""I hope this can be Kiara's legacy. That it can do something of good."" An inquest into Kiara's death has been opened and adjourned.

Murder victim beaten with own false leg,"Mark Swinhoe's family described him as a ""loving and caring man"" A man was beaten with his own prosthetic leg before being stabbed to death in a drugs deal that went wrong. Mark Swinhoe, 38, from Long Eaton, Derbyshire, died in Moira Street, Loughborough, in the early hours of 14 January. He was attacked and killed by two men in what detectives described as a ""vicious and violent encounter"".

Jamie Wileman, 24, of Elm Grove, Moira, was found guilty of Mr Swinhoe's manslaughter but acquitted of murder. Paul Anthony Williams, 38, of no fixed address, was acquitted of both murder and manslaughter. Mark Swinhoe was treated by paramedics for a stab wound but died at the scene Detectives said Mr Swinhoe had no intention to pay for the drugs and was going to rob the defendants. A post-mortem examination found he died due to a stab wound, but witnesses said he was also hit with the prosthetic leg. A friend who was with him in Moira Street suffered bruising to her body and a cut to her face. Det Ch Insp Martin Smalley, who led the investigation, said: ""Matthews came armed with a weapon and had no qualms in attacking Mr Swinhoe. This was a vicious attack by any definition.""

Amol Rajan: The issue with BBC Studios,"Tony Hall says the BBC's current fixed income is ""not sustainable"" The publication of this report shows the perennial difficulty of reporting any financial year, and the disadvantages of removing BBC Studios from the equation of salaries disclosed. While there has been some progress in improving the overall balance of this list - on which my own name appears - the top of the list is still dominated by men. Had BBC Studios' salaries been included, there would have been a better balance of men and women overall on the list, and more of the names at the very summit of the list would have been female. But the BBC argues that it needs BBC Studios to flourish commercially, and publishing names there would put it at a disadvantage. The other problem for the corporation is that, because the figures here reflect the past financial year, major changes - whether some men being paid less, or some women being paid more - aren't in the figures available today. They will only filter through next year. This is the sense in which such financial reporting always seems a year behind. While the issue of equal pay and the gender pay gap will dominate headlines, the annual report mentions an existential question for the BBC, which the director-general also addressed when I spoke to him. Lord Hall of Birkenhead says the current model of the BBC, in which it has a fixed income in a super-inflationary market - where the likes of Amazon, Netflix, and Disney are all spending billions building direct-to-consumer, global offerings - ""is not sustainable"". I asked him what he intends to do about this. Apparently the BBC board are turning their attention to this in the autumn, making it a priority after August. But it already feels late. Devising a plausible solution to the BBC's fixed revenue model, perhaps in conjunction with other public service broadcasters - or failing to do so - will be an even bigger part of Lord Hall's legacy than equal pay.

Chris Evans tops 2017 salaries list,"Evans and Winkleman are the BBC's highest paid male and female stars Chris Evans has topped the list of the BBC's best-paid stars. He made between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m in 2016/2017, while Claudia Winkleman was the highest-paid female celebrity, earning between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000. About two-thirds of stars earning more than Â£150,000 are male, compared to one-third female, according to theBBC annual report,external. Director general Tony Hall said there was ""more to do"" on gender and diversity. BBC pay: Who earns what? What will the industry make of star pay? Stars on their pay Reality Check: The gender pay gap It is the first time the pay of stars earning more than Â£150,000 has been made public. The BBC has been compelled to reveal the information, including the pay of 96 of its top stars, under the terms of its new Royal Charter. The total bill for the 96 personalities was Â£28.7m; but the figures in the report reveal large disparities betweenwhat men and women are paid,external. Overall, 25 men on the talent list receive more than Â£250,000, compared to just nine women. Speaking on LBC Radio, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We've seen the way the BBC is paying women less for doing the same job... I want women to be paid equally."" When asked if Chris Evans was worth 12 of her, Mrs May - who earns about Â£150,000 - said: ""What's important is that the BBC looks at the question of paying men and women the same for doing the same job."" ""On gender and diversity, the BBC is more diverse than the broadcasting industry and the civil service,"" Lord Hall said. ""We've made progress, but we recognise there is more to do and we are pushing further and faster than any other broadcaster."" When asked if female talent working at the BBC would now be asking for pay rises, Lord Hall said: ""We will be working carefully on our relationship with our talent."" Woman's Hour'sJane Garvey tweeted,external: ""I'm looking forward to presenting @BBCWomansHour today. We'll be discussing #GenderPayGap . As we've done since 1946. Going well, isn't it?"" Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, who did not appear on the list,retweeted Garvey's message,external. There is also a gap between the pay for white stars and those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background. George Alagiah, Jason Mohammad and Trevor Nelson are the highest paid BAME presenters, each receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. The highest-paid female star with a BAME background is BBC news presenter Mishal Husain, who earned between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000. The annual report contains pay information in bands and does not reveal exact amounts. Nor does it include stars who receive their pay through BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm. The figures quoted only refer to the amount of licence fee money each person receives and do not include their earnings from other broadcasters or commercial activities. They also exclude stars paid through independent production companies. That means some big name stars - such as David Attenborough, Benedict Cumberbatch and Matt LeBlanc - do not appear on the list. The list also does not distinguish between people who are paid for doing multiple jobs within the BBC and those who are just paid for one. Two of the judges on Strictly are in a higher pay bracket than the others - but they also work for other BBC shows Strictly Come Dancing head judge Len Goodman - who has now left the show - and fellow judge Bruno Tonioli were both in the Â£200,000-Â£250,000 band. The show's other judges, Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell, got between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000. Tess Daly, Winkleman's Strictly Come Dancing co-host, was paid between Â£350,000 and Â£400,000. Graham Norton earned more than Â£850,000 but this does not include payments to his production company, which makes The Graham Norton Show and pays him a separate salary. The BBC is alone amongst the UK's major broadcasters in releasing pay details for its on-air and on-screen talent. Talent pay is considerably higher in the commercial sector. As he left the BBC after his Radio 2 breakfast show on Wednesday, Chris Evans said it was right ""on balance"" that star salaries were being disclosed. ""We are the ultimate public company I think, and therefore it's probably right and proper people know what we get paid,"" he told reporters. During a briefing on the annual report on Wednesday morning, Lord Hall said: ""Chris Evans is presenting the most popular show on the most popular radio network in Europe. ""The BBC does not exist in a market on its own where it can set the market rates. ""If we are to give the public what they want, then we have to pay for those great presenters and stars."" Aside from Strictly, Winkleman's other BBC roles include presenting The Great British Sewing Bee and her Radio 2 Sunday night show. Her agent said she would be making no comment. If you ask experienced people in the world of broadcasting what they think of these salary disclosures, three clear and consistent points are apparent. First, the BBC pays below - and sometimes much below - market rates, both at management level and in terms of top broadcasting talent. Second, this move will prove inflationary. Those on the list will think to themselves: ""Why is that inferior presenter getting paid more than me?"" - and will demand a pay rise. Third, if you thought it was tin hat time for the talent, pity the poor agents they work with. Read more from Amol here. Casualty star Derek Thompson was the BBC's highest paid actor, receiving between Â£350,000 and Â£400,000 over the last financial year. Amanda Mealing, who also stars in Casualty as well as Holby City, was the highest paid actress, receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. Peter Capaldi, the outgoing star of Doctor Who, was paid between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000. Clare Balding earned between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 for her work on sports shows including Wimbledon Today and the Rio Olympics. Casualty stars Derek Thompson and Amanda Mealing are the BBC's best-paid actors The overall spend on talent was Â£193.5m - down on the Â£200m spent in 2015/2016. The figures also showed a decrease - from 109 to 96 - in the number of stars paid more than Â£150,000. The total spend on stars with salaries of more than Â£150,000 was also down Â£5 million on the Â£31.9 million paid in the previous financial year. This video can not be played Ex-BBC chairman Lord Grade describes the corporation's disclosure of talent pay as ""disturbing"" Speaking on the Today programme, Lord Grade - a former BBC One controller - called the government's insistence that talent pay be disclosed ""distasteful and disturbing"". ""The net result of this is inflation,"" he said. ""Talent salaries and wages will round upwards, they won't go down."" Former culture secretary John Whittingdale MP said: ""If somebody is earning the equivalent of 1,000 households' licence fees put togetherâ¦ the licence fee payer deserves to know."" The annual report showed that the BBC continues to reach 95 percent of UK adults every week. It also said the iPlayer had its most successful year to date, with an average of 246 million requests each month.

Saving homeless Ryan,"Businessman James Minns offered Ryan Davidson a job after talking to him on a Newcastle street This picture captures the moment a homeless man arrived for his first day of work, after being offered a permanent job by a businessman he had asked for ""spare change"" on a Newcastle street. Posted on Facebook on Thursday, a photo of their first encounter has been shared more than 4,000 times and prompted 11,000 interactions. Allow Facebook content?

Ryan Davidson, 25, has been looking for permanent housing for two years. He told BBC News he now had hope for the future. ""James was walking past me, so I asked him for spare change,"" he said. ""He stopped and seemed like a genuine, nice guy. ""We chatted for a while and then he said he had a company and could offer me a job - I couldn't believe it."" James Minns, who owns a paint-coating company in the city, had been enjoying a meal to celebrate his wedding anniversary, with his wife and two friends, moments earlier. ""I saw Ryan's big smile and we started talking,"" James told BBC News. ""If you were offered a job, would you take it?"" James asked. ""100%,"" replied Ryan. James told Ryan where his factory was and they shook hands on the job offer, with Ryan promising to turn up for work on the factory floor. But what James thought was an innocent Facebook post about the encounter soon began gathering pace. ""I logged into my Facebook on Friday and there were hundreds of notifications and thousands of friend requests - I couldn't believe it,""  James told BBC News. ""Fingers crossed he takes the opportunity,"" postedone Facebook user,external. Another post read: ""Our county needs more companies like you to believe in these people."" One of the people who responded to James after seeing the post was Ryan's aunt. And she was able to provide a mobile phone number on which he could be contacted. James rang Ryan on Friday to confirm his start time on Monday. And his optimism increased when Ian Cutts, a local milkman, who had also seen the Facebook post, offered to collect Ryan for his first day and give him a lift to the factory. Thai cave rescue: The doctor who chose to stay Where a six-figure salary is 'low income' 'Handmaid's Tale' moment at US airport By Sunday, however, Ryan had stopped answering his phone. And, at 06:30 on Monday, when Ian arrived at the meeting point they had agreed, there was no sign of Ryan. Jamesalerted his growing band of Facebook followers,external, telling them: ""Morning everyone, unfortunately Ryan didn't show up. Ian Erniethemilkman Cutts was there at 6.30am to pick him up. Waited 30 mins and he didn't show. I've rang him several times and got no answer too. Totally gutted tbh."" And the news provoked a downturn in mood on the social network. ""Such a shame"" readone Facebook post,external. However, the story does have a happy ending. Ryan had had to attend an emergency housing appointment on Monday morning and had been unable to let James know as his phone had run out of credit. But he turned up for work bright and early the next day and, he told BBC News, his first day on the job could not have gone better. Allow Facebook content?

James told BBC News the social media reaction to his Facebook posts had prompted so many other offers of help for Ryan and ""messages from people who want to see him do well"" he had now set up fundraising web page for him ""We are going to use the proceeds to find Ryan permanent housing,"" he added. And Ryan told BBC News he had been simply overwhelmed by the response. ""It has opened my eyes to how generous and kind people can be,"" he said.

Neo-Nazi given life for German race murders,"Beate ZschÃ¤pe was at the centre of one of the longest trials in modern German history After a five-year trial, a member of a neo-Nazi gang has been found guilty of 10 racially-motivated murders. Beate ZschÃ¤pe was the main defendant on trial over the murder of eight ethnic Turks, a Greek citizen and a policewoman between 2000 and 2007. The Munich state court's verdict carries an automatic life sentence. The connection between the murders was only discovered by chance in 2011, after a botched robbery led to the neo-Nazi group's discovery. ZschÃ¤pe, 43, shared a flat in the eastern town of Zwickau with two men, who died in an apparent suicide pact. The bodies of Uwe Mundlos and Uwe BÃ¶hnhardt were found in a burnt-out caravan used in the robbery. ZschÃ¤pe, Mundlos and BÃ¶hnhardt had formed a terrorist cell called the National Socialist Underground (NSU). A fire at their home - apparently in an attempt to destroy evidence - led to ZschÃ¤pe turning herself in. The NSU's seven-year campaign exposed serious shortcomings in the German state's monitoring of neo-Nazis, and led to a public inquiry into how police failed to discover the murder plot. More than 600 witnesses were heard in the Munich court, making the trial one of the biggest in Germany's post-war history. Four other defendants were also given jail terms for their role in helping the NSU gang: Ralf Wohllebenwas sentenced to 10 years for aiding and abetting murder - he procured the silenced gun Carsten Schultze,a juvenile at the time, was found guilty of handing the gang the pistol and silencer, and was given three years AndrÃ© Emingerwas given two years and six months for helping a terrorist group Holger Gerlachreceived three years for giving his birth certificate and other ID to Uwe Mundlos Speaking ahead of the verdict, ZschÃ¤pe's defence lawyer said she would appeal against any life sentence. During the trial, ZschÃ¤pe denied taking part in the murders, saying she only knew of them after they were committed by Mundlos and BÃ¶hnhardt. The NSU case covers 10 murders, two bomb attacks in Cologne, which left more than 20 people injured, and 15 bank robberies. The murder victims were mainly ethnic Turks, shot during their working days with a CZ 83 handgun over the course of seven years. German police photos of eight victims: (top, L-R) Enver Simsek, Abdurrahim Ozudogru, Suleyman Taskopru and Habil Kilic and (bottom, L-R) Yunus Turgut, Ismail Yasar, Theodorus Boulgarides and Mehmet Kubasik One Greek victim, Theodoros Boulgarides, was also killed in 2005. The final victim was MichÃ¨le Kiesewetter, a German policewoman, who was shot and killed while sitting in a patrol car on her break in 2007. The link between the murders would only be discovered years later. Police had long suspected that the killers were ethnic Turks in the victims' communities, earning them the nickname the ""Bosphorus"" murders after Istanbul's famous river. The derogatory term ""doner murders"" - in reference to kebabs - was used by some parts of Germany's press. Investigators had thought some of the victims were killed following involvement in criminal activities - allegations that have since been retracted in court. Victims' families, their lawyers and activists have long expressed their frustration at Germany's fragmented policing system, with 16 different jurisdictions for the 16 states. They believe institutional racism hampered the investigation and the trial. Abdulkerim Simsek (l) and Gamze Kubasik are children of victims murdered by NSU in 2000 and 2006 respectively In particular, they have pointed to the domestic intelligence agency BfV, which destroyed and redacted files related to the terror cell after they became publicly known in 2011 and protected paid informants in the neo-Nazi scene from testifying fully. German far-right terror attackers jailed Girl scout stands up to Neo-Nazi in viral photo YouTube's neo-Nazi music problem Abdulkerim Simsek was 13 years old when his father, a florist and NSU's first victim, was killed in 2000. He told German media seeing his father's bullet ridden body ""was the worst day of my life"". He and other victims' relatives believe there are more perpetrators yet to be brought to trial. ""Someone with local knowledge has scouted all the victims,"" Mr Simseks told German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung. ""This scout and other NSU helpers are still running free around here. That bothers me a lot."" Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent ZschÃ¤pe was smiling and relaxed in the minutes before she was sentenced to life in prison. The 43-year-old has spoken just twice during the five-year trial. But while the guilty verdicts will probably be welcomed by the families of the victims, neither these proceedings nor a number of official inquiries have answered fundamental questions. How and why did the killers select their victims? And why did the German authorities - who relied on paid informants from within the neo-Nazi community and stand accused of institutionalised racism - seemingly do so little to protect them? In 2011, an unusual DVD was received by some German press outlets. It showed the iconic cartoon character the Pink Panther in a doctored cartoon, displaying messages from the NSU about the murders, along with spliced footage of the bombings. The neo-Nazis boasted about the murders in a ""Pink Panther"" confession video On 4 November 2011, Mundlos and BÃ¶hnhardt robbed a bank in a German town, one of a string of similar heists. This time, police were able to follow them to a caravan they had hidden in. Despite being armed, the pair did not put up any resistance - and were found dead inside. Investigators believe Mundlos shot BÃ¶hnhardt before killing himself. ZschÃ¤pe, now the only surviving member of the NSU trio, apparently set fire to the apartment where all three had lived together in Zwickau. She turned herself in a few days later. The neo-Nazi cell's burnt-out Zwickau home in November 2011 The fire damage to her home had not destroyed everything - and investigators found a copy of the Pink Panther DVD, linking the trio to the NSU name and the murders. The suspected murder weapon - the Ceska pistol - was also found in the ruins. The public now knew a neo-Nazi cell had operated with impunity for 11 years, murdering 10 people - and had remained unknown to police. Widespread public outrage followed, along with multipleparliamentary investigations which demanded tighter surveillance of neo-Nazi activities. In July 2015 the German parliament, or Bundestag, passed a set of reforms giving greater power to the BfV to avoid a repeat of the failures in the NSU investigation. It included key changes to the use of paid informants, known as ""V-Leute"".

'No blame' over girl's car drowning deathTwo-year-old Kiara Moore died when her parents' car rolled into a river with her inside.Wales,"This video can not be played Kiara Moore drowned when her parents' car rolled into the River Teifi in March The father of a two-year-old girl who died when her parents' car rolled into a river has said there was ""no point in blaming anyone"". Kiara Moore was found by divers in the River Teifi in Cardigan, Ceredigion in March - a week before her third birthday. Her father, Jet, said he would ""imagine"" she was still alive and still read her favourite book regularly. ""There is no point in blaming anyone,"" he said. ""It was a freak accident."" In May, Dyfed-Powys Police said inquiries had concluded andno chargeswould be brought. ""It doesn't seem that she has gone,"" said Mr Moore, in an interview with BBC Wales. ""You still imagine she's there - maybe that's my way of dealing with it, but her happiness and fun is still with me."" Mr Moore and his partner, Kim Rowlands, initially thought their car had been stolen whenit vanished from the slipway outside their business on 19 Marchwith their daughter inside. But after a police search the silver Mini was found in the river, along with Kiara's body. Jet Moore said his daughter had died in a ""freak accident"" and he thought about her every day In a Facebook post written shortly after her death, which has since been deleted, her mother Kim said her ""beautiful baby girl"" had died, adding: ""Due to my own stupidity, I will have to live with the guilt of this for the rest of my life. ""Mummy loves you baby girl and I'm so sorry."" Mr Moore said: ""There is no blame for that day. There is no point in blaming anyone. ""If you go back to that day there was so many little things that happened that, if you were to try and do it again, wouldn't happen. ""At worst, what could I blame? I could blame the handbrake on the car, maybe, if I felt the need to. ""Sometimes your mind wanders off to what happened. Could any of us have changed anything? We could have not got out of bed that day, we could have not gone to work. But that's all could ofs - there's no point really of dwelling."" Mum 'so sorry' for girl's river death Social media warning after child's death Mr Moore said he worried that he would forget his daughter, and hoped something positive would come out of her death. ""She was, I suppose, hopefully like me a bit, just enjoyed being outside constantly, enjoyed being around people,"" he said. ""She absolutely loved water, whether that was a swimming pool or out and about with us, and then on the farm with grandad, getting muddy, jumping in the puddles, being a bit like Peppa Pig."" The family hiked up Snowdon to scatter Kiara's ashes after her sudden death, which Mr Moore said was something her mother Kim really wanted to do He said he continues to read one of her favourite books, Dear Zoo, to remember his daughter, said the family carried a little Donald Duck toy in her memory when they went on adventures. The first trip they took as a family after her death was up Snowdon, in north Wales, where they scattered her ashes. ""She was everywhere with us, so wherever we have been since, we can say: 'Oh yeah, Kiara was here doing this or that.' In three years she did a lot,"" he said. Mr Moore continues to run his outdoor pursuits business close to where his daughter's body was found, but said being on the water had given him a sort of therapy. ""[The water] has given me so much, but it's also taken away something so special,"" he said. ""It took us a while to decide whether we were going to come back, but the river and the area is a beautiful area. The accident that happened on that day was a freak accident. ""I'm still constantly thinking about her and that it happened, but then I also try and lead my mind into a positive way of how much fun she also had. ""You've got two choices in my mind - you give up or you carry on"", he said, ""I couldn't just sit indoors and give up."" Mr Moore isappealing for help and support,externalto set up a foundation in Kiara's name to offer adventure therapy to other bereaved families. ""There are definitely moments when it is not so positive, when it is hard,"" he said. ""The hope for any of your kids is that they go on to do great things. She hasn't got that now, but in three years she inspired a lot of people,even at her funeral I think there were 500 people there, and for a three year old, to have that many people at your funeral, that's pretty impressive. ""There's absolutely nothing we can do about what happened that day, it's one of those awful accidents, we can't change that, but I guess we can move forward and make hopefully the best of what we can as a life in the future. ""I hope this can be Kiara's legacy. That it can do something of good."" An inquest into Kiara's death has been opened and adjourned.

"Baron Cohen 'dupes' Palin for new seriesSarah Palin calls the Borat star ""truly sick"" for posing as a wounded military veteran.","Former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin says Sacha Baron Cohen ""duped"" her in an interview by posing as a wounded military veteran. The Borat star has been secretly filming for a new satirical comedy series that will air on TV next week. It was revealed on Monday the show - titled Who is America? - would explore ""diverse individuals"" in the US ""across the political and cultural spectrum"". Palin wrote on Facebook: ""Yup - we were duped. Ya' got me, Sacha. Feel better?"" She went on: ""I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick 'humour' of the British 'comedian' Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime."" Baron Cohen series to air on Channel 4 Baron Cohen is best known for hoaxing interviewees as comedy characters Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev and fashion reporter Bruno, all of whom inspired big-screen films. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, said she received a request to contribute to a ""legit historical documentary"" and travelled across the US with one of her daughters. She wrote: ""Baron Cohen (I presume) had heavily disguised himself as a disabled US Veteran, fake wheelchair and all. ""Out of respect for what I was led to believe would be a thoughtful discussion with someone who had served in uniform, I sat through a long 'interview' full of Hollywoodism's disrespect and sarcasm - but finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out, much to Cohen's chagrin. ""The disrespect of our US military and middle-class Americans via Cohen's foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions was perverse."" Palin, who asked for the proceeds from the programme to be donated to charity, added: ""Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country. Truly sick."" Last week, the comedian teased his comeback witha preview clip,externalshowing former US vice president Dick Cheney apparently agreeing to autograph a ""waterboard kit"" - in reality a plastic water jug. Who is America? will premiere on Showtime in the US on Sunday and the network has promised it will show the comedian and actor ""as you've never seen him before"". The series will begin in the UK on Monday on Channel 4 at 22:00 BST. Years before US presidentDonald Trumpentered the world of politics, he was interviewed by Ali G, Baron Cohen's Staines rapper. The famous interview saw his character try to pitch a business idea involving an ""ice cream glove"" to the entrepreneur. As part of a sketch for Channel 4's 11 O'Clock Show in 1998, Ali G got Conservative politicianRhodes Boysonto say that children should be ""caned"" at school, Baron Cohen was criticised for playing on Boyson's weakness as the politician had previously appeared on Have I Got News For You, apparently without realising it was a satirical comedy show. In an interview with former Conservative politicianNeil Hamiltonin 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton some ""cannabis"", which he accepted and smoked, creating minor controversy in the British media. In 2004, an episode of Da Ali G Show saw Borat interview Republican candidate for US Congress,James Broadwater. Borat's questions led Broadwater to say Jews would go to hell if they did not follow Christianity, which upset some Jewish communities. In the 2009 film of the same name, his character Bruno interviewed Republican presidential candidateRon Pauland in the scene tried and failed to seduce the Texas congressman into making a sex tape with Bruno, a gay Austrian TV host.

Cave rescue 'hope became reality',"This video can not be played Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yuukongkaew, head of the Thai navy seals: ""There was only a tiny bit of hope"" The head of the Thai Navy Seals has said ""hope became reality"" with the successful rescue of 12 boys and their coach from the Tham Luang cave. ""We had a little bit of hope that they might still be alive but we had to do it, we just had to move forward,"" Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew told the BBC. ""There was only a tiny bit of hope, but that's all we had to work with."" The group was trapped in the cave by rising water andrescued in a dramatic operation that captivated the world. The complex, three-day rescue saw four boys emerge on Sunday, four on Monday, and the final four boys plus their coach on Tuesday. They survived the nine days before they were found by drinking water dripping from the cave walls, officials said. The doctor who stayed with the boys Heroes who saved the Wild Boars Football teams offer support to rescued boys All 13 are now in hospital in Chiang Rai city and receiving medical and psychological assistance, but recovering well. A picture released by the Seal team shows a person being stretchered out of the cave There were conflicting reports following the rescue about the extent to which the boys had been medicated before they were brought out. The Thai prime minister on Tuesday denied reports that they had been sedated, saying the boys were given only light anti-anxiety medication commonly provided to soldiers. But sources in the rescue operation told the BBC that the boys were heavily sedated and only partially conscious, and had to be carried throughout the journey out of the cave. All of the boys lost weight during their ordeal and will remain in hospital for a week, followed by a week's recuperation for another week at home. Public health ministry officials said the first group were all eating normal food and the second group would be put on normal food as of Wednesday. The third group evacuated on Tuesday are undergoing the same medical check-ups as the first two groups but appeared to also be in good health. There are no cases of serious infections. The first four boys have already been visited by their families, officials said, and the second group will also be allowed to receive visitors later on Wednesday. Joy and relief as Thai cave boys rescued How the Thai boys were rescued Heroic diver gave his life to the rescue This video can not be played Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" ""We are not sure if this is a miracle, science, or what,"" wrote theThai Navy Seals,externalon Facebook on Tuesday. ""All the 13 Wild Boars are now out of the cave."" There were cheers around the Tham Luang cave system as the dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers involved in the operation left the site. In the nearby city of Chiang Rai, the news was greeted by the honking of car horns while people gathered outside the hospital broke into applause. On social media, Thais showed their feelings about the rescuers by using hashtags including #Heroes and #Thankyou. Offers of hospitality for the boys, the coach and their rescuers have come in from international football clubs including Manchester United and Benfica. Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team entered the cave system in dry weather, during an excursion with their coach. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded way the cave complex, blocking their way back out. The story of the rescue - told for children They were found nine days later when two expert British divers entered the cave. The boys were huddled in darkness on a ledge. Elation at the discovery of the group quickly turned to concern as it became clear just how difficult it would be to rescue boys who could not swim and had been weakened by their time underground. A team of expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave system. Getting to and from the trapped group was an exhausting round trip, even for experienced divers. The process involved a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy was accompanied by two divers, who also carried his air supply. The boys and their coach were trapped underground for a total of 17 days. Officials said the group survived the first nine days of their ordeal by drinking water dripping from the cave walls. They reportedly entered the cave to celebrate one of the team's birthday, and the snacks they brought with them are thought to have helped sustain them. Once found, they were given ""easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor"", said Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yuukongkaew. The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Rescuers brought them food, light and letters from their parents to help them cope According to Thongchai Lertwilairattanapong, an inspector for Thailand's health department, all the children lost on average 2kg during their time underground, but are in good physical condition. Authorities also said they seemed to cope well with the mental strain of their time underground. Rescue teams brought them lights andletters from their parentsto help them cope. And their coach, Ekapol Chantawong, reportedly taught the team how to meditate to cope with the stress. He trained for a decade as a Buddhist monk before turning to football. Details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. CaptainDuganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.

Prime Minister's Questions: The verdictDavid Lidington clashed with Emily Thornberry over Brexit turmoil - here are the key bits.UK Politics,"David Lidington went head-to-head with Emily Thornberry in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. With Theresa May at the Nato summit in Brussels, the PMQs ""B team"" stepped in to the breach. David Lidington, who is effectively Mrs May's second-in-command, congratulated Gareth Southgate and his England team and wished them ""the very best"", ahead of tonight's World Cup semi-final against Croatia. Then - just to get it out of the way - he had a joke at the expense of Jeremy Corbyn's stand-in Emily Thornberry, who four years agowas forced to quit the Labour front benchover what was branded a ""snobby"" tweet about a house decked out in England football flags. Mr Lidington offered to buy the shadow foreign secretary - who at the time denied the tweet was snobby and apologised for any offence caused by it - an England flag for the game.

Then, just as the two were about to start their exchanges, Speaker Bercow announced that two members of the Osmond family - the squeaky-clean Seventies chart toppers - were watching from the public gallery. ""It takes some of us back to the 1970s, we are very pleased to have you,"" he told Kelly and Merrill Osmond. Ms Thornberry began by revealing that she would be not be watching tonight's England game because she would be representing the Labour Party at a service to commemorate the Srebrenica genocide. This was a subject close to her heart, she explained to MPs, because her father, one-time UN Assistant Secretary General Cedric Thornberry, had played a role ""in trying to prevent it"". It was the only England game she had missed, she assured MPs, before wishing the team the ""best of luck"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She may know ""very little about football"", she went on, but even she knew the importance of teamwork and listening to the manager. What lessons could this ""shambles of a government"" learn from the England team? The government already knew about teamwork etc, said Mr Lidington, who wondered what Labour's alternative plan for Brexit was. Allow Twitter content?

""Even Donald Trump could see they were in turmoil and he hasn't even got to Britain,"" said Ms Thornberry. Mr Lidington had once compared Labour to the film ""Mutiny on the Bounty remade by the Carry On team"", she said. This government was now behaving ""like Reservoir Dogs remade by the Chuckle Brothers"". That got a big laugh from all sides of the House. Allow Twitter content?

But things then took a serious turn as the two got into a very detailed debate about post-Brexit trade arrangements. Ms Thornberry asked the minister to explain ""how frictionless trade was going to be achieved under their Brexit plan"". Mr Lidington repeatedly accused her of not properly understanding Mrs May's proposals and said more will be revealed in Thursday's white paper. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Lidington accused the Labour leadership of refusing to rule out another EU referendum.

Labour should get behind the government on Brexit and stop ""carping from the sidelines,"" he replied. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's verdict: There's never quite the same edge when it's the battle of the stand-ins at PMQsâ¦ but it is pretty clear from Emily Thornberry's (extended) line of questioning that Labour plan to hammer away at the Government's Chequers compromise, to stoke Brexiteer nervousness and punch the bruises in the Conservative ranks. She may have run a little aground in the sands of euro-detail, but the politics was surely correct, and as usual the pre-baked jokes were suitably biting. After this, any lingering notion that the government could rely on being bailed out by Labour votes if faced with a backbench rebellion against Chequers can be laid to rest. David Lidington remained, as ever, a calm professional presence at the Dispatch Box, and his riposte, that Labour's Brexit policy was the best kept secret in Westminster, hit home. These exchanges got unusually detailed, but it was never really about the detail. No-one who's been out and about in Westminster in the last couple of days can be in any doubt about the jittery combination of brave faces and angry nervousness in the hearts of Tory MPs. This was about keeping those hearts a-flutter, and not in a good way. Most backbenchers stayed out of the Brexiting but the Conservative Julia Lopez put down a marker about keeping faith with the referendum, and her words gave a clue about how high feelings are running. Elsewhere, there were a couple of Conservative questions about crime - suggesting the issue is climbing up the league-table of concerns. Keep an eye on that; it could goad the new Home Secretary (and possible future PM) Sajid Javid into action.

A single ticket was the only one to match all seven numbers - which were 03, 08, 26, 33 and 45 with Lucky Stars 07 and 10. Andy Carter, from the National Lottery, urged players to check their tickets.""Rest assured, we have plenty of champagne on ice,"" he said. The latest win comes just a few months aftera UK ticket-holder claimed Â£121m. That winner, who landed the prize in April, became the country's third biggest lottery winner of all time. Two months earlier, a UK ticket holder won almost Â£78m in the draw. The UK's largest EUromillions win of Â£161m went to Chris and Colin Weir in July 2011 Euromillions is played in nine countries - the UK, Austria, Belgium, France, the Irish Republic, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland - with ticket-holders trying to win a share of the same jackpot.

LiveWilliamson updates MPs on Afghanistan roleDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson is making a statement to the Commons on the UK's continued role in Afghanistan.Parliaments,"Environment questions to Michael Gove and team Urgent question on hostile environment agenda Urgent question on policing during US president's visit Business statement from Leader of the House Statement on Brexit white paper Richard Morris and Lucy Webster The UK government sets out in detail how it wants trade with the EU to work after Brexit. What happened? House of CommonsParliament Two urgent questions and a statement kept the Commons busy today. The sitting was briefly suspended about a minute into Dominic Raab's first speech from the dispatch box as Exiting the EU Secretary. The Speaker was unhappy that MPs did not have copies of the Brexit white paper in front of them to ask questions, so MPs started distributing them amongst themselves, during which time the sitting was suspended. MPs from all parties were critical of the move, while Mr Raab said he would speak to the clerks office over the confusion. Thelong-awaited White Paper,externalis aimed at ensuring trade co-operation, with no hard border for Northern Ireland, and global trade deals for the UK. It fleshes out the Chequers agreement that sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis. The UK is hoping the EU will back the proposals in the White Paper so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March. Labour MPs asked two further questions, one on the pausing of the hostile environment policy for those over 30 in the wake of the Windrush scandal; and the second on police staffing and funding levels during the visit of the US President, Donald Trump. The Commons returns at 2:30pm on Monday, with Home Office questions. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament Business Minister Andrew Griffiths says it is easy to ""underestimate"" how significant the collapse of Carillion was, including the impacts on the lives of ""too many"". It is important that ""everything"" the government does is to prevent this from happening again, he says. The business secretary has commissioned a review into the responsibilities of the Financial Reporting Council, he adds. He adds that ""thousands of documents are being considered"" in trying to trace what went wrong at Carillion. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow business minister Bill Esterson says the collapse of Carillion was ""a fiasco"" for the 30,000 employees and 20,000 sub-contractors, the 27,000 members of its defined pension scheme, 30,000 suppliers owed Â£2bn in unpaid invoices, the children who depended on school meals, armed services personnel whose housing is mismanaged and the taxpayer who is picking up the tab for the colossal failure of the government to safeguard large sums of public money. He says the ""cosy"" way in which the big four accountancy firms (Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, and KPMG) operate must come to and end and ask if the government supports calls for the big four to be broken up. He ends by saying that Labour in government would be a party of business for the many, not the few. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Chris Stephens says that the mystery of Carillion's collapse is not something to be surprised about, but instead the surprise was how long the company lasted for. He says the company exploited suppliers and ""gamed with public assets"" and sought to ""eliminate any competitors"". The US president questions whether the UK's current Brexit plan is ""what they voted for"". Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament Ms Reeves says the directors, who made the decisions which led to the company's collapse, still refuse to accept their responsibility and continue to deny the findings of her committee's report. She says they awarded themselves bonuses while workers have lost jobs and pensions. She says the auditors, including KPMG, also did not issue the appropriate warnings. She says auditors have the wrong incentives because they report to senior managers. She says that when management and the auditors were seen to be failing, the regulators should have stepped in. She says they were too ""passive"" and acted too late. She says the pension regulator eventually ""barked but did not bite."" She concludes that ""urgent action"" must be taken for those affected and for those who would be affected if the same were to happen again. ""Best value is not the same as lowest price,"" she says. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament MPs move on to a debate on the collapse of Carillion, introduced by the Chair of the Business Committee, Rachel Reeves. She says that this Sunday will be six months since Carillion collapsed, owing money to suppliers and subcontractors and with major projects ""mothballed"". Five committees have looked into its collapse, she says, with her committee considering the causes for its demise. ""Warning lights should have been flashing when such a big business was on the brink,"" she says. Forced adoption debate House of CommonsParliament Education Minister Nadhim Zahawi says that many adopted children have struggled with ""overwhelming"" feelings of rejection and with forming attachments. ""It is truly shocking to hear how single mothers were treated at that time in our country,"" he says, while adding that the church has apologised for their role in this. He says that there general principle that children are better looked after by their own family. He adds that these days forced separation takes place from a court order. Forced adoption debate House of CommonsParliament The shadow children and families minister, Emma Lewell-Buck, says that ""culturally, the 50s, 60s and 70s"" when the majority of these adoption orders were made, was a different time. Welfare benefits were not available and sex education was nonexistent, which affected people who had children out of wedlock, she says. She adds that many of the stories from the time show the ""powerlessness"" women experienced. The very least these women need ""is an apology,"" she says. Forced adoption debate House of CommonsParliament MPs are holding a debate on the practice of forced adoption - a backbench business debate proposed by Labour MPs Alison McGovern and Stephen Twigg. House of CommonsParliament German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabic and Prime Minister Theresa May during a reception at the end of the Western Balkans Summit The statement on the Brexit white paper concludes and MPs move on to a statement by a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee on global Britain and the Western Balkans. On 9 and 10 July 2018, the UK hosted the 5th annual Western Balkans Summit. Committee member, and Labour MP, Mike Gapes says,due to the resignation of the summit host - the then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson- the summit ""didn't get the attention it deserved"". He says this was the first time the UK had hosted the summit and was ""a test of the UK's commitment to European scrutiny"". Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Conservative Stephen Metcalfe says his constituents want reassurance the white paper will ""return control over our borders, over our money and our laws"". ""Don't listen to the siren voices,"" he urges, advising people to instead look at the document ""and see where it delivers"". Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Labour's Wes Streeting suggests that the government's white paper ""doesn't command the support of a majority of the House of Commons"". He asks how the EU, European Commission or European Parliament can take the proposals seriously ""because this house, it is clear, does not."" Dominic Raab accuses the MP of ""blithely skating over divisions in his own party"". He defends the government's plan as a ""positive, principled approach that is deliverable"". Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Conservative Andrew Bridgen says colleagues have ""grave concerns"" about this proposal, in terms of how it will play out the wishes of the British people during the referendum. He asks why Mr Raab's first choice of special advisor, Stewart Jackson, was rejected by the Cabinet Office. Mr Raab pays tribute to the work of special advisors and says he will be naming his shortly. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Conservative David Jones says that the role of the European Court of Justice is preserved as the interpreter of EU rules in the UK. He asks what kind of audience British applicants to the court could expect when no longer an EU country. Mr Raab says there is provision for ""consistent interpretation"" of the law under the ECJ. The UK would have a veto over decisions, he says, adding that the UK needs to have agreement over common rules. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Brexit-supporting Conservative Owen Paterson asks the Brexit secretary if the ""common rulebook"" will lead to EU policy being put back into UK law without the ability to amend it. Dominic Raab says the common rulebook will only apply to the extent that is necessary to avoid friction at the border. What's the common rulebook? Have a lookhere. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Labour's Kate Hoey says that it is ""nonsense"" that MPs got the white paper so late, and she asks if Angela Merkel has seen this document before MPs. She asks for assurances that European citizens will no longer receive special treatment in immigration after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Raab says that freedom of movement is something which discriminates the rest of the world against EU nationals in UK immigration. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Home Affairs Committee chair Yvette Cooper questions why there is a lack of detail on the government's post-Brexit immigration plan. Dominic Raab responds that the paper is very clear that free movement will end. Home Secreatry Sajid Javid told the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday that there will be a separate white paper on post-Brexit immigration in the autumn.

Eating spiders' webs and other pre-match rituals,"JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann's pre-match lucky ritual included a cup of espresso. Alan Shearer's slightly less sophisticated equivalent was a plate of chicken and beans What does the success of a sports team depend upon? You might be tempted to think it's skill, fitness and a sprinkling of good luck. According to many fans, however, you would be wrong. It all boils down to whether your mate's wife pops into the kitchen in the 31st minute of a match; not cutting your toenails; and smashing that all-important rendition of Three Lions in the shower. That is, the pre-match ritual. BBC pundits JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann, Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinandall had their specific routineswhen they were still playing the game. Klinsmann would have a cup of espresso made with the German team's own machine. Less sophisticatedly, Shearer would eat a plateful of chicken and beans. Rio Ferdinand's lucky pre-match routine involved Paul Scholes, who appears to be taking it rather seriously And Ferdinand had so many there is not time to mention them all - but they included having the same breakfast, pouring water over his head in the tunnel andplaying two-touch,externalwith Paul Scholes. Ferdinand has even continued with some of his rituals as a supporter rather than player - a pre-match coffee is now an essential element. But he's not the only one doing his bit for England. A tasty - and lucky - snack for Susan Green Susan Green from Letchworth in Hertfordshire has joined her partner in hirsute heroics. ""My partner doesn't shave his head for the whole of the tournament and I have not shaved my legs since last Tuesday, and will not do so until the final. I am beginning to look a bit like a female woolly mammoth. ""Also, if I use particular adjectives, I have to say them at least twice in a sentence in different order. So, if I say shiny and sparkly I have to say 'shiny sparkly, sparkly shiny'. And I ate a spider's web yesterday... just in case."" Not creepy at all Matt Southworth from Warrington is keeping England's hopes alive by wearing a new Gareth Southgate mask for each knock-out game and destroying it afterwards. ""I've got two ready for the semi and the final after I wore one for both knockout rounds. Both masks were destroyed in the following celebrations for each match so I have decided having one and destroying it is crucial for World Cup glory. ""I have also had the same St George flag wrapped around my neck during every game - the only times I hadn't were the Belgium game and Colombia before penalties. I made my mate give it to me for the shootout. ""I will also not be cleaning my England top despite the stale beer smell of it now, as the only game I wore it clean for was the Belgium game. The flag has also not been cleaned and is also in a similarly rancid state."" Stephen from Wakefield (and his liver) are supporting the team by having a tactical beer with every game. ""My wife realised that the first letter of each beer matched the first letter of the opponent in the next round - but in their own language. So against Colombia the beer began with 'S' for Sverige. And against Sweden it began with 'H' for Hrvatska. Tomorrow I'll only drink a beer beginning with 'F'. ""When we make the final I'll find a 'W' beer for World Champions."" Good news for Worthingtons, Wadworth and Waggle Dance. A still life arrangement by Paul Ashley, showcasing his 1966 replica shirt, beard shampoo and the dog's bandana Paul Ashley from Doncaster has carried out the same detailed routine before every game. ""I have a morning shower (as opposed to my usual night-time clean) with a hair shampoo and a separate beard shampoo. ""I spend a large chunk of the day pacing the house. About 15 minutes before kick off I don my replica '66 shirt with 10 on the back, then about five minutes before kick-off I put an England flag bandana on my dog. ""It's worked so far, apart from Belgium, but I think I may have forgot to shampoo the beard that day."" Steve Hance's unwashed shorts are considered - by him - to be lucky Steve Hance from Buckhurst Hill in Essex is taking no risks and is cooking the same barbecue menu as for every single other England game. He says his family is getting a bit bored having to eat the same food every three days. Mr Hance adds: ""I'm wearing the same shirt (washed because that's lucky), same shorts (not washed, because that's lucky). ""I also ring my mate Tom at work from at least 20 different numbers in the building (so that he answers) and then whisper ""it's coming home"" and then hang up. Every single day. ""I'm certain that this keeps us in the running."" Jeremy Chapman risks overheating for the cause Jeremy Chapman, from Tring in Hertfordshire, donned his lucky suit - previously worn at his wedding - on Saturday as a tribute to the smartly-dressed England manager Gareth Southgate. Mr Chapman's wife Meredith Hepner says the ensemble is hanging up and ready in preparation for Wednesday's clash with Croatia. But it's not all the superstitious fan does. He also paints his toenails in patriotic colours (and for all we know, beneath his shiny, sensible lace-ups Southgate does the same) and the ""slides and painted toes are now part of the England luck ritual"". World Cup 2018: What are England fans singing? How Southgate helped us fall in love again Fans in ecstasy as England reach semis Meanwhile, in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, it's all in the seating arrangements. Simon Pinnell and his mates know the only way to keep England in the tournament is by sitting in the same places on his friend Mark's sofa for every single game. Simon Pinnell and friends have sacrificed watching in the pub to sit in the same ""lucky"" seats ""Despite invitations from a number of people to gather at theirs or suggestions to go to the pub, having watched all the other games at Mark's and got the result we wanted - including losing to Belgium - we are not going to risk anything other than watching it in the same room, sitting in the same positions,"" says Simon. Mark's wife Kate could find herself watching the game solo after having the audacity to leave the room during England's match against Sweden. ""During the match, she [went] to get a drink when Harry Maguire scored. We were tempted to banish her to the kitchen for the rest of the game,"" Simon added. âThe real fear, however, is if Joe Solo from Scarborough fails to purchase the same cut-price dinner he enjoyed on Saturday. Here is his confession and apology to the England team, just in case. Joe Solo's bread and cheese failure could break English hearts ""From the quarter-final onwards I obviously had to switch up a gear and pile the pressure on the opposition, not just with my lucky shorts and my T-shirt on backwards (to obviously blindside their full-backs), or my slippers on the wrong feet (to stop their forwards shooting straight), but with the pre-match meal. ""And this is where I have made a fatal error. ""Prior to the Sweden game I made the mistake of buying my dinner from the 'reduced' counter. It was proper nice - a stale tomato bread and a slightly overripe cheddar with chilli and lime, and obviously, with the 2-0 win it did the trick. ""Problem is, I have been back to the same reduced counter three times now and haven't seen the same food available. ""This is a potential crisis for the Croatia game and I would urge you not to be put off by it, and to give the game your all, regardless. For my part I will wait by the counter as late as I can before kick-off just in case we get lucky. ""Oh, and one last thing. If you do happen to lose, please don't tell anyone it was because of me. Everyone here is so excited about #ItsComingHome and I wouldn't want news of my bread/cheese failure to be made public if at all possible."" What are your special pre-match rituals?

Six male hosts agree pay cut,"Left-right: Nicky Campbell, Huw Edwards, Jon Sopel, Jeremy Vine, Nick Robinson and John Humphrys Six of the BBC's leading male presenters have agreed to take pay cuts after revelations over equal salaries. The BBC said Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine had all accepted reduced wages. The move follows Carrie Gracie'sresignation as BBC China editorin protest at unequal pay between male and female international editors. Humphrys said he would be earning ""hugely less"" than the Â£600,000 he was. The move comes after the BBCrevealed the pay of on-air talent earning over Â£150,000in July. Two-thirds of stars on the list, including the top seven earners, were men. This video can not be played John Humphrys says pay cut is 'fair' Humphrys, the presenter on Radio 4's flagship Today programme and Mastermind, was revealed to have earned between Â£600,000 and Â£649,999 in 2016/17. He refused to confirm or deny reports that his pay packet had been halved, to Â£250,000-Â£300,000, but did say his new salary would be ""a lot less than Â£600,000"". He said he had, in fact, taken a total of three pay cuts. ""It seemed fair,"" he told BBC News. ""The BBC used to have, in the good old days, an awful lot of money. ""It no longer has an awful lot of money. I was earning a lot of money and it seemed entirely proper to me that I should take a few pay cuts."" Of the six men, Radio 2 and Eggheads presenter Jeremy Vine was the best-paid of the group, earning between Â£700,000-Â£749,999 in 2016/17. Jon Sopel, the BBC's North America editor, earned the least, in the Â£200,000-Â£249,999 bracket - compared to Carrie Gracie's Â£135,000-a-year salary. The BBC did not comment how much the presenters would now receive. A BBC statement said: ""We are very grateful to Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine, who have agreed that their pay will now be reduced. ""These are great journalists and presenters, who have a real connection with the audience. We are proud to have them working at the BBC. ""The final details of some of these changes are still being discussed, and there are further conversations that the BBC will have with others in due course."" Carrie Gracie published an open letter giving her reasons for resigning as China editor On his way into work at Radio 2 on Friday, Vine was asked by reporters why he had agreed to a lower wage. ""I think it needs to be sorted out and I support my female colleagues who have rightly said they should be paid the same when they're doing the same job,"" he said. ""It's just a no-brainer, so it wasn't a problem for me to accept one [a pay cut]."" An independent audit into equal pay at the BBC will be published next week. When the list of the best-paid BBC presenters that was published last summer, Chris Evans was at the top, earning between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m in 2016/2017. The highest-paid woman, Claudia Winkleman, earned significantly less - between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said while competition in the entertainment industry had intensified, the opposite had happened in news. ""Many of those now taking pay cuts secured generous deals years ago,"" he said. ""That world has disappeared - and these presenters now accept that a chunk of their salaries will have to disappear with it."" This video can not be played Jeremy Vine: Taking a pay cut is 'a no-brainer' After leaving her post as China editor, Gracie is now returning to the BBC newsroom in London, saying she expects to be ""paid equally"". She is due to appear before a select committee of MPs on Wednesday next week, shortly before director general of the BBC Tony Hall, his deputy Anne Bulford and director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth. They were called to discuss what action the corporation is taking to address the gender pay gap. Damian Collins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: ""While it is admirable that these BBC presenters want to show solidarity for their female colleagues by taking a pay cut, it doesn't address the fundamental issues of pay inequality that Carrie Gracie and others have raised."" He added that they would hear from Gracie and senior BBC figures at the committee session. There have been three investigations into gender pay at the BBC: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. Itfound the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%,external, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff published at the same time found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is due to be published next week Lord Hall pledged to close the gap by 2020, saying the corporation should be ""an exemplar of what can be achieved when it comes to pay, fairness, gender and representation"".

Baron Cohen 'dupes' Palin for new series,"Former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin says Sacha Baron Cohen ""duped"" her in an interview by posing as a wounded military veteran. The Borat star has been secretly filming for a new satirical comedy series that will air on TV next week. It was revealed on Monday the show - titled Who is America? - would explore ""diverse individuals"" in the US ""across the political and cultural spectrum"". Palin wrote on Facebook: ""Yup - we were duped. Ya' got me, Sacha. Feel better?"" She went on: ""I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick 'humour' of the British 'comedian' Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime."" Baron Cohen series to air on Channel 4 Baron Cohen is best known for hoaxing interviewees as comedy characters Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev and fashion reporter Bruno, all of whom inspired big-screen films. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, said she received a request to contribute to a ""legit historical documentary"" and travelled across the US with one of her daughters. She wrote: ""Baron Cohen (I presume) had heavily disguised himself as a disabled US Veteran, fake wheelchair and all. ""Out of respect for what I was led to believe would be a thoughtful discussion with someone who had served in uniform, I sat through a long 'interview' full of Hollywoodism's disrespect and sarcasm - but finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out, much to Cohen's chagrin. ""The disrespect of our US military and middle-class Americans via Cohen's foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions was perverse."" Palin, who asked for the proceeds from the programme to be donated to charity, added: ""Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country. Truly sick."" Last week, the comedian teased his comeback witha preview clip,externalshowing former US vice president Dick Cheney apparently agreeing to autograph a ""waterboard kit"" - in reality a plastic water jug. Who is America? will premiere on Showtime in the US on Sunday and the network has promised it will show the comedian and actor ""as you've never seen him before"". The series will begin in the UK on Monday on Channel 4 at 22:00 BST. Years before US presidentDonald Trumpentered the world of politics, he was interviewed by Ali G, Baron Cohen's Staines rapper. The famous interview saw his character try to pitch a business idea involving an ""ice cream glove"" to the entrepreneur. As part of a sketch for Channel 4's 11 O'Clock Show in 1998, Ali G got Conservative politicianRhodes Boysonto say that children should be ""caned"" at school, Baron Cohen was criticised for playing on Boyson's weakness as the politician had previously appeared on Have I Got News For You, apparently without realising it was a satirical comedy show. In an interview with former Conservative politicianNeil Hamiltonin 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton some ""cannabis"", which he accepted and smoked, creating minor controversy in the British media. In 2004, an episode of Da Ali G Show saw Borat interview Republican candidate for US Congress,James Broadwater. Borat's questions led Broadwater to say Jews would go to hell if they did not follow Christianity, which upset some Jewish communities. In the 2009 film of the same name, his character Bruno interviewed Republican presidential candidateRon Pauland in the scene tried and failed to seduce the Texas congressman into making a sex tape with Bruno, a gay Austrian TV host.

Why millions of football fans see the World Cup like this,"A colour-blind simulation created by Colour Blind Awareness Sean Hargrave is a self-declared football obsessive, but when he sat down to watch the opening match of the 2018 World Cup he couldn't tell one team from the other. He wasn't the only one struggling. Roars of frustration jumped from sitting rooms to social media as fans worldwide branded Russia v Saudi Arabia ""a disgrace"". The problem? Sean, like 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women, is colour-blind. Specifically, he struggles to tell red and green apart - the most common form of the condition. So if one team plays in red kit (Russia) and one in green (Saudi), it's game over. Or as he puts it, ""it's like Madonna coming out on stage and saying, 'I'm singing the songs in Swahili tonight!'"" Colour-blindness varies in type and severity, but to someone with severe red-green issues, watching Russia demolish Saudi Arabia might have looked a bit like this: Simulation by Colour Blind Awareness Instead of like this: A massive 320 million people worldwide are colour-blind. Statistically, the condition affects one player in every men's football team. And with almost half the planet projected to watch the World Cup, many are furious that its organiser Fifa has failed to take account of what they can and can't see. Allow Facebook content?

The most obvious liability for colour-blind people is not being able to tell football strips apart, especially in a fast-moving game.

And the same happened with England v Sweden, where they couldn't tell England goalie Jordan Pickford's lime green kit apart from Sweden's sunshine shade. Allow Twitter content?

Courage, agility, steeliness: How Pickford became England's number one Katy Moran, 27, who is colour-blind and plays for Aston Villa Ladies, told the BBC she sometimes has to stare at the players' socks to work out who's who - including when she's on the pitch herself. ""We played Millwall last season. Villa wear a claret colour and Millwall had... it must have been dark blue. They walked onto the pitch, I looked and thought - good job I'm not playing! And both teams had white shorts on as well."" Inevitably, it damages her game. ""You're concentrating on trying to work out who's who. If I was playing [Millwall] my reactions would be so much slower, because I can't work out quick enough if it's my player who's about to get the ball, or if I should step in. ""There have been times when we've played with red cones and I've moved out of the area because I couldn't see where they were. I was running off and they're like, 'Where are you going?!'"" Katy Moran of Aston Villa Ladies says she struggles to watch around 1 in 5 football matches on TV, due to her colour-blindness These are problems that reach football's highest levels - including players taking part in the World Cup. Just eight minutes before meeting the Danish international team to fly to Russia,midfielder Thomas Delaney phoned a Danish radio station to support a colour-blind caller who said he'd had trouble telling Denmark and Mexico apart in a pre-World Cup friendly,external. Giving his name only as ""Thomas"", Delaney told the station DR P3: ""I'm red-green [colour-blind]. I wouldn't say it's too bad, but it does happen. The other day on the field it was a bit difficult, seeing who was on my team and who was on the other."" ""And do you play for a red or a green team?"" the hosts enquired. ""I play for the red team,"" he said. ""What team do you play for, Thomas?"" ""The Danish national team."" Thomas Delaney (front row, first from right) pictured with the Denmark starting XI in their white away kit, ahead of their game against Australia Delaney's frank admission saw both Denmark and Australia don their away kits when they met for a 1-1 draw in Group C. According to the Totally Football Show podcast, Australia's dark green was easier for the player to distinguish from white than their usual yellow. Kathyrn Albany-Ward, founder of advocacy group Colour Blind Awareness, says the Dane's honesty was a threshold moment. ""He is the first ever player at elite level, still playing, that we know of who has spoken out about being colour-blind. I don't think he realises the implications of what he's done,"" she says. ""Most people don't speak out because they're frightened that it's going to affect their value; whether they get played or if they're put on the bench, and all that kind of thing. It shouldn't, but that's what they'll be frightened of."" Thomas Delaney of Denmark and Borussia Dortmund told the radio station DR P3 he wanted their previous colour-blind caller to know he wasn't alone The nervousness is understandable, given the tendency of opposing fans to leap on any perceived weakness. ""That was never a red card, ref must be colour-blind!"" is standard chat at grounds. Adrian Smith, 60, is a British amateur referee who qualified in 1978 - and describes himself as ""manageably"" red-green colour-blind. He referees in his local youth league in Gloucester, and reckons pitfalls can often be avoided with a bit of pre-match planning. Organised competitions usually have a handbook which lists the colours teams are registered to play in, he says. And if they wear something different on the day? ""Then you can ask the team captain before you toss the coin at the start of the game, 'That's a nice kit - what shade would you describe that as?' That's a strategy that works for me."" Social media has given colour-blind football fans a platform to share their experiences, both with each other and the world at large. It's underscored how much still needs to change - and activists are working hard to make the game more accessible before the next major contest. Colour Blind Awareness has spent the last nine months auditing the stadia that will be used for the 2020 Uefa European Football Championship, and flagging up less noticeable colour-blindness issues. Signage, for example: Exit signs, safety warnings and directions can effectively be invisible to some if they're mounted on the wrong colour background. The woman who sees 'invisible' colours The island of colour blindness Colour-blind aid for Warcraft game Last year, the group also worked with the English Football Association (FA) and Uefa to produce guidance notes on colour-blindness,external, and how to improve all areas of football for people with the condition. According to the FA, it is the only Uefa member to do so. Ms Albany-Ward says the FA wants to protect younger players, ""to make sure they aren't being discriminated against if they aren't performing as well as they could"". Some British Premiership clubs are becoming more accessible too. Tottenham Hotspur designed its website and season-ticket pricing plan to be less confusing for colour-blind fans, who frequently despair over online ticketing systems that use colour-coding to show where seats are, or which are available. Colour-blind fans have an extra reason to cheer premiership team Tottenham Hotspur With early signs of progress on the horizon, is there hope that the next World Cup, in 2022, might finally be colour-blind-friendly? ""I know Fifa are aware of it on some level,"" says Ms Albany-Ward. ""I don't know how high up.But they should be aware of the Uefa guidance,external. ""They have been looking at other visual impairments - they've been doing special commentary for blind people, and a lot for hearing-impaired people. So colour-blind people are next on the list, I would hope! ""Colour-blindness affects far more than the people in the stadium. It's millions of people worldwide - and they've missed a trick really. They could have avoided the adverse publicity that they've had if they'd just been a bit braver, and thought about it a bit sooner."" Why are people colour-blind? Colour-blindness is usually inherited, and is believed to be passed down the maternal line. However, some people get it through a health condition, including diabetes or multiple sclerosis - or as a side-effect from certain medications. What causes it? Humans see colour through nerve cells in our eyes, called cones. There are three separate kinds, which absorb red, green and blue light. A fully functioning set will allow you to see the full colour spectrum. But in someone colour-blind, one type of cone cell is faulty, or (in severe cases) does not exist at all. If it's the red cone, the person will struggle to see colours that contain red clearly. So they might confuse a blue and a purple because they can't ""see"" the red component of purple, for example. Simple tests are available to establish whether someone has abnormal colour vision There is no cure for inherited colour blindness, but the acquired kind can sometimes be reversed. Many people who are mildly colour-blind don't realise that they are, because they were born with the condition and don't realise others are seeing a fuller range of colours. What should you do if you think you might be colour-blind? Visit a local optician, and ask for a colour vision test. You might also find it helpful to speak to your GP. There are initial tests you can take online,external- though these shouldn't replace a proper diagnosis.

Trump says Germany 'controlled by Russia',"This video can not be played In 2018, Donald Trump told Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg that Germany is ""totally controlled by Russia"" US President Donald Trump has clashed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over Russian influence and defence spending, ahead of a Nato summit. Mr Trump said Germany was ""totally controlled by Russia"" because of the high level of natural gas it imported, and this was a ""bad thing for Nato"". Mrs Merkel hit back, comparing German independence now with the time when she grew up in the former East Germany. She also defended her country's contribution to the Western alliance. The last summit both leaders attended ended in acrimony in a row over trade. Mr Trump later made more conciliatory remarks after he and Mrs Merkel had met on the sidelines of the summit in Brussels on Wednesday. The summit comes less than a week beforeMr Trump is due to hold his first summit with Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, reviving concerns among US allies over his proximity to the Russian president. Reality Check: How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? Can Nato survive Donald Trump? What does the US contribute to Nato? President Trump shocked some by quipping that the Nato summit might prove harder than next Monday's summit with Mr Putin. He has said the US is being ""taken advantage of"" by other members of the Nato alliance, which was set up in 1949 to counter the Soviet Union, of which Russia is the main successor state. European Council President Donald Tusk accused him of criticising Europe ""almost daily"", tweeting: ""Dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don't have that many."" Germany has the EU's biggest economy and has long been accused by US administrations of failing to contribute its fair share to Nato operations but Mr Trump's comments were particularly stinging. At a breakfast meeting in Brussels with Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, the US leader said: ""Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they will be getting from 60% to 70% of their energy from Russia, and a new pipeline, and you tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not and I think it's a very bad thing for Nato."" EU figures suggestRussia is responsible for between 50% and 75% of Germany's gas imports,external, butgas makes up less than 20% of Germany's energy mix for power production. Germany has given political support for a new Baltic Sea pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which will increase the flow of Russian gas to EU states. The project has been sharply criticised by Poland and others. The US president also accused Germany of only spending ""a little bit over 1%"" of its economic output on defence compared to the 4.2% spent by the US ""in actual numbers"". Germany spends 1.24% of GDP on defence and the US 3.5%,external, according to the latest Nato estimate. ""I want to say that I have experience of when a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union,"" she told reporters. ""I am very happy that today we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions. ""That is very good, especially for people in eastern Germany."" Mrs Merkel (centre) led efforts to negotiate with Mr Trump over trade at last month's G7 summit in Canada What's happening in this G7 picture? US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU She added that Germany had put a huge proportion of its troops at Nato's disposal. ""We are still very heavily involved in Afghanistan and thus we also defend the interests of the United States of America... and Germany was pleased to do it and did it out of conviction,"" she said. At the G7 summit in Canada last month, the German chancellor led efforts to reach agreement with Mr Trump on trade butthe American leader rejected the G7 summit joint communique after he left. Mr Stoltenberg sought to play down Mr Trump's accusations, saying he expected Nato leaders would agree they were ""stronger together than apart"". He also tried to separate arguments about trade - not a primary Nato concern - from discussions about military matters. ""There are disagreements on trade. This is serious. My task is to try to minimise the negative impact on Nato,"" Mr Stoltenberg told a forum on the sidelines of the summit. Mr Trump told reporters that military spending and a planned gas pipeline from Russia to Germany had been discussed. ""We have a very, very good relationship with the chancellor. We have a tremendous relationship with Germany,"" he said. Mrs Merkel said she had discussed migration and trade with Mr Trump, and that she looked forward to further discussions as the US and Germany remained partners. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent In describing Germany as being ""totally controlled by Russia"" and linking this to what the US sees as Berlin's unsatisfactory defence budget, President Trump is underscoring two longstanding US concerns. US leaders have long warned of what they see as Europe's uncomfortable dependence upon Russian energy supplies. And they have also been arguing for more than a decade that the Europeans should spend more on defence. Mr Trump has given these twin themes a new and more abrasive tone. While he may well be overstating Germany's dependence upon Russian energy, even many European leaders are well aware of the potential influence that this could give Moscow. It's an area where short-term economic and longer-term security considerations are at variance. No wonder then that when the US sanctions Russia for its behaviour in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea it included steps to hamper anyone who helped build or support new Russian pipelines westwards. German troops in Lithuania this summer Mr Trump's main objection is that all but a handful of member states have still not increased their defence budgets to meet a goal of spending at least 2% of their annual economic output on defence by 2024.

Of Nato's 29 members, just five meet that target this year: the US, Greece, Estonia, the UK and Latvia. However, several, such as Poland and France, are close to the mark. Some in Nato fear Mr Trump's repeated blunt demands could harm morale, furthering the agenda of President Putin, whom they accuse of seeking to destabilise the West.

Facebook faces maximum fine for data misuse,"This video can not be played Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham says Facebook's fines will damage its reputation The UK's data protection watchdog intends to fine Facebook Â£500,000 for data breaches - the maximum allowed. The Information Commissioner's Office said Facebook had failed to ensure another company - Cambridge Analytica - had deleted users' data. The ICO will also bring a criminal action,externalagainst Cambridge Analytica's defunct parent company SCL Elections. And it has raised concerns about political parties buying personal information from ""data brokers"". Specifically it named one company used by the Labour Party, Emma's Diary, which gives medical advice and free baby-themed products to parents. Facebook said it would respond to the report ""soon"". The ICO also said another company - Aggregate IQ - which worked with the Vote Leave campaign in the run up to the EU Referendum, must stop processing UK citizens' data. The fine is modest compared with previous sanctions on Facebook. Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal Facebook reveals its data-sharing VIPs Cambridge Analytica boss spars with MPs In 2017 it was fined110m euros (Â£95m) by the European Commission, which in the same yearpunished Google for 2.42bn euros(Â£2.1bn). But information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said companies also worried about reputational damage. The impact of behavioural advertising, when it came to elections, was ""significant"" and called for a code of practice to ""fix the system"", she said. Such a code would ensure that ""elections are fair and people understand how they are being micro-targeted"". The action comes 16 months after the ICO began its probe into political campaigners' use of personal data followingconcerns raised by whistleblower Christopher Wylie, among others. The ICO found Facebook had breached its own rules and failed to make sure Cambridge Analytica had deleted this personal data. While Cambridge Analytica insisted it hadindeed wiped the data after Facebook's erasure request in December 2015,external, the ICO said it had seen evidence that copies of the data had been shared with others. ""This potentially brings into question the accuracy of the deletion certificates provided to Facebook,"" said an ICO spokesperson. The ICO has also written to the UK's 11 main political parties telling them to have their data protection practices inspected. It is concerned the parties may have bought lifestyle information about members of the public from data brokers, who might have not have obtained the necessary consent. Naming Emma's Diary, the ICO said it was concerned about how transparent the firm had been about its political activities. Emma's Diary requires users to download an app to get a free bundle of baby-themed goods It said that the Labour Party had confirmed using the firm, but did not provide other details except that it intended to take some form of regulatory action. The service's owner Lifecycle Marketing told the BBC it did not agree with the ICO's initial findings. ""For over 25 years we have operated with integrity and within the spirit of data regulation,"" said a spokeswoman. ""As the ICO investigation continues we will freely cooperate... and cannot comment further at this stage."" Looking wider, the ICO noted Facebook had been the biggest recipient of digital advertising by political parties and campaigns to date. Yet, it said, the US firm had neither done enough to explain to its members how they were being targeted as a consequence, nor given them enough control over how their sensitive personal data was used. As a result, it said, Facebook was guilty of a second breach of the Data Protection Act. Facebook has a chance to respond to the Commissioner's Notice of Intent, after which a final decision will be made. The tech firm's chief privacy officer issued a brief response. ""As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,"" said Erin Egan. ""We have been working closely with the ICO in their investigation of Cambridge Analytica, just as we have with authorities in the US and other countries. We're reviewing the report and will respond to the ICO soon."" Cambridge Analytica, which claimed it could swing elections, and its parent SCL Elections, shut down in May. But the ICO said it was still taking legal steps to bring a criminal prosecution. The basis for this would be that SCL Elections had failed to properly respond to anearlier demand that it give a US academic a copy of any personal informationit held on him along with an explanation as to its source and usage. In March, Cambridge Analytica offices were searched by ICO officers Bearing in mind SCL Elections is now out of business, the ICO said it might consider taking action against the company's directors. The ICO said it had established that the Canadian data analytics firm AggregateIQ - AIQ - had access to UK voters' personal data provided by the Brexit referendum's Vote Leave campaign. It said it was now investigating whether this information had been transferred and accessed outside the UK and whether this amounted to a breach of the data protection act. The watchdog added that it continued to investigate to what degree AIQ and SCL Elections had shared UK personal data. And it said it had served an enforcement notice forbidding AIQ from continuing to make use of a list of UK citizens' email addresses and names that it still holds. Other action includes: an investigation into allegations that Arron Banks' Eldon Insurance Services illegally shared customer data with the Leave.EU group he co-founded, and used the business' call centre staff to make calls on behalf of the campaign - claims the firm has previously denied a probe into the collection and sharing of personal data by the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger In Europe  - and a linked data broker an audit of the University of Cambridge's Psychometrics Centre. The department carries out its own research into social media profiles. The ICO said it had been told of an alleged security breach involving one of the centre's apps and had additional concerns about its data protection efforts a call for the government to introduce a code of practice limiting how personal information can be used by political campaigns before the next general election efforts to ensure ex-staff from SCL Elections and Cambridge Analytica do not illegally use materials obtained from the business before its collapse The ICO said it expects the next stage of its investigation to be complete by the end of October.

Woman admits killing dad and burying body,"Barbara Coombes killed her father and then lied to her family and the authorities for years A woman beat her ""violent bully"" father to death with a shovel and buried his body in her garden after finding his hoard of child abuse images. The remains of Kenneth Coombes were found in Reddish in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in January. Barbara Coombes, 63, of Matlock Road in Reddish, pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility at Manchester Crown Court. She was jailed for nine years by Mr Justice Timothy King. The court heard Coombes had killed her father in 2006, concealing his body until she walked into a local police station on 7 January and told officers: ""I murdered my father 12 years ago."" She had earlier found a box of photographs belonging to the 87-year-old, which contained indecent images of children. Police forensic tents could be seen outside the home in January The patch of garden where Kenneth Coombes' remains were discovered The mother-of-one, who had suffered 40 years of physical and verbal torment from her ""formidable"" ex-military father, then ""snapped"", the court heard. Coombes had been in the garden digging at the time. Feeling ""utterly disgusted and mortified"" she walked into the living room of the family home and hit him over the back of the head with the shovel. When he turned around she then struck him a second time, slashing his throat with the blade edge of the tool. As he bled to death, she wrapped her father in carpet and put him in the garden before ordering a ton of soil and burying him the next day. The court heard how Coombes had suffered ""a lifetime"" of extreme physical and verbal abuse from Mr Coombes, who was described as a violent bully, the court heard. Police and forensic officers pictured at the scene of the discovery in January Psychiatric reports found the she had post-traumatic stress disorder and a severe depressive illness. Michelle Colborne QC said although the story of abuse Coombes had suffered came from herself, there was evidence to show her account was not ""contrived"". Coombes also continued claiming her father's pension and benefits on his behalf, receiving Â£189,125 over the following 12 years. At an earlier hearing, she admitted preventing the lawful burial of Mr Coombes and two fraud charges. Police pictured on the street in Reddish where Barbara Coombes lived The court heard that although she successfully lied to her father's GP, hospital doctors and benefits advisers for more than a decade, ""the net began to tighten"" in autumn 2017. A local housing association officer, Lynn Williams, visited the family home to arrange a ""winter welfare"" visit for Mr Coombes, who by then would have been 99. Coombes tried to rebuff the visits and suspicions were raised. It prompted Coombes to walk into a police station in Cheadle Heath and confess to officers.

Chris Evans tops 2017 best-paid BBC stars list,"Evans and Winkleman are the BBC's highest paid male and female stars Chris Evans has topped the list of the BBC's best-paid stars. He made between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m in 2016/2017, while Claudia Winkleman was the highest-paid female celebrity, earning between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000. About two-thirds of stars earning more than Â£150,000 are male, compared to one-third female, according to theBBC annual report,external. Director general Tony Hall said there was ""more to do"" on gender and diversity. BBC pay: Who earns what? What will the industry make of star pay? Stars on their pay Reality Check: The gender pay gap It is the first time the pay of stars earning more than Â£150,000 has been made public. The BBC has been compelled to reveal the information, including the pay of 96 of its top stars, under the terms of its new Royal Charter. The total bill for the 96 personalities was Â£28.7m; but the figures in the report reveal large disparities betweenwhat men and women are paid,external. Overall, 25 men on the talent list receive more than Â£250,000, compared to just nine women. Speaking on LBC Radio, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We've seen the way the BBC is paying women less for doing the same job... I want women to be paid equally."" When asked if Chris Evans was worth 12 of her, Mrs May - who earns about Â£150,000 - said: ""What's important is that the BBC looks at the question of paying men and women the same for doing the same job."" ""On gender and diversity, the BBC is more diverse than the broadcasting industry and the civil service,"" Lord Hall said. ""We've made progress, but we recognise there is more to do and we are pushing further and faster than any other broadcaster."" When asked if female talent working at the BBC would now be asking for pay rises, Lord Hall said: ""We will be working carefully on our relationship with our talent."" Woman's Hour'sJane Garvey tweeted,external: ""I'm looking forward to presenting @BBCWomansHour today. We'll be discussing #GenderPayGap . As we've done since 1946. Going well, isn't it?"" Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, who did not appear on the list,retweeted Garvey's message,external. There is also a gap between the pay for white stars and those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background. George Alagiah, Jason Mohammad and Trevor Nelson are the highest paid BAME presenters, each receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. The highest-paid female star with a BAME background is BBC news presenter Mishal Husain, who earned between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000. The annual report contains pay information in bands and does not reveal exact amounts. Nor does it include stars who receive their pay through BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm. The figures quoted only refer to the amount of licence fee money each person receives and do not include their earnings from other broadcasters or commercial activities. They also exclude stars paid through independent production companies. That means some big name stars - such as David Attenborough, Benedict Cumberbatch and Matt LeBlanc - do not appear on the list. The list also does not distinguish between people who are paid for doing multiple jobs within the BBC and those who are just paid for one. Two of the judges on Strictly are in a higher pay bracket than the others - but they also work for other BBC shows Strictly Come Dancing head judge Len Goodman - who has now left the show - and fellow judge Bruno Tonioli were both in the Â£200,000-Â£250,000 band. The show's other judges, Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell, got between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000. Tess Daly, Winkleman's Strictly Come Dancing co-host, was paid between Â£350,000 and Â£400,000. Graham Norton earned more than Â£850,000 but this does not include payments to his production company, which makes The Graham Norton Show and pays him a separate salary. The BBC is alone amongst the UK's major broadcasters in releasing pay details for its on-air and on-screen talent. Talent pay is considerably higher in the commercial sector. As he left the BBC after his Radio 2 breakfast show on Wednesday, Chris Evans said it was right ""on balance"" that star salaries were being disclosed. ""We are the ultimate public company I think, and therefore it's probably right and proper people know what we get paid,"" he told reporters. During a briefing on the annual report on Wednesday morning, Lord Hall said: ""Chris Evans is presenting the most popular show on the most popular radio network in Europe. ""The BBC does not exist in a market on its own where it can set the market rates. ""If we are to give the public what they want, then we have to pay for those great presenters and stars."" Aside from Strictly, Winkleman's other BBC roles include presenting The Great British Sewing Bee and her Radio 2 Sunday night show. Her agent said she would be making no comment. If you ask experienced people in the world of broadcasting what they think of these salary disclosures, three clear and consistent points are apparent. First, the BBC pays below - and sometimes much below - market rates, both at management level and in terms of top broadcasting talent. Second, this move will prove inflationary. Those on the list will think to themselves: ""Why is that inferior presenter getting paid more than me?"" - and will demand a pay rise. Third, if you thought it was tin hat time for the talent, pity the poor agents they work with. Read more from Amol here. Casualty star Derek Thompson was the BBC's highest paid actor, receiving between Â£350,000 and Â£400,000 over the last financial year. Amanda Mealing, who also stars in Casualty as well as Holby City, was the highest paid actress, receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. Peter Capaldi, the outgoing star of Doctor Who, was paid between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000. Clare Balding earned between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 for her work on sports shows including Wimbledon Today and the Rio Olympics. Casualty stars Derek Thompson and Amanda Mealing are the BBC's best-paid actors The overall spend on talent was Â£193.5m - down on the Â£200m spent in 2015/2016. The figures also showed a decrease - from 109 to 96 - in the number of stars paid more than Â£150,000. The total spend on stars with salaries of more than Â£150,000 was also down Â£5 million on the Â£31.9 million paid in the previous financial year. This video can not be played Ex-BBC chairman Lord Grade describes the corporation's disclosure of talent pay as ""disturbing"" Speaking on the Today programme, Lord Grade - a former BBC One controller - called the government's insistence that talent pay be disclosed ""distasteful and disturbing"". ""The net result of this is inflation,"" he said. ""Talent salaries and wages will round upwards, they won't go down."" Former culture secretary John Whittingdale MP said: ""If somebody is earning the equivalent of 1,000 households' licence fees put togetherâ¦ the licence fee payer deserves to know.""

"Cave rescue 'hope became reality'Thai Navy Seal chief said rescuers were driven by a ""tiny bit of hope"" the boys were still alive.Asia","This video can not be played Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yuukongkaew, head of the Thai navy seals: ""There was only a tiny bit of hope"" The head of the Thai Navy Seals has said ""hope became reality"" with the successful rescue of 12 boys and their coach from the Tham Luang cave. ""We had a little bit of hope that they might still be alive but we had to do it, we just had to move forward,"" Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew told the BBC. ""There was only a tiny bit of hope, but that's all we had to work with."" The group was trapped in the cave by rising water andrescued in a dramatic operation that captivated the world. The complex, three-day rescue saw four boys emerge on Sunday, four on Monday, and the final four boys plus their coach on Tuesday. They survived the nine days before they were found by drinking water dripping from the cave walls, officials said. The doctor who stayed with the boys Heroes who saved the Wild Boars Football teams offer support to rescued boys All 13 are now in hospital in Chiang Rai city and receiving medical and psychological assistance, but recovering well. A picture released by the Seal team shows a person being stretchered out of the cave There were conflicting reports following the rescue about the extent to which the boys had been medicated before they were brought out. The Thai prime minister on Tuesday denied reports that they had been sedated, saying the boys were given only light anti-anxiety medication commonly provided to soldiers. But sources in the rescue operation told the BBC that the boys were heavily sedated and only partially conscious, and had to be carried throughout the journey out of the cave. All of the boys lost weight during their ordeal and will remain in hospital for a week, followed by a week's recuperation for another week at home. Public health ministry officials said the first group were all eating normal food and the second group would be put on normal food as of Wednesday. The third group evacuated on Tuesday are undergoing the same medical check-ups as the first two groups but appeared to also be in good health. There are no cases of serious infections. The first four boys have already been visited by their families, officials said, and the second group will also be allowed to receive visitors later on Wednesday. Joy and relief as Thai cave boys rescued How the Thai boys were rescued Heroic diver gave his life to the rescue This video can not be played Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" ""We are not sure if this is a miracle, science, or what,"" wrote theThai Navy Seals,externalon Facebook on Tuesday. ""All the 13 Wild Boars are now out of the cave."" There were cheers around the Tham Luang cave system as the dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers involved in the operation left the site. In the nearby city of Chiang Rai, the news was greeted by the honking of car horns while people gathered outside the hospital broke into applause. On social media, Thais showed their feelings about the rescuers by using hashtags including #Heroes and #Thankyou. Offers of hospitality for the boys, the coach and their rescuers have come in from international football clubs including Manchester United and Benfica. Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team entered the cave system in dry weather, during an excursion with their coach. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded way the cave complex, blocking their way back out. The story of the rescue - told for children They were found nine days later when two expert British divers entered the cave. The boys were huddled in darkness on a ledge. Elation at the discovery of the group quickly turned to concern as it became clear just how difficult it would be to rescue boys who could not swim and had been weakened by their time underground. A team of expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave system. Getting to and from the trapped group was an exhausting round trip, even for experienced divers. The process involved a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy was accompanied by two divers, who also carried his air supply. The boys and their coach were trapped underground for a total of 17 days. Officials said the group survived the first nine days of their ordeal by drinking water dripping from the cave walls. They reportedly entered the cave to celebrate one of the team's birthday, and the snacks they brought with them are thought to have helped sustain them. Once found, they were given ""easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor"", said Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yuukongkaew. The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Rescuers brought them food, light and letters from their parents to help them cope According to Thongchai Lertwilairattanapong, an inspector for Thailand's health department, all the children lost on average 2kg during their time underground, but are in good physical condition. Authorities also said they seemed to cope well with the mental strain of their time underground. Rescue teams brought them lights andletters from their parentsto help them cope. And their coach, Ekapol Chantawong, reportedly taught the team how to meditate to cope with the stress. He trained for a decade as a Buddhist monk before turning to football. Details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. CaptainDuganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.

Murdoch's Fox increases Sky bidRupert Murdoch's Fox increases its offer for Sky as part of a takeover battle with Comcast.BusinessComments,"Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has increased its offer for UK broadcaster Sky to Â£24.5bn. This tops a previous offer from rival bidder Comcast and is part of an escalating battle between media giants, including Disney. Fox is expecting to obtain regulatory approval in the UK for the deal this week. The firm has been waiting for the go-ahead from the government before putting the deal to shareholders. Fox has been trying to get approval from UK regulators since 2016 to buy the 61% of Sky it does not own already. The bid was held up by fears that it could give Mr Murdoch too much power over UK media. Fox has been trying to address those concerns by offering concessions, including selling Sky News to Disney once the deal is complete. In June, the then Culture Secretary, Matt Hancock, said the Fox deal could go ahead if it sold Sky News, with certain conditions. Disney increases bid for Murdoch's Fox assets Sky takeover battle looms What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal? At the time, Mr Hancock said he needed to be confident that the deal ensured the long-term financial viability of the channel. Sky News would need to continue to be a major UK-based news broadcaster. It would also need to be able to make editorial decisions independent from the control of the Murdochs. Comcast, the US media giant that owns NBC and Universal Pictures, made a Â£22bn offer for Sky in February, trumping a previous offer from Fox that valued Sky at Â£18.5bn. Mr Hancock said in June that there would be no public interest concerns with a Comcast takeover of Sky. The government is expected to give its decision on Fox's Sky bid on Friday. If the Department of Culture, Media and Sport gives regulatory go-ahead for the bid, as is expected, then Fox has 28 days to notify shareholders that they need to vote on the deal. The end of the week also happens to be the deadline for Comcast to post an offer to Sky shareholders, who then have 60 days to consider that offer under UK takeover rules. Analysis: BBC business editor Simon Jack The new bid for Sky is a whopping 80% more than the market thought Sky was worth before the bidding war started. A source close to the deal said: ""It's absolutely unbelievable - they are way overpaying."" And I'm told it's not done yet. ""I think Comcast want it more - and will be back."" The big question may be for Disney, which, if the price goes any higher, may start to think that the company they want to buy - Fox - is overpaying for Sky. As one source at Sky told me: ""If you can figure out what the strategy is here, then let me know."" Here goes: the approval of the merger between AT&T and HBO's owner Time Warner in the US started an all-out global media arms between old giants and new pretenders such as Netflix. In that arms race for content and distribution, price is secondary to scale. And Sky - with its 20 million subscribers in Germany, Italy, UK, Spain and Ireland - hands the victor European distribution at scale on a single (increasingly expensive) plate. More from Simon here The skirmish for control of Sky is being fought in the shadow of an even bigger battle - a struggle for control of prized entertainment assets owned by Fox, including its stake in Sky. Disney and Comcast are locked in a battle for those businesses which include movie studios, cable channels, National Geographic and a 30% stake in video website Hulu, as well as Indian network Star. In June,Disney raised its offerfor those assets to $71.3bn (Â£54bn) in cash and shares. Under the deal, Fox would keep Fox Sports, Fox News and Fox Television Stations and make them into a new company called ""New Fox"". Established media companies like Disney are looking for deals that would help them meet the challenge of fast-growing rivals including Netflix and Amazon. George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There's enough sub-plots in the race to acquire Sky to commission a prime-time drama."" Another Fox offer for Sky was no surprise in itself, he said, but the offer was slightly lower than anticipated, which brought another twist. ""There's every chance it might entice another counter from Comcast. That might explain why the shares still trade above the latest offer price,"" he added. ""Whoever ends up in control will have acquired an attractive asset, but the price tag can't be ignored."" Shares in Sky closed on Wednesday at Â£14.94. A year ago they were trading at just under Â£10.

Novichok victim 'has spoken to police',"A man who was poisoned by Novichok has spoken ""briefly"" to officers trying to find the source of the nerve agent, Scotland Yard has said. Charlie Rowley, 45, is no longer in a critical condition, Salisbury District Hospital said, after making ""further progress overnight"". It comes a day after the hospital said he had regained consciousness. Dawn Sturgess, 44, who was also exposed to Novichok in Amesbury on 30 June, died on Sunday. Police are investigating a possible link to the case of Russians Sergei and Yulia Skripal, who were poisoned with the same substance in nearby Salisbury in March.

China 'shocked' by US trade actions,"China said it is ""shocked"" after the US announced plans for fresh tariffs, escalating a trade war between the two countries. The US listed $200bn (Â£150bn) worth of additional products it intends to place tariffs on as soon as September. The move comes just days after the two countries imposed tit-for-tat tariffs of $34bn on each other's goods. Beijing described Washington's latest threat as ""totally unacceptable,"" saying it would harm the world. ""The behaviour of the US is hurting China, hurting the world and hurting itself,"" a spokesperson for China's commerce ministry said in a statement. The spokesperson also said the government would have to take the ""necessary counter-measures"". The list names more than 6,000 items,externalincluding food products, minerals and consumer goods such as handbags. The public will have until the end of August to comment on the list before the new tariffs - to be imposed at 10% - come into effect. Analysis: Andrew Walker, economics correspondent China says it will respond to the new tariffs that President Trump has asked his administration to prepare.  But how? It cannot directly match the total of $234bn worth of goods that the US has in its sights, because it does not import enough American goods (another fact which the US president complains about). Last year, US goods exports to China were worth $130bn. What Beijing could do instead is to make life more difficult for American business interests, with more aggressive action by regulators, such as safety inspections or financial investigations.  China could also try to force its currency lower to gain competitiveness. There has even been speculation that China could sell some of the $1 trillion worth of US government debt (or bonds) that it holds.  If it sold enough, that could drive up the cost of borrowing in the US, but it would also inflict losses on China,  by forcing down the value of those bonds. Asian stock markets fell sharply on Wednesday as investors shunned risk amid escalating trade tensions between the two economic giants. In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 1.5%, while the Shanghai Composite fell 1.8%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index shed 1.2%. Trump raises stakes in US-China trade war How a US-China trade war could hurt us all The White House says the tariffs are a response to unfair trade practices by China. The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said there was ""no justification"" for China's retaliation. ""As in the past, the United States is willing to engage in efforts that could lead to a resolution of our concerns about China's unfair trade practices and to China opening its market to US goods and services,"" he said. ""In the meantime, we will remain vigilant in defending the ability of our workers and businesses to compete on a fair and reciprocal basis."" This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets Many companies in the US are opposed to the administration's use of tariffs against China, saying they risk hurting business and the economy without being likely to change behaviour. On top of the $34bn worth of tariffs that came into effect on Friday last week, the White House has said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products. US President Donald Trump has suggested these could come into effect later this month. In total, the new import taxes that President Trump is threatening to impose are almost equal to the value of China's entire goods exports to the US, worth more than $500bn last year. ""It's a difficult situation for a number of our companies. They're getting increasingly worried about where this is all going,"" Ed Brzytwa, director of international trade for the American Chemistry Council, which represents chemical companies, told the BBC on Tuesday before the latest measures were announced. ""They can't figure out what the endgame is."" Trump raises stakes in US-China trade war How a US-China trade war could hurt us all Trade war: Why you should care.

Novichok 'could stay active for 50 years',"A man who was poisoned by Novichok has spoken ""briefly"" to officers trying to find the source of the nerve agent, Scotland Yard has said. Charlie Rowley, 45, is no longer in a critical condition, Salisbury District Hospital said, after making ""further progress overnight"". It comes a day after the hospital said he had regained consciousness. Dawn Sturgess, 44, who was also exposed to Novichok in Amesbury on 30 June, died on Sunday. Police are investigating a possible link to the case of Russians Sergei and Yulia Skripal, who were poisoned with the same substance in nearby Salisbury in March.

The pre-match fan rituals keeping England on track,"JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann's pre-match lucky ritual included a cup of espresso. Alan Shearer's slightly less sophisticated equivalent was a plate of chicken and beans What does the success of a sports team depend upon? You might be tempted to think it's skill, fitness and a sprinkling of good luck. According to many fans, however, you would be wrong. It all boils down to whether your mate's wife pops into the kitchen in the 31st minute of a match; not cutting your toenails; and smashing that all-important rendition of Three Lions in the shower. That is, the pre-match ritual. BBC pundits JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann, Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinandall had their specific routineswhen they were still playing the game. Klinsmann would have a cup of espresso made with the German team's own machine. Less sophisticatedly, Shearer would eat a plateful of chicken and beans. Rio Ferdinand's lucky pre-match routine involved Paul Scholes, who appears to be taking it rather seriously And Ferdinand had so many there is not time to mention them all - but they included having the same breakfast, pouring water over his head in the tunnel andplaying two-touch,externalwith Paul Scholes. Ferdinand has even continued with some of his rituals as a supporter rather than player - a pre-match coffee is now an essential element. But he's not the only one doing his bit for England. A tasty - and lucky - snack for Susan Green Susan Green from Letchworth in Hertfordshire has joined her partner in hirsute heroics. ""My partner doesn't shave his head for the whole of the tournament and I have not shaved my legs since last Tuesday, and will not do so until the final. I am beginning to look a bit like a female woolly mammoth. ""Also, if I use particular adjectives, I have to say them at least twice in a sentence in different order. So, if I say shiny and sparkly I have to say 'shiny sparkly, sparkly shiny'. And I ate a spider's web yesterday... just in case."" Not creepy at all Matt Southworth from Warrington is keeping England's hopes alive by wearing a new Gareth Southgate mask for each knock-out game and destroying it afterwards. ""I've got two ready for the semi and the final after I wore one for both knockout rounds. Both masks were destroyed in the following celebrations for each match so I have decided having one and destroying it is crucial for World Cup glory. ""I have also had the same St George flag wrapped around my neck during every game - the only times I hadn't were the Belgium game and Colombia before penalties. I made my mate give it to me for the shootout. ""I will also not be cleaning my England top despite the stale beer smell of it now, as the only game I wore it clean for was the Belgium game. The flag has also not been cleaned and is also in a similarly rancid state."" Stephen from Wakefield (and his liver) are supporting the team by having a tactical beer with every game. ""My wife realised that the first letter of each beer matched the first letter of the opponent in the next round - but in their own language. So against Colombia the beer began with 'S' for Sverige. And against Sweden it began with 'H' for Hrvatska. Tomorrow I'll only drink a beer beginning with 'F'. ""When we make the final I'll find a 'W' beer for World Champions."" Good news for Worthingtons, Wadworth and Waggle Dance. A still life arrangement by Paul Ashley, showcasing his 1966 replica shirt, beard shampoo and the dog's bandana Paul Ashley from Doncaster has carried out the same detailed routine before every game. ""I have a morning shower (as opposed to my usual night-time clean) with a hair shampoo and a separate beard shampoo. ""I spend a large chunk of the day pacing the house. About 15 minutes before kick off I don my replica '66 shirt with 10 on the back, then about five minutes before kick-off I put an England flag bandana on my dog. ""It's worked so far, apart from Belgium, but I think I may have forgot to shampoo the beard that day."" Steve Hance's unwashed shorts are considered - by him - to be lucky Steve Hance from Buckhurst Hill in Essex is taking no risks and is cooking the same barbecue menu as for every single other England game. He says his family is getting a bit bored having to eat the same food every three days. Mr Hance adds: ""I'm wearing the same shirt (washed because that's lucky), same shorts (not washed, because that's lucky). ""I also ring my mate Tom at work from at least 20 different numbers in the building (so that he answers) and then whisper ""it's coming home"" and then hang up. Every single day. ""I'm certain that this keeps us in the running."" Jeremy Chapman risks overheating for the cause Jeremy Chapman, from Tring in Hertfordshire, donned his lucky suit - previously worn at his wedding - on Saturday as a tribute to the smartly-dressed England manager Gareth Southgate. Mr Chapman's wife Meredith Hepner says the ensemble is hanging up and ready in preparation for Wednesday's clash with Croatia. But it's not all the superstitious fan does. He also paints his toenails in patriotic colours (and for all we know, beneath his shiny, sensible lace-ups Southgate does the same) and the ""slides and painted toes are now part of the England luck ritual"". World Cup 2018: What are England fans singing? How Southgate helped us fall in love again Fans in ecstasy as England reach semis Meanwhile, in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, it's all in the seating arrangements. Simon Pinnell and his mates know the only way to keep England in the tournament is by sitting in the same places on his friend Mark's sofa for every single game. Simon Pinnell and friends have sacrificed watching in the pub to sit in the same ""lucky"" seats ""Despite invitations from a number of people to gather at theirs or suggestions to go to the pub, having watched all the other games at Mark's and got the result we wanted - including losing to Belgium - we are not going to risk anything other than watching it in the same room, sitting in the same positions,"" says Simon. Mark's wife Kate could find herself watching the game solo after having the audacity to leave the room during England's match against Sweden. ""During the match, she [went] to get a drink when Harry Maguire scored. We were tempted to banish her to the kitchen for the rest of the game,"" Simon added. âThe real fear, however, is if Joe Solo from Scarborough fails to purchase the same cut-price dinner he enjoyed on Saturday. Here is his confession and apology to the England team, just in case. Joe Solo's bread and cheese failure could break English hearts ""From the quarter-final onwards I obviously had to switch up a gear and pile the pressure on the opposition, not just with my lucky shorts and my T-shirt on backwards (to obviously blindside their full-backs), or my slippers on the wrong feet (to stop their forwards shooting straight), but with the pre-match meal. ""And this is where I have made a fatal error. ""Prior to the Sweden game I made the mistake of buying my dinner from the 'reduced' counter. It was proper nice - a stale tomato bread and a slightly overripe cheddar with chilli and lime, and obviously, with the 2-0 win it did the trick. ""Problem is, I have been back to the same reduced counter three times now and haven't seen the same food available. ""This is a potential crisis for the Croatia game and I would urge you not to be put off by it, and to give the game your all, regardless. For my part I will wait by the counter as late as I can before kick-off just in case we get lucky. ""Oh, and one last thing. If you do happen to lose, please don't tell anyone it was because of me. Everyone here is so excited about #ItsComingHome and I wouldn't want news of my bread/cheese failure to be made public if at all possible."" What are your special pre-match rituals?

Trump trades barbs with EU chief over Nato,"This video can not be played In 2018, Donald Trump told Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg that Germany is ""totally controlled by Russia"" US President Donald Trump has clashed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over Russian influence and defence spending, ahead of a Nato summit. Mr Trump said Germany was ""totally controlled by Russia"" because of the high level of natural gas it imported, and this was a ""bad thing for Nato"". Mrs Merkel hit back, comparing German independence now with the time when she grew up in the former East Germany. She also defended her country's contribution to the Western alliance. The last summit both leaders attended ended in acrimony in a row over trade. Mr Trump later made more conciliatory remarks after he and Mrs Merkel had met on the sidelines of the summit in Brussels on Wednesday. The summit comes less than a week beforeMr Trump is due to hold his first summit with Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, reviving concerns among US allies over his proximity to the Russian president. Reality Check: How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? Can Nato survive Donald Trump? What does the US contribute to Nato? President Trump shocked some by quipping that the Nato summit might prove harder than next Monday's summit with Mr Putin. He has said the US is being ""taken advantage of"" by other members of the Nato alliance, which was set up in 1949 to counter the Soviet Union, of which Russia is the main successor state. European Council President Donald Tusk accused him of criticising Europe ""almost daily"", tweeting: ""Dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don't have that many."" Germany has the EU's biggest economy and has long been accused by US administrations of failing to contribute its fair share to Nato operations but Mr Trump's comments were particularly stinging. At a breakfast meeting in Brussels with Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, the US leader said: ""Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they will be getting from 60% to 70% of their energy from Russia, and a new pipeline, and you tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not and I think it's a very bad thing for Nato."" EU figures suggestRussia is responsible for between 50% and 75% of Germany's gas imports,external, butgas makes up less than 20% of Germany's energy mix for power production. Germany has given political support for a new Baltic Sea pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which will increase the flow of Russian gas to EU states. The project has been sharply criticised by Poland and others. The US president also accused Germany of only spending ""a little bit over 1%"" of its economic output on defence compared to the 4.2% spent by the US ""in actual numbers"". Germany spends 1.24% of GDP on defence and the US 3.5%,external, according to the latest Nato estimate. ""I want to say that I have experience of when a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union,"" she told reporters. ""I am very happy that today we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions. ""That is very good, especially for people in eastern Germany."" Mrs Merkel (centre) led efforts to negotiate with Mr Trump over trade at last month's G7 summit in Canada What's happening in this G7 picture? US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU She added that Germany had put a huge proportion of its troops at Nato's disposal. ""We are still very heavily involved in Afghanistan and thus we also defend the interests of the United States of America... and Germany was pleased to do it and did it out of conviction,"" she said. At the G7 summit in Canada last month, the German chancellor led efforts to reach agreement with Mr Trump on trade butthe American leader rejected the G7 summit joint communique after he left. Mr Stoltenberg sought to play down Mr Trump's accusations, saying he expected Nato leaders would agree they were ""stronger together than apart"". He also tried to separate arguments about trade - not a primary Nato concern - from discussions about military matters. ""There are disagreements on trade. This is serious. My task is to try to minimise the negative impact on Nato,"" Mr Stoltenberg told a forum on the sidelines of the summit. Mr Trump told reporters that military spending and a planned gas pipeline from Russia to Germany had been discussed. ""We have a very, very good relationship with the chancellor. We have a tremendous relationship with Germany,"" he said. Mrs Merkel said she had discussed migration and trade with Mr Trump, and that she looked forward to further discussions as the US and Germany remained partners. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent In describing Germany as being ""totally controlled by Russia"" and linking this to what the US sees as Berlin's unsatisfactory defence budget, President Trump is underscoring two longstanding US concerns. US leaders have long warned of what they see as Europe's uncomfortable dependence upon Russian energy supplies. And they have also been arguing for more than a decade that the Europeans should spend more on defence. Mr Trump has given these twin themes a new and more abrasive tone. While he may well be overstating Germany's dependence upon Russian energy, even many European leaders are well aware of the potential influence that this could give Moscow. It's an area where short-term economic and longer-term security considerations are at variance. No wonder then that when the US sanctions Russia for its behaviour in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea it included steps to hamper anyone who helped build or support new Russian pipelines westwards. German troops in Lithuania this summer Mr Trump's main objection is that all but a handful of member states have still not increased their defence budgets to meet a goal of spending at least 2% of their annual economic output on defence by 2024.

Of Nato's 29 members, just five meet that target this year: the US, Greece, Estonia, the UK and Latvia. However, several, such as Poland and France, are close to the mark. Some in Nato fear Mr Trump's repeated blunt demands could harm morale, furthering the agenda of President Putin, whom they accuse of seeking to destabilise the West.

Murdoch's Fox increases Sky bid,"Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has increased its offer for UK broadcaster Sky to Â£24.5bn. This tops a previous offer from rival bidder Comcast and is part of an escalating battle between media giants, including Disney. Fox is expecting to obtain regulatory approval in the UK for the deal this week. The firm has been waiting for the go-ahead from the government before putting the deal to shareholders. Fox has been trying to get approval from UK regulators since 2016 to buy the 61% of Sky it does not own already. The bid was held up by fears that it could give Mr Murdoch too much power over UK media. Fox has been trying to address those concerns by offering concessions, including selling Sky News to Disney once the deal is complete. In June, the then Culture Secretary, Matt Hancock, said the Fox deal could go ahead if it sold Sky News, with certain conditions. Disney increases bid for Murdoch's Fox assets Sky takeover battle looms What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal? At the time, Mr Hancock said he needed to be confident that the deal ensured the long-term financial viability of the channel. Sky News would need to continue to be a major UK-based news broadcaster. It would also need to be able to make editorial decisions independent from the control of the Murdochs. Comcast, the US media giant that owns NBC and Universal Pictures, made a Â£22bn offer for Sky in February, trumping a previous offer from Fox that valued Sky at Â£18.5bn. Mr Hancock said in June that there would be no public interest concerns with a Comcast takeover of Sky. The government is expected to give its decision on Fox's Sky bid on Friday. If the Department of Culture, Media and Sport gives regulatory go-ahead for the bid, as is expected, then Fox has 28 days to notify shareholders that they need to vote on the deal. The end of the week also happens to be the deadline for Comcast to post an offer to Sky shareholders, who then have 60 days to consider that offer under UK takeover rules. Analysis: BBC business editor Simon Jack The new bid for Sky is a whopping 80% more than the market thought Sky was worth before the bidding war started. A source close to the deal said: ""It's absolutely unbelievable - they are way overpaying."" And I'm told it's not done yet. ""I think Comcast want it more - and will be back."" The big question may be for Disney, which, if the price goes any higher, may start to think that the company they want to buy - Fox - is overpaying for Sky. As one source at Sky told me: ""If you can figure out what the strategy is here, then let me know."" Here goes: the approval of the merger between AT&T and HBO's owner Time Warner in the US started an all-out global media arms between old giants and new pretenders such as Netflix. In that arms race for content and distribution, price is secondary to scale. And Sky - with its 20 million subscribers in Germany, Italy, UK, Spain and Ireland - hands the victor European distribution at scale on a single (increasingly expensive) plate. More from Simon here The skirmish for control of Sky is being fought in the shadow of an even bigger battle - a struggle for control of prized entertainment assets owned by Fox, including its stake in Sky. Disney and Comcast are locked in a battle for those businesses which include movie studios, cable channels, National Geographic and a 30% stake in video website Hulu, as well as Indian network Star. In June,Disney raised its offerfor those assets to $71.3bn (Â£54bn) in cash and shares. Under the deal, Fox would keep Fox Sports, Fox News and Fox Television Stations and make them into a new company called ""New Fox"". Established media companies like Disney are looking for deals that would help them meet the challenge of fast-growing rivals including Netflix and Amazon. George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There's enough sub-plots in the race to acquire Sky to commission a prime-time drama."" Another Fox offer for Sky was no surprise in itself, he said, but the offer was slightly lower than anticipated, which brought another twist. ""There's every chance it might entice another counter from Comcast. That might explain why the shares still trade above the latest offer price,"" he added. ""Whoever ends up in control will have acquired an attractive asset, but the price tag can't be ignored."" Shares in Sky closed on Wednesday at Â£14.94. A year ago they were trading at just under Â£10.

Military burial for World War One sailor,"An Aberdeen sailor killed during World War One has received a full military burial service in France after his remains were identified more than 100 years after his death. Able Seaman James Robertson was 27 when he died in April 1917 during the capture of Gavrelle. The human remains, and uniform shoulder titles, were found in 2016. The MoD's Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre had two possible candidates, beforeDNA confirmation. Relatives said it was ""sad and poignant"" and they would not have missed the ceremony. A Royal Naval Division shoulder title was found Mr Robertson had joined the Royal Naval Division (RND) at the beginning of the war. The RND was created after a surplus of Naval volunteers came forward after war was declared. A shortfall in infantry divisions in the Army led to the formation of the RND to supplement land forces. Mr Robertson served with the Hood Battalion, fighting in Gallipoli and Northern France. In January 1917, he joined the Anson Battalion and it was during ""fierce fighting"" in the village of Gavrelle that he died on 28 April 1917. His nephew, Frank Treasurer, 81, attended the service at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Orchard Dump Cemetery in France on Wednesday morning. Able Seaman James Robertson died while serving with the Anson Battalion He later told BBC Scotland: ""I sent a DNA sample and it came back positive. He was indeed my uncle. ""It's very sad, very poignant, but delightful to know he's buried with full honours. ""We have had a wonderful day here and I am delighted we managed to come across. I would not have missed this for the world actually.""

"Facebook faces record UK fine for data misuseThe data protection watchdog plans to fine Facebook Â£500,000 over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.Technology","This video can not be played Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham says Facebook's fines will damage its reputation The UK's data protection watchdog intends to fine Facebook Â£500,000 for data breaches - the maximum allowed. The Information Commissioner's Office said Facebook had failed to ensure another company - Cambridge Analytica - had deleted users' data. The ICO will also bring a criminal action,externalagainst Cambridge Analytica's defunct parent company SCL Elections. And it has raised concerns about political parties buying personal information from ""data brokers"". Specifically it named one company used by the Labour Party, Emma's Diary, which gives medical advice and free baby-themed products to parents. Facebook said it would respond to the report ""soon"". The ICO also said another company - Aggregate IQ - which worked with the Vote Leave campaign in the run up to the EU Referendum, must stop processing UK citizens' data. The fine is modest compared with previous sanctions on Facebook. Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal Facebook reveals its data-sharing VIPs Cambridge Analytica boss spars with MPs In 2017 it was fined110m euros (Â£95m) by the European Commission, which in the same yearpunished Google for 2.42bn euros(Â£2.1bn). But information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said companies also worried about reputational damage. The impact of behavioural advertising, when it came to elections, was ""significant"" and called for a code of practice to ""fix the system"", she said. Such a code would ensure that ""elections are fair and people understand how they are being micro-targeted"". The action comes 16 months after the ICO began its probe into political campaigners' use of personal data followingconcerns raised by whistleblower Christopher Wylie, among others. The ICO found Facebook had breached its own rules and failed to make sure Cambridge Analytica had deleted this personal data. While Cambridge Analytica insisted it hadindeed wiped the data after Facebook's erasure request in December 2015,external, the ICO said it had seen evidence that copies of the data had been shared with others. ""This potentially brings into question the accuracy of the deletion certificates provided to Facebook,"" said an ICO spokesperson. The ICO has also written to the UK's 11 main political parties telling them to have their data protection practices inspected. It is concerned the parties may have bought lifestyle information about members of the public from data brokers, who might have not have obtained the necessary consent. Naming Emma's Diary, the ICO said it was concerned about how transparent the firm had been about its political activities. Emma's Diary requires users to download an app to get a free bundle of baby-themed goods It said that the Labour Party had confirmed using the firm, but did not provide other details except that it intended to take some form of regulatory action. The service's owner Lifecycle Marketing told the BBC it did not agree with the ICO's initial findings. ""For over 25 years we have operated with integrity and within the spirit of data regulation,"" said a spokeswoman. ""As the ICO investigation continues we will freely cooperate... and cannot comment further at this stage."" Looking wider, the ICO noted Facebook had been the biggest recipient of digital advertising by political parties and campaigns to date. Yet, it said, the US firm had neither done enough to explain to its members how they were being targeted as a consequence, nor given them enough control over how their sensitive personal data was used. As a result, it said, Facebook was guilty of a second breach of the Data Protection Act. Facebook has a chance to respond to the Commissioner's Notice of Intent, after which a final decision will be made. The tech firm's chief privacy officer issued a brief response. ""As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,"" said Erin Egan. ""We have been working closely with the ICO in their investigation of Cambridge Analytica, just as we have with authorities in the US and other countries. We're reviewing the report and will respond to the ICO soon."" Cambridge Analytica, which claimed it could swing elections, and its parent SCL Elections, shut down in May. But the ICO said it was still taking legal steps to bring a criminal prosecution. The basis for this would be that SCL Elections had failed to properly respond to anearlier demand that it give a US academic a copy of any personal informationit held on him along with an explanation as to its source and usage. In March, Cambridge Analytica offices were searched by ICO officers Bearing in mind SCL Elections is now out of business, the ICO said it might consider taking action against the company's directors. The ICO said it had established that the Canadian data analytics firm AggregateIQ - AIQ - had access to UK voters' personal data provided by the Brexit referendum's Vote Leave campaign. It said it was now investigating whether this information had been transferred and accessed outside the UK and whether this amounted to a breach of the data protection act. The watchdog added that it continued to investigate to what degree AIQ and SCL Elections had shared UK personal data. And it said it had served an enforcement notice forbidding AIQ from continuing to make use of a list of UK citizens' email addresses and names that it still holds. Other action includes: an investigation into allegations that Arron Banks' Eldon Insurance Services illegally shared customer data with the Leave.EU group he co-founded, and used the business' call centre staff to make calls on behalf of the campaign - claims the firm has previously denied a probe into the collection and sharing of personal data by the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger In Europe  - and a linked data broker an audit of the University of Cambridge's Psychometrics Centre. The department carries out its own research into social media profiles. The ICO said it had been told of an alleged security breach involving one of the centre's apps and had additional concerns about its data protection efforts a call for the government to introduce a code of practice limiting how personal information can be used by political campaigns before the next general election efforts to ensure ex-staff from SCL Elections and Cambridge Analytica do not illegally use materials obtained from the business before its collapse The ICO said it expects the next stage of its investigation to be complete by the end of October.

"Baron Cohen 'dupes' Palin for new seriesSarah Palin calls the Borat star ""truly sick"" for posing as a wounded military veteran.Entertainment & Arts","Former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin says Sacha Baron Cohen ""duped"" her in an interview by posing as a wounded military veteran. The Borat star has been secretly filming for a new satirical comedy series that will air on TV next week. It was revealed on Monday the show - titled Who is America? - would explore ""diverse individuals"" in the US ""across the political and cultural spectrum"". Palin wrote on Facebook: ""Yup - we were duped. Ya' got me, Sacha. Feel better?"" She went on: ""I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick 'humour' of the British 'comedian' Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime."" Baron Cohen series to air on Channel 4 Baron Cohen is best known for hoaxing interviewees as comedy characters Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev and fashion reporter Bruno, all of whom inspired big-screen films. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, said she received a request to contribute to a ""legit historical documentary"" and travelled across the US with one of her daughters. She wrote: ""Baron Cohen (I presume) had heavily disguised himself as a disabled US Veteran, fake wheelchair and all. ""Out of respect for what I was led to believe would be a thoughtful discussion with someone who had served in uniform, I sat through a long 'interview' full of Hollywoodism's disrespect and sarcasm - but finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out, much to Cohen's chagrin. ""The disrespect of our US military and middle-class Americans via Cohen's foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions was perverse."" Palin, who asked for the proceeds from the programme to be donated to charity, added: ""Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country. Truly sick."" Last week, the comedian teased his comeback witha preview clip,externalshowing former US vice president Dick Cheney apparently agreeing to autograph a ""waterboard kit"" - in reality a plastic water jug. Who is America? will premiere on Showtime in the US on Sunday and the network has promised it will show the comedian and actor ""as you've never seen him before"". The series will begin in the UK on Monday on Channel 4 at 22:00 BST. Years before US presidentDonald Trumpentered the world of politics, he was interviewed by Ali G, Baron Cohen's Staines rapper. The famous interview saw his character try to pitch a business idea involving an ""ice cream glove"" to the entrepreneur. As part of a sketch for Channel 4's 11 O'Clock Show in 1998, Ali G got Conservative politicianRhodes Boysonto say that children should be ""caned"" at school, Baron Cohen was criticised for playing on Boyson's weakness as the politician had previously appeared on Have I Got News For You, apparently without realising it was a satirical comedy show. In an interview with former Conservative politicianNeil Hamiltonin 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton some ""cannabis"", which he accepted and smoked, creating minor controversy in the British media. In 2004, an episode of Da Ali G Show saw Borat interview Republican candidate for US Congress,James Broadwater. Borat's questions led Broadwater to say Jews would go to hell if they did not follow Christianity, which upset some Jewish communities. In the 2009 film of the same name, his character Bruno interviewed Republican presidential candidateRon Pauland in the scene tried and failed to seduce the Texas congressman into making a sex tape with Bruno, a gay Austrian TV host.

Tory vice-chairs quit over PM's Brexit plan,"This video can not be played Brexit: What just happened? Two vice-chairs of the Conservative Party are quitting their posts in protest at Theresa May's Chequers Brexit compromise plan. Maria Caulfield and Ben Bradley warned the PM her plan would not capitalise on the opportunities of Brexit. ""This policy will be bad for our country and bad for the party,"" Ms Caulfield said. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis have already quit over the proposals. Ahead of his first visit to the country as US President on Thursday, Donald Trump said the UK was ""somewhat in turmoil"" and it was ""up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister. He also praised Mr Johnson, describing him as a ""good friend of mine"". Mrs May says theproposed new relationship,externalwith the EU will ""honour the result of the referendum"" and allow the UK to ""take back control of our borders, our law and our money"". Speaking at a press conference alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the prime minister said her plan would allow for a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"", protecting jobs and livelihoods. Trump talks of UK 'turmoil' ahead of trip Reaction to more Brexit resignations PM's new cabinet meets amid Brexit turmoil It would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to minimise friction for trade at borders. But some Tories are unhappy, saying it will leave the UK tied closely to EU rules and prevent it from striking its own trade deals in years to come. More details are expected on Thursday in a White Paper. Ms Caulfield, who was vice chairwoman for women, supported Leave in the EU referendum. Mr Bradley - who backed Remain - had a brief trying to appeal to young voters. The Conservatives have nine vice chairmen in total, appointed in January's reshuffle. In her resignation letter to Mrs May, Ms Caulfield - the MP for Lewes in Sussex - said the proposed new trading relationship with the EU did not ""fully embrace the opportunities that Brexit can provide"". Mr Bradley, who posted a positive message of support for Mrs May before Friday's Chequers meeting, said he could not now ""with any sincerity defend this course"" to voters in his Leave-backing constituency of Mansfield.

Amid continuing unrest on the Tory benches, Andrew Bridgen became the first Conservative MP to publicly confirm he had sent a letter calling for a vote of confidence in Mrs May.

Mr Trump, who arrives in the UK on Thursday after attending the Nato summit in Brussels, told reporters before leaving Washington there were ""a lot of things going on"" in the UK at the moment. He said he got on well with Mrs May and had ""always liked"" Boris Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary on Monday, describing him as a ""friend of mine"". Mr Trump, who has called on other Nato members to pay more for their own defence, joked that his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday ""may be the easiest of all"". Mrs Merkel said she wanted the closest possible relationship with the UK after Brexit The prime minister has chaired the first meeting of her new-look cabinet, after the departures of Mr Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis The new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged all ministers to stand behind Mrs May in pursuit of an agreement with the EU based on the approach agreed at Chequers. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has insisted any Brexit deal must guarantee there is no ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland, has suggested the Chequers agreement might represent a breakthrough. ""If the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,"" he told the Irish Parliament. ""I think perhaps we are now entering into that space."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking at a summit for the Western Balkans in London, said it was good that the UK had put proposals on the table and the EU would issue a ""common response"" in due course. ""We have made progress,"" she told reporters. And the EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said 80% of the detail of the UK's withdrawal had been settled and he was now prepared to start talking about a ""very ambitious"" trade agreement with the UK.

US fires next shot in China trade war,"Neither the US nor China appear willing to back down The US has ramped up its trade war with China, listing $200bn (Â£150bn) worth of additional products it plans to place tariffs on as soon as September. The move comes just days after the two countries imposed tit-for-tat tariffs of $34bn on each other's goods. President Donald Trump had already threatened to impose additional tariffs against China if it retaliated. The list names more than 6,000 items,externalincluding food products, minerals and consumer goods such as handbags. The public will have until the end of August to comment on the list before the new tariffs - to be imposed at 10% - come into effect. Asian stock markets fell sharply in early trading amid escalating trade tensions between the two economic giants. In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 2% while the Shanghai Composite fell 1.8%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index shed 1.7%. Trump raises stakes in US-China trade war How a US-China trade war could hurt us all The White House says the tariffs are a response to unfair trade practices by China. The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said there was ""no justification"" for China's retaliation. ""As in the past, the United States is willing to engage in efforts that could lead to a resolution of our concerns about China's unfair trade practices and to China opening its market to US goods and services,"" he said. ""In the meantime, we will remain vigilant in defending the ability of our workers and businesses to compete on a fair and reciprocal basis."" Many companies in the US are opposed to the administration's use of tariffs against China, saying they risk hurting business and the economy without being likely to change behaviour. On top of the $34bn worth of tariffs that came into effect on Friday, the White House has said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products. President Trump has suggested these could come into effect later this month. In total, the new import taxes President Trump is threatening to impose are almost equal to the value of China's entire goods exports to the US, worth more than $500bn last year. ""It's a difficult situation for a number of our companies. They're getting increasingly worried about where this is all going,"" Ed Brzytwa, director of international trade for the American Chemistry Council, which represents chemical companies, told the BBC on Tuesday before the latest measures were announced. ""They can't figure out what the end game is."" Trump raises stakes in US-China trade war US-China trade war: A farmer's view.
