Venice bans large cruise ships from historic centre,"Demonstrators protest against the passage of cruise ships in parts of Venice Large cruise ships are to be banned from entering Venice's historic centre, the Italian government says. Ships weighing more than 1,000 tonnes will be rerouted away from certain waterways from September. The move follows an accident in June in which a ship collided with a dock, injuring five people. But conservationists say the government's plans are insufficient to prevent underwater erosion and pollution in the lagoon city.

Starting from next month, some liners will be forced to dock at the Fusina and Lombardia terminals away from the city centre,the Financial Times reported,external. By the end of 2020, a third of all ships will be rerouted. Critics have long said waves created by cruise ships on the canal erode the foundations of the city, which regularly suffers from flooding. Others have also complained that they detract from the beauty of Venice's historic sites and bring in too many tourists. But the June accident, in whichthe MSC Opera - a 275m (900ft) long ship - collided with a dock and a small tourist boatin the city's Giudecca canal, galvanised protesters to call for a definitive ban. The Giudecca, which passes close to the popular St Mark's Square, is one of Venice's major waterways.

Late signings take spending to Â£1.41bn,"Kieran Tierney, Alex Iwobi, Ryan Sessegnon and Ismaila Sarr were the four Â£25m+ Premier League signings on deadline day A late flurry of deadline-day signings took Premier League spending for the summer up to Â£1.41bn, just short of the Â£1.43bn record set in 2017, according to Deloitte. Deadline day spending alone by English top-flight clubs was Â£170m - but on just 18 deals, the joint fewest number of transfers on the last day of the summer window since 2009. Everton's Â£34m signing of forwardAlex Iwobifrom Arsenal was the biggest incoming Premier League deal, while the largest transfer sawRomelu Lukakuleave Manchester United for Inter Milan for Â£74m - a loss of Â£1m on the fee they paid Everton. Arsenal were the biggest spenders in England during the window, splashing out Â£155m. On deadline day, they bought Â£25m Celtic left-backKieran Tierneyand Â£8m Chelsea centre-back David Luiz. Tottenham recruited Real Betis midfielderGiovani lo Celsoon loan and signed Fulham winger Ryan Sessegnon for Â£25m. Their pursuit of Juventus forward Paulo Dybala was one of the big stories earlier in the day butthe deal fell through. Watford spent a club record, reported to be Â£25m, on Rennes wingerIsmaila Sarrand Leicester bought Sampdoria's attacking midfielderDennis Praetfor a reported Â£18m. How did social media react to deadline day? Full list: Discover all the deadline-day transfers What's new this season in the Premier League? Three former England internationals made moves - Burnley signing Chelsea midfielderDanny Drinkwaterand Manchester City bringing in Derby goalkeeperScott Carson,both on loan, while Newcastle re-signed free agent strikerAndy Carroll. If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please clickhere,externalto vote. A busy day in the Championship was headlined by West Brom spending Â£4m on Southampton strikerCharlie Austin. This was the second year in a row when Premier League clubs could only sign players until the day before the season started, instead of the end of August. The deadline has also now passed for Championship clubs, but teams from Scotland, Leagues One and Two and all of Europe's major leagues can bring in players until 2 September. The total number of Premier League signings in the summer fell for the sixth year in a row. Eleven of the 20 Premier League clubs broke their transfer record this summer, with Sheffield United smashing theirs four times. Arsenal, Aston Villa, Leicester (twice), Manchester City, Newcastle, Southampton, Tottenham, Watford - on deadline day - West Ham and Wolves are the other 10. Harry Maguire's Â£80m switch from Leicester to Manchester United was the biggest Premier League signing of the summer, followed by Arsenal's Â£72m purchase of Lille winger Nicolas Pepe. Champions Manchester City bought Atletico Madrid midfielder Rodri for Â£62.8m and Juventus right-back Joao Cancelo for Â£60m. Spurs spent Â£53.8m on Lyon midfielder Tanguy Ndombele - their first first-team signing since January 2018. The 10 biggest signings by Premier League clubs this summer Villa spent Â£125m, the second promoted club to hit nine figures after Fulham, who did so last summer, only to be relegated in April. The other biggest transfers were Manchester United right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Â£50m from Crystal Palace), West Ham striker Sebastien Haller (Â£45m from Eintracht Frankfurt), Newcastle striker Joelinton (Â£40m from Hoffenheim) and Leicester midfielder Youri Tielemans (reported Â£40m from Monaco). Chelsea also spent Â£40m on Real Madrid midfielder Mateo Kovacic despite having a transfer embargo. The Croat was already there on loan, so Frank Lampard's side were allowed to sign him permanently as he was already registered. Their sale of Eden Hazard to Real for a fee of Â£89m, which could rise to Â£150m, was one of the biggest deals in the world. This was the second highest total spend since the introduction of the transfer window system in 2003, according to analysis from Deloitte's Sports Business Group. It is the fourth consecutive summer that Premier League clubs have spent over Â£1bn. But Premier League clubs' net expenditure (purchases minus sales) was Â£625m - the lowest in a summer since 2015, helped by Hazard and Lukaku's big-money moves. Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: ""With this level of net spend, combined with a more modest increase in Premier League broadcast rights values for the coming season than we have seen previously, we would expect wages to increase at a greater rate than revenue, returning to a wages to revenue ratio of over 60%. ""However, this does not signal major financial concerns as Premier League clubs collectively generated pre-tax profits of Â£426m in 2017-18, while net spend as a proportion of revenue of 12% is at its lowest since 2012."" Here are some of Deloitte's other findings... La Liga clubs could still overtake the Premier League's total. Spain's top-flight clubs have spent Â£1.1bn, with Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona accounting for two thirds of that alone. That number will increase with their deadline not until 2 September. Championship clubs spent Â£160m on transfers, an increase from the Â£155m spent last summer. Chelsea (who had a transfer embargo), Crystal Palace and Liverpool were the three clubs to make a profit on transfers this summer. Benfica (Â£170m) and Ajax (Â£165m) were among the sides to make the most in player sales this summer. The deadline for La Liga, Serie A, the Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and other European leagues is on 2 September so their clubs can sign Premier League players until then. Real Madrid have been linked with United midfielder Paul Pogba all summer, but it seems unlikely United would let the France international go now without being able to bring in a replacement. Spurs playmaker Christian Eriksen is another who could leave the Premier League. The Denmark international, who has one year left on his contract, isinterested in a move abroad.But could their failure to sign Dybala make a move less likely? Manchester City winger Leroy Sane is a long-term Bayern Munich target but thecruciate ligament damagesuffered in Sunday's Community Shield could see him stay at Etihad Stadium. Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale was never really linked to any English clubs before the deadline. He has got three and a half weeks to find a European club, or else face a season out of the team, with the Welshman seemingly not in Zinedine Zidane's plans. Paris St-Germain forward Neymar continues to be linked to Real Madrid and former club Barcelona, while Real attacking midfielder James Rodriguez - like Bale - may have to move away for first-team football. The Premier League deadline closing could spark a flurry of signings elsewhere. Some managers in Leagues One and Two have been waiting for this stage, with Premier League and Championship clubs now more likely to know who they will be willing to loan or sell.

Salvini calls for snap election in Italy,"This video can not be played Matteo Salvini called for a quick break with Five Star Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's League party, has called for a snap election, saying differences with coalition partners cannot be mended. A failed attempt by the Five Star Movement to derail plans for a high-speed rail link showed the coalition could no longer govern, he said. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said his party did not fear another election. Mr Salvini's right-wing party is well ahead in opinion polls, due mainly to his stance against illegal immigration. The League party has tabled a no-confidence motion in the Senate to bring down its coalition with the Five Star Movement. Party leaders will set the date for the debate on Monday. Parliament is on its summer recess but Mr Salvini told legislators to ""get off their bums"" to debate the motion within the statutory 10 days. Mr Salvini is also very active on social media and has developed a ""man of the people"" image, pushing for tax cuts despite Italy's â¬2.3tn (Â£2.1tn) debt mountain, which is second only to Greece's in the EU. In last year's election, Five Star won twice as many votes as the League, but polls suggest the proportions have been reversed. In European elections held in May the League came top with 34% of the votes in Italy, whereas Five Star got about 17%. The Russian oil allegations gripping Italy Can Italy trust this man? Country profile Giuseppe Conte, the non-party law professor who serves as the coalition's prime minister, has said Mr Salvini, Italy's interior minister, must ""justify"" to parliament his call for an election. Both Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio are deputy prime ministers. The authority to dissolve parliament rests with President Sergio Mattarella, but he may be reluctant to do so, as next month MPs - who are currently on holiday - have to consider the 2020 budget. Political clashes over the project for a railway between the Italian city of Turin and French city of Lyon led Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to put tenders on hold in March. The multi-billion-euro TAV (Treno Alta VelocitÃ ) link involves digging a 58km (36-mile) tunnel through the Alps. It is bitterly opposed by Five Star on environmental and cost grounds. The tunnel from Turin to Lyon is expected to cost â¬8.6bn but an Italian government report put the price tag at over â¬20bn The League argues that it would create jobs and stimulate economic growth, and that moving freight from road to rail is environmentally friendly. Supporters of the project say it would halve the travel time between the two cities to just two hours. The tunnel would also make it possible to travel from Paris to Milan in around four hours, down from nearly seven. The project was launched 20 years ago and part of it has already been dug. It is scheduled for completion in 2025. Costs were initially projected to hit â¬8.6bn ($9.7bn; Â£7.4bn), but Italy's Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli - a Five Star member - put the price tag at over â¬20bn. The EU pledged to fund up to 40% of the cost. ""Let's go straight to parliament to say there is no longer a majority... and quickly go back to the voters,"" Mr Salvini said on Thursday. Mr Di Maio countered by declaring in a statement: ""We are ready, we don't care in the least about occupying government posts and we never have."" The League has been in an uneasy coalition with Five Star, which came to power on an anti-establishment ticket. Mr Salvini's demand for an election does not necessarily mean a poll will be called in the near future. Italy has not had an autumn election in all the post-war period, Reuters news agency reports. President Sergio Mattarella could theoretically appoint a government of technocrats and postpone a new election until next year. Italy has had a technocratic government before, but Mr Salvini, riding a wave of popularity, can be expected to oppose such a move.

Chancellor 'fast tracking' Brexit spending review,"Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced a one-year spending review to give government departments ""financial certainty"" as they prepare for Brexit. Mr Javid said a spending round for 2020-21 would ""clear the ground ahead of Brexit while delivering on people's priorities"". He told the BBC that he was confident it would meet the government's priorities for the NHS, police and schools. It is not a multi-year spending review. Those usually happen every two to four years and due to Brexit delays there has not been such a review since 2015. The Institute for Fiscal Studies called it ""long-awaited"", while Labour said the Tories were ""playing dangerous games with spending"". What should we expect from new Chancellor Sajid Javid? Sajid Javid tells HMRC: Make no-deal Brexit planning top priority Â£2.1bn extra for no-deal Brexit planning Spending reviews are regularly carried out by the Treasury to fix firm expenditure limits and set out what the public can expect from the government. Mr Javid told the BBC: ""One of things I've done is I want to make sure all departments, including my own, are very focused on our priority which is to make sure we leave the European Union on October 31st. ""That's why I'm having a one-year spending round so we can just get focused on our priority. ""But I'm confident that in that spending round that we'll be able to meet all our priorities and that certainly means increased focus on the NHS, on police and on schools."" Mr Javid was appointed chancellor by incoming Prime Minister Boris Johnson last month, replacing Philip Hammond. Speaking after data showed the economy had contracted in the second quarter of the year, he added: ""I'll be a chancellor to make sure that our country continues to live within our means."" He also said the economy remained strong and was forecast to return to growth, meaning the government could ""continue to invest in the priorities of the British people"". Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said: ""This spending round will give financial certainty to departments' plans for next year. ""We will invest in the priority areas of schools and policing, while delivering our promises on the NHS, defence and Official Development Assistance [foreign aid]."" Mr McDonnell said the approach ""smacks of pre-election panic"" Under Mr Johnson's administration, emergency preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit have been ramped up. Last week, Mr Javid announcedan extra Â£2.1bn of fundingto prepare for such an outcome - doubling the amount of money the government has set aside this year. Labour's Mr McDonnell said the approach ""smacks of pre-election panic measures by the government"". ""Boris Johnson is splashing a little bit of cash as a publicity stunt, but keeping the door open for even more austerity if a no-deal Brexit breaks the economy,"" he said. Mr McDonnell said there were ""gaping holes"" in the spending plans, with ""nowhere near enough"" allocated to the NHS, schools or local government. About 50% of government spending is planned on a multi-year basis, when it comes to things like public services, such as the NHS, schools or the police, which are unlikely to alter drastically from year to year. Typically, these budgets are set three or four years in advance, in order to help government departments plan their spending more effectively. Tony Bonsignore, political correspondent Government departments are likely to have mixed views about this announcement. On the one hand, some public services - for example, health and the police - may be offered more money. There may also be extra cash to deal with the potential fallout from a no-deal Brexit. The government says this decision is about getting Brexit done and delivering on people's priorities. But the decision also makes it harder for public services to plan for the longer term, as they'll now have to wait another year for the real spending review. There's also the risk that the spending taps might be turned off as quickly as they're turned on. That's Labour's line of attack - they're accusing the government of playing ""dangerous games"" and ""abandoning any pretence of a long-term economic plan"". ""If you're a head teacher or head of a police force, if you're trying to work out who to hire or whether to invest in a piece of equipment, it helps to know what your budget is going to be into the future,"" Ben Zaranko, a research economist with the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC. ""If you have to plan this on a year-to-year basis, it's quite hard."" This time, the spending review will be published in advance of the Budget, which means the chancellor will be making spending plans before he has updated forecasts for the economy, and before he has set tax policy, Mr Zaranko added. One-year spending reviews are not unprecedented. In 2013, the government set the budget for 2015-16, so as to avoid spending decisions going beyond the next election. Chancellor Sajid Javid and Home Secretary Priti Patel were given a tour of Tilbury Docks in early August The IFS's Mr Zaranko said it made sense that the chancellor was unwilling to commit to longer spending plans, because ""we don't know what the economy is going to look like six months down the line, let alone three years"". However, it would make it much harder for government departments to plan for the future. Earlier this year, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary released a report warning that one-year spending reviews would not be good for the police in England. But James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, welcomed the one-year spending round, saying councils ""urgently need some certainty about how local services will be funded next year as they begin their budget-setting process"".

Privacy law 'hack' exposed fiancee's personal dataOne in four firms holding a test subject's data released it to her partner without her permission.,"GDPR is supposed to protect personal data, but this experiment used the law to help achieve the opposite effect About one in four companies revealed personal information to a woman's partner, who had made a bogus demand for the data by citing an EU privacy law. The security expert contacted dozens of UK and US-based firms to test how they would handle a ""right of access"" request made in someone else's name. In each case, he asked for all the data that they held on his fiancee. In one case, the response included the results of a criminal activity check. Other replies included credit card information, travel details, account logins and passwords, and the target's full US social security number. University of Oxford-based researcher James Pavur has presented his findings at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas. It is one of the first tests of its kind to exploit theEU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),external, which came into force in May 2018. The law shortened the time organisations had to respond to data requests, added new types of information they have to provide, and increased the potential penalty for non-compliance. ""Generally if it was an extremely large company - especially tech ones - they tended to do really well,"" he told the BBC. ""Small companies tended to ignore me. ""But the kind of mid-sized businesses that knew about GDPR, but maybe didn't have much of a specialised process [to handle requests], failed."" He declined to identify the organisations that had mishandled the requests, but said they had included: a UK hotel chain that shared a complete record of his partner's overnight stays two UK rail companies that provided records of all the journeys she had taken with them over several years a US-based educational company that handed over her high school grades, mother's maiden name and the results of a criminal background check survey Mr Pavur has, however, named some of the companies that he said had performed well. Mr Pavur says he believes he did not break the law himself while conducting the trial He said they included: the supermarket Tesco, which had demanded a photo ID the domestic retail chain Bed Bath and Beyond, which had insisted on a telephone interview American Airlines, which had spotted that he had uploaded a blank image to the passport field of its online form One independent expert said the findings were a ""real concern"". ""Sending someone's personal information to the wrong person is as much a data breach as leaving an unencrypted USB drive lying around, or forgetting to shred confidential papers,"" said Dr Steven Murdoch, from University College London. Mr Pavur's bride-to-be gave him permission to carry out the tests and helped write up the findings, but otherwise did not participate in the operation. So for correspondence, the researcher created a fake email address for his partner, in the format ""first name-middle initial-last name@gmail.com"". Anaccompanying letter said that under GDPR,,externalthe recipient had one month to respond. It added that he could provide additional identity documents via a ""secure online portal"" if required. This was a deliberate deception since he believed many businesses lacked such a facility and would not have time to create one. Google reveals fistful of flaws in Apple's iMessage app Gay dating apps still leaking location data WhatsApp flaw 'puts words in your mouth' The attacks were carried out in two waves. For the first half of those contacted, he used only the information detailed above. But for the second batch, he drew on personal details revealed by the first group to answer follow-up questions. The idea, he said, was to replicate the kind of attack that could be carried out by someone starting with just the details found on a basic LinkedIn page or other online public profile. If the organisation asked for a ""strong"" type of ID - such as a passport or driver's licence scan - Mr Pavur declined. He also decided not to create forgeries of more easily faked documents. So, for example, he would not sign documents saying he was the data subject. Nor would he send emails with spoofed headers when asked to write from the victim's registered account. But he did try to convince the companies to accept documents that would theoretically be easy to mock up, but in this case could be sourced from his fiancee. So, when one train operator asked for a photocopy of a passport, he convinced it instead to accept a postmarked envelope addressed to the ""victim"". In another case, a cyber-security company agreed to accept a photograph of a bank statement, which had been blacked out so that the only information left on view was the target's name and address. Mr Pavur says that in one case he a heavily redacted bank statement was accepted Sometimes such subterfuge was unnecessary. One online gaming company asked for the applicant's account password. But on being told that it had been forgotten, Mr Pavur said it disclosed his fiancee's personal data anyway without asking for alternative verification. Mr Pavur said that a total of 60 distinct pieces of personal information about his girlfriend were ultimately exposed. These included a list of past purchases, 10 digits of her credit card number, its expiry date and issuer, and her past and present addresses. In addition, one threat intelligence firm provided a record of breached usernames and passwords it held on his partner. These still worked on at least 10 online services as she had used the same logins for multiple sites. In one case, the GDPR request letter was posted to the internet after being sent to an advertising company, constituting a data breach in itself. It contained the fiancee's name, address, email and phone number. ""Luckily it only had very simple data,"" said Mr Pavur. ""But you could imagine someone sending a letter with more detailed information."" Overall, of the 83 firms known to have held data about his partner, Mr Pavur said: 24% supplied personal information without verifying the requester's identity 16% requested an easily forged type of ID that he did not provide 39% asked for a ""strong"" type of ID 5% said they had no data to share, even though the fiancee had an account controlled by them 3% misinterpreted the request and said they had deleted all her data 13% ignored the request altogether WhatsApp flaw 'puts words in your mouth' Gay dating apps still leaking location data Los Angeles mayor giving update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Warnings after 'vagina steaming' burns womanGynaecologists are sharing the story as a cautionary tale about the alternative therapy trend.,"Gynaecologists are warning of the potential risks of vaginal steaming after it emerged a Canadian woman burned herself attempting one. A case study, involving a 62-year-old, was published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada. The woman had been suffering from a prolapsed vagina and believed the treatment could help avoid surgery. Vaginal steaming, which involves sitting over a hot water and herb mix, has seen a growth in popularity. It and other treatments for intimate areas, including vulva facials, are now available at some salons and spas. The LA Times first reported on the steaming trend in 2010,,externaland it later gained widespread attention when Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand recommended it.

Privacy law 'hack' exposed fiancee's personal dataOne in four firms holding a test subject's data released it to her partner without her permission.Technology,"GDPR is supposed to protect personal data, but this experiment used the law to help achieve the opposite effect About one in four companies revealed personal information to a woman's partner, who had made a bogus demand for the data by citing an EU privacy law. The security expert contacted dozens of UK and US-based firms to test how they would handle a ""right of access"" request made in someone else's name. In each case, he asked for all the data that they held on his fiancee. In one case, the response included the results of a criminal activity check. Other replies included credit card information, travel details, account logins and passwords, and the target's full US social security number. University of Oxford-based researcher James Pavur has presented his findings at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas. It is one of the first tests of its kind to exploit theEU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),external, which came into force in May 2018. The law shortened the time organisations had to respond to data requests, added new types of information they have to provide, and increased the potential penalty for non-compliance. ""Generally if it was an extremely large company - especially tech ones - they tended to do really well,"" he told the BBC. ""Small companies tended to ignore me. ""But the kind of mid-sized businesses that knew about GDPR, but maybe didn't have much of a specialised process [to handle requests], failed."" He declined to identify the organisations that had mishandled the requests, but said they had included: a UK hotel chain that shared a complete record of his partner's overnight stays two UK rail companies that provided records of all the journeys she had taken with them over several years a US-based educational company that handed over her high school grades, mother's maiden name and the results of a criminal background check survey Mr Pavur has, however, named some of the companies that he said had performed well. Mr Pavur says he believes he did not break the law himself while conducting the trial He said they included: the supermarket Tesco, which had demanded a photo ID the domestic retail chain Bed Bath and Beyond, which had insisted on a telephone interview American Airlines, which had spotted that he had uploaded a blank image to the passport field of its online form One independent expert said the findings were a ""real concern"". ""Sending someone's personal information to the wrong person is as much a data breach as leaving an unencrypted USB drive lying around, or forgetting to shred confidential papers,"" said Dr Steven Murdoch, from University College London. Mr Pavur's bride-to-be gave him permission to carry out the tests and helped write up the findings, but otherwise did not participate in the operation. So for correspondence, the researcher created a fake email address for his partner, in the format ""first name-middle initial-last name@gmail.com"". Anaccompanying letter said that under GDPR,,externalthe recipient had one month to respond. It added that he could provide additional identity documents via a ""secure online portal"" if required. This was a deliberate deception since he believed many businesses lacked such a facility and would not have time to create one. Google reveals fistful of flaws in Apple's iMessage app Gay dating apps still leaking location data WhatsApp flaw 'puts words in your mouth' The attacks were carried out in two waves. For the first half of those contacted, he used only the information detailed above. But for the second batch, he drew on personal details revealed by the first group to answer follow-up questions. The idea, he said, was to replicate the kind of attack that could be carried out by someone starting with just the details found on a basic LinkedIn page or other online public profile. If the organisation asked for a ""strong"" type of ID - such as a passport or driver's licence scan - Mr Pavur declined. He also decided not to create forgeries of more easily faked documents. So, for example, he would not sign documents saying he was the data subject. Nor would he send emails with spoofed headers when asked to write from the victim's registered account. But he did try to convince the companies to accept documents that would theoretically be easy to mock up, but in this case could be sourced from his fiancee. So, when one train operator asked for a photocopy of a passport, he convinced it instead to accept a postmarked envelope addressed to the ""victim"". In another case, a cyber-security company agreed to accept a photograph of a bank statement, which had been blacked out so that the only information left on view was the target's name and address. Mr Pavur says that in one case he a heavily redacted bank statement was accepted Sometimes such subterfuge was unnecessary. One online gaming company asked for the applicant's account password. But on being told that it had been forgotten, Mr Pavur said it disclosed his fiancee's personal data anyway without asking for alternative verification. Mr Pavur said that a total of 60 distinct pieces of personal information about his girlfriend were ultimately exposed. These included a list of past purchases, 10 digits of her credit card number, its expiry date and issuer, and her past and present addresses. In addition, one threat intelligence firm provided a record of breached usernames and passwords it held on his partner. These still worked on at least 10 online services as she had used the same logins for multiple sites. In one case, the GDPR request letter was posted to the internet after being sent to an advertising company, constituting a data breach in itself. It contained the fiancee's name, address, email and phone number. ""Luckily it only had very simple data,"" said Mr Pavur. ""But you could imagine someone sending a letter with more detailed information."" Overall, of the 83 firms known to have held data about his partner, Mr Pavur said: 24% supplied personal information without verifying the requester's identity 16% requested an easily forged type of ID that he did not provide 39% asked for a ""strong"" type of ID 5% said they had no data to share, even though the fiancee had an account controlled by them 3% misinterpreted the request and said they had deleted all her data 13% ignored the request altogether WhatsApp flaw 'puts words in your mouth' Gay dating apps still leaking location data Los Angeles mayor giving update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Chancellor 'fast tracking' Brexit spending reviewSajid Javid said an accelerated one-year spending review would help departments to prepare for Brexit.Business,"Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced a one-year spending review to give government departments ""financial certainty"" as they prepare for Brexit. Mr Javid said a spending round for 2020-21 would ""clear the ground ahead of Brexit while delivering on people's priorities"". He told the BBC that he was confident it would meet the government's priorities for the NHS, police and schools. It is not a multi-year spending review. Those usually happen every two to four years and due to Brexit delays there has not been such a review since 2015. The Institute for Fiscal Studies called it ""long-awaited"", while Labour said the Tories were ""playing dangerous games with spending"". What should we expect from new Chancellor Sajid Javid? Sajid Javid tells HMRC: Make no-deal Brexit planning top priority Â£2.1bn extra for no-deal Brexit planning Spending reviews are regularly carried out by the Treasury to fix firm expenditure limits and set out what the public can expect from the government. Mr Javid told the BBC: ""One of things I've done is I want to make sure all departments, including my own, are very focused on our priority which is to make sure we leave the European Union on October 31st. ""That's why I'm having a one-year spending round so we can just get focused on our priority. ""But I'm confident that in that spending round that we'll be able to meet all our priorities and that certainly means increased focus on the NHS, on police and on schools."" Mr Javid was appointed chancellor by incoming Prime Minister Boris Johnson last month, replacing Philip Hammond. Speaking after data showed the economy had contracted in the second quarter of the year, he added: ""I'll be a chancellor to make sure that our country continues to live within our means."" He also said the economy remained strong and was forecast to return to growth, meaning the government could ""continue to invest in the priorities of the British people"". Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said: ""This spending round will give financial certainty to departments' plans for next year. ""We will invest in the priority areas of schools and policing, while delivering our promises on the NHS, defence and Official Development Assistance [foreign aid]."" Mr McDonnell said the approach ""smacks of pre-election panic"" Under Mr Johnson's administration, emergency preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit have been ramped up. Last week, Mr Javid announcedan extra Â£2.1bn of fundingto prepare for such an outcome - doubling the amount of money the government has set aside this year. Labour's Mr McDonnell said the approach ""smacks of pre-election panic measures by the government"". ""Boris Johnson is splashing a little bit of cash as a publicity stunt, but keeping the door open for even more austerity if a no-deal Brexit breaks the economy,"" he said. Mr McDonnell said there were ""gaping holes"" in the spending plans, with ""nowhere near enough"" allocated to the NHS, schools or local government. About 50% of government spending is planned on a multi-year basis, when it comes to things like public services, such as the NHS, schools or the police, which are unlikely to alter drastically from year to year. Typically, these budgets are set three or four years in advance, in order to help government departments plan their spending more effectively. Tony Bonsignore, political correspondent Government departments are likely to have mixed views about this announcement. On the one hand, some public services - for example, health and the police - may be offered more money. There may also be extra cash to deal with the potential fallout from a no-deal Brexit. The government says this decision is about getting Brexit done and delivering on people's priorities. But the decision also makes it harder for public services to plan for the longer term, as they'll now have to wait another year for the real spending review. There's also the risk that the spending taps might be turned off as quickly as they're turned on. That's Labour's line of attack - they're accusing the government of playing ""dangerous games"" and ""abandoning any pretence of a long-term economic plan"". ""If you're a head teacher or head of a police force, if you're trying to work out who to hire or whether to invest in a piece of equipment, it helps to know what your budget is going to be into the future,"" Ben Zaranko, a research economist with the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC. ""If you have to plan this on a year-to-year basis, it's quite hard."" This time, the spending review will be published in advance of the Budget, which means the chancellor will be making spending plans before he has updated forecasts for the economy, and before he has set tax policy, Mr Zaranko added. One-year spending reviews are not unprecedented. In 2013, the government set the budget for 2015-16, so as to avoid spending decisions going beyond the next election. Chancellor Sajid Javid and Home Secretary Priti Patel were given a tour of Tilbury Docks in early August The IFS's Mr Zaranko said it made sense that the chancellor was unwilling to commit to longer spending plans, because ""we don't know what the economy is going to look like six months down the line, let alone three years"". However, it would make it much harder for government departments to plan for the future. Earlier this year, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary released a report warning that one-year spending reviews would not be good for the police in England. But James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, welcomed the one-year spending round, saying councils ""urgently need some certainty about how local services will be funded next year as they begin their budget-setting process"".

Accused 'moonwalked past victim's family'The mother of a stabbed teenager criticises his family's treatment during a trial over his death.Manchester,"This video can not be played Yousef Makkiâs mum says her family were ""treated like criminals"" The mother of a stabbed teenager has said one of the boys who faced charges relating to her son's death would ""moonwalk"" past her in court. Yousef Makki, 17, was stabbed in the heart in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester, on 2 March. His mum Debbie said she had to share a corridor with two defendants during a trial at Manchester Crown Court. A boy, 17, admitted stabbing Yousef with a flick knife but wascleared of murder and manslaughter. Known in court as Boy A, the teenager pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and possessing a knife andwill spend eight months in custody. Another 17-year-old, known as Boy B, was given a four-month detention and training order after he admitted possessing a knife. Throughout the trial, Mrs Makki said, she would see both defendants outside the courtroom. ""One of them used to moonwalk past us and laugh, the other one just used to smirk at us,"" she said. Mrs Makki said she felt her family was ""treated like criminals"" and were left feeling ""pushed out"" of proceedings. She toldBBC Radio 5 live: ""We were actually shown a video of Yousef dead on the floor and we weren't warned about any of it. ""That picture sticks in my daughter's head forever."" Yousef, who won a scholarship to the prestigious Â£12,000-a-year school, was ""extremely intelligent"", his mother said Mrs Makki said her son, a Manchester Grammar School pupil, was ""made to look like the bad guy"" during the trial. ""The whole case for four weeks was aimed at the fact that these boys were good boys from a good area, as if they were innocent babies, as if they couldn't possibly do anything bad because they weren't from a council estate."" The family was ""shoved upstairs"" in the public gallery to watch the four-week trial ""through a glass window"", Mrs Makki said. This made it difficult to hear proceedings and left them unable to see the accused, she said. ""They're protected like babies with their families next to them and we're told there is no room for us,"" she said. Yousef, from an Anglo-Lebanese family from Burnage, had won a scholarship to the prestigious Â£12,000-a-year school. He was stabbed in the village, which is popular with footballers and celebrities. Mrs Makki described him as ""extremely intelligent, caring, kind"" and ""always true to himself"". ""It is as if a light has gone out,"" she added. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said victims' families were ""offered the use of a private suite and the option of sitting away from a defendant's family"" during cases and headphones were available to help those in the public gallery ""listen to proceedings more clearly"". He added that it was ""a tragic case and our sympathies remain with Mr Makki's family"" and said the department was ""looking at the possibility of putting speakers into the upstairs public gallery"" at the court. Correction 23rd October 2019: An earlier version of this article referred to ""one of the boys on trial"" over the killing of Yousef Makki and this has since been amended to make clear that while both boys faced charges relating to his death, only Boy A faced charges over his killing.

Election-time no-deal 'anti-democratic' - Corbyn,"Jeremy Corbyn has urged the UK's most senior civil servant to intervene to prevent a no-deal Brexit happening during a general election campaign. The Labour leader is concerned that the UK could leave the EU on 31 October, while a campaign is ongoing and before a new government is elected. He has written to Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill saying such a move would be an ""anti-democratic abuse of power"". It comes amid speculation MPs will table a no-confidence motion in the PM. It is thought opposition MPs could propose the vote in a bid to prevent the UK leaving the EU with no deal - leading to a general election being called. Mr Johnson has a working majority in Parliament of just one. What is a vote of no confidence? Still time to stop no-deal, Tory Brexit rebel says Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Is it too late to hold an election before Brexit? The UK will leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. Mr Corbyn said his party would propose a no-confidence vote at an ""appropriate"" time after the Commons returned from its summer recess on 3 September. Election rules say Parliament should be dissolved 25 working days before polling day - so some people are concerned Mr Johnson could allow a no-deal Brexit to happen while MPs are not sitting. Speaking on Friday, Chancellor Sajid Javid told the BBC: ""I'm not speculating on votes of no confidence"". He added that the next general election should take place in 2022 - when it is currently scheduled to take place under UK law. If the PM loses the motion of no-confidence, then under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act he would have another 14 days to win a vote of confidence. If he failed to win such a vote, then a general election would be called on a date advised on by the PM. However, if another candidate could secure the confidence of the Commons, Mr Johnson would be expected to resign and recommend the Queen appoint that person in his place. This could in theory lead to atemporary cross-party government, whose main aim could be to request an extension from the EU and organise an election in the meantime. Lib Dem business spokesman Chuka Umunna said his party was willing to discuss with other parties how a no-deal Brexit might be avoided. However he said it ""isn't a runner"" to expect that Mr Corbyn could lead an interim administration, predicting he would fail to muster the required number of MPs to support him. ""He cannot command a majority among his own MPs, never mind others like Conservative rebels,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Labour's priority is a Labour government, it isn't to stop Brexit,"" he added. The make-up of the House of Commons On Thursday, Mr Johnson was asked whether he would resign if he lost a no-confidence vote. He responded that MPs should ""honour the mandate of the people "" by leaving the EU. Mr Johnson's senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has reportedly told MPs that losing a no-confidence vote would not stop the prime minister taking the UK out of the EU by the October 31 deadline. The Sunday Telegraph,externalreported that he said Mr Johnson could call an election to fall after 31 October, by which time Britain would have left. Brexiteers say Britain's departure from the EU is already set, with Parliament having consented to Brexit when it triggered negotiations under Article 50 and passed legislation thereafter to set the deadline of 31 October. A senior Conservative source accused Jeremy Corbyn of wanting to ignore the result of the 2016 referendum. ""No amount of letter-writing political stunts will change the fact that politicians don't get to choose which public votes they respect,"" the source added. This video can not be played No-deal Brexit: How might it affect the EU? Meanwhile, the government has announced aone-year spending reviewto give government departments ""financial certainty"" as they prepare for Brexit. Chancellor Sajid Javid said a ""fast-tracked"" spending round for 2020-21 would ""clear the ground ahead of Brexit while delivering on people's priorities"". In hisletter to Sir Mark,external, Mr Corbyn called the possibility of calling a general election to fall after Brexit had happened ""unprecedented"" and ""unconstitutional"". He referred to the Cabinet Office's election ""purdah"" guidance - which states that policy decisions on which a new government ""might be expected to want to take a different view"" should be postponed until after the election. Mr Corbyn added that a Labour government would never support a no-deal Brexit, and so would ""want the opportunity to take a different view"". He called on Sir Mark to rule that if the UK was due to leave the EU with no deal during an election, the government should seek another time-limited extension to Article 50. ""Forcing through no-deal against a decision of Parliament, and denying the choice to the voters in a general election already under way, would be an unprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power by a prime minister elected not by the public but by a small number of unrepresentative Conservative Party members,"" he wrote. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said Sir Mark would respond to Mr Corbyn's letter ""in due course"". By Peter Saull, political correspondent In the period before elections there are restrictions on what civil servants can and can't do. The idea is to stop what is, effectively, a caretaker government from implementing decisions that the next government might disagree with. Downing Street would probably argue that those rules don't apply to Brexit. The UK's withdrawal from the EU has been the legal default since MPs voted to trigger Article 50 in March 2017. Nevertheless, purdah rules could limit the government's ability to make last-minute preparations for a no-deal departure. Ministers would not, for example, be able to instruct civil servants to start a new public information campaign. Of course, all of this is uncharted territory and no-one knows for sure quite how it will all pan out. Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?

Farmers union rejects no-deal cattle cull claim,"The Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) has rejected claims that 45,000 dairy cows will be culled in Northern Ireland as part of a no-deal Brexit. BBC Newsnight reported that senior industry figures believe cows could be culledin the event of a no-deal Brexit, if new higher tariffs are applied to British milk. UFU president Ivor Ferguson said it was ""scare tactics"". The Department of Agriculture said it was not planning a cull of animals. Mr Ferguson said: ""We certainly don't anticipate culling dairy cows."" He told BBC Radio Ulster's Stephen Nolan Show that the figure of 45,000 cows appeared to have been ""plucked out of the air"". ""I don't agree with it and nobody in the Ulster Farmers' Union would agree with it,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said:  ""We are not planning a cull of animals; rather we are exploring ways to support industry through contingency measures and potential funding streams."" The spokesperson added DAERA had ""recruited additional resources and trained existing staff"" in anticipation of significant demand for export health certificates. Ulster Farmers' Union president Ivor Ferguson said the group has warned that a no-deal Brexit would be ""disastrous"" for farmers About 800 million litres of milk are processed in the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland each year. According to BBC Newsnight, the fear among producers in Northern Ireland is that, if no agreement is reached and traditional trading relationships with the south become difficult, the country will be left with a glut of milk that it will not be able to process or sell. Mr Ferguson said the UFU has been in contact with politicians, both locally and in Westminster, ""to make our case that a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous for farmers"". ""Farmers' reserves are at their lowest now because farming hasn't been profitable this year in a lot of the sectors,"" he said. ""If milk had to face a tariff, the only way that milk would go across the border would be if the government stepped up and paid a tariff, and that's assuming the Republic of Ireland would accept the milk.

Accused 'moonwalked past victim's family',"This video can not be played Yousef Makkiâs mum says her family were ""treated like criminals"" The mother of a stabbed teenager has said one of the boys who faced charges relating to her son's death would ""moonwalk"" past her in court. Yousef Makki, 17, was stabbed in the heart in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester, on 2 March. His mum Debbie said she had to share a corridor with two defendants during a trial at Manchester Crown Court. A boy, 17, admitted stabbing Yousef with a flick knife but wascleared of murder and manslaughter. Known in court as Boy A, the teenager pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and possessing a knife andwill spend eight months in custody. Another 17-year-old, known as Boy B, was given a four-month detention and training order after he admitted possessing a knife. Throughout the trial, Mrs Makki said, she would see both defendants outside the courtroom. ""One of them used to moonwalk past us and laugh, the other one just used to smirk at us,"" she said. Mrs Makki said she felt her family was ""treated like criminals"" and were left feeling ""pushed out"" of proceedings. She toldBBC Radio 5 live: ""We were actually shown a video of Yousef dead on the floor and we weren't warned about any of it. ""That picture sticks in my daughter's head forever."" Yousef, who won a scholarship to the prestigious Â£12,000-a-year school, was ""extremely intelligent"", his mother said Mrs Makki said her son, a Manchester Grammar School pupil, was ""made to look like the bad guy"" during the trial. ""The whole case for four weeks was aimed at the fact that these boys were good boys from a good area, as if they were innocent babies, as if they couldn't possibly do anything bad because they weren't from a council estate."" The family was ""shoved upstairs"" in the public gallery to watch the four-week trial ""through a glass window"", Mrs Makki said. This made it difficult to hear proceedings and left them unable to see the accused, she said. ""They're protected like babies with their families next to them and we're told there is no room for us,"" she said. Yousef, from an Anglo-Lebanese family from Burnage, had won a scholarship to the prestigious Â£12,000-a-year school. He was stabbed in the village, which is popular with footballers and celebrities. Mrs Makki described him as ""extremely intelligent, caring, kind"" and ""always true to himself"". ""It is as if a light has gone out,"" she added. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said victims' families were ""offered the use of a private suite and the option of sitting away from a defendant's family"" during cases and headphones were available to help those in the public gallery ""listen to proceedings more clearly"". He added that it was ""a tragic case and our sympathies remain with Mr Makki's family"" and said the department was ""looking at the possibility of putting speakers into the upstairs public gallery"" at the court. Correction 23rd October 2019: An earlier version of this article referred to ""one of the boys on trial"" over the killing of Yousef Makki and this has since been amended to make clear that while both boys faced charges relating to his death, only Boy A faced charges over his killing.

Privacy law 'hack' exposed fiancee's personal data,"GDPR is supposed to protect personal data, but this experiment used the law to help achieve the opposite effect About one in four companies revealed personal information to a woman's partner, who had made a bogus demand for the data by citing an EU privacy law. The security expert contacted dozens of UK and US-based firms to test how they would handle a ""right of access"" request made in someone else's name. In each case, he asked for all the data that they held on his fiancee. In one case, the response included the results of a criminal activity check. Other replies included credit card information, travel details, account logins and passwords, and the target's full US social security number. University of Oxford-based researcher James Pavur has presented his findings at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas. It is one of the first tests of its kind to exploit theEU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),external, which came into force in May 2018. The law shortened the time organisations had to respond to data requests, added new types of information they have to provide, and increased the potential penalty for non-compliance. ""Generally if it was an extremely large company - especially tech ones - they tended to do really well,"" he told the BBC. ""Small companies tended to ignore me. ""But the kind of mid-sized businesses that knew about GDPR, but maybe didn't have much of a specialised process [to handle requests], failed."" He declined to identify the organisations that had mishandled the requests, but said they had included: a UK hotel chain that shared a complete record of his partner's overnight stays two UK rail companies that provided records of all the journeys she had taken with them over several years a US-based educational company that handed over her high school grades, mother's maiden name and the results of a criminal background check survey Mr Pavur has, however, named some of the companies that he said had performed well. Mr Pavur says he believes he did not break the law himself while conducting the trial He said they included: the supermarket Tesco, which had demanded a photo ID the domestic retail chain Bed Bath and Beyond, which had insisted on a telephone interview American Airlines, which had spotted that he had uploaded a blank image to the passport field of its online form One independent expert said the findings were a ""real concern"". ""Sending someone's personal information to the wrong person is as much a data breach as leaving an unencrypted USB drive lying around, or forgetting to shred confidential papers,"" said Dr Steven Murdoch, from University College London. Mr Pavur's bride-to-be gave him permission to carry out the tests and helped write up the findings, but otherwise did not participate in the operation. So for correspondence, the researcher created a fake email address for his partner, in the format ""first name-middle initial-last name@gmail.com"". Anaccompanying letter said that under GDPR,,externalthe recipient had one month to respond. It added that he could provide additional identity documents via a ""secure online portal"" if required. This was a deliberate deception since he believed many businesses lacked such a facility and would not have time to create one. Google reveals fistful of flaws in Apple's iMessage app Gay dating apps still leaking location data WhatsApp flaw 'puts words in your mouth' The attacks were carried out in two waves. For the first half of those contacted, he used only the information detailed above. But for the second batch, he drew on personal details revealed by the first group to answer follow-up questions. The idea, he said, was to replicate the kind of attack that could be carried out by someone starting with just the details found on a basic LinkedIn page or other online public profile. If the organisation asked for a ""strong"" type of ID - such as a passport or driver's licence scan - Mr Pavur declined. He also decided not to create forgeries of more easily faked documents. So, for example, he would not sign documents saying he was the data subject. Nor would he send emails with spoofed headers when asked to write from the victim's registered account. But he did try to convince the companies to accept documents that would theoretically be easy to mock up, but in this case could be sourced from his fiancee. So, when one train operator asked for a photocopy of a passport, he convinced it instead to accept a postmarked envelope addressed to the ""victim"". In another case, a cyber-security company agreed to accept a photograph of a bank statement, which had been blacked out so that the only information left on view was the target's name and address. Mr Pavur says that in one case he a heavily redacted bank statement was accepted Sometimes such subterfuge was unnecessary. One online gaming company asked for the applicant's account password. But on being told that it had been forgotten, Mr Pavur said it disclosed his fiancee's personal data anyway without asking for alternative verification. Mr Pavur said that a total of 60 distinct pieces of personal information about his girlfriend were ultimately exposed. These included a list of past purchases, 10 digits of her credit card number, its expiry date and issuer, and her past and present addresses. In addition, one threat intelligence firm provided a record of breached usernames and passwords it held on his partner. These still worked on at least 10 online services as she had used the same logins for multiple sites. In one case, the GDPR request letter was posted to the internet after being sent to an advertising company, constituting a data breach in itself. It contained the fiancee's name, address, email and phone number. ""Luckily it only had very simple data,"" said Mr Pavur. ""But you could imagine someone sending a letter with more detailed information."" Overall, of the 83 firms known to have held data about his partner, Mr Pavur said: 24% supplied personal information without verifying the requester's identity 16% requested an easily forged type of ID that he did not provide 39% asked for a ""strong"" type of ID 5% said they had no data to share, even though the fiancee had an account controlled by them 3% misinterpreted the request and said they had deleted all her data 13% ignored the request altogether WhatsApp flaw 'puts words in your mouth' Gay dating apps still leaking location data Los Angeles mayor giving update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

PM calls for 'common sense' Brexit compromise,"This video can not be played PM: EU should show 'common sense' on Brexit The EU should show ""common sense"" and agree to make changes to the Brexit withdrawal deal, Boris Johnson has told the BBC. The prime minister said there was ""bags of time"" for the EU to compromise on the Irish border backstop plan before the Brexit deadline of 31 October. He also warned MPs not to oppose Brexit, and to respect the 2016 referendum result. The EU has said repeatedly the backstop arrangements cannot be changed. Mr Johnson said the policy - designed to guarantee there will not be a hard Irish border after Brexit - would turn the UK into a ""satellite state"" of the EU if it came into effect. Speaking during a visit to Oxfordshire, he said the arrangements would ""keep us locked in EU regulatory orbit, locked in the EU trading system, unable to control our own laws"". ""We need change on that, once we get change on that I think we're at the races, and I think there's a good deal to be done."" Gove: EU 'refusing to negotiate' on Brexit Johnson 'absolutely' rules out early election Could there be an early general election? Theresa May's deal has been rejected three times by MPs and as things stand, the UK will leave the EU on 31 October whether it has agreed a new one or not. Many of those who voted against the deal had concerns over the backstop, which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. The prime minister's comments come amid growing speculation that opposition MPs will table a vote of no confidence in the government in a move to try and stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour will table a no-confidence vote at an ""appropriate"" time, once MPs return from the summer break in September. What is a vote of no confidence? According to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Johnson's senior advisor at No 10, Dominic Cummings, has told MPs even losing such a vote could not stop the PM taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Hereportedly saidMr Johnson could call an election for after the deadline, with Brexit taking place in the meantime. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. On Wednesday, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would expect Mr Johnson to step aside if he lost a no-confidence vote. ""No prime minister can sustain themselves in office when they no longer have a majority in the Commons"", he said, speaking at the Edinburgh Festival. ""I don't want to drag the Queen into this, but I would be sending Jeremy Corbyn in a cab to Buckingham Palace to say 'we're taking over'."" Asked whether he would resign in those circumstances, Mr Johnson said MPs should ensure Brexit takes place by the end of October. ""What MPs should do and what they've already voted to do, when triggering Article 50 and reconfirmed several times, is honour the mandate of the people"", he said. On Tuesday cabinet minister Michael Gove accused the EU of ""refusing to negotiate with the UK"" over a new Brexit deal. The European Commission said it was willing to hold further talks, ""should the UK wish to clarify its position"".

"Venice bans large cruise ships from historic centreThe move follows an accident in June in which a cruise ship collided with a dock, injuring five people.Europe","Demonstrators protest against the passage of cruise ships in parts of Venice Large cruise ships are to be banned from entering Venice's historic centre, the Italian government says. Ships weighing more than 1,000 tonnes will be rerouted away from certain waterways from September. The move follows an accident in June in which a ship collided with a dock, injuring five people. But conservationists say the government's plans are insufficient to prevent underwater erosion and pollution in the lagoon city. This video can not be played The MSC Opera, its horns blaring, crashes into a boat moored at a wharf in San Basilio-Zattere. Starting from next month, some liners will be forced to dock at the Fusina and Lombardia terminals away from the city centre,the Financial Times reported,external. By the end of 2020, a third of all ships will be rerouted. Critics have long said waves created by cruise ships on the canal erode the foundations of the city, which regularly suffers from flooding. Others have also complained that they detract from the beauty of Venice's historic sites and bring in too many tourists. But the June accident, in whichthe MSC Opera - a 275m (900ft) long ship - collided with a dock and a small tourist boatin the city's Giudecca canal, galvanised protesters to call for a definitive ban.

Plant-based diet can fight climate change - UN,"Vegan burgers are now a fixture on many restaurant menus Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, UN experts have said. A major report on land use and climate change says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global warming. But scientists and officials stopped short of explicitly calling on everyone to become vegan or vegetarian. They said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat. The document, prepared by 107 scientists for the UN'sIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),external, says that if land is used more effectively, it can store more of the carbon emitted by humans. It was finalised following discussions held here in Geneva, Switzerland. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Twelve years to save Earth? Make that 18 months... Meat, veg, nuts - a diet designed to feed 10bn What is climate change? 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA ""We're not telling people to stop eating meat. In some places people have no other choice. But it's obvious that in the West we're eating far too much,"" said Prof Pete Smith, an environmental scientist from Aberdeen University, UK. We're also wasting too much food. The panel estimates that greenhouse emissions associated with food loss and waste - from field to kitchen bin - is as high as 8-10% of ALL global emissions. The report calls for vigorous action to halt soil damage and desertification - both of which contribute to climate change. Road-testing the diet to save the world Make-me-a-vegan-the-verdict The questions everyone's asking Google about veganism It also warns that plans by some governments to grow trees and burn them to generate electricity will compete with food production unless carried out on a limited scale. The Earth's land surface, and the way it is used, forms the basis for human society and the global economy. But we are re-shaping it in dramatic ways, including through the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. How the land responds to human-induced climate change is a vital concern for the future. This video can not be played Gases produced by livestock are a major factor in global warming, so should we change our eating habits? Climate change poses a threat to the security of our food supply. Rising temperatures, increased rain and more extreme weather events will all have an impact on crops and livestock. But food production also contributes to global warming. Agriculture - together with forestry - accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock rearing contributes to global warming through the methane gas the animals produce, but also via deforestation to expand pastures, for example. Climate change: German MPs want higher meat tax The environmental impact of meat production is important to many vegetarians and vegans. A UK-based group called #NoBeef lobbies caterers to take beef and lamb off student menus. In the US, vegan burger patties are made from plant-based meat substitutes said to taste like the real thing thanks to an iron-rich compound called heme. Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Peter Stevenson, from Compassion in World Farming, said: ""A reduction in meat consumption is essential if we are to meet climate targets."" But in some parts of the world, such as China, beef consumption is growing. This is despite attempts by the Chinese central government to promote traditional diets. Geneva-based company Partage is helping tackle waste by taking in unsold food The authors of the report encourage action to stop wasting food - either before or after its sale to consumers. Waste food can sometimes be used as animal feed or, if suitable, redirected to charities to feed people in need. One organisation here in Switzerland called Partage takes in unsold food discarded by shops and distributes it to local families. It also collects stale bread and turns it into biscuits, dries fruit, and cans vegetables. All of this helps reduce the CO2 emissions involved in producing food. July was 'marginally' world's warmest month ever Hungry nations add the least to global CO2 Stop abusing land, scientists warn Road-testing the diet to save the world Extra atmospheric carbon can nourish forests, but there comes a point where they are overwhelmed The extra carbon that humans have put into the atmosphere is nourishing the growth of forests - especially in the Northern Hemisphere. This can help to mitigate climate change, but it all comes down to a balance of factors. Experts say this effect on forests will be negated if the Earth heats up too much. In fact, the report says areas near the equator may already be losing vegetation through heat stress. Dr Katrin Fleischer, from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, warned that in some places a shortage of phosphorus in soil - a key ingredient for plant growth - would also hinder tree growth. She said: ""This would mean that the rainforest has already reached its limit and would be unable to absorb any more carbon dioxide emissions. ""If this scenario turns out to be true, the Earth's climate would heat up significantly faster."" Soil is sometimes neglected as part of the climate system. But it's the second largest store of carbon after the oceans. Plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and lock the carbon away in the soil. But deforestation and poor farming practices can damage its ability to do this. When soil is degraded, carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, while further plant growth is compromised. Climate change is expected to speed this process up. Higher temperatures can help break down the organic matter in soil, boosting greenhouse emissions. The report says reducing and reversing soil damage provides immediate benefits to local communities. Better land management, including controlled grazing by animals and tree planting, can boost soil fertility, helping to reduce poverty and boost food security. ""It's really clear that the land's being degraded through over-exploitation - and that's making climate change worse,"" said Prof Smith. ""The land is part of the problem but if we wise up about the way we use it, it can part of the climate solution."" Changing the way humans use the land surface is a daunting challenge, especially as it will entail a major shift in farming methods. Nevertheless, scientists say people need to: Protect natural forest, particularly in the tropics Eat less red meat and more vegetables Safeguard and restore peatlands Encourage ""agroforestry"", where food crops are mixed in with trees Improve crop varieties But one practice touted as a climate change solution - bioenergy - has been treated with caution by IPCC experts. Bioenergy involves burning vegetation as a substitute for fossil fuels. To some countries, it appears to be an attractive option because CO2 emissions from the process can be captured. Interactive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the world The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts bioenergy will outpace solar, wind and hydropower in the next five years. But the authors of the IPCC report say converting land to bioenergy could deprive countries of soil to grow much-needed crops. They advise limits on the amount of land used for biofuels.

Warnings after 'vagina steaming' burns woman,"Gynaecologists are warning of the potential risks of vaginal steaming after it emerged a Canadian woman burned herself attempting one. A case study, involving a 62-year-old, was published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada. The woman had been suffering from a prolapsed vagina and believed the treatment could help avoid surgery. Vaginal steaming, which involves sitting over a hot water and herb mix, has seen a growth in popularity. It and other treatments for intimate areas, including vulva facials, are now available at some salons and spas. The LA Times first reported on the steaming trend in 2010,,externaland it later gained widespread attention when Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand recommended it. Last year, US model Chrissy Teigen also shared a photograph of herself undergoing the treatment. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Experts, however, warn it can be dangerous and say there is no proven medical evidence for the health claims being made, including that steaming can ease period pains or help with fertility. Dr Vanessa Mackay, a consultant and spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, says it is a ""myth"" that the vagina requires extensive cleaning or treatment.

Accused 'moonwalked past victim's family'The mother of a stabbed teenager criticises his family's treatment during a trial over his death.,"This video can not be played Yousef Makkiâs mum says her family were ""treated like criminals"" The mother of a stabbed teenager has said one of the boys who faced charges relating to her son's death would ""moonwalk"" past her in court. Yousef Makki, 17, was stabbed in the heart in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester, on 2 March. His mum Debbie said she had to share a corridor with two defendants during a trial at Manchester Crown Court. A boy, 17, admitted stabbing Yousef with a flick knife but wascleared of murder and manslaughter. Known in court as Boy A, the teenager pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and possessing a knife andwill spend eight months in custody. Another 17-year-old, known as Boy B, was given a four-month detention and training order after he admitted possessing a knife. Throughout the trial, Mrs Makki said, she would see both defendants outside the courtroom. ""One of them used to moonwalk past us and laugh, the other one just used to smirk at us,"" she said. Mrs Makki said she felt her family was ""treated like criminals"" and were left feeling ""pushed out"" of proceedings. She toldBBC Radio 5 live: ""We were actually shown a video of Yousef dead on the floor and we weren't warned about any of it. ""That picture sticks in my daughter's head forever."" Yousef, who won a scholarship to the prestigious Â£12,000-a-year school, was ""extremely intelligent"", his mother said Mrs Makki said her son, a Manchester Grammar School pupil, was ""made to look like the bad guy"" during the trial. ""The whole case for four weeks was aimed at the fact that these boys were good boys from a good area, as if they were innocent babies, as if they couldn't possibly do anything bad because they weren't from a council estate."" The family was ""shoved upstairs"" in the public gallery to watch the four-week trial ""through a glass window"", Mrs Makki said. This made it difficult to hear proceedings and left them unable to see the accused, she said. ""They're protected like babies with their families next to them and we're told there is no room for us,"" she said. Yousef, from an Anglo-Lebanese family from Burnage, had won a scholarship to the prestigious Â£12,000-a-year school. He was stabbed in the village, which is popular with footballers and celebrities. Mrs Makki described him as ""extremely intelligent, caring, kind"" and ""always true to himself"". ""It is as if a light has gone out,"" she added. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said victims' families were ""offered the use of a private suite and the option of sitting away from a defendant's family"" during cases and headphones were available to help those in the public gallery ""listen to proceedings more clearly"". He added that it was ""a tragic case and our sympathies remain with Mr Makki's family"" and said the department was ""looking at the possibility of putting speakers into the upstairs public gallery"" at the court. Correction 23rd October 2019: An earlier version of this article referred to ""one of the boys on trial"" over the killing of Yousef Makki and this has since been amended to make clear that while both boys faced charges relating to his death, only Boy A faced charges over his killing.

New cars 'can be broken into in 10 seconds',"Some of the UK's newest and most popular cars are at risk of being stolen in seconds by exploiting weaknesses in keyless entry systems. The systems let drivers open and start their cars without taking their key out of their pocket. What Car? magazine tested seven different car models,externalfitted with keyless entry and start systems. A DS 3 Crossback and Audi TT RS were taken in 10 seconds, and a Land Rover Discovery Sport TD4 180 HSE in 30. What Car? security experts performed the tests using the same specialist technology operated by thieves. Hundreds of popular cars 'at risk of keyless theft' They measured the time it took to get into the cars and drive them away. Car theft rates in England and Wales have reached an eight-year high. In 2018, more than 106,000 vehicles were stolen. And motor theft insurance claim payoutshit their highest level in seven yearsat the start of 2019. The Association of British Insurers said claims for January to March were higher than for any quarter since 2012. It said a rise in keyless car crime was partly to blame, but did not have figures on what proportion of claims were for keyless vehicles. Audi's parent company, the VW Group, said it collaborated with police and insurers as part of its ""continual"" work to improve security measures. This video can not be played ""Relay attacks"" - how they work and how to stop them The PSA Group - the parent company of DS -told What Car?,externalit had a team dedicated to treating potential security weaknesses and worked closely with police to ""analyse theft methods"". It also said dealers could deactivate the keyless entry systems on the latest cars at the owner's request. Jaguar Land Rover said: ""The Discovery Sport model tested is no longer in production. The current Discovery Sport produced today features technology which prevents relay attack. ""In addition, all our vehicles are available with InControl tracking devices which have delivered a more than 80% success of recovery."" Stephen Savigar, 59, from Newport, South Wales, was on his way to Heathrow Airport with his wife and two friends when they became victims of keyless car theft. The couples were flying to Singapore for a cruise to celebrate his wife and her friend's 60th birthdays. The thieves struck when they stopped for a toilet break at Reading services. Mr Savigar's Ford Mondeo was not stolen, but what was taken from the car almost ended their holiday on the spot. ""While we were inside thieves jammed my car's locking system,"" he said. ""They stole my travel bag which had mine and my wife's passports inside, as well as our glasses and an iPad. Steven Savigar and his wife Kim, managed to have their cruise holiday despite losing passports and an ipad to car thieves ""It meant we were unable to fly. But we still dropped our friends to the airport and waved them off at the desk. My wife ended up passing out at the desk as we were in a terrible state."" The couple drove home, went to the passport office, travelled back to Heathrow the next day, and paid for another flight with a different airline. They made it to Singapore just in time to catch the cruise. Five months later Mr Savigar said he still felt upset talking about it. ""It was an absolutely horrific experience. We had been planning this trip for two years. It's a horrendous crime."" Andrew from North London had his keyless Mercedes c220 stolen from outside his home in November last year. ""The vehicle had keyless entry and my keys were not even near the front door,"" he told the BBC. The vehicle is still missing and Andrew said Mercedes has not been able to explain how this happened. He said: ""I was given the line by Mercedes that if I double tap my key when locking the vehicle it will be safe as the key does not transmit. For me that was standard practice, I had known about this function, the key was on the third floor at the back of my house. ""I believe people are being misled when manufacturers say vehicles are even more safe. According to my insurance there had been more than 10 cars stolen with keyless entry in my postcode in London alone , in that month."" Thieves, normally working in pairs, will target a car parked outside a house. One criminal will hold a device close to the car that boosts the signal meant for the key, while the other thief will stand close to the house with another device that relays that signal to the key, fooling the system. Once the cars have been broken into, they will be stripped for parts, police say. Car manufacturers have begun introducing new technologies to prevent keyless theft, such as motion detection technology. What Car? was unable to break into cars that had motion detection installed as a safety measure, however the technology is not available across the car market.

More children back in school during the holidays,"This video can not be played ""It has become the heart and soul of what our school is about"" A growing number of primary schools are keeping their doors open during the summer holidays. Funded by the Wales-wide School Holiday Enrichment Programme (Shep), children receive breakfast and lunch and lessons are replaced by sports and activities. Kath Newman said her nine-year-old daughter Carianne ""absolutely loves"" going back to her Ebbw Vale primary school over the summer. Ms Newman said the scheme had ""saved"" her family after financial struggles. The number of schools offering the programme has risen by 43% this year. ""It started last year - my husband has ongoing problems and had four major surgeries, and money is an issue,"" explained Ms Newman. ""So we were really, really struggling and it was a case of feeding the children and going without ourselves. We heard about this programme and it has really saved us because it is a long time."" Kath Newman (centre) with her husband Chris, youngest daughter Carianne, son Dan, and eldest daughter Maddy One teacher in Barry said the scheme had become ""the heart and soul of what our school is about"". ""Our children and our families need us to be there, not just during term time and not just in the traditional way,"" said Janet Hayward, head teacher of Cadoxton Primary, in Barry. Like 75 other primary schools around Wales, Mrs Hayward and her learning assistants welcome children back for three weeks during the holidays. The school is in a ward in Barry where the latest figures estimate 31% are classed as living in child poverty - above the Wales average of 29.3%. Funding for the project is available to schools where more than 16% of pupils are entitled to free school meals. But once running, the programme is open to all children in the school, whatever their circumstances. Children can take part in a range of activities, such as baking Almost 2,500 children took part in Shep last year. This month, 3,700 are expected to pass through school gates usually locked for six weeks. It is a response to growing concern about some children not getting a healthy diet outside term time. Isolation and a lack of stimulation over the summer might also contribute to a growing attainment gap, say supporters of the scheme. 'Holiday hunger' fears for food banks 'My five-year-old searched bins for food' Wales only UK nation to see child poverty rise Under fives 'may never catch up' Ms Newman said it had ""made such a difference"" to Carianne's wellbeing. ""This year things have improved but she still loves going. She learns about healthy eating and it is something to do to break up the long holiday,"" she said. ""She gets to mix with new friends and they do a daily mile every morning and they can choose to walk or jog. They teach them about cooking and go on trips to the local park. ""They even brought owls in yesterday from a local owl sanctuary. It's absolutely brilliant,"" she toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales. But the Â£900,000 spent by the Welsh Government this year is nowhere near enough to reach all the children in need, says the Bevan Foundation think-tank. In a report on the ""national scandal"" of holiday hunger,external, it says guaranteeing a place for a quarter of children eligible for free school meals would cost Â£4.75m. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We have increased funding for the School Holiday Enrichment Programme by Â£400,000 to Â£900,000 this year, which includes Â£100,000 for a new pilot based on play and community based settings.""

"LiveLivePremier League transfer deadline dayFollow all the latest deals as they happen, with transfers still being completed after the 17:00 BST deadline.BBC Sport","Transfer window closed Tottenham sign Fulham winger Sessegnon for Â£25m & Betis midfielder Lo Celso on loan Arsenal sign Tierney for Â£25m and Luiz for Â£8m Everton sign Iwobi for fee which could rise to Â£34m Inter Milan sign Lukaku from Man Utd for Â£74m Free agent Carroll returns to Newcastle Shamoon Hafez We settled down here at 06:00 BST, 15-and-a-half hours later we come to a close. Premier League clubs made a total of 16 signings on transfer deadline day. The biggest deals includ:  Head here to see the full list of deals Just one sleep to go for the start of the new Premier League season. We are back on Friday as last season's runners-up Liverpool start the campaign against newly promoted Norwich. Until then. Waited long enough for Everton to announce Alex Iwobi, but yet to hear word from Southampton on the signing of 20-year-old defender Kevin Danso from Augsburg. We'll leave it there, what a cracking day it has been. Everton
manager Marco Silva said: âAlex was one of our main targets for this window and
I believe he is a fantastic signing for Everton. He is a direct and skilful
winger and attacking midfielder who always works very hard for his team. âHe
is still young but already with a lot of top-level experience â 100 Premier
League matches, more in Europe and many international games. âIt
was important for me to have one more quality option for our attacking
positions to add to what we have with Richarlison, Bernard and Theo Walcott. âAlex
fits exactly the profile of player I want in my model. He is hungry to join
Everton and take the next step in his career, to help us compete with the
strongest teams in the league and reach his potential at our club.â Hah, nicely done Everton. Was it my tweet that made you get a wriggle on? #IwobiAnnounced Allow Twitter content?

FINALLY, here it is Everton have signed 23-year-old forward Alex Iwobi from Arsenal for a fee believed to be Â£28m, rising to Â£34m with potential add-ons.  GUESS WHATTTT........!! Ian DennisRadio 5 live senior football reporter Ryan Sessegnon is a player we didn't see the best of last season at Fulham but he's an exciting player who can play left-back and left wing. I think Mauricio Pochettino will get the best out of him for Tottenham. Spurs didn't make a signing for ages, then brought in Tanguy Ndombele earlier this summer. They went a bit crazy on deadline day with the two transfers of Giovani lo Celso (got an email at work today saying it's pronounced 'LO CHEL-SO'), as well as Ryan Sessegnon.

If you've been wondering about who held the transfer record for a Scottish player before Kieran Tierney and Ollie McBurnie (20:30)... Well if you can remember back a couple of years to 2017, Oliver Burke switched from RB Leipzig to West Brom for a reported fee of Â£15m, a year after moving to Germany for a fee of about Â£13m in August 2016. Prior to that......it was the one and only Ross McCormack who moved from Fulham to Aston Villa for Â£12m also in 2016. The forward signed a four-year contract at Villa Park but made just 22 appearances for the club. #bbcfootball or text on 81111 (UK only) Stephen:David Luiz given the no.23 shirt. Can anyone guess another famous Arsenal centre-back who wore no.23?  Spurs fans are welcome to have a guess. Answer... #bbcfootball or text on 81111 (UK only) Will Rocha-Thomas:Good luck to Andy Carroll, I hope Newcastle have actually got shorts and socks for him...he might actually play you know. Ian DennisRadio 5 live senior football reporter Andy Carroll going back to Newcastle United has been talked about for a number of years. He's had a chequered past but the thing is he's still only 30 but if they can get him fit, he could still make an impact. It's his boyhood club and he'll have the incentive to look after his body. Been hitting F5 on Everton's Twitter feed for 45 minutes now. Still no Alex Iwobi update. Andy TownsendEx-Chelsea midfielder on BBC Radio 5 live I'm really looking forward to seeing Mason Greenwood and whether he is genuinely good enough to do what Marcus Rashford did not that long ago and make people think 'wow'. People will criticise Manchester United and Ed Woodward heavily but I think what they have done this summer is what they wanted to do. They wanted to go back to kind of a retro feel and look to a British corer of player that might help them on the road to recovery. Manchester United had a terrible season last time out, finishing in lowly sixth place. They have added Harry Maguire for a world record fee for a defender, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James. But an unbalanced squad now has seven centre-backs and they look light in midfield with no replacement brought in for Marouane Fellaini or Ander Herrera. Good window or bad? Hit the thumbs. Steven ThompsonFormer Scotland striker on BBC Radio 5 Live I don't know what is cheap or not in the current market but Kieran Tierney has been a very impressive player for Celtic. He's been a major part in their success, whenever he makes the step up into Champions League or international games he's always looked comfortable. He's a top, top player. Celtic are a massive club but he's going to a huge stage and I don't think it will phase him. Arsenal have got themselves a top player. Allow Twitter content?

Liverpool pushed Manchester City all the way in the Premier League title race last season but fell agonisingly short. No big signings have been brought in, Jurgen Klopp preferring to stick with the hand that took him to the Champions League title. Good for continuity or should deals have been made? Thumbs up for good transfer window, down for for bad. Andy TownsendEx-Chelsea midfielder on BBC Radio 5 live If you'd been a Crystal Palace fan this morning and Wilfried Zaha was going you'd have been waking up thinking 'who is going to bail us out at the weekend, drive into the box and win a penalty, who is going to create those situations out of nothing?' I think Roy Hodgson will be pleased he's got his player. His work starts now getting on top of Zaha's disappointment. Work on his mind and get him right attitude wise so he gives his very best for Palace. Zaha will be very disappointed right now and they have to pick him up and get him back into gear. Â© 2025 BBC.

Nationwide customers refunded Â£6m in charges,"Thousands of Nationwide's overdraft customers are being refunded Â£6m after the building society failed to send them the correct text warnings. Bank customers must receive a text alert before they are charged for entering unarranged overdrafts. A total of 320,000 customers were affected and are now in line for a reimbursement of the charges. The refunds come as Nationwide deals with a separate technical error, when payments appear to be taken twice. Customers have expressed anger on social media over the errors, which meant account balances looked too low. Thousands have been affected, and the building society has apologised.

On a bad day for the building society, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced that Nationwide had broken rules over text alerts 20 times since February last year. The warnings are supposed to give customers time to take action to avoid unexpected overdraft charges. In the majority of cases, Nationwide failed to make it clear in texts that customers could incur charges if they did not take any action. ""Nationwide failed to do this on numerous occasions and our action today makes it clear they must fix this as a matter of urgency. It is imperative that these problems are sorted out immediately and that they don't occur again,"" said Adam Land from the CMA. The building society apologised and said the wording was corrected in November 2018, while additional controls would ensure this did not happen again. The CMA does not have the authority to fine companies which breach the rules, although it is calling on the government to bolster its powers. Some angry customers have been threatening to leave Nationwide over a fault that suggested they had less money in their accounts than should have been the case. The error meant some customers appeared to have made payments twice, with one completed, and a duplicate marked as a pending transaction. One customer believed they had just Â£2.98 left in their account, while another appeared to be overdrawn even though he did not have an overdraft facility. Another customer, Iwan Edwards, said he was charged twice for a Â£12,543 payment for a new car, and did not know what was going on for 12 hours. Clare Jones, from Kidderminster, was paying Â£2,000 towards a holiday, but the sum appeared to have been taken out twice. ""I went to buy something online, but it said my bank wouldn't authorise payment. I looked online and it said we were about Â£2,000 overdrawn,"" she said. ""They said there was nothing they could do, they left us with no money."" A Nationwide spokeswoman said: ""Yesterday evening, we identified a problem that meant the available balance on some member accounts appeared lower than they should, due to some payments still showing as pending. ""This was corrected overnight and everything is now working normally. We apologise to those members affected and can assure them that they won't incur any charges as a result of this issue.""

'No-one talks about women carrying knives'An average of 125 knife possession offences involving women and girls are recorded in England each month.UK,"This video can not be played 'My boyfriend bought me knives' Knife possession offences involving women in England have increased steeply since 2014 - rising by at least 10% every year, police figures show. Some 1,509 offences were recorded in 2018 - an increase of 73% over the last five years - data obtained following freedom of information requests shows. Youth workers say some women carry weapons for gangs as they are less likely to be stopped by police. The Home Office said it funds schemes to help gang-affected women and girls. Figures for England show that between 2014 and 2018 there were more than 5,800 recorded knife possession crimes involving women. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Are more teenagers carrying knives? 'Thousands' of 14-year-olds carry knives The BBC contacted the four police forces in Wales but the figures are incomplete. Police Scotland and Police Northern Ireland figures were unavailable. It comes against a backdrop of rising knife crime nationally and after the number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales was last year thehighest number since records began. Some 1,509 knife possession offences involving women were recorded in 2018 West Midlands Police found a gun, bullets and a knife in a designer handbag after searching a car Data from 38 forces out of 39 in England shows almost a quarter of recorded offences involved girls under the age of 18 - with the youngest aged seven. While London's Metropolitan Police saw the highest number of possession cases involving women, parts of northern England have seen female knife possession crimes increase at a faster rate. London's Metropolitan Police recorded a 52% increase over five years, with a total of 916 recorded offences from 2014 to 2018. During the same time, Merseyside Police saw a 54% rise, to 499 offences, while the number of offences in Greater Manchester doubled, with 95 recorded offences last year. In South Yorkshire there was an 82% rise over five years - with 248 offences involving women. Theresa John regularly carried a knife for 12 years. She said it ""became part of my identity"" on the streets in Essex. ""I used to name my knives. When I was 16 I had one that was like a flick Stanley blade and I used to call it Uncle Stan. Fatal stabbings at record high Who are the first 100 stabbing victims of 2019? ""If anyone asked me 'have you got Unc on you', I'd be like 'yeah'. That was my pet until I was 21."" After a chaotic and difficult childhood, Theresa's life spiralled out of control. In her early 20s she became addicted to heroin and crack cocaine and worked as a prostitute to fund her addiction. Theresa says she regularly carried a knife for 12 years ""I'd either have a knife or a pair of scissors because when I was out working on the streets. There would be different guys who would force you to do stuff. ""I stayed in this lifestyle of crime and madness and just brokenness. I was in a very abusive relationship to the point that my kids were taken into care and at that point I just lost all hope. ""I started taking heroin, I was out on the streets working in prostitution. I used to get in a lot of fights - there was a lot of violence."" One night, the scissors were used as a weapon on her and a man stabbed her in the back of the head. And in 2012, Theresa stabbed her next door neighbour and was sentenced to 10 months in prison for actual bodily harm and possession of a knife. Now 35 years old, she says: ""It was like this mist came over me and I charged at her with the knife, and just stabbed her straight in the top of her head."" Jennifer Blake is a former gang leader from Peckham, in south London, who now works as a community support worker and independent gangs consultant. ""For some women it's a normal thing to have in your bag, like lipstick,"" she says. ""We have got girls that stab, but it's just like the elephant in the room. No-one wants to talk about it because no one knows how to deal with it. ""Everywhere you go you have problems with girls and their identity, their self-worth and those are the vulnerable ones that boys end up picking up."" She says some girls and women from broken homes see street gangs as their family and will do anything to fit it. ""Knife, guns, drugs - they are the couriers for it. They're not going to get stopped by police, and the men know that."" The Home Office said it was investing Â£220m into steering both young men and young women away from violent crime. For female offenders specifically, it supports and funds young people's advocates who work with gang-affected young women and girls in London, Manchester and the West Midlands. A spokesman added: ""We recently announced plans to recruit 20,000 more police officers and empower them to use fair and intelligence-led stop and search, to prevent more young people falling victim to knife crime."" Earlier this year South Yorkshire Police was one of seven forces to receive extra Home Office funding to tackle violent crime. The force's assistant chief constable, Tim Forber, said while knife crime is still predominately a male problem, it is increasingly about ""vulnerability"" rather than gender. ""It's a very small proportion [of women] but it's a worrying proportion - we don't want to see any young people, any women carrying knives in society. ""I don't think it's any more nuanced, than it is for men, it's about vulnerable young people getting drawn into the fringes of organised crime.""

German MPs want higher meat tax,"Higher VAT would most likely reduce German shoppers' meat purchases Green and Social Democrat (SPD) politicians in Germany say the 7% sales tax (VAT) rate on meat should be raised to 19% to help curb global warming and fund animal welfare improvements. According to UN research, methane from livestock accounts for 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions - more than the direct emissions from transport. The German proposal, if made law, could reduce meat purchases and the supply of cheaper meats from factory farms. But the agriculture minister objected. Minister Julia KlÃ¶ckner, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party, said she welcomed the discussion on improving animal welfare, but argued that raising VAT was not the way to do it, as a drop in meat sales could hurt farmers' incomes. The standard VAT rate in Germany is 19%, but most foods, including meat, benefit from the reduced rate of 7%. The SPD is in government with the CDU, and the German Greens made big gains in the May European elections. The German debate coincided witha UN report from a panel of scientists calling for a determined switch away from livestock farming. They argue that the West's high consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global warming. This video can not be played Gases produced by livestock are a major factor in global warming Besides the harm caused by methane emissions from livestock, there is the widespread destruction of forests to make way for pasture, a process that releases CO2 stored in soil and reduces the absorption of CO2 by trees. Polish bad meat spreads to 11 EU states Call for end to live calf exports The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)says the livestock sector produces 14.5%,externalof greenhouse gas emissions, or 7.1 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent - more than all the direct emissions from cars, aviation, ships and other transport. SPD agriculture spokesman Rainer Spiering said ""there are discount stores in Germany selling 500 grams of mince for â¬2.50 (Â£2.30), and if the VAT rate goes up by 12 percentage points they will charge â¬2.80 - I think that is acceptable"". Germany's Die Zeit daily reports that the average German eats about 60kg (132 pounds) of meat annually, but the German Nutrition Society (DGE) recommends only half that amount as a healthy level. In the first half of this year, German abattoirs produced 3.9m tonnes of meat. Slaughtered animals - excluding poultry - totalled 29.4m. Under EU rules, food generally qualifies for a reduced rate of VAT - as do many other essential goods and services. But alcohol, fruit juice and some other types of food and drink are taxed at the standard rate. The minimum standard rate is 15%, and the lowest reduced rate is 5%. In Germany, the reduced rate applies to pet food, but not to baby food. And carrots are reduced-rate, but not carrot juice. In the UK the VAT rate on food is 0%, whichremains legal under EU rules,external, because it predates the 5% threshold set in 1991. VAT rates vary widely across the EU,,externalas taxation remains largely a national government responsibility. But the variation makes it harder to crack down on VAT fraud, and the EU has longstanding plans to reform VAT.

Stab accused 'moonwalked past victim's family'The mother of a stabbed teenager criticises his family's treatment during a trial over his death.Manchester,"This video can not be played Yousef Makkiâs mum says her family were ""treated like criminals"" The mother of a stabbed teenager has said one of the boys who faced charges relating to her son's death would ""moonwalk"" past her in court. Yousef Makki, 17, was stabbed in the heart in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester, on 2 March. His mum Debbie said she had to share a corridor with two defendants during a trial at Manchester Crown Court. A boy, 17, admitted stabbing Yousef with a flick knife but wascleared of murder and manslaughter. Known in court as Boy A, the teenager pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and possessing a knife andwill spend eight months in custody. Another 17-year-old, known as Boy B, was given a four-month detention and training order after he admitted possessing a knife. Throughout the trial, Mrs Makki said, she would see both defendants outside the courtroom. ""One of them used to moonwalk past us and laugh, the other one just used to smirk at us,"" she said. Mrs Makki said she felt her family was ""treated like criminals"" and were left feeling ""pushed out"" of proceedings. She toldBBC Radio 5 live: ""We were actually shown a video of Yousef dead on the floor and we weren't warned about any of it. ""That picture sticks in my daughter's head forever."" Yousef, who won a scholarship to the prestigious Â£12,000-a-year school, was ""extremely intelligent"", his mother said Mrs Makki said her son, a Manchester Grammar School pupil, was ""made to look like the bad guy"" during the trial. ""The whole case for four weeks was aimed at the fact that these boys were good boys from a good area, as if they were innocent babies, as if they couldn't possibly do anything bad because they weren't from a council estate."" The family was ""shoved upstairs"" in the public gallery to watch the four-week trial ""through a glass window"", Mrs Makki said. This made it difficult to hear proceedings and left them unable to see the accused, she said. ""They're protected like babies with their families next to them and we're told there is no room for us,"" she said. Yousef, from an Anglo-Lebanese family from Burnage, had won a scholarship to the prestigious Â£12,000-a-year school. He was stabbed in the village, which is popular with footballers and celebrities. Mrs Makki described him as ""extremely intelligent, caring, kind"" and ""always true to himself"". ""It is as if a light has gone out,"" she added. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said victims' families were ""offered the use of a private suite and the option of sitting away from a defendant's family"" during cases and headphones were available to help those in the public gallery ""listen to proceedings more clearly"". He added that it was ""a tragic case and our sympathies remain with Mr Makki's family"" and said the department was ""looking at the possibility of putting speakers into the upstairs public gallery"" at the court. Correction 23rd October 2019: An earlier version of this article referred to ""one of the boys on trial"" over the killing of Yousef Makki and this has since been amended to make clear that while both boys faced charges relating to his death, only Boy A faced charges over his killing.

Boardmasters cancellation a 'bitter blow' for town,"People were queuing at Newquay railway station after Boardmasters was cancelled The last-minute cancellation of Boardmasters festival amid storm warnings is set to hit Newquay businesses hard. The annual event makes the second week of August the busiest of the year for the town's traders, bringing in tens of thousands of visitors and anestimated Â£45m,external. Kim Conchie from Cornwall's Chamber of Commerce said it was  ""a bitter blow"". One business said an order of ""several thousand"" pasties had been cancelled. Fiona Rick, from Cornish Premier Pasties, said a customer had been planning to pick up a large batch of the snacks on each of the festival's five days. Cornwall councillor Oliver Monk said Boardmasters was ""like Christmas"" for the area. ""It's three days of maximum trade and cancelling it has a massive, massive knock on effect for all the businesses in town,"" he said. The music festival at Watergate Bay attracts world class acts and thousands of fans Tim Rowe said they had lost out on ""T-shirts and hats"" trade He said customers from the festival ""tend to come in and buy caps and T-shirts"". ""I put on extra staff because so many people come in the shop,"" the shop manager added. ""My biggest problem is that families are put off coming this week because of Boardmasters. ""So not only have we lost the T-shirts and hats trade from the festival goers, we won't get the families buying wetsuits and surfboards either."" Damian Rowe had ordered 500 ponchos He said the cancellation could cost the shop up to about Â£6,000. We sell more wellies this week than the rest of year put together so have a couple of hundred pairs,"" he said. ""Last year we didn't have enough ponchos so I ordered 500 of them. He said he also stocked up on cheap tents but said they would ""last till next year and maybe some proper campers will now come into town because the festival isn't on"". Nick Coates has had a pitch at Fistral beach for the last six years of Boardmasters He said organisers ""made the call for the right reasons, for public safety"". Mr Coates added: ""I saw it in 2014 when the weather got really bad and they wanted to avoid that. It can be very dangerous at Watergate where it is exposed with lots of heavy equipment around. ""It's not good for the traders. Last year was amazing so I have travelled from Germany to be here. ""There won't be so many people down here but we should still get some good traffic for the surfing so it's not a complete loss, but it won't be as good as it could be. ""We don't pay small amounts for the pitches so we are hoping we may get some money back, or perhaps have it free next year."" Boardmasters called off with 12 hours' notice Boardmasters is off but festival vibes go on Chris Rome and Aaron Richmond are from Peterborough Mr Richmond said the cancellation would have an impact. ""People from the festival often come down here during the day so we won't see so many people. We found out last night and it's a big disappointment,"" he said. ""The atmosphere has completely dried up here - it's all anyone is talking about and it's not a nice topic. ""For trade this is not good news. Last year the pitch opposite made Â£3,000 to Â£4,000 a day. I didn't make that much, but still did well."" Mr Rome added: ""Hopefully the big surf will bring people down to Fistral but we are a bit concerned about numbers. We want to have a good time but we are here to make money.""

Attack was 'darkest moment',"PC Mat Baker said he believed he was ""fighting for my life"" during the incident A police officer attacked by a man he was trying to restrain said it was one of the ""darkest moments"" in his life. PC Mat Baker and his colleague were bitten and strangled during the assault in Highworth in July 2017, and he said he was ""fighting for my life"". The officer's account of the attack wasshown on the BBC One documentary series Critical Incidentthis week. In the past two years, assaults on Wiltshire Police officers have almost doubled. Recalling the attack, PC Baker said: ""I heard my colleague saying 'he's got his hand on my throat' and this guy's repeatedly saying 'I'm going to kill you. You're going to die. You're dead'. Repeatedly. ""You then start to wonder am I actually in the fight for my life. Yeah, I was in a fight for my life. It is that simple."" He said he and his colleague ""shared one of the darkest moments of our lives"". PC Baker said more than a year later he is still waiting for the traumatic memories to fade PC Baker described attacks on emergency service personnel as ""heinous"", and said more than a year later he was still waiting for the traumatic memories to ""fade into nothing"". His attacker admitted assault charges in January 2018 and received a 14-month suspended jail term. Wiltshire Police deputy chief constable Maggie Blyth said: ""What happened to Mat was dreadful and no police officer should come to work and be subjected to the sort of assault that he was. ""Sadly we have seen an increase in police officer assaults last year in Wiltshire, and that's mirrored across the country."" The force has adopted a seven point package of measures to help support officers assaulted in the execution of their duty, she added. Figures from Wiltshire Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Angus Macpherson last year showed there were 55 assaults on officers in 2016/17 and 103 in 2017/18. ""As with any job there are highs and lows, but being injured and abused on duty should not be part and parcel of working for the police,"" he said.

"Nationwide customers refunded Â£6m in chargesThe refunds, for a text alert failure, come as it also faces anger over a separate technical error.Business","Thousands of Nationwide's overdraft customers are being refunded Â£6m after the building society failed to send them the correct text warnings. Bank customers must receive a text alert before they are charged for entering unarranged overdrafts. A total of 320,000 customers were affected and are now in line for a reimbursement of the charges. The refunds come as Nationwide deals with a separate technical error, when payments appear to be taken twice. Customers have expressed anger on social media over the errors, which meant account balances looked too low. Thousands have been affected, and the building society has apologised.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. On a bad day for the building society, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced that Nationwide had broken rules over text alerts 20 times since February last year. The warnings are supposed to give customers time to take action to avoid unexpected overdraft charges. In the majority of cases, Nationwide failed to make it clear in texts that customers could incur charges if they did not take any action. ""Nationwide failed to do this on numerous occasions and our action today makes it clear they must fix this as a matter of urgency. It is imperative that these problems are sorted out immediately and that they don't occur again,"" said Adam Land from the CMA. The building society apologised and said the wording was corrected in November 2018, while additional controls would ensure this did not happen again. The CMA does not have the authority to fine companies which breach the rules, although it is calling on the government to bolster its powers. Some angry customers have been threatening to leave Nationwide over a fault that suggested they had less money in their accounts than should have been the case. The error meant some customers appeared to have made payments twice, with one completed, and a duplicate marked as a pending transaction. One customer believed they had just Â£2.98 left in their account, while another appeared to be overdrawn even though he did not have an overdraft facility. Another customer, Iwan Edwards, said he was charged twice for a Â£12,543 payment for a new car, and did not know what was going on for 12 hours. Clare Jones, from Kidderminster, was paying Â£2,000 towards a holiday, but the sum appeared to have been taken out twice. ""I went to buy something online, but it said my bank wouldn't authorise payment. I looked online and it said we were about Â£2,000 overdrawn,"" she said. ""They said there was nothing they could do, they left us with no money."" A Nationwide spokeswoman said: ""Yesterday evening, we identified a problem that meant the available balance on some member accounts appeared lower than they should, due to some payments still showing as pending. ""This was corrected overnight and everything is now working normally. We apologise to those members affected and can assure them that they won't incur any charges as a result of this issue.""

Rise in women caught carrying knives in England,"This video can not be played 'My boyfriend bought me knives' Knife possession offences involving women in England have increased steeply since 2014 - rising by at least 10% every year, police figures show. Some 1,509 offences were recorded in 2018 - an increase of 73% over the last five years - data obtained following freedom of information requests shows. Youth workers say some women carry weapons for gangs as they are less likely to be stopped by police. The Home Office said it funds schemes to help gang-affected women and girls. Figures for England show that between 2014 and 2018 there were more than 5,800 recorded knife possession crimes involving women. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Are more teenagers carrying knives? 'Thousands' of 14-year-olds carry knives The BBC contacted the four police forces in Wales but the figures are incomplete. Police Scotland and Police Northern Ireland figures were unavailable. It comes against a backdrop of rising knife crime nationally and after the number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales was last year thehighest number since records began. Some 1,509 knife possession offences involving women were recorded in 2018 West Midlands Police found a gun, bullets and a knife in a designer handbag after searching a car Data from 38 forces out of 39 in England shows almost a quarter of recorded offences involved girls under the age of 18 - with the youngest aged seven. While London's Metropolitan Police saw the highest number of possession cases involving women, parts of northern England have seen female knife possession crimes increase at a faster rate. London's Metropolitan Police recorded a 52% increase over five years, with a total of 916 recorded offences from 2014 to 2018. During the same time, Merseyside Police saw a 54% rise, to 499 offences, while the number of offences in Greater Manchester doubled, with 95 recorded offences last year. In South Yorkshire there was an 82% rise over five years - with 248 offences involving women. Theresa John regularly carried a knife for 12 years. She said it ""became part of my identity"" on the streets in Essex. ""I used to name my knives. When I was 16 I had one that was like a flick Stanley blade and I used to call it Uncle Stan. Fatal stabbings at record high Who are the first 100 stabbing victims of 2019? ""If anyone asked me 'have you got Unc on you', I'd be like 'yeah'. That was my pet until I was 21."" After a chaotic and difficult childhood, Theresa's life spiralled out of control. In her early 20s she became addicted to heroin and crack cocaine and worked as a prostitute to fund her addiction. Theresa says she regularly carried a knife for 12 years ""I'd either have a knife or a pair of scissors because when I was out working on the streets. There would be different guys who would force you to do stuff. ""I stayed in this lifestyle of crime and madness and just brokenness. I was in a very abusive relationship to the point that my kids were taken into care and at that point I just lost all hope. ""I started taking heroin, I was out on the streets working in prostitution. I used to get in a lot of fights - there was a lot of violence."" One night, the scissors were used as a weapon on her and a man stabbed her in the back of the head. And in 2012, Theresa stabbed her next door neighbour and was sentenced to 10 months in prison for actual bodily harm and possession of a knife. Now 35 years old, she says: ""It was like this mist came over me and I charged at her with the knife, and just stabbed her straight in the top of her head."" Jennifer Blake is a former gang leader from Peckham, in south London, who now works as a community support worker and independent gangs consultant. ""For some women it's a normal thing to have in your bag, like lipstick,"" she says. ""We have got girls that stab, but it's just like the elephant in the room. No-one wants to talk about it because no one knows how to deal with it. ""Everywhere you go you have problems with girls and their identity, their self-worth and those are the vulnerable ones that boys end up picking up."" She says some girls and women from broken homes see street gangs as their family and will do anything to fit it. ""Knife, guns, drugs - they are the couriers for it. They're not going to get stopped by police, and the men know that."" The Home Office said it was investing Â£220m into steering both young men and young women away from violent crime. For female offenders specifically, it supports and funds young people's advocates who work with gang-affected young women and girls in London, Manchester and the West Midlands.

Earlier this year South Yorkshire Police was one of seven forces to receive extra Home Office funding to tackle violent crime. The force's assistant chief constable, Tim Forber, said while knife crime is still predominately a male problem, it is increasingly about ""vulnerability"" rather than gender. ""It's a very small proportion [of women] but it's a worrying proportion - we don't want to see any young people, any women carrying knives in society.

Commuter gets Â£27k for 'possible pigeon poo slip',"A total of Â£136,585-worth of compensation claims paid out by Network Rail happened at London Paddington A commuter received Â£27,602 from Network Rail after ""possibly slipping"" on pigeon poo at Paddington station. Data obtained by the BBC has revealed Network Rail has paid out nearly Â£1m in five years for slips, trips and falls at its stations across the UK. Over half of the payouts were made following accidents at Euston, Paddington, Victoria and Liverpool Street stations. Network Rail said a ""tiny fraction"" of commuters ""experience a mishap"". In the five years up to the end of 2018-19 financial year a total of Â£951,360 was paid out in compensation. The highest single amount was Â£39,631 for a passenger who ""slipped on some liquid"" at Charing Cross station. Other passengers have received large payouts for slips at Paddington (Â£36,392) and Euston (Â£35,721) while another commuter received Â£28,000 after suffering a ""possible lacerated finger"" at Liverpool Street. Settlements made by Network Rail were said to reflect the claims and would take into account not only the injury but the wider impact. Network Rail's Philip Thrower said Network Rail was a company that took its ""responsibilities seriously"". He added: ""With tens of millions of people using our stations every day, only a tiny fraction of a percent experience a mishap. ""If we are at fault for causing damage or injury to anyone, we rightly compensate them for those accidents and put in place new ways of working to stop them from happening again."" Tube commuters fainting at 'alarming levels' Network Rail generates Â£4.8m from toilet charges Bid to run Southeastern rail route scrapped Network Rail manages 20 stations across the UK including 11 in London. Others include stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Reading, Guildford and Bristol Temple Meads. Victoria was the railway station that saw the highest number of successful claims paid out by Network Rail - 44. Waterloo (32), Leeds (32), Euston (27) and Liverpool Street (24) also feature highly. Guildford and Glasgow Central were the only Network Rail-run stations not to have had a compensation claim paid out in the past five financial years.

Attack on PC was 'darkest moment in life',"PC Mat Baker said he believed he was ""fighting for my life"" during the incident A police officer attacked by a man he was trying to restrain said it was one of the ""darkest moments"" in his life. PC Mat Baker and his colleague were bitten and strangled during the assault in Highworth in July 2017, and he said he was ""fighting for my life"". The officer's account of the attack wasshown on the BBC One documentary series Critical Incidentthis week. In the past two years, assaults on Wiltshire Police officers have almost doubled. Recalling the attack, PC Baker said: ""I heard my colleague saying 'he's got his hand on my throat' and this guy's repeatedly saying 'I'm going to kill you. You're going to die. You're dead'. Repeatedly. ""You then start to wonder am I actually in the fight for my life. Yeah, I was in a fight for my life. It is that simple."" He said he and his colleague ""shared one of the darkest moments of our lives"". PC Baker said more than a year later he is still waiting for the traumatic memories to fade PC Baker described attacks on emergency service personnel as ""heinous"", and said more than a year later he was still waiting for the traumatic memories to ""fade into nothing"". His attacker admitted assault charges in January 2018 and received a 14-month suspended jail term. Wiltshire Police deputy chief constable Maggie Blyth said: ""What happened to Mat was dreadful and no police officer should come to work and be subjected to the sort of assault that he was. ""Sadly we have seen an increase in police officer assaults last year in Wiltshire, and that's mirrored across the country."" The force has adopted a seven point package of measures to help support officers assaulted in the execution of their duty, she added. Figures from Wiltshire Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Angus Macpherson last year showed there were 55 assaults on officers in 2016/17 and 103 in 2017/18. ""As with any job there are highs and lows, but being injured and abused on duty should not be part and parcel of working for the police,"" he said.

UN 'deeply concerned' over Kashmir restrictions,"This video can not be played The BBC reports from inside Indian-administered Kashmir The UN has said the latest restrictions imposed on Indian-administered Kashmir are deeply concerning and ""will exacerbate the human rights situation"". A UN spokesperson highlighted a telecommunications ban, the arbitrary detention of leaders and a ban on political assembly. The region has been on lockdown since Sunday with communication cut off. It came as India made the controversial decision to remove its special constitutional status. Article 370 - as the constitutional provision guaranteeing special status is known - gave the state of Jammu and Kashmir special dispensation to make its own laws on everything apart from matters of foreign affairs, defence and communications. This formed the basis of its complex relationship with India for some 70 years. The Himalayan region is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, but each country controls only part of it. Kashmiris express anger at loss of special status What happened in Kashmir and why it matters By revoking it, Delhi has irrevocably changed its relationship with the region. The move came as a shock, and has been met with harsh criticism from some opposition lawmakers, constitutional experts and even ordinary citizens. But it has also been welcomed by many, including Supreme Court lawyers who have argued that it is not unconstitutional. In the days leading up to the parliamentary announcement on Monday, India's federal government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had moved tens of thousands of troops into Kashmir. On Sunday evening, the internet, mobile phone networks and landlines in the region were cut off; and political leaders, including two former chief ministers, were put under house arrest. They are reportedly still detained. The controversial move has sparked protests The region remains under lockdown, with Kashmiris in other parts of the country saying that they are unable to get through to their families. The government has justified the lockdown, saying it was a precaution to prevent unrest or violence over its controversial move. But the BBC has spoken to people inside the region, and has seen some protests which have involved people throwing stones at security forces. The region remains in lockdown There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule in the region since 1989, and security forces have repeatedly clashed with stone-throwing protesters, leading to thousands of deaths over the years. But many say the lockdown this time is unprecedented in its scale. In the video statement posted on Twitter, UN spokesperson Rupert Colville reiterated the organisation's previous concerns over the human rights situation in Kashmir saying a previous report had ""documented how authorities have repeatedly blocked communications networks to muzzle dissent, used arbitrary detention to punish political dissidents and employed excessive force while dealing with protests leading to extra judicial killings and serious injuries"".

But he said the new restrictions had taken the situation to ""a new level"". The UN was now ""seeing again blanket telecommunications restrictions, perhaps more blanket than we have seen before"", he said. He warned the bans would prevent people from ""participating fully in democratic debate about the future status of Jammu and Kashmir"". India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over the region. India and Pakistan both claim the Himalayan region India's decision revoking Article 370 drew a swift reaction from Pakistan's prime minister, Imran Khan who said the move was in breach of international law. Pakistan has also announced plans to expel India's top diplomat and suspend trade relations with its neighbour, deepening the row between the countries over Kashmir. India has responded saying they ""regret"" Pakistan's statement, adding that Article 370 was an internal matter.

BeyoncÃ© diet plan 'could be dangerous',"A diet endorsed by US pop singer BeyoncÃ© ""could be dangerous,"" the British Association for Nutrition and Lifestyle Medicine has told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Subscribers to the 22-day plan pay $14 (Â£11.50) to access plant-based recipes. But nutritionist Daniel O'Shaughnessy says the diet could lead to ""nutritional deficiencies"". BeyoncÃ©'s trainer Marco Borges said the singer was ""mindful of the importance of proper nutrition and exercise"". The original diet was created in 2013 but the singer is now promoting BeyoncÃ©'s Kitchen, the plan she followed in preparation for her comeback performance at the 2018 Coachella festival after having twins. A promotional video released on her YouTube channel last month opens with a clip from her Homecoming film, showing her stepping on to some scales and saying her weight is ""every woman's worst nightmare"". The video has been viewed 1.7 million times. BeyoncÃ© also says to reach her goals she must limit herself to ""no bread, no carbs, no sugar, no dairy, no meat, no fish, no alcoholâ¦ and I'm hungry"". She followed the plan for 44 days. Her plan was devised by 22 Days Nutrition founder Borges, whom she describes as her ""friend, trainer, exercise physiologist and New York Times bestselling author"". Mr O'Shaughnessy questioned its stated nutritional values. For example, one of the recipes, a ""vegg sandwich"" containing 36g (1oz) of protein, actually contained just 24g, he said. While another, a green smoothie, contained eight teaspoons of sugar. The NHS recommends men consume 2,500 calories a day and women 2,000 - but the diet supplies just 1,400. ""This is quite low for anyone, users will feel tired and exhausted particularly when adding in the exercise,"" Mr O'Shaughnessy said. ""It could be dangerous for the average person to follow without a team of nutritionists and trainers like BeyoncÃ© has."" Excluding all animal products without any information on what nutritional issues the dieter may need to consider, such as replacing vitamin B12, iron or protein intake, was also problematic, Mr O'Shaughnessy said. And celebrities should be encouraging women to be comfortable with their bodies. ""BeyoncÃ© is selling a dream,"" Mr O'Shaughnessy said. ""This is worrying as she has a number of teenage followers who are easily susceptible. ""She is a gateway to millions of people."" BeyoncÃ© did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Mr Borges, said: ""BeyoncÃ© used a combination of a whole food plant-based diet and daily exercise as part of her discipline and hard work in order to reach her personal goals in preparation for her Coachella performance... ""She achieved her goals successfully and was able to show up and give 100% for a performance which required nothing less. ""She continues to be mindful of the importance of proper nutrition and exercise as part of a healthy and happy lifestyle. ""We applaud her and are humbled by her courage to share her journey with others.""

Diet shift 'can help fight global warming',"Vegan burgers are now a fixture on many restaurant menus Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, UN experts have said. A major report on land use and climate change says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global warming. But scientists and officials stopped short of explicitly calling on everyone to become vegan or vegetarian. They said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat. The document, prepared by 107 scientists for the UN'sIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),external, says that if land is used more effectively, it can store more of the carbon emitted by humans. It was finalised following discussions held here in Geneva, Switzerland. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Twelve years to save Earth? Make that 18 months... Meat, veg, nuts - a diet designed to feed 10bn What is climate change? 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA ""We're not telling people to stop eating meat. In some places people have no other choice. But it's obvious that in the West we're eating far too much,"" said Prof Pete Smith, an environmental scientist from Aberdeen University, UK. We're also wasting too much food. The panel estimates that greenhouse emissions associated with food loss and waste - from field to kitchen bin - is as high as 8-10% of ALL global emissions. The report calls for vigorous action to halt soil damage and desertification - both of which contribute to climate change. Road-testing the diet to save the world Make-me-a-vegan-the-verdict The questions everyone's asking Google about veganism It also warns that plans by some governments to grow trees and burn them to generate electricity will compete with food production unless carried out on a limited scale. The Earth's land surface, and the way it is used, forms the basis for human society and the global economy. But we are re-shaping it in dramatic ways, including through the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. How the land responds to human-induced climate change is a vital concern for the future. This video can not be played Gases produced by livestock are a major factor in global warming, so should we change our eating habits? Climate change poses a threat to the security of our food supply. Rising temperatures, increased rain and more extreme weather events will all have an impact on crops and livestock. But food production also contributes to global warming. Agriculture - together with forestry - accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock rearing contributes to global warming through the methane gas the animals produce, but also via deforestation to expand pastures, for example. Climate change: German MPs want higher meat tax The environmental impact of meat production is important to many vegetarians and vegans. A UK-based group called #NoBeef lobbies caterers to take beef and lamb off student menus. In the US, vegan burger patties are made from plant-based meat substitutes said to taste like the real thing thanks to an iron-rich compound called heme. Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Peter Stevenson, from Compassion in World Farming, said: ""A reduction in meat consumption is essential if we are to meet climate targets."" But in some parts of the world, such as China, beef consumption is growing. This is despite attempts by the Chinese central government to promote traditional diets. Geneva-based company Partage is helping tackle waste by taking in unsold food The authors of the report encourage action to stop wasting food - either before or after its sale to consumers. Waste food can sometimes be used as animal feed or, if suitable, redirected to charities to feed people in need. One organisation here in Switzerland called Partage takes in unsold food discarded by shops and distributes it to local families. It also collects stale bread and turns it into biscuits, dries fruit, and cans vegetables. All of this helps reduce the CO2 emissions involved in producing food. July was 'marginally' world's warmest month ever Hungry nations add the least to global CO2 Stop abusing land, scientists warn Road-testing the diet to save the world Extra atmospheric carbon can nourish forests, but there comes a point where they are overwhelmed The extra carbon that humans have put into the atmosphere is nourishing the growth of forests - especially in the Northern Hemisphere. This can help to mitigate climate change, but it all comes down to a balance of factors. Experts say this effect on forests will be negated if the Earth heats up too much. In fact, the report says areas near the equator may already be losing vegetation through heat stress. Dr Katrin Fleischer, from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, warned that in some places a shortage of phosphorus in soil - a key ingredient for plant growth - would also hinder tree growth. She said: ""This would mean that the rainforest has already reached its limit and would be unable to absorb any more carbon dioxide emissions. ""If this scenario turns out to be true, the Earth's climate would heat up significantly faster."" Soil is sometimes neglected as part of the climate system. But it's the second largest store of carbon after the oceans. Plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and lock the carbon away in the soil. But deforestation and poor farming practices can damage its ability to do this. When soil is degraded, carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, while further plant growth is compromised. Climate change is expected to speed this process up. Higher temperatures can help break down the organic matter in soil, boosting greenhouse emissions. The report says reducing and reversing soil damage provides immediate benefits to local communities. Better land management, including controlled grazing by animals and tree planting, can boost soil fertility, helping to reduce poverty and boost food security. ""It's really clear that the land's being degraded through over-exploitation - and that's making climate change worse,"" said Prof Smith. ""The land is part of the problem but if we wise up about the way we use it, it can part of the climate solution."" Changing the way humans use the land surface is a daunting challenge, especially as it will entail a major shift in farming methods. Nevertheless, scientists say people need to: Protect natural forest, particularly in the tropics Eat less red meat and more vegetables Safeguard and restore peatlands Encourage ""agroforestry"", where food crops are mixed in with trees Improve crop varieties But one practice touted as a climate change solution - bioenergy - has been treated with caution by IPCC experts. Bioenergy involves burning vegetation as a substitute for fossil fuels. To some countries, it appears to be an attractive option because CO2 emissions from the process can be captured. Interactive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the world The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts bioenergy will outpace solar, wind and hydropower in the next five years. But the authors of the IPCC report say converting land to bioenergy could deprive countries of soil to grow much-needed crops. They advise limits on the amount of land used for biofuels.

WhatsApp flaw 'puts words in your mouth',"A newly-released tool that exploits a vulnerability in Facebookâs WhatsApp allows you to ""put words in peopleâs mouths"", researchers say. A team from cybersecurity firm Checkpoint has demonstrated how the tool can be used to alter the text within quoted messages, making it look as if a person had said something they did not. Researcher Oded Vanunu told the BBC the tool made it possible for âmalicious actorsâ to manipulate conversations on the platform. Facebook would not provide a comment on the issue. How WhatsApp helped turn a village into a mob Burned to death because of a rumour on WhatsApp The tool was demonstrated at Black Hat, a cyber-security conference in Las Vegas, as a follow up to a research paper published by Checkpoint last year. âItâs a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to create fake news and create fraud,â Mr Vanunu explained. The tool makes it possible to manipulate WhatsAppâs quoting feature to make it look like someone had written something they had not. âYou can completely change what someone says,â Mr Vanunu said. ""You can completely manipulate every character in the quote.â The tool also allows an attacker to change how the sender of the message is identified, making it possible to attribute a comment to a different source. A third issue highlighted by researchers has been successfully fixed by Facebook. That flaw could trick users into believing they were sending a private message to one person, when in fact their reply went to a more public group. But Mr Vanunu said Facebook had told them the other issues could not be resolved due to âinfrastructure limitationsâ on WhatsApp. In particular, the encryption technology used by WhatsApp made it extremely difficult - perhaps impossible - for the company to monitor and verify the authenticity of messages being sent by users. Other potential measures to stop the problems highlighted could result in trade-offs in the usability of the app, researchers were told. When asked by the BBC why his team would release a tool that made it easier for others to exploit the vulnerability, Mr Vanunu defended the move, saying he hoped it would provoke discussion. â[WhatsApp] serves 30% of the global population. It's our responsibility. There is a big problem with fake news and manipulation. It's infrastructure that serves more than 1.5 billion users. ""We cannot like put it aside and say: 'Okay, this is not happening.â"" The spread of misinformation on WhatsApp has been a major cause of concern, particularly in countries such as India and Brazil,where misinformation has lead to instances of violence, and in some cases, death. WhatsApp made changes to its platform in an effort to reduce the spread of misinformation, such as limiting the number of times a message could be forwarded. Update: 8 August 2019: Facebook provided a statement a day after first asked: ""We carefully reviewed this issue a year ago and it is false to suggest there is a vulnerability with the security we provide on WhatsApp,"" it said. ""The scenario described here is merely the mobile equivalent of altering replies in an email thread to make it look like something a person didn't write. ""We need to be mindful that addressing concerns raised by these researchers could make WhatsApp less private - such as storing information about the origin of messages."" _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Whaley Bridge residents struggle for compensation,"Goyt Wines manager Malcolm Swets says the company's insurance provider is disputing the bar's claim for loss of earnings Hundreds of Whaley Bridge residents have spent almost a week away from their homes and businesses. Now,as they return, they are left wondering: ""What next?"" For many, the question of compensation - for lost earnings or food and accommodation costs - springs to mind. But how much of a struggle is this likely to be? Goyt Wines manager Malcolm Swets said the shop and bar had lost ""thousands of pounds"" in revenue over the week. ""We're going to have trouble because our insurance company is disputing paying out anything for lost earnings,"" he said. ""A flood didn't happen, [there's been] no damage to the property, so we can't claim on anything like that."" He said the insurers were disputing whether the fact customers were prevented from accessing the shop fell under their policy. The shop's owners have been referred to the Financial Ombudsman over the claim. Hairdresser Julian Thompson reopened his salon within hours of the cordon being lifted on Thursday Adeva hairdressers owner Julian Thompson reopened his salon hours after the cordon had been lifted. He said he would have struggled to cope if the evacuation had continued. ""I have staff and I have to pay their wages,"" he said. ""A week, I could just about do it. Any longer than that and I'm starting to panic."" Phoenix Takeaway owner Siu Lok Wong worries his insurance premiums will go up if he claims for loss of earnings Siu Lok Wong, owner of the Phoenix Takeaway, said he had lost seven days' worth of trade. He said: ""If we're not open, we're not making any money, but it's the same for every business here."" He said he had been in touch with his insurance company and expected to receive a payout for loss of earnings but feared it could push up his premium in the future. The Association for British Insurers (ABI) said businesses with cover for ""denial of access"" should be able to claim for loss of earnings if they were inside the evacuation cordon. For evacuated townsfolk who have paid out for accommodation, food and other emergency supplies, insurance claims may prove trickier. Malcolm Tarling, from the ABI, said: ""Flood insurance cover kicks in when any flooding actually occurs. ""When it does, insurers will respond quickly to help homeowners and firms recover."" As no properties in Whaley Bridge were damaged as a result of the dam breaching, costs incurred by the evacuation may not be reimbursable through home insurance - although the ABI said there was ""no harm in checking in with your insurer"". Some businesses based in the evacuation zone were unable to trade as emergency services worked to avert a flood One Whaley Bridge resident, who did not wish to be named, said his insurers had already told him they would pay for his hotel costs after he had to pay for rooms on the first night of the evacuation. His family also spent more than Â£1,000 on a week-long stay at a care home for an elderly relative, but he had yet to check with the relative's insurer over compensation for respite care. Getting creative in a crisis Dam emergency in pictures How well was the Whaley Bridge dam maintained? However, like many of the evacuees, his overriding feeling was relief that his family were safe. ""We're prepared to pay for it -  at the end of the day everyone's safe and nobody's hurt,"" he said. The overriding feeling among evacuees is relief that they are safe Fellow resident Ruth Ashton, 26, agreed. She stayed with her parents after being advised to leave her home, so did not spend money on accommodation herself, but said: ""I know some people have found it financially difficult so they should definitely get some form of compensation or reimbursement for whatever they lost."" She pointed out that some people had been unable to work but still had to pay rent and living costs. ""Business owners have lost a massive amount of income and still have to pay business rates for properties that they're letting,"" she said. ""It's not really [the insurers'] fault we were evacuated; it's nobody's fault. It's a massive inconvenience but, at the end of the day, everybody's safe."" Support may be available from the council for residents returning to their homes But might stricken residents have other options when it comes to financial support? Derbyshire County Council said it would set up two emergency funds - worth Â£160,000 - for residents and businesses that were financially affected by the evacuation. A spokeswoman said part of it would be funded through the Derbyshire Discretionary Fund, which would be topped up by county council's budget. She added: ""The business emergency support fund of Â£100,000 is being set aside from existing council reserves to provide emergency relief to businesses out of pocket as a result of the Toddbrook Reservoir incident.""
