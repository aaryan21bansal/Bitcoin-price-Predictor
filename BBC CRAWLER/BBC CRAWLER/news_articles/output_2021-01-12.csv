Hundredth birthday marked by a Covid jab,"Isabella Curry urged others to get the jab and said it was just a little ""prick in the arm"" A woman has celebrated her 100th birthday by getting a covid vaccination at home. Isabella Curry, known as Ella, from Cramlington, was among some of the most vulnerable people in Northumberland to receive the vaccine. Ms Curry, who lives alone, urged others not to be afraid to get the jab and said it was just a little ""prick in the arm"" and she now felt safe. Her birthday was also marked by the arrival of a card from the Queen. She said: ""This vaccine means I'll be able to go out, meet my friends soon and feel safe."" Isabella Curry's nephew Neil Curry thanked the ""army"" of helpers who cared for his aunt Ms Curry's nephew, Neil Curry from Bristol, said he was delighted she had had the vaccination but sad the whole family could not get together for the milestone birthday. ""We had a family reunion for Ella's 90th - we all got together in Newcastle.  We would have all got together again to mark this occasion, but we couldn't,"" he said. He also said he wanted to thank the ""army"" of people who looked after his aunt including Noreen and Jim Hutchinson, who did her shopping and cut her grass. He also thanked June and Peter Marshall and all the other people who collected her prescriptions and mobile library books. Kate Fraser, the community nurse who administered the vaccination, said: ""It's been an emotional time being able to give Isabella her vaccination.""

Earl admits sex attack at castle home,"Simon Bowes-Lyon put his victim through a 20-minute ordeal A Scottish earl has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a woman at his ancestral home in Angus. The Earl of Strathmore, Simon Bowes-Lyon, forced his way into the sleeping woman's room during a weekend event he was hosting at Glamis Castle. He repeatedly assaulted the 26-year-old victim and tried to pull off her nightdress during the 20-minute attack. Bowes-Lyon, 34 - who is the Queen's first cousin twice removed - has been placed on the sex offenders register. He was granted bail at Dundee Sheriff Court and sentence was deferred. Sheriff Alistair Carmichael also ordered Glamis Castle be assessed for its suitability to house Bowes-Lyon while under a tagging order. The court heard the woman fled the castle the morning after the attack on 13 February last year and flew home to report the matter to police. Both Police Scotland and the Metropolitan Police were involved in the investigation. Glamis Castle was the childhood home of the Queen Mother Outside court, Bowes-Lyon said he was ""greatly ashamed"" of his actions. He added: ""Clearly I had drunk to excess on the night of the incident. I should have known better. I recognise, in any event, that alcohol is no excuse for my behaviour. ""I did not think I was capable of behaving the way I did but have had to face up to it and take responsibility. ""My apologies go, above all, to the woman concerned, but I would also like to apologise to family, friends and colleagues for the distress I have caused them."" Glamis Castle, near Forfar, has been the seat of the Bowes-Lyon family since 1372. It was the childhood home of the Queen Mother, and the Queen's sister Princess Margaret was born there. Bowes-Lyon was a great-great nephew of the Queen Mother.

Row over Naomi Campbellâs Kenya tourism role,"Naomi Campbell and Kenyan Tourism Minister Najib Balala sealed the deal over the weekend The appointment of British supermodel Naomi Campbell as Kenya's tourism ambassador has caused a Twitter storm in the East African nation. Many queried why it had not been given to a prominent Kenyan like Hollywood actress Lupita Nyong'o. Others leapt to her defence, saying the debate already justified her role. Kenya's tourism sector has been badly hit by coronavirus, with visitor numbers down by 72% between January and October last year. ""The sector hence lost over 110bn Kenyan shillings [$1bn, Â£738m] of direct international tourists' revenue due to the Covid-19 pandemic,""Kenya's Tourism Research Institute reported last month.,external The country is famous for its wildlife safaris and beach resorts.

A leaked memo warned hospitals in Birmingham were ""in a position of extremis"" as Covid-19 cases rise. Elective surgeries at the city's main Queen Elizabeth Hospital will stop as staff move to critical care duties. A spokesperson said the approach ensured ""the greatest good for the greatest numbers of people"". The trust's decision to redeploy doctorswas revealed in a leaked email to the Health Service Journal,external, which has been verified by the BBC.

School meals must 'urgently' improve - minister,"England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford is a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals and said the PM had assured him ""he is committed to correcting the issue"" A mother who posted a photo on social media of a food parcel she received has told of the ""sense of sadness"" she felt on seeing what it contained. The mother, who wants to be anonymous, told the BBC: ""As I unpacked that food parcel... and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and depressing."" Chartwells, the firm which supplied the parcel, has apologised. The education secretary said schools will be able to offer vouchers rather than food parcels from next week. Gavin Williamson told the education select committee on Wednesday that he was ""absolutely disgusted"" by the photo of the food parcel's contents, and that his department had made it clear ""this sort of behaviour is just not right [and] will not be tolerated"". He said the government would ""support any school that needs to take action"" and ""name and shame those that are not delivering against the standards"" set by the Department for Education. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Boris Johnson on online images of the ""disgraceful"" food parcels during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs). What free school meals are children supposed to get? School food firm apologises after Rashford intervenes The PM insisted the government had ""massively increased the value of what we're providing"" in the form of anotherÂ£170m in the winter grant scheme, Â£220m for holiday activities and food programme, as well as the rollout of the national voucher scheme. He expressed his gratitude to the footballer Marcus Rashford - a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals who shared images of some parcels online - for highlighting the issue. Speaking to MPs on the Commons Liaison committee on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Johnson said the free school meals pictured online do not reflect government guidance, adding it was a ""scandal and a disgrace that some companies are trying to get away with the provision that they're offering"". The PM added that it was the decision of the schools on whether or not to have vouchers or food parcels, saying that about 75% opt for vouchers but that some schools wish to continue to support caterers. Mr Rashford, who has met with Chartwells andspoke to Mr Johnson earlier,external, called for a ""full major review"" of the free school meal system. In a Twitter thread on Wednesday,,externalMr Rashford said many vulnerable children had been helped during the pandemic ""thanks to the efforts of individuals, businesses, charities, educators, and government"". But he added: ""It's 2021. Our eyes are open. Now is the time for a full major review of the Free School Meal system."" Food parcels have been sent to pupils in England who would normally be eligible for free school meals while schools are closed during the coronavirus lockdown. The national voucher scheme providessupermarket vouchers through an online portal. The government had previously used this scheme duringthe first lockdown. A row broke out after the mother, using the online name Roadside Mum, posted a photo on Twitter of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items, which she calculated to have cost about Â£5. The post prompted others to complain about the quality and quantity of the food they had received in similar parcels. The mother, who is disabled, had thought it was supposed to last 10 school days and should have been worth Â£30. ""Public funds were charged Â£30. I'd have bought this for Â£5.22,"" said Twitter user Roadside Mum of the parcel she received She told BBC Breakfast: ""As I unpacked that food parcel in my living room and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and very depressing. ""One of my children came in and saw me laying this out on the floor, and I said I was going to picture it because it didn't look like a lot. ""I could see the child's realisation that this is what I've been given to eat for a week and the sense of sadness. ""Where has the rest of the food gone? This is meant to be a week's food. Why is it so mean?"" Lockdown meals teacher restarts deliveries Inside Rashford's campaign to tackle child hunger 'I remember going to bed with hunger pains' Chartwells, the company that provided the parcel, said it was actually only intended to last one school week and had cost Â£10.50 for food, packing and distribution. In a further statement posted on Wednesday,external, the firm, which is owned by Compass group, said it had ""fully investigated"" its food parcels provision in the last few hours. It apologised for those parcels that did not meet the firm's high standards, and committed to refunding the costs. It added that from Monday, the lunches would be enhanced to reflect the Department for Education's additional allowance of Â£3.50 per week per child. The company has since said,externalthat it will add breakfast free of charge into the food parcels from 25 January, and will continue to do so while schools are closed. It will include bread, butter, yoghurts, juice, milk, oats and fruit, it said.

""It's very humiliating,"" one parent toldPolitics Home.,external""Why would you decide for us? Why not give us the money?"" Future Academies, which runs the school, told the BBC it had asked its caterers to improve the quality of its food parcels. Impact Food Group, the suppliers, said the pot contained ""bread mix"" and the only extra ingredient needed was water. The intention was to help parents create ""an interactive cooking experience"" with their children and to help with some food education at home, he said. The academy chain has said its own voucher scheme would start on 18 January. Rachel said she was not 'impressed' with the amount of food in one parcel she received Rachel Rodgers, a mother of three children aged 14, eight, and five, said she was not ""impressed"" with the amount of food provided in a parcel for her youngest child. Rachel, from Essex, says: ""I got so much more with the vouchers. I always looked for meat and vegetables on offer at the supermarket, so I made the vouchers stretch even more. ""What am I supposed to do with one potato?"" Rachel, who receives food parcels for her two youngest children and a voucher for her eldest, says it would have been ""nice to get a little more"" food, adding that ""even sandwich meat would have been good"". One mother said she was 'disappointed' by the food parcel she received for her two children, who are at secondary school One mother of three says she was ""disappointed"" by the contents of food parcels. The mum, who does not want to be identified, says the food box she received for two of her children at secondary school contained sliced frozen bread ""[which] did not stay fresh""; two slices of cheese that [were] ""hard and taste disgusting"", as well as beans, tinned tomatoes, apples, pasta and potatoes. She says her youngest child, who is in primary school, received a parcel of five rolls ""that were going stale"", grated cheese, three packs of crackers, five yoghurts and packs of biscuits. The mother adds: ""It is a good job I already had some cheese and bacon in the fridge, because this is disheartening. ""We have never had support feeding our children through the holidays even when I was young. We need help now."" The initial social media images of food parcels drew widespread criticism. Becca Lyon, head of child poverty campaigns at Save the Children, said the charity welcomed the return of the voucher scheme - adding that theproblems some families had with the vouchers last yearshould not be repeated. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner, called on companies to provide ""real food and real amounts that will really help families"". Meanwhile, Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the contents of the food parcels were ""not nutritionally sufficient for children and young people"". Parcels should contain food items rather than pre-prepared meals due to food safety considerations Minimise the fridge and freezer space that schools and families will need to store foods Contain items which parents can use to prepare healthy lunches for their child/children across the week Not rely on parents having additional ingredients at home to prepare meals Not contain items restricted under the school food standards Cater for pupils who require special diets, for example, allergies, vegetarians or religious diets - schools should ensure there are systems in place to avoid cross-contamination Contain appropriate packaging sizes for household use, rather than wholesale sizes Source:Department for Education,external In Wales, the provision of free school meals during the holidays has been extended by a year, and the Northern Ireland Executive made a pledge in November to provide free school meals in holidays until Easter 2022.

School food firm apologises after Rashford intervenes,"Marcus Rashford helps out at a food bank The company at the centre of an outcry over the size of food parcels going to the poorest pupils while schools are in lockdown in England has apologised. Marcus Rashford sought a meeting with the firm, Chartwells, after seeing a photo of the measly parcel on Twitter. The post, by someone calling herself Roadside Mum, was picked up by news outlets which then quizzed Downing Street officials about it. Some hours later the firm agreed the parcel had fallen short on quantity. Food parcels are currently being sent to school children in England who would normally get free school meals. The mother, who posted the photo of two carrots, two potatoes and a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items, said she calculated the cost to be only about Â£5. It was retweeted 15,000 times on Twitter and received 36,000 likes. The mother, who does not want to be identified, had thought it was supposed to last 10 school days and should have been worth Â£30. Chartwells said it was actually only intended to last one school week, but acknowledged it was insufficient. ""Public funds were charged Â£30. I'd have bought this for Â£5.22,"" said Twitter user Roadside Mum of the parcel she received It said in a statement: ""For clarity, this shows five days of free school lunches (not 10 days) and the charge for food, packing and distribution was actually Â£10.50 and not Â£30 as suggested. ""However, in our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance."" It added that its ""10-day hampers"" typically included a wide variety of nutritious food items to support the provision of lunches for children. Marcus Rashford hadshared images,externalof what appeared to be food parcels, saying they were ""not good enough"", that children should not go hungry and that ""we must do better"" - and he asked for a meeting with Chartwells. This prompted Downing Street to say it was ""completely unacceptable"", and that the parcels should be healthy and sufficient for the task. Children's minister Vicky Ford then began an investigation. What free school meals are children supposed to get? Lockdown meals teacher restarts deliveries A spokesman for Chartwells, which is owned by Compass group, said the firm would further enhance its food parcels following the Department for Education's additional allowance of Â£3.50 per week per child, in line with nutritional guidelines. The DfE, which has clear guidelines for parcels, will shortly be opening a similar voucher scheme to the one operational during the first school lockdown. During the lockdown, schools have been told to continue providing free meals for those who are learning at home and have currently been urged to use their usual caterers to offer food parcels. If schools cannot provide parcels, they can consider other arrangements which might include vouchers for local shops and supermarkets. The post prompted others to complain about the quality and quantity of the food in the parcels. Mother-of-three Kerry Wilks, from Redcar in north-east England, received a package at her youngest child's school containing a loaf of bread, three yoghurts, a tin of beans, tuna, two potatoes, four pieces of fruit and two slices of cheese. ""Even the teaching staff were quite embarrassed by giving them out,"" Ms Wilks, 38, said. ""I think what's really bugged me about it is the fact that there's two pieces of square cheese wrapped in cling film - I just find it so degrading."" Elaine Stacey, 41, from Reading, said she received a loaf of bread, weighed-out pasta in a sandwich bag, three jelly pots and a jar of Dolmio sauce to feed her 17-year-old son for a week. The parcel fell so short of what he needed that she said she was having to give up food herself so he would have enough. Chef Wayne Sullivan, who lives in the Cotswolds and has three school-age children, criticised school food more generally, saying he has been collecting packed lunches from his two boys' school daily and was ""horrified"" by the contents. How many children need free meals? 'I remember going to bed with hunger pains' Mr Sullivan, a former MasterChef contestant, told the BBC: ""There's probably about 55p worth of food. It's not been prepared with any care or attention, and nutritionally it's not balanced."" Wayne Sullivan said he was ""horrified"" by the contents of his boys' packed lunches Jack Monroe, food campaigner and chef, said the government should reinstate the voucher system ""that gave people dignity"" and allowed people to make choices about what they could feed themselves and their children ""in these difficult times"". Meanwhile, some head teachers have been going to extraordinary lengths to make sure their pupils can eat. Zane Powles, assistant head teacher at Western Primary School in Grimsby, said the night after the school lockdown was announced he went to the supermarket to get ""all our packed lunches for the next two days"". What he bought was ""much better"" and cheaper than what he gets from the company he uses, he said. This video can not be played Jack Monroe: Free school meals ""replaced with a poverty picnic"" A spokesman for Laca, the professional body for catering managers in schools, said it was ""disappointed"" to see the pictures of food parcels, adding they did not meet the standards. After his meeting with Chartwells, Rashford said: ""One thing that is clear is that there was very little communication with the suppliers that a national lockdown was coming. ""We MUST do better. Children shouldn't be going hungry on the basis that we aren't communicating or being transparent with plans. That is unacceptable."" Reacting to the initial images, Sir Keir Starmertweeted,externalthat the food appeared to be ""woefully inadequate"" and said it needed ""sorting immediately"". Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner, criticised the food parcels posted online and called on companies to provide ""real food and real amounts that will really help families"". ""Children need nutritious food for their lunch that helps them learn and keeps them warm in winter. Some lunch boxes I've seen are great but they all should be and there are too many examples of very poor ones on view today that are paltry, cheap and demeaning,""she said,external. Children's minister Vicky Ford said,external: ""Food parcels should cover all lunchtime meals and be nutritious. ""We've increased funding for parcels and will support local vouchers - national voucher also rolling out ASAP, working night and day on this.""

Four arrested over 'public nuisance' at hospitals,"The men were arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance at hospitals in Birmingham and Worcestershire Four men have been arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance at hospitals in the West Midlands. The men, aged between 31 and 37, were held in relation to incidents in Birmingham and Worcestershire between 31 December and 9 January. Earlier this month, police said they were investigating after people posted videos of supposedly empty hospital corridors on social media. The videos claiming Covid-19 was a hoax sparked an outcry from medical workers. West Mercia Police launched a joint investigation with West Midlands Police, after incidents were reported at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the Alexandra in Redditch. Hospitals in Worcester and Kidderminster also featured, before the footage was deleted. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands The West Mercia force confirmed it had arrested two men from Bromsgrove aged 31 and 34 as well as a 37 year-old man from Kidderminster and a fourth man, aged 34, from Droitwich. They were also detained relating to incidents in a park in Bromsgrove as well as the town centre. All four men have since been bailed with conditions not to enter any hospital in England unless they have a medical reason to do so.

2020 saw most excess deaths since World War Two,"The Covid pandemic has caused excess deaths to rise to their highest level in the UK since World War Two. There were close to 697,000 deaths in 2020 - nearly 85,000 more than would be expected based on the average in the previous five years. This represents an increase of 14% - making it the largest rise in excess deaths for more than 75 years. When the age and size of the population is taken into account, 2020 saw the worst death rates since the 2000s. This measure - known as age-standardised mortality - takes into account population growth and age. The data is only available until November - so the impact of deaths in December have not yet been taken into account - but it shows the death rate at that stage was at its highest in England since 2008. The data on deaths can be confusing. On one hand, excess deaths are at their highest since World War Two, while on the other, death rates, once age and size of population are taken into account, are at their worst level for a little over a decade 'only'. How should that be interpreted? Excess deaths are basically a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years. Clearly, 2020 saw a huge and unexpected rise in deaths because of the pandemic, just as World War Two led to a sudden jump. But in determining how much those jumps affected the chances of dying, a measure known as age-standardised mortality, which takes into account the age and size of the population, is important. It shows the pandemic has undone the progress made in the last decade or so. That is significant - especially given this has happened despite lockdowns and social-distancing measures to stop the spread of the virus. But it also helps put the death toll over the past 12 months in a wider context. King's Fund chief executive Richard Murray said the picture was likely to worsen, given Covid deaths were rising following the surge in infections over recent weeks. ""The UK has one of the highest rates of excess deaths in the world, with more excess deaths per million people than most other European countries or the US,"" he said. 'It will take a public inquiry to determine exactly what went wrong, but mistakes have been made. ""In a pandemic, mistakes cost lives. Decisions to enter lockdown have consistently come late, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes or the experiences of other countries. ""The promised 'protective ring' around social care in the first wave was slow to materialise and often inadequate, a contributing factor to the excess deaths among care home residents last year. 'Like many countries, the UK was poorly prepared for this type of pandemic."" Matthew Reed, of the end-of-life care charity Marie Curie said the focus on Covid should not hide the fact there has been a ""silent crisis"" of deaths at home. He said people have died prematurely in 2020 from other causes - with a big jump in deaths at home. ""We are concerned many have not had the care they needed,"" he added.

Pre-riot speech was 'totally acceptable' - Trump,"This video can not be played President Trump: ""Be careful what you wish for"" US President Donald Trump has said his speech before last week's deadly Capitol riot, when he urged his supporters to march on Congress, was ""totally appropriate"". Mr Trump dismissed as ""ridiculous"" efforts by Democrats in Congress to impeach him for inciting insurrection. He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on an article of impeachment on Wednesday. ""I think it's [the impeachment procedure] causing tremendous danger to our country and it's causing tremendous anger. I want no violence,"" Mr Trump said. Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? How many arrests so far from Capitol riots? How much of Trump's wall has been built? He was speaking as he left the White House for a visit to Texas to inspect a section of the border wall with Mexico. It was his first public appearance since the violence at the Capitol, in which five people died and dozens of people were injured, including at least 60 police officers. During his speech at the rally in Washington on 6 January, Mr Trump repeated his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud during the 3 November presidential election and urged his supporters to march on Congress. ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength,"" he told the crowd of several thousand supporters. He said Vice-President Mike Pence should have ""the courage to do what he has to do"", claiming without foundation that Mr Pence had the constitutional power to overturn the votes which were being formally tallied in Congress that day. ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,"" Mr Trump said. Dozens of people have since been detained in connection with last week's violence. Of the five who lost their lives, one was a police officer and one was a rioter shot dead by police. Meanwhile,a third US lawmaker has said he has Covid-19 after sheltering with maskless Republicans in a safe roomduring the events of 6 January. This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol The House of Representatives will vote on Tuesday to ask Mr Pence to invoke the 25th amendment to the constitution to remove Mr Trump from office - an idea Mr Pence is said to oppose. That vote is expected to fail, and so the House will then consider an article of impeachment against Mr Trump for ""incitement of insurrection"". Democrats have the majority in the House, so the impeachment vote is likely to pass. If it does, Mr Trump will become the first president in US history to be impeached twice. However, the impeachment will only lead to his removal from office if a two-thirds majority votes in favour of his conviction in the Senate. That would need the assent of a substantial number of Republicans and so far, few have shown any willingness to vote against a president from their own party. Speaking on his visit to Texas, Mr Trump brushed off the threat of removal from office under the constitution. ""The 25th amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration,"" he said. According to the New York Times, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has told confidants he is pleased Democrats want to impeach the president. The Kentucky senator believes the punishment will make it easier to cleanse Mr Trump from the Republican party, reports the newspaper. Mr McConnell has also told associates he believes the president committed impeachable offences, reports the Washington Post. Neither Mr McConnell nor his Republican counterpart in the House, Kevin McCarthy, plan to whip votes for or against impeachment, according to US media. On Tuesday afternoon, one of the most senior House Republicans, Liz Cheney, said she would vote to impeach Mr Trump. The Wyoming representative said in a statement: ""There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution."" Ms Cheney, the number three Republican in the lower chamber and the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, said Mr Trump had ""summoned this mob, assembled the mob, lit the flame of this attack"". Trump almost never shies away from a fight. He didn't on Tuesday, either. When asked about his incendiary speech to supporters outside the White House last week - the one many allege helped incite a riot - he did not apologise. Instead, he lashed out at his critics and cast himself as a victim. The Democrats, he said, were the problem. Their effort at impeachment, he explained, was ""causing tremendous danger to our country"", along with ""tremendous anger"". It was vintage Trump. In his final days, he is relying on a strategy borrowed from his beloved sport, mixed martial arts, to defend himself: throw quick punches and duck. Meanwhile in the West Wing, offices are emptying, cardboard boxes are lying on the floor next to people's desks, and aides are leaving in droves. Calls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots in Congress. The FBI is warning of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Mr Biden's inauguration. Up to 15,000 National Guard troops will be deployed in Washington DC for the event. The leaders of the US military's different branches, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, issued a message describing the riots as a direct assault on Congress and the constitution, Reuters news agency and CNN report. The message said Mr Biden would be inaugurated on 20 January and warned service members: ""Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law.""

"Edinburgh Woollen Mill rescue to save 2,000 jobs","A deal has been agreed for the sale of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home and BonmarchÃ© chains, which were on the brink of closure. The businesses went into administration last year after a collapse in sales due to the pandemic. Almost 2,000 staff will be kept on but as many as 260 stores could close. The buyers are a consortium of international investors who will inject fresh funds into the business, led by the existing management team. Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which sells mid-price knitwear and other clothing to older shoppers, is part of a stable of retail brands owned by billionaire businessman, Philip Day. Retail sales in 2020 worst on record, report says It is understood that Mr Day will effectively lend the group the money to buy the businesses which will be paid back over a number of years. The deal also covers two other brands in the group, value retailer BonmarchÃ©, and Ponden Home, an interiors chain based in the south east of England. The new owners plan to operate 246 stores across both the Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home brands, retaining 1,453 staff in those stores, the head office and distribution centres in Carlisle. However, 85 Edinburgh Woollen Mill stores and 34 Ponden Home stores have been closed permanently, with the loss of  485 jobs. Wakefield-based BonmarchÃ© will retain 72 of its stores and 531 staff including head office and distribution centre staff. The majority of its stores, 148 outlets, remain under review with staff on furlough. Administrators representing Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home said the deal represented the best chance to save stores and jobs, given the difficult outlook for UK retail. ""We regret that not all of Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home could be rescued,"" said Tony Wright, partner at FRP. ""This has resulted in a significant number of redundancies at a particularly challenging time of year and period of economic uncertainty."" Retail has been particularly hard hit by measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. Even when shops have been open many shoppers stayed away, wary of the health risks. The British Retail Consortium said consumers bought 5% less last year than the year before (not including food). Much of that custom switched from the High Street to online, making it harder for chains whose customers usually shop in person. Physical stores saw sales drop by a quarter, the BRC said. Other major brands including Topshop-owner Arcadia and Debenhams have also gone into administration, costing hundreds of jobs. ""Lockdowns have proved hugely damaging for mid-range fashion chains like Edinburgh Woollen Mill and BonmarchÃ© whose traditional customer base has not adapted so quickly to online shopping as younger shoppers,"" said Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The backers of this rescue deal clearly believe there is pent-up demand amongst core customers which will be released once the doors are flung open once more,"" she added. On Monday,Marks & Spencer announced it was buying Jaeger,another brand that had belonged to Philip Day's portfolio. Peacocks, another High Street fashion brand in the EWM group remains in administration.

Earl admits sex attack at castle homeThe Earl of Strathmore attacked a woman in her room during an event he was hosting at Glamis Castle.Tayside and Central Scotland,"Simon Bowes-Lyon put his victim through a 20-minute ordeal A Scottish earl has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a woman at his ancestral home in Angus. The Earl of Strathmore, Simon Bowes-Lyon, forced his way into the sleeping woman's room during a weekend event he was hosting at Glamis Castle. He repeatedly assaulted the 26-year-old victim and tried to pull off her nightdress during the 20-minute attack. Bowes-Lyon, 34 - who is the Queen's first cousin twice removed - has been placed on the sex offenders register. He was granted bail at Dundee Sheriff Court and sentence was deferred. Sheriff Alistair Carmichael also ordered Glamis Castle be assessed for its suitability to house Bowes-Lyon while under a tagging order. The court heard the woman fled the castle the morning after the attack on 13 February last year and flew home to report the matter to police. Both Police Scotland and the Metropolitan Police were involved in the investigation. Glamis Castle was the childhood home of the Queen Mother Outside court, Bowes-Lyon said he was ""greatly ashamed"" of his actions. He added: ""Clearly I had drunk to excess on the night of the incident. I should have known better. I recognise, in any event, that alcohol is no excuse for my behaviour. ""I did not think I was capable of behaving the way I did but have had to face up to it and take responsibility. ""My apologies go, above all, to the woman concerned, but I would also like to apologise to family, friends and colleagues for the distress I have caused them."" Glamis Castle, near Forfar, has been the seat of the Bowes-Lyon family since 1372. It was the childhood home of the Queen Mother, and the Queen's sister Princess Margaret was born there. Bowes-Lyon was a great-great nephew of the Queen Mother.

Hundreds march over arrested man's death,"This video can not be played Hundreds march over arrested man's death Hundreds of people have joined a march organised following claims a man died hours after being released by police in Cardiff. The family of Mohamud Mohammed Hassan, 24, claim hewas assaulted in custody. More than 300 people took part in a march from the city centre to Cardiff Bay police station. South Wales Police said it found no evidence of excessive force. The police watchdog said initial tests showed Mr Hassan was not killed by any injuries. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said toxicology tests were now being carried out and it was awaiting the full post-mortem results. Earlier, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the reports of Mr Hassan's death were ""deeply concerning"". Mr Hassan was arrested at his Roath home on Friday on suspicion of breach of the peace but released without charge on Saturday morning. This video can not be played Mohamud Mohammed Hassan's death in Cardiff investigated Mr Hassan's aunt Zainab Hassan told BBC Wales she had seen Mr Hassan within an hour of his release. ""He was released on Saturday morning with lots of wounds on his body and lots of bruises,"" she said. ""He didn't have these wounds when he was arrested and when he came out of Cardiff Bay police station, he had them."" In a virtual session of the Welsh Parliament on Monday, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ""Every effort should be made to seek the truth of what happened."" He said he wanted to know why Mr Hassan was arrested and what happened during his arrest. Mr Hassan's aunt Zainab Hassan said she saw him after his release ""Why did this young man die?,"" he added. Mr Price said any inquiry should not be prejudged, but asked if the first minister would ""help the family find those answers"". In response, Mr Drakeford said reports of the story were ""deeply concerning"". ""Our thoughts must be with the family of a young man who was... a fit and healthy individual,"" the Cardiff West MS said. Mark Drakeford said he was deeply concerned by the reports Mr Drakeford, who said the death must be ""properly investigated"", said the first step in any inquiry would be to allow the IOPC to carry out their work, which he said he expected ""to be done rigorously and with full and visible independence"". He added that if there were things the Welsh Government could do ""I will make sure that we attend properly to those"". Protesters on Tuesday afternoon chanted ""no justice, no peace"" and called for the police force to release CCTV of Mr Hassan's time in custody. Some held signs that read ""Black Lives Matter"". Protesters on Tuesday afternoon marched from the city centre to Cardiff Bay In a statement on Monday, South Wales Police said Mr Hassan was arrested at his home in Newport Road on Friday night and taken to Cardiff Bay police station. He was released at 08:30 GMT on Saturday and officers returned to the property at about 22:30 following his death. It added: ""As part of the South Wales Police investigation CCTV and body-worn video has already been, and will continue to be, examined. ""This will assist in establishing and understanding the events that took place. ""Early findings by the force indicate no misconduct issues and no excessive force."" Protesters were heard chanting ""no justice, no peace"" Catrin Evans, the IOPC's director for Wales, said its investigation would focus on Mr Hassan's arrest, the journey in a police van to custody and his time at Cardiff Bay police station, including whether relevant assessments were made before he was released. She said they would be ""urgently examining the extensive relevant CCTV footage and body-worn video"" and would be speaking to the officers involved as well as witnesses who saw his arrest on Friday evening and his movements the next day after leaving custody. She added: ""I send my condolences to Mr Hassan's family and friends, and to everyone affected by his sad death. ""We are aware of concerns being expressed and questions being asked about use of force by police officers. We will look carefully at the level of force used during the interaction and I would urge people show patience while our inquiries, which will take some time, are made."" Ms Evans added: ""An interim report from a post-mortem examination is awaited. ""Preliminary indications are that there is no physical trauma injury to explain a cause of death, and toxicology tests are required.""

"Lockdown lifting 'unlikely' as deaths pass 5,000","This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Lockdown likely to extend to February Scotland's first minister has said the country's current lockdown is ""very unlikely"" to be lifted at the end of the month. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed that more than 5,000 people have now died after testing positive for the virus. A review of the current restrictions is due to be carried out at the end of January. Ms Sturgeon said it was possible that there would be no easing at that point. A further 54 deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours - bringing the total by that measure to 5,023. But the most recent figures from the National Records of Scotland - which record all deaths registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate - put the total at 6,686. Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing that the figures were a reminder of the toll the virus had taken. And she said every death had caused heartbreak to friends, families and loved ones across the country. The people who have died with Covid-19 Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? The first minister also said Scotland's NHS would be under far greater pressure if the current restrictions had not been put in place on Boxing Day. And she urged people not to raise their expectations about what will be announced when the lockdown review is completed in a fortnight as wholesale lifting of the restrictions was ""very unlikely"". She added: ""There may not even be any lifting of these restrictions as soon as the end of January - we will have to consider all of that carefully and set it out in due course."" All of mainland Scotland and some islands were placed into level four restrictions on 26 December, with schools remaining closed to most pupils until at least the end of the month. A further 1,875 positive cases of the virus were recorded on Monday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 153,423. The number of people in hospital with the virus stands at 1,717 - an increase of 53 since yesterday and higher than the peak of about 1,500 in the first wave in April. Of these, 133 patients are intensive care units, with Ms Sturgeon saying that the virus was putting ""very acute pressure"" on hospitals. The first minister also said that 175,942 people in Scotland had received their first vaccine dose by Monday. Opposition parties have claimed that the rollout of the vaccine has been ""sluggish"" in Scotland compared to south of the border - a charge that the government denies. And they have called for greater transparency over how many people are being given the jab every day. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said on Monday that the government was aiming to vaccinate about 560,000 people in Scotland by 31 January. Non-essential shops have been closed in Scotland since 26 December The Scottish government has previously said it is concerned that too many people have not been following the ""stay at home"" rules that are in place across the whole of the mainland and some islands. Ministers have been discussing the possibility of imposing tougher rules on click and collect shopping and takeaway food, with an announcement expected to be made on Wednesday. Retail industry representatives have described click and collect services as a ""lifeline"" for struggling businesses amid the forced closure of all non-essential shops. And they said they had not been shown any evidence that click and collect was driving transmission of the virus. Ms Sturgeon told her daily coronavirus briefing that the government may not stop click and collect services altogether. But she added: ""If we are saying to people right now that you should not be out of your home for shopping unless it is essential, then do we need to have click and collect for non-essential services instead of having that for delivery?"" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Scotland that he did not want to see further restrictions put in place unless there was evidence that they would have the desired effect. He also suggested that restricting click and collect would simply result in more people going back into supermarkets to do their shopping. The Scottish government is also under pressure to lift the the current ban on public Sunday worship, with a group of 500 church leaders from across the UK - including 200 in Scotland - insisting that there is ""no evidence of any tangible contribution to community transmission through churches in Scotland"". In a letter to the first minister, they claim that the ban may be unlawful and accuse the government of failing to understand that ""Christian worship is an essential public service, and especially vital to our nation in a time of crisis"". A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Test and Protect tells us where people were in their 48-hour infectious period. ""So we know that on one day last week the seven-day number for places of worship was 120, and data from yesterday shows the seven-day number for places of worship is 38, underlining the essential decision to require places of worship to close for public health reasons."" Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that everyone arriving in Scotland from overseas will need to show proof of a negative test from Friday. The test will need to be ""highly reliable"", the first minister said, and will need to have been from the previous three days - although young children may be exempt from the restriction. Those travelling from countries not on the quarantine exemption list will still need to self-isolate on arrival. The new rules, which will also come into force in England, werefirst outlined last week. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Tesco, Asda and Waitrose ban shoppers without masks","Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have become the latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. Retailers have been criticised for not doing enough to stop people breaking Covid rules as infections spread. But enforcement of face coverings is officially a police responsibility. However, supermarkets can deny entry to their premises which is private property, and can call the police if someone refuses to follow the rules or becomes abusive. Morrisons and Sainsbury's ban maskless shoppers Supermarkets: 'We're lucky if people wear masks' Senior police figures have reportedly said there is little officers can do to enforce the rules in shops because they are so busy. But policing minister Kit Malthouse said that they would offer ""backup if things go seriously wrong"". ""What we hope is that in the vast majority of cases the enforcement, or the reminders if you like, put in place by the store owners will be enough,"" he told BBC News. A Tesco spokeswoman said the supermarket chain had decided to strengthen its policies. ""To protect our customers and colleagues, we won't let anyone into our stores who is not wearing a face covering, unless they are exempt in line with government guidance,"" she said. ""We are also asking our customers to shop alone, unless they're a carer or with children. To support our colleagues, we will have additional security in stores to help manage this."" An Asda spokesman said if customers had forgotten their face coverings, it would continue to offer them one free of charge. But he added: ""Should a customer refuse to wear a covering without a valid medical reason and be in any way challenging to our colleagues about doing so, our security colleagues will refuse their entry."" This video can not be played How to wear your mask. Hint: it's not any of these three options Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations at Waitrose, said: ""We've listened carefully to the clear change in tone and emphasis of the views and information shared by the UK's governments in recent days. ""By insisting on the wearing of face coverings, over and above the social distancing measures we already have in place, we aim to make our shops even safer for customers."" On Tuesday, Sainsbury's told the BBC it did not have the power to deny entry to shoppers without masks. However, trials showed customers complied more when asked to wear masks by security guards at the door, it said. In an interview with the BBC, Sainsbury's boss, Simon Roberts, said ""we are not going to ban customers"". But he urged shoppers to wear a mask and shop alone. ""By doing that we will help keep everybody safe,"" he said. The Co-op also said it would not ban shoppers without masks from entering, and instead urged customers to take responsibility for wearing a face covering when visiting its stores, as it was mandatory by law. Boss of Co-op Food Jo Whitfield said: ""We've increased our in-store messaging to remind customers and government guidance does state that the police can take measures if members of the public don't comply with this law."" Iceland said it would take a similar approach, adding the vast majority of its customers continued to shop in compliance with the law. ""In view of the rising tide of abuse and violence being directed at our store colleagues, we do not expect them to confront the small minority of customers who aggressively refuse to comply with the law,"" a spokesman added. In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines.

"Covid-19 deaths pass 5,000 mark in Wales","Rhondda Cynon Taf has the highest death rate from coronavirus in Wales - with another 34 hospital deaths in the latest week There have now been more than 5,100 deaths in Wales involving Covid-19 since the pandemic began. The latest weekly figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show 310 deaths in the week ending 1 January, which is 32 more than the week before. This is nearly 42.6% of all deaths. Cwm Taf Morgannwg saw the highest numbers of weekly deaths in Wales, the most since the end of April at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. There were 76 deaths in the area - including 66 in hospitals and six in care homes. Looking at council areas, Rhondda Cynon Taf had the second highest number of hospital deaths across England and Wales, with 34. The London borough of Newham had 35. Parents' Covid warning after daughter, 25, dies Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Around half of Covid intensive care patients dying The ONS again urged caution when interpreting this week's figures, due to the Christmas and new year holidays, which will affect the number of registrations. The total number of Covid deaths in Wales, up to and registered by 1 January, was 4,963. But when deaths registered over the following few days are included, there was a total of 5,169. The Aneurin Bevan health board, with 68 deaths registered involving Covid, also had its highest number in a single week since the end of April. Hywel Dda health board reported 37 deaths - its highest weekly figure since the pandemic began. Of these, 18 were patients in hospital from Carmarthenshire and 10 were hospital patients from Pembrokeshire. Swansea Bay health board had 61 deaths in this week. The Swansea council area itself had the seventh highest number of hospital deaths across England and Wales. There were 36 deaths in Cardiff and Vale, 25 deaths in Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales - 10 of which were hospital deaths in Wrexham - and seven in Powys. All counties recorded at least one death involving Covid-19. This map shows three valleys areas in south Wales among the highest for crude mortality rates involving Covid in the pandemic so far Rhondda Cynon Taf, with 685 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales up to the latest week, followed by Cardiff with 578. When looking at crude death rates - based on the number of deaths compared to local populations - Wales has three of the five worst across England and Wales. Rhondda Cynon Taf has 283 deaths per 100,000 in total so far in the pandemic. Merthyr Tydfil is second with 253.6 and Blaenau Gwent is ranked fourth. So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average. Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. In Wales, the number of deaths fell from 825 to 727 in the latest week, but this was still 209 deaths (40.3%) higher than the five-year average for that week. This is the second highest proportion after London. The ONS figures report where doctors mention Covid-19 on death certificates, including confirmed and suspected cases. They include deaths occurring in all places, not only hospitals and care homes but also people's own homes. It has been estimated that Covid is the underlying cause in around 90% of these deaths and not just a contributory factor.

'Loads of shoppers breaking rules' in supermarkets,"This video can not be played Covid lockdown: Are supermarkets following the rules? Supermarket workers are facing abuse for challenging shoppers not wearing masks during the pandemic, staff say. One Mold supermarket worker said she was challenging people every day and seeing ""loads of people walking around"" the store without masks and in groups. The Welsh Government has hinted rules will betightened amid concerns Covid-19 rules are not being followed. ""This is not a social event, come in on your own, not as a family of five,"" the supermarket worker said. Supermarket workers spoke to BBC Radio Wales as Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the ""onus"" was on supermarkets to make sure shoppers abided by the rules. There has been an ""escalation of abuse"" towards supermarket staff in the last nine months, and the role of policing such rules must not fall on those on the shop floor, Nick Ireland Divisional Officer of the Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) said. He said measures in stores had ""rolled back"", with many no longer enforcing systems, and people walking the wrong way down one-way systems, and ""whole families"" shopping with just one basket. Meanwhile Bally Auluk, an area organiser in Cardiff and Barry for Usdaw, said abuse towards shopworkers was happening on ""a daily and weekly basis"". He said retailers and the Welsh Government should ""start protecting shop workers"" after dealing with members himself who were ""threatened with physical violence and spat on"". ""Customers now are treating it almost like it was last year, that it's not a problem, that is where the big issues arises,"" he said. The Welsh Government is in discussions about bringing in ""more visible"" coronavirus regulations. Morrisons and Sainsbury's had pledged to challenge shoppers not wearing face coverings in store, unless they have a medical exemption. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose are the latest supermarkets to follow the moveand challenge those who flout the rules. Under coronavirus rules, people must wear face coverings in order to enter shops across the UK, while supermarkets should have social distancing and strict hygiene measures in place. The Welsh Government has been in talks with retailers on how to improve safety and return to the strict observance of social distancing from the first lockdown, although no new guidance has been issued. Teachers and supermarket staff 'not key workers' Wales' supermarket staff 'having to referee' shopping rules Shop workers given bodycams after being 'coughed and spat on' First Minister Mark Drakeford said he had heard concerns from people ""expressing anxiety"" about a lack of ""visible protections"" in supermarkets, such as limited numbers allowed in store, hand sanitiser and security on doors. The Mold supermarket worker said staff had been told not to challenge people not wearing masks, and had seen people being yelled at. Jane, who did not give her last name, told BBC Wales customers were offered a mask on the way in, but many did not want them. ""You do see a lot of customers walking around without a mask on,"" she said. ""Of course there are people with hidden disabilities who can't wear a mask but there can't be that many of them."" Jane said enforcement needed to be greater, but it should not be led by the shopfloor staff.""We're told not to challenge people as we don't know someone's personal situation and we don't want to face any abuse if they don't want to wear it or don't agree with it,"" she said. ""At the moment people will ask politely, but I have witnessed quite a few occasions where customers have been verbally abusive to the person greeting them on their way in. ""There needs to be someone enforcing this, it can't be left to retail staff: whether its a police officer or a security guard."" Supermarket aisles carrying non-essential items are closed off again, as they were during the firebreak lockdown One security guard at a supermarket in Aberdare said he had had more ""hassle"" working in the past 10 months at the store, than from drinkers while working as a nightclub doorman for more than 20 years. ""The attitude towards yourself... they don't appreciate that you're standing there for 12 hours a day, they don't understand how hard it is to try and keep people distancing,"" he toldDot Davies on BBC Radio Wales. ""When they go inside the shop it all goes out the window... we keep the two metres outside, but we've got people coming outside to tell us we should be in there sorting it out."" One supermarket manager said the lengths people were going to in order to shop together were ""ridiculous"", with families coming in with a number of trolleys or baskets in order not to be challenged. ""We've seen families turning up to go shopping for a basket shop, it's just not on,"" said Mr Ireland, who called on supermarket staff to be prioritised for vaccines. He suggested those who do not observe the rules should be banned and fined. But one mother said that she had no choice but to shop with her children, and she had been unable to get a click and collect or delivery slot. ""It's easy to get caught up in the fear of it, but some people are at the shops as they have no choice,"" she said. Others have spoken of shop staff themselves not wearing masks. James Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said it was ""everyone's responsibility"" to abide by the rules, rather than for shop workers to enforce. ""Doing that [enforcement of rules] in a small store, where you don't have lots of colleagues around, has been a trigger for more abuse and even violence,"" he said. Mr Lowman said making businesses Covid secure was down to the local authority, while individuals' behaviour was a matter for police, but ""in practicality"" it is everyone's responsibility. But Mr Gething said the ""onus"" for getting shoppers to follow Covid-19 rules, such as wearing masks, social-distancing and cordoning off non-essential items, was on the supermarket managers. ""[It needs to be made] clear that you do need to wear a mask unless you can demonstrate that you have a particular exemption,"" he said. ""I don't think there's any lack of understanding. We've been through this before and I do think a number of supermarkets are going to go and make clear there are a range of items that are off-limits for shoppers coming in.

Irish PM to apologise over mother-and-baby homes,"The scandal became an international news story when ""significant human remains"" were found on the grounds of a former home in County Galway The Irish government is to apologise after an investigation found an ""appalling level of infant mortality"" in the country's mother-and-baby homes. Established in the 19th and 20th Centuries, the institutions housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage. About 9,000 children died in the 18 institutions under investigation. The government said the report revealed the country had a ""stifling, oppressive and brutally misogynistic culture"". Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said the report, which can be read in fullhere,external, described a ""dark, difficult and shameful chapter"" of Irish history. ""As a nation we must face up to the full truth of our past,"" he said. 'I need to know what happened to my brothers' Timeline: Irish mother and baby homes controversy The commission that investigated the homes found that the number of children who died was about 15% of all those who were born in the institutions. There were about 56,000 unmarried mothers and 57,000 children in the homes investigated by the commission. This video can not be played PJ Haverty explains what life was like for him after being born in Tuam mother-and-baby home The greatest number of admissions was in the 1960s and early 1970s. Many children born in the homes were adopted or taken to orphanages run by Catholic nuns. The report said ""the women and children should not have been in the institutions"" and that many women suffered emotional abuse. The investigators said it appeared there was ""little kindness"" shown to the mothers and ""this was particularly the case"" during childbirth, which many of the women found to be ""a traumatic experience"". Mr Martin is to issue a full apology on behalf of the state in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) on Wednesday. Speaking on Tuesday, he said ""one hard truth"" was that ""all of society was complicit"" in the scandal. This video can not be played Taoiseach  MicheÃ¡l Martin: ""We treated women and children exceptionally badly"" ""We did this to ourselves as a society - we treated women exceptionally badly; we treated children extremely badly,"" said the taoiseach. ""We had a completely warped attitude to sexuality and intimacy and young mothers and their sons and daughters were forced to pay a terrible price for that dysfunction. ""As a society we embraced judgementalism, moral certainty, a perverse religious morality and control which was so damaging. ""But what was very striking was the absence of basic kindness."" Archbishop Martin apologised to survivors for the long-lasting hurt and emotional distress they suffered The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, said he accepted that the Church was part of a culture in which ""people were frequently stigmatised, judged and rejected"". ""For that, and for the long-lasting hurt and emotional distress that has resulted, I unreservedly apologise to the survivors and to all those who are personally impacted by the realities it uncovers,"" he said. ""I believe the Church must continue to acknowledge before the Lord and before others, its part in sustaining what the report describes as a 'harshâ¦ cold and uncaring atmosphere'."" The Church needed to find ways of reaching out to those who have spoken of their experiences in the report, he said. Archbishop Martin urged anyone who could help locate the burial places of those who died in the mother and baby homes to come forward. Children's Minister Roderic O'Gorman said the report showed that for decades a ""pervasive stigmatisation of unmarried mothers and their children robbed those individuals of their agency and sometimes their future"". The hidden story of African-Irish children The girls of Bessborough The commission has made 53 recommendations, including compensation and memorialisation. Its report stated that while mother-and-baby homes existed in other countries the proportion of unmarried mothers who were in the institutions in Ireland was probably the highest in the world. Catherine Corless carried out research in a bid to find the graves of infants who died at Tuam ""In the years before 1960 mother-and-baby homes did not save the lives of 'illegitimate' children; in fact they appear to have significantly reduced their prospects of survival,"" stated the report. ""The very high mortality rates were known to local and national authorities at the time and were recorded in official publications."" The Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, which ran some of the homes, said it was a ""matter of great sorrow to us that babies died while under our care"". ""We especially want to recognise and accept today that so many women who were shunned and shamed by society did not find the support and level of care they needed and deserved at such a dreadful and painful time in their lives,"" said the group. ""We want to sincerely apologise to those who did not get the care and support they needed and deserved."" The homes became an international news story in 2014 after a substantial amount of human remains was found in the grounds of a former home in Tuam, County Galway. Local historian Catherine Corless found that796 children had been buried there. Catherine Corless watched the taoiseach speak to survivors of the homes before the report was published In response, the Irish government established anindependent Mother-and-Baby Homes Commission. In an interim report, the commission found that some babies were buried in 20 chambers inside what was a larger decommissioned sewage tank. Speaking after the publication of the final report, Ms Corless was critical of how the government had presented it to the survivors of the homes. The taoiseach had spoken to them in an online briefing on Tuesday before the report was made public. ""It was highfalutin talk... a lot of waffle, you could say,"" she said. ""A lot of the survivors are very, very upset, they feel they're just being thrown redress - pay them off and just forget about everything."" Annette McKay's mother was sent to the home in Tuam when she was 17 and believes her older sister could be one those buried there. She has always hoped her sister's remains could be exhumed and identified, however while the report talks about a process of ""respectful reburial"", it will not begin until 2022. She told PA: ""I'm very sad. I was never optimistic. I was always full energy, that a fight could be won, and now I don't feel that. I feel defeated."" ""It's very, very hard today to look at a picture of my mother and think 'another year mum, and we're no further on'. It's been a tough day."" The Tuam home was demolished but a shrine was later erected on the site The commission said it found ""very little evidence that children were forcibly taken from their mothers"". It continued: ""It accepts that the mothers did not have much choice but that is not the same as 'forced' adoption'."" The report contains witness testimony from women who said they had not consented to their child being adopted. Niall Boylan, who was born in the St Patrick's home on the Navan road in Dublin, has criticised the report's failure to deal with forced adoption. ""The report doesn't acknowledge that there was abuse, and they don't acknowledge that there was forced adoption. It's ridiculous.""

Eleven ambulances were sent to a care home in Cornwall at the weekend after a coronavirus outbreak, it has been confirmed. Coronavirus rapidly spread to 25 residents at Trengrouse care home in Helston and many staff were off sick or self-isolating despite best efforts to prevent the spread, bosses said.

With new lockdowns now in force in England, most of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we've been answering some of your questions. Cheryle Locke asked: ""My 89-year-old father had the vaccine a week ago. Is it safe to hug him now?"" If someone is vaccinated they should still follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. Thatâs because no vaccine is 100% effective and it is not yet clear if immunisation will stop people catching and spreading coronavirus, even though it protects against severe illness and death. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection. However, if you have alreadyformed a support bubblewith your father, you can have close physical contact with him.

Campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford helped secured changes last year We reported earlier on the outcry about the supply of food parcels to children on free school meals in England during lockdown after the contents of one company's hamper went viral on social media. A mother had posted a photo of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of food items, and questioned whether the contents were sufficient. It came to the attention of footballer Marcus Rashford, who secured changes to government policy on free school meals last year after launching a campaign on the issue. He sought a meeting with the supplier, Chartwells. The company has now apologised, but stressed the hamper was not for five days - not 10 - as had been suggested on social media. But it said: ""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.""

The NHS trust with the largest intensive care capacity in the UK has confirmed it now has almost 200 more Covid patients in its four hospitals than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. University Hospitals Birmingham said it has 873 patients with Covid-19 in its hospitals and 125 in intensive care. It comes after the Health Service Journal
published a leaked email to staff which suggested the trust risked being ""overwhelmed"". A hospital spokesperson said: ""We continue to expand our
intensive care and acute medical teams so they are able to treat the rising
number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery
including cancer operations. ""Every member of staff will be
supported by the Trust in delivering the best care wherever they are
working.""  Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The police are stepping up enforcement because they believe many people
breaking the Covid regulations are doing so because they are stubborn, not
because they donât understand what is allowed. The public, police, and legal experts do struggle to keep up with
the ever-changing rules. But the organisers of a party on a boat in Hertfordshire, the passengers
on a minibus heading for Wales, and the couple who travelled 120 miles to ""watch seals"" would have struggled to explain to the officers issuing them with
fines that they were confused. Those were clear breaches.  More complicated is the fine line
between the law - which police officers can enforce - and the government
guidance, which they canât. No law says exercise can only be conducted once a day, or for a specific
duration. These are pieces of firm guidance, along with the request to ""stay
local"", which resulted in criticism of the prime minister after his bike ride
in east London. It would be difficult to set a distance limit which would work for both
people living in rural areas and inner cities.  Impossible to prove that a
65-minute run was in breach of the law. Which is why the success of the measures will rely on personal
responsibility in the end. And why some experts are saying that different
messages such as ""act like youâve got it"" or ""thanks for doing the right thing"" might
cut through better than a list of regulations to be obeyed.   Ben WrightBBC political correspondent National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt says a limit on
how far people can travel for exercise in England would be difficult for police
to enforce. Earlier today the Metropolitan Police said exercise should begin and end at
someoneâs front door if possible. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wonât
speculate about tougher rules but says there are âendless discussionsâ within
government about tightening the measures. It wonât happen today but it clearly
could soon. In the meantime she hopes to clear up confusion and firm up
compliance but is insisting the current rules are clear. In a very stern voice. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Questions keep cropping up
about when key workers, such as supermarket staff and teachers, will be
vaccinated. There was one at todayâs
televised briefing. Some argue key workers should
be part of this first phase of the vaccination programme, which will see all over-50s, front-line health and care staff, and younger adults with health conditions
vaccinated by the end of April. But the assessment by the
governmentâs scientific advisers is pretty simple. They have targeted those who
are most at risk of dying if infected. Someone who is over the age
of 75 â the age group that is being prioritised immediately for vaccination by
mid-February - has a one in eight chance of dying if they catch Covid. By comparison, a person who
is 40 has a one in 1,000 chance. And that risk almost entirely
lies with those in that age group who have a health condition and therefore
would be part of this first phase anyway.  Reality Check At Home Secretary Priti Patelâs
news conference, Ian from Preston asked why the rules are more relaxed than
they were during the first lockdown last year if the new variant is more infectious. We know the government
recognises the situation is more serious because the UK is at threat level five - the highest level - which means there is a
danger of the NHS being overwhelmed within
21 days. In the first lockdown the UK was
only at threat level four. But the restrictions appear less
severe than they were in March. For example, support bubbles and childcare
bubbles exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds are open when they were
closed last time. And communal worship is still allowed as long as social distancing is observed. But one significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops and public transport. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened: Priti Patel mentioned the latest government statistics on coronavirus during the briefing this evening. A further 1,243 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to thelatest figures on the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external That brings the UK total to 81,960. The UK has also recorded a further 45,533 positive coronavirus test results. And 2,431,648 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But
what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started
falling. There have now been two consecutive days where newly
diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the
average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in
London, the South East and East of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. The North West is
causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having
any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the
tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look
like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising â patients being admitted at
the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago â but it does at
least offer a glimmer of hope. Alan Tolhurst from Politics Home asks whether the vaccination centres are Covid secure and have adequate ventilation. The home secretary cites the government's vaccination delivery plan and says the sites have spaced-out cubicles and other features to support social distancing and protect staff, following all of the guidance from Public Health England. Dr Diwakar says ""absolutely rigid"" infection controls are in place, including in the ExCel centre in London, which he visited recently. He says gels and masks are provided and the last thing staff want is to inadvertently pass on the virus to those being vaccinated, particularly the over-80s and other vulnerable people. ""We have spent months preparing to set these centres up and we are guided by really strict rules."" With that, Ms Patel brings the presser to an end.  The home secretary is asked how the public can understand what constitutes staying local,after two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk but had the penalties withdrawn. Priti Patel says the police ""exercise their professional judgement"" and points out that the fine in that case was rescinded. ""When we have people dying... we all have to exercise our judgement,"" she says. The new lockdown in England allows people to exercise with one other person from another household in an open public space, but says you should staytwo metres apartfrom each other. Ms Patel says: ""When it comes to exercising, again I do say stay local. Stay local is absolutely crucial. ""By all means take your daily exercise, but it's up to all of us in the right way to exercise that judgement as to how we do it - not socialising, making sure we're acting in the right way, staying away from other people."" She says that is ""clearly what the prime minister"" did when herode his bicycle seven miles from home. She adds: ""We all have to ask ourselves what can we do to keep everyone safe."" Martin Hewitt says ""this is unprecedented territory"" for police. ""Sometimes mistakes will be made but we always have looked at those, we've looked at those quickly... and we have said when we've got something wrong."" The home secretary says the government is ""absolutely working"" on getting frontline workers such as police, teachers and supermarket staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Diane from York, Priti Patel acknowledged they were ""at occupational risk of coming in in contact with the virus"". But she said the government was following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation who had ""thought carefully"" when it identified the top priority groups to receive the vaccine first. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, said he would ""obviously"" back the call for vaccinations for police as the ""nature of policing is that those officers are having daily to deal with people where they have no idea whether they are infected"".  Next up is the Telegraph's Gordon Rayner, who says countries such as France and Italy were able to cope with 40,000 patients going into hospital without asking everyone to stay at home. Could the NHS have been better prepared, he asks? Dr Diwakar said the NHS spent the summer learning the lessons of the first wave and preparing for the winter, investing in critical care. Hundreds of extra beds have been made available in London and patients have been moved elsewhere in the UK where extra capacity is available and that is how the NHS is coping. On a separate question, Ms Patel says there is a ""live"" debate within government on the current rules but says she will not speculate on whether they could be tightened up further. ""All rules are constantly under review within government but right now we are focusing very much on compliance enforcement"". Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel has reinforced the governmentâs
âstay at homeâ message. But to what extent is that being
followed and how has our behaviour changed compared with Englandâs first national
lockdown last March? Apple and Google record mobility
data which is pulled together by recording the location histories on people's
mobile devices and comparing it to a pre-coronavirus level. On Friday, the number of people
driving was down by 31% compared with the pre-Covid level. But it was down 63% on the first
Friday of the first lockdown in March 2020. Similar data shows that a higher
proportion of people were in workplaces, parks and grocery shops last Friday
compared with the first lockdown. But this could be in part down to
more places, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents, being open
this time. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. Sam Coates from Sky asks whether the government is concentrating too much on enforcing the rules in spaces like parks when they should be looking at workplaces and public transport. Ms Patel says ""when it comes to the rules... our target and our objective is to save lives, this isn't about picking out individual groups"". ""When it comes to the enforcement of those rules, it is right that we go after those breaches,"" she says, referring to things like parties. But she adds that ""this is a collective effort"" and that police are working with local authorities and other bodies to enforce the rules. She thanks supermarkets that have ""stepped up their efforts"" to make sure people are social distancing. On workplaces, Martin Hewitt says: ""That is ultimately the responsibility of any business or owner in that space."" He adds: ""Primarily our space is the public space."" ITV's Dan Hewitt asks whether the rules are tough enough to contain the virus and whether they need to be clarified, referring to the row over Boris Johnson's Olympic Park bike ride. Martin Hewitt answers first, saying there has been a lot of focus on the definition of local and he doesn't think it is sensible to mandate a certain distance people can travel as this would be challenging for the police to enforce. He says exemptions for exercise are fair and they are easily understood. People need to ask themselves whether their actions are essential and being done in the safest way possible. Ms Patel says exercise is important for people's health and wellbeing and says most people are adhering to the stay local guidance. ""The rules are tough enough,"" she adds. ""The message is clear. ""The more we follow the rules is the sooner we can drive this awful, atrocious virus down."" Mark Easton from the BBC asks Priti Patel why the rules of this lockdown aren't as tough as they were last spring. She says: ""The rules are actually very simple and clear - we are meant to stay at home and only leave home for a very very limited number of reasons."" She adds that ""everyone has to be conscientious in our actions"" and echoes Dr Diwakar's comment that people should act as if they have the virus. ""The rules are clear,"" she says. Martin Hewitt says: ""From our perspective we will carry on engaging [with] people... but I think the rules are clear."" He adds: ""You're right that the regulations have shifted over that period of time... but I think it's very clear what people need to do."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Edinburgh Woollen Mill rescue to save 2,500 jobs","A deal has been agreed for the sale of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home and BonmarchÃ© chains, which were on the brink of closure. The businesses went into administration last year after a collapse in sales due to the pandemic. Almost 2,000 staff will be kept on but as many as 260 stores could close. The buyers are a consortium of international investors who will inject fresh funds into the business, led by the existing management team. Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which sells mid-price knitwear and other clothing to older shoppers, is part of a stable of retail brands owned by billionaire businessman, Philip Day. Retail sales in 2020 worst on record, report says It is understood that Mr Day will effectively lend the group the money to buy the businesses which will be paid back over a number of years. The deal also covers two other brands in the group, value retailer BonmarchÃ©, and Ponden Home, an interiors chain based in the south east of England. The new owners plan to operate 246 stores across both the Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home brands, retaining 1,453 staff in those stores, the head office and distribution centres in Carlisle. However, 85 Edinburgh Woollen Mill stores and 34 Ponden Home stores have been closed permanently, with the loss of  485 jobs. Wakefield-based BonmarchÃ© will retain 72 of its stores and 531 staff including head office and distribution centre staff. The majority of its stores, 148 outlets, remain under review with staff on furlough. Administrators representing Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home said the deal represented the best chance to save stores and jobs, given the difficult outlook for UK retail. ""We regret that not all of Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home could be rescued,"" said Tony Wright, partner at FRP. ""This has resulted in a significant number of redundancies at a particularly challenging time of year and period of economic uncertainty."" Retail has been particularly hard hit by measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. Even when shops have been open many shoppers stayed away, wary of the health risks. The British Retail Consortium said consumers bought 5% less last year than the year before (not including food). Much of that custom switched from the High Street to online, making it harder for chains whose customers usually shop in person. Physical stores saw sales drop by a quarter, the BRC said. Other major brands including Topshop-owner Arcadia and Debenhams have also gone into administration, costing hundreds of jobs. ""Lockdowns have proved hugely damaging for mid-range fashion chains like Edinburgh Woollen Mill and BonmarchÃ© whose traditional customer base has not adapted so quickly to online shopping as younger shoppers,"" said Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The backers of this rescue deal clearly believe there is pent-up demand amongst core customers which will be released once the doors are flung open once more,"" she added. On Monday,Marks & Spencer announced it was buying Jaeger,another brand that had belonged to Philip Day's portfolio.

John Lewis suspends click and collect due to virus,"John Lewis is suspending its click and collect services and tightening safety measures after a ""change in tone"" from the government over the virus. The department store will also pause in-home services, unless they are ""essential to customers' wellbeing"". The retailer said it felt the changes were right with the country at a ""critical point in the pandemic"". However customers will be able to collect John Lewis orders from Waitrose stores. Waitrose, which belongs to the John Lewis Partnership, is also tightening rules over face coverings, following moves from the other supermarkets to make face masks mandatory for shoppers unless they have a medical exemption. John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries Tesco, Asda and Waitrose ban shoppers without masks ""We've listened carefully to the clear change in tone and emphasis of the views and information shared by the UK's governments in recent days,"" said Andrew Murphy, Executive Director, Operations. ""While we recognise that the detail of formal guidance has not changed, we feel it is right for us - and in the best interests of our Partners and customers - to take proactive steps to further enhance our Covid-security and related operational policies."" John Lewis said click and collect from its department stores would be switched off for new orders from the end of Tuesday. Existing orders and bookings for services, such as installing washing machines, will still be carried out, if customers wish to proceed, but there will be no further bookings for non-essential services. Many other shops from coffee chains to craft suppliers are offering click and collect services. However, with the continued rise in coronavirus cases the government is examining ways to reduce social contact further. The book chain Waterstones stopped offering click and collect services from its shops at the start of the current lockdown. Marks and Spencer said it was continuing to offer customers the opportunity to collect other items at its food halls, which are still open for grocery shopping.

Stick with the rules during lockdown - Patel,"Home Secretary Priti Patel uses the Downing Street briefing to say she will back police who enforce England's coronavirus lockdown Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, says the rules ""are clear and we need to abide by them to protect the NHS and save lives"" Last year saw the largest increase in UK deaths in a single year since 1940, according to provisional ONS figures In 2020, nearly 697,000 deaths were registered, compared with an average of nearly 606,000 each year between 2015 and 2019 UK police chiefs are under increasing pressure to enforce the lockdown laws Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said tighter measures in England cannot be ruled out Scotland and Wales have both passed 5,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic In the US, two Congress members have tested positive after hiding in a crowded room during the Capitol riot Malaysia has declared a nationwide state of emergency to combat a rise in cases Globally, almost two million people have died with Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by James Clarke and Rob Corp We're going to bring our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to an end now. We'll be back again tomorrow. Before we go, here are some of the main stories from the day:  Today's live coverage was written by Hazel Shearing, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Alexandra Fouche and Gavin Stamp, and edited by James Clarke, Rob Corp and Vicky Baker.  Eleven ambulances were sent to a care home in Cornwall at the weekend after a coronavirus outbreak, it has been confirmed. Coronavirus rapidly spread to 25 residents at Trengrouse care home in Helston and many staff were off sick or self-isolating despite best efforts to prevent the spread, bosses said. Three residents were taken to hospital. Others needed oxygen and are being looked after at the home. Bosses said staff and residents were being ""tested very regularly"" and ""we'll never know how it came into the home"". Read more here. With new lockdowns now in force in England, most of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we've been answering some of your questions. Cheryle Locke asked: ""My 89-year-old father had the vaccine a week ago. Is it safe to hug him now?"" If someone is vaccinated they should still follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. Thatâs because no vaccine is 100% effective and it is not yet clear if immunisation will stop people catching and spreading coronavirus, even though it protects against severe illness and death. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection. However, if you have alreadyformed a support bubblewith your father, you can have close physical contact with him. Read more answers to your questions - including about the rollout of vaccination, new international travel rules and school closures -here. Campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford helped secured changes last year We reported earlier on the outcry about the supply of food parcels to children on free school meals in England during lockdown after the contents of one company's hamper went viral on social media. A mother had posted a photo of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of food items, and questioned whether the contents were sufficient. It came to the attention of footballer Marcus Rashford, who secured changes to government policy on free school meals last year after launching a campaign on the issue. He sought a meeting with the supplier, Chartwells. The company has now apologised, but stressed the hamper was not for five days - not 10 - as had been suggested on social media. But it said: ""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance."" Read more about this story here. The NHS trust with the largest intensive care capacity in the UK has confirmed it now has almost 200 more Covid patients in its four hospitals than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. University Hospitals Birmingham said it has 873 patients with Covid-19 in its hospitals and 125 in intensive care. It comes after the Health Service Journal
published a leaked email to staff which suggested the trust risked being ""overwhelmed"". A hospital spokesperson said: ""We continue to expand our
intensive care and acute medical teams so they are able to treat the rising
number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery
including cancer operations. ""Every member of staff will be
supported by the Trust in delivering the best care wherever they are
working.""  Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The police are stepping up enforcement because they believe many people
breaking the Covid regulations are doing so because they are stubborn, not
because they donât understand what is allowed. The public, police, and legal experts do struggle to keep up with
the ever-changing rules. But the organisers of a party on a boat in Hertfordshire, the passengers
on a minibus heading for Wales, and the couple who travelled 120 miles to ""watch seals"" would have struggled to explain to the officers issuing them with
fines that they were confused. Those were clear breaches.  More complicated is the fine line
between the law - which police officers can enforce - and the government
guidance, which they canât. No law says exercise can only be conducted once a day, or for a specific
duration. These are pieces of firm guidance, along with the request to ""stay
local"", which resulted in criticism of the prime minister after his bike ride
in east London. It would be difficult to set a distance limit which would work for both
people living in rural areas and inner cities.  Impossible to prove that a
65-minute run was in breach of the law. Which is why the success of the measures will rely on personal
responsibility in the end. And why some experts are saying that different
messages such as ""act like youâve got it"" or ""thanks for doing the right thing"" might
cut through better than a list of regulations to be obeyed.   Ben WrightBBC political correspondent National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt says a limit on
how far people can travel for exercise in England would be difficult for police
to enforce. Earlier today the Metropolitan Police said exercise should begin and end at
someoneâs front door if possible. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wonât
speculate about tougher rules but says there are âendless discussionsâ within
government about tightening the measures. It wonât happen today but it clearly
could soon. In the meantime she hopes to clear up confusion and firm up
compliance but is insisting the current rules are clear. In a very stern voice. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Questions keep cropping up
about when key workers, such as supermarket staff and teachers, will be
vaccinated. There was one at todayâs
televised briefing. Some argue key workers should
be part of this first phase of the vaccination programme, which will see all over-50s, front-line health and care staff, and younger adults with health conditions
vaccinated by the end of April. But the assessment by the
governmentâs scientific advisers is pretty simple. They have targeted those who
are most at risk of dying if infected. Someone who is over the age
of 75 â the age group that is being prioritised immediately for vaccination by
mid-February - has a one in eight chance of dying if they catch Covid. By comparison, a person who
is 40 has a one in 1,000 chance. And that risk almost entirely
lies with those in that age group who have a health condition and therefore
would be part of this first phase anyway.  Reality Check At Home Secretary Priti Patelâs
news conference, Ian from Preston asked why the rules are more relaxed than
they were during the first lockdown last year if the new variant is more infectious. We know the government
recognises the situation is more serious because the UK is at threat level five - the highest level - which means there is a
danger of the NHS being overwhelmed within
21 days. In the first lockdown the UK was
only at threat level four. But the restrictions appear less
severe than they were in March. For example, support bubbles and childcare
bubbles exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds are open when they were
closed last time. And communal worship is still allowed as long as social distancing is observed. But one significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops and public transport. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened: Priti Patel mentioned the latest government statistics on coronavirus during the briefing this evening. A further 1,243 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to thelatest figures on the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external That brings the UK total to 81,960. The UK has also recorded a further 45,533 positive coronavirus test results. And 2,431,648 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But
what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started
falling. There have now been two consecutive days where newly
diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the
average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in
London, the South East and East of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. The North West is
causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having
any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the
tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look
like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising â patients being admitted at
the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago â but it does at
least offer a glimmer of hope. Alan Tolhurst from Politics Home asks whether the vaccination centres are Covid secure and have adequate ventilation. The home secretary cites the government's vaccination delivery plan and says the sites have spaced-out cubicles and other features to support social distancing and protect staff, following all of the guidance from Public Health England. Dr Diwakar says ""absolutely rigid"" infection controls are in place, including in the ExCel centre in London, which he visited recently. He says gels and masks are provided and the last thing staff want is to inadvertently pass on the virus to those being vaccinated, particularly the over-80s and other vulnerable people. ""We have spent months preparing to set these centres up and we are guided by really strict rules."" With that, Ms Patel brings the presser to an end.  The home secretary is asked how the public can understand what constitutes staying local,after two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk but had the penalties withdrawn. Priti Patel says the police ""exercise their professional judgement"" and points out that the fine in that case was rescinded. ""When we have people dying... we all have to exercise our judgement,"" she says. The new lockdown in England allows people to exercise with one other person from another household in an open public space, but says you should staytwo metres apartfrom each other. Ms Patel says: ""When it comes to exercising, again I do say stay local. Stay local is absolutely crucial. ""By all means take your daily exercise, but it's up to all of us in the right way to exercise that judgement as to how we do it - not socialising, making sure we're acting in the right way, staying away from other people."" She says that is ""clearly what the prime minister"" did when herode his bicycle seven miles from home. She adds: ""We all have to ask ourselves what can we do to keep everyone safe."" Martin Hewitt says ""this is unprecedented territory"" for police. ""Sometimes mistakes will be made but we always have looked at those, we've looked at those quickly... and we have said when we've got something wrong."" The home secretary says the government is ""absolutely working"" on getting frontline workers such as police, teachers and supermarket staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Diane from York, Priti Patel acknowledged they were ""at occupational risk of coming in in contact with the virus"". But she said the government was following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation who had ""thought carefully"" when it identified the top priority groups to receive the vaccine first. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, said he would ""obviously"" back the call for vaccinations for police as the ""nature of policing is that those officers are having daily to deal with people where they have no idea whether they are infected"".  Next up is the Telegraph's Gordon Rayner, who says countries such as France and Italy were able to cope with 40,000 patients going into hospital without asking everyone to stay at home. Could the NHS have been better prepared, he asks? Dr Diwakar said the NHS spent the summer learning the lessons of the first wave and preparing for the winter, investing in critical care. Hundreds of extra beds have been made available in London and patients have been moved elsewhere in the UK where extra capacity is available and that is how the NHS is coping. On a separate question, Ms Patel says there is a ""live"" debate within government on the current rules but says she will not speculate on whether they could be tightened up further. ""All rules are constantly under review within government but right now we are focusing very much on compliance enforcement"". Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel has reinforced the governmentâs
âstay at homeâ message. But to what extent is that being
followed and how has our behaviour changed compared with Englandâs first national
lockdown last March? Apple and Google record mobility
data which is pulled together by recording the location histories on people's
mobile devices and comparing it to a pre-coronavirus level. On Friday, the number of people
driving was down by 31% compared with the pre-Covid level. But it was down 63% on the first
Friday of the first lockdown in March 2020. Similar data shows that a higher
proportion of people were in workplaces, parks and grocery shops last Friday
compared with the first lockdown. But this could be in part down to
more places, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents, being open
this time. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. Sam Coates from Sky asks whether the government is concentrating too much on enforcing the rules in spaces like parks when they should be looking at workplaces and public transport. Ms Patel says ""when it comes to the rules... our target and our objective is to save lives, this isn't about picking out individual groups"". ""When it comes to the enforcement of those rules, it is right that we go after those breaches,"" she says, referring to things like parties. But she adds that ""this is a collective effort"" and that police are working with local authorities and other bodies to enforce the rules. She thanks supermarkets that have ""stepped up their efforts"" to make sure people are social distancing. On workplaces, Martin Hewitt says: ""That is ultimately the responsibility of any business or owner in that space."" He adds: ""Primarily our space is the public space."" ITV's Dan Hewitt asks whether the rules are tough enough to contain the virus and whether they need to be clarified, referring to the row over Boris Johnson's Olympic Park bike ride. Martin Hewitt answers first, saying there has been a lot of focus on the definition of local and he doesn't think it is sensible to mandate a certain distance people can travel as this would be challenging for the police to enforce. He says exemptions for exercise are fair and they are easily understood. People need to ask themselves whether their actions are essential and being done in the safest way possible. Ms Patel says exercise is important for people's health and wellbeing and says most people are adhering to the stay local guidance. ""The rules are tough enough,"" she adds. ""The message is clear. ""The more we follow the rules is the sooner we can drive this awful, atrocious virus down."" Mark Easton from the BBC asks Priti Patel why the rules of this lockdown aren't as tough as they were last spring. She says: ""The rules are actually very simple and clear - we are meant to stay at home and only leave home for a very very limited number of reasons."" She adds that ""everyone has to be conscientious in our actions"" and echoes Dr Diwakar's comment that people should act as if they have the virus. ""The rules are clear,"" she says. Martin Hewitt says: ""From our perspective we will carry on engaging [with] people... but I think the rules are clear."" He adds: ""You're right that the regulations have shifted over that period of time... but I think it's very clear what people need to do."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Retail sales 'worst for 25 years',"Retailers suffered their worst annual sales performance on record in 2020, driven by slump in demand for fashion and homeware products, figures show. While food sales growth rose 5.4% on 2019, non-food fell about 5%, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. It meant an overall fall of 0.3% in a year dominated by the Covid-19 impact, the worst annual change since the BRC began collating the figures in 1995. Christmas offered little cheer, with much of the High Street still closed. ""Physical non-food stores, including all of non-essential retail, saw sales drop by a quarter compared with 2019,"" said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive. ""Christmas offered little respite for these retailers, as many shops were forced to shut during the peak trading period,"" she said. The 5.4% rise in food sales was fuelled by shoppers flocking to supermarkets and online grocers to ensure they were stocked up during the pandemic. UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better' 'Worst year for High Street job losses in 25 years' In December, total retail sales increased by 1.8% as shoppers spent more in the run-up to Christmas. Like-for-like sales for the month were up 4.8% as overall shop takings were still affected by restrictions and temporary closures. Online non-food sales jumped by 44.8% in December, according to the new figures, as a higher proportion of shopping took place online. The BRC's sales monitor is collated with the consultancy KPMG, whose UK head of retail, Paul Martin, said: ""In the most important month for the retail industry, there was some positive growth due to the ongoing shift of expenditure from other categories such as travel and leisure. ""Once again we saw big swings in the types of products being purchased and the channels used for shopping, with much of the growth taking place online, where nearly half of all non-food purchases were made."" But he warned that the new lockdown would worsen conditions for many non-essential shops and the High Street generally. Last week, a report from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, the CRR said.

The lockdown rules explained,"All the UK's rules requiring people to wear masks in indoor spaces like shops and restaurants have come to an end. But guidance remains in place for some settings. Covid: Five things we still need to keep an eye on Are we ready for last Covid rule to be ditched? End of Covid regulations: What if I'm still worried? Scotland's legal restrictions on face coverings have come to an end - but the Scottish government says itstrongly recommends wearing a mask,externalin indoor public spaces and on public transport. People with symptoms are no longer being asked to take a PCR test - they're now advised to stay at home while they're unwell. Testing for the general population has ended. The Scottish government has also confirmedit will ""switch off"" the domestic part of its vaccine passport scheme. What is the Covid advice in Scotland? Masks are no longer required in shops or on public transport - although they are recommended - but they remain compulsory in health and social care settings.

Could I be fined for exercising?,"The police's role in the coronavirus pandemic is simple: to ensure we follow national lockdown restrictions. But in practice, that is a huge challenge for officers who are being asked to monitor behaviour that, until March last year, was perfectly legal. Police chiefs have followed a system called ""The Four Es"". Before fines are issued to rule-breakers, police will first: Engage with people, to ask why they appear to be breaking the rules Explain the law, stressing the risks to public health and the NHS Encourage them to change their behaviour The fourth ""E"" is ""Enforce"" by issuing penalty notices, as a last resort. Covid rule-breakers are now ""increasingly likely"" to be finedby officers, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said. The police have a legal duty to make sure the rules are enforced, alongside council, environmental health and trading standards officers. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live If you break coronavirus regulations, you could get a fixed penalty notice , the Covid equivalent of a traffic offence like speeding. Since March, 32,000 have been issued in England and Wales. Penalties rose sharply during England's November lockdown. Almost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out as police moved more quickly to enforcement. In England and Northern Ireland fines start at Â£200. Fines start at Â£60in Wales,external, andin Scotland,external, although this is reduced to Â£30 if paid within 28 days. Large parties can also be shut down by the police - with fines of up to Â£10,000. In extreme circumstances, you could be prosecuted and face an even greater fine imposed by a court. Hundreds of people were caught on a drone camera at an illegal party by West Midlands Police Yes. All of England is now in a ""tier four"" national lockdown, with similar measures in place across the rest of the UK. Under the new lockdown law, you must stay at home unless you have a ""reasonable excuse"" to be outside. Your home includes property such as a garden, shed or garage - and also access to it. The government's lockdown guidance sets outexamples of reasonable excuses,external. Police won't fine you for leaving home to go shopping for essential goods, or to use a business that can remain open, or for going to work or education, training or childcare. There are other reasonable excuses - such as helping other people in their moment of need. Police chiefs are telling frontline officers to use their judgement if they come across a situation not defined in the regulations. If you want to take part in a protest, the law does not define that as a reasonable excuse to leave home. There is, however, an exception for joining a picket as part of lawful industrial action. Exercise is one of the reasonable excuses for being outside in a public space. You cannot be fined for exercising. But there has been enormous confusion since last March over how long people could exercise for. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove pronounced that spring that he thought half an hour was enough. There are also questions over how far you can go to exercise. Boris Johnson has beencriticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Streetto go cycling during lockdown. There are no restrictions in law in England on how you exercise and for how long. You cannot exercise in groups, but you can run or go on a wander with someone else from your household, support bubble or one person you don't live with. The government's Covid guidance for exercise explains that law - andmixes it with a non-legal recommendation,externalto only go out once a day - and to stay local. It says local ""means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live"", but that has no legal force. Derbyshire Police have been taking the ""stay local"" principle seriously. Officers have issued tickets to people who drive five miles to their local beauty spot - includingtwo women accused of an illegal picnicbecause they were carrying takeaway cups of tea. They might. This refers to the ban on ""gatherings"". The last-but-one version of the restrictions made it a potential crime to ""mingle"". That language has now gone from the law - but the rules are far stricter. While the law in England doesn't criminalise bumping into someone in the street, you can no longer meet anyone socially - other than those in your household, support bubble or people you care for. The Home Office has given the police an extra Â£30m to pay for Covid patrols in England and Wales. Over Christmas there were more than 800 fines for what Home Secretary Priti Patel says were ""egregious"" breaches of the rules. The National Police Chiefs' Council hasn't abandoned the Four Es - but expect more fines and more officers asking people what they are doing. Leicester woman fined for Wales trip to see horse Group fined for playing dominoes in restaurant Border police patrols to double after travel ban Police patrols were stepped up around the Scotland-England border around Christmas For instance, the Metropolitan Police has told officers to issue fines ""more quickly"" to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches. Derbyshire Police, who famouslyput a drone up over hikersin the first lockdown, has issued a similar warning. Yes - while in shops and on public transport. You could face a fixed penalty notice if you don't. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? If you have returned from an overseas Covid hotspot, or have been told by the NHS Test and Trace system to stay at home, you must quarantine for 10 days. The police can now check the NHS Test and Trace database to investigate a tip-off about a quarantine-breaker. Police won't get to see your personal health records.

Supermarkets 'lucky if people wear masks',"Skye works in a supermarket in Lincoln ""People did take the first lockdown a lot more seriously - in this lockdown we're lucky if people are wearing masks."" Skye Henson is 23 and works in a supermarket in Lincoln and has worked throughout the pandemic. She says now is definitely the toughest time to be working as people are no longer respecting rules like social distancing. ""A good 30% of the people that come into our shop don't wear masks and just outright don't think it's an issue,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""They don't consider us to be in any kind of danger, so for me I do think a lot of it is the public putting us at risk."" Who needs to wear a face covering while shopping? Tesco, Asda and Waitrose ban shoppers without masks Are lockdown rules changing? and other questions Her words come asthe government has warned shoppersto follow the rules in supermarkets. Skye says she's faced a lot of abuse from the public when trying to enforce mask-wearing too. ""He was coughing so I asked him to put on his mask and he said, 'You can't expect me to wear it, I can't breathe in it' and he was very nasty about it,"" she says. Supermarkets ask customers to wear masks, but they don't force them to She has a message for people visiting supermarkets. ""Even if you don't think you're personally at risk, there's people who us workers have at home that are. ""I can't see my family throughout this whole thing because they are high risk, so please be considerate of us. ""Also be respectful of us, we're just doing our job and we shouldn't have to face abuse in our workplace - we're not getting paid enough!"" Lucy wants people coming into her supermarket to wear masks Nearly 300 miles away in Edinburgh, Lucy Scyner has been having a similar experience during her supermarket shifts. ""Social distancing with customers has gone out the window,"" she says. ""During Christmas it was absolutely mental with people coming in and reaching over each other, reaching over you, they're up in your face and you want to be as polite as possible and ask people to step back. ""I personally feel anxious about going in - our store has done everything they can to make us safe but it's when customers are in that you feel unsafe."" The 18-year-old balances her job with college and says people not sticking to the rules makes her life a lot more stressful. ""I was working on Friday and I had a customer come right up in my face who wasn't wearing a mask,"" she says. ""I don't think my job is being appreciated enough - I know that a lot of people in supermarkets are young and people like me and are also students. Our work is being overlooked."" Lucy wants shoppers to start taking their store visits more seriously. ""Treat it the way we treated it at the start of the pandemic where people were being a lot more careful with what they were doing. ""People are forgetting how dangerous it actually is. Everybody's scared so if we all work together and we all wear masks and wash our hands we can end it sooner."" Supermarkets are reacting to the concerns of their workers, withMorrisons now sayingthey will ban shoppers who refuse to wear a mask when they don't have a medical exemption. Paddy Lillis, from union USDAW, which represents shop workers, says ""people are being verbally abused, having things thrown at them and spit on - it's downright nasty."" ""We've written to supermarkets saying they've got to reinforce the message that social distancing, the numbers [of people] in stores, and face coverings needs to be strictly reinforced."" He says he's also contacted the governments in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to see if shop rules can be enforced by law too. Liv spoke to Newsbeat in October 2020 Liv works at a supermarket in Ipswich and had a different view on whether people should wear masks when she spoke to Newsbeat back in October. ""I do think masks give people a sense of security and a little bit of extra protection but I wouldn't say it bothers me whether people wear them or not,"" she said. ""I know the government says it's compulsory in some places but on the whole I do think it's a personal choice."" The 28-year-old also thinks people who are exempt get a backlash if they're not wearing them. ""If you see someone not wearing a mask, just mind your business. As long as you're two metres away from them, I don't see how it affects you."" Liv's supermarket doesn't order people to wear masks because customers could have an underlying health condition they don't want to disclose. The British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, says shops are meeting their responsibilities in encouraging mask wearing. It says they're communicating the rules through things like signs, in-store announcements and other reminders. But more general rules across the UK now sayface masks are compulsoryin shops. Liv's store has brought in a marshal who ""politely"" asks people without masks if they'd like to wear one. She says she feels safe at work and says social distancing rules are being followed. The advice from the World Health Organisation is that masks should beworn in publicplaces. But for Liv, there'snot enough evidencethey work. ""I've worked through the whole pandemic in a supermarket. At the start we were told we didn't need to wear them, so it's just a bit far-fetched for me now."" Masks became mandatory inside shops in the summer - after the first lockdown. Scotland was the first nation to require masks in shops in early July, followed by England later that month. They became mandatory in Northern Ireland in August and in Wales in September 2020. Liv does have one request though when it comes to mask wearing. ""What annoys me the most is when people are wearing masks but don't wear them properly so it's not over their nose,"" she says. ""You're either going to wear it or you're not going to wear it.""

"Play your part in fight against Covid, says PatelThe home secretary says she will back police to enforce virus rules, as another 1,243 die in the UK.UK","This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""Our selfless police officers... will enforce the regulations and I will back them to do so"" People have been urged to ""play your part"" and follow Covid rules by Home Secretary Priti Patel, who says she will back police to enforce laws. At a No 10 briefing, Ms Patel said a minority were ""putting the health of the nation at risk"" by flouting rules. Police are ""moving more quickly to issuing fines"", she added, with nearly 45,000 fixed penalty notices issued across the UK. Another 1,243 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid. And there have beena further 45,533 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK,external. Meanwhile, another 145,076 people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 20,768 a second dose, bringing the totals respectively to 2,431,648 and 412,167. What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? Could police fine me for exercising? Can I hug my vaccinated dad? And other questions Four arrested over 'public nuisance' at hospitals At the briefing, Ms Patel said: ""My message today to anyone refusing to do the right thing is simple: if you do not play your part, our selfless police officers - who are out there risking their own lives every day to keep us safe - they will enforce the regulations. ""And I will back them to do so, to protect our NHS and to save lives."" It comes after the UK's most senior police officer saidlockdown rule-breakers were more likely to be finedas Covid laws would be enforced ""more quickly"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said her officers had been forced to break up parties, despite hospitals in London struggling to cope with rising patient numbers. Chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Martin Hewitt, who also spoke at the Downing Street briefing, said people should be asking themselves whether their reason for leaving home was ""truly essential"". He stressed that police officers had been ""putting themselves at risk in order to keep people safe"", and said it had been ""disappointing"" to see some of the behaviour by rule-breakers. He said examples of recent breaches included: a boat party in Hertfordshire with a bar and DJ booth, where more than 40 people had each paid Â£30 for a ticket a minibus full of people from different households travelling from Cheltenham to Wales for a walk a Â£10,000 fine in Surrey for the organiser of a party who was trying to claim it was a business event Mr Hewitt said he made ""no apology"" for police issuing fines, and warned people breaking rules - such as by organising parties or not wearing face coverings on public transport - to ""expect"" a fine. Asked if there needed to be more clarity on the guidance around exercise and staying local, Mr Hewitt said it would be wrong to put a ""particular distance"" on how far people could exercise from their home - as it would be too difficult for police to enforce. He said it was right there was an exception to allow people to exercise, but insisted it was the public's responsibility to make sure they were doing so safely. There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started falling. There has now been two consecutive days where newly diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in London, the south east and east of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. Thenorth west of Englandis causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having any significant impact, so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising - patients being admitted at the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago - but it does at least offer a glimmer of hope. Later in the news conference, NHS medical director for London Dr Vin Diwakar said the capital'sNightingale hospital has reopenedand was admitting patients to help with the coronavirus spread. He told reporters it was taking non-Covid patients to help free up beds in London's hospitals. Dr Diwakar warned that if levels of hospitalisation in the capital continued to rise then more patients would need to be transferred out of London, adding that the NHS across the country was under pressure. In Birmingham, 200 doctors are being redeployed to one of the country's largest intensive care units as it nears capacity. TheUniversity Hospitals Birmingham Trust saidthere were 873 patients with Covid-19 in their hospitals, with 125 in intensive care. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Earlier, crime and policing minister Kit Malthouse said people have a ""duty"" to make this lockdown ""the last one"". ""We are urging the small minority of people who aren't taking this seriously to do so now, and [we say] to them that, if they don't, they are much more likely to get fined by the police,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Dame Cressida told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move towards greater enforcement was ""common sense"" rather than a show of ""dictatorial policing"". Fines start at Â£200 inEngland,externalandNorthern Ireland,external, and Â£60 inWales,externalandScotland,external. Large parties can be shut down by the police, with fines of up to Â£10,000. England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - all of which are in charge of deciding and enforcing their own coronavirus restrictions.

Coronavirus rapidly spread to 25 residents at Trengrouse care home in Helston and many staff were off sick or self-isolating despite best efforts to prevent the spread, bosses said. Three residents were taken to hospital. Others needed oxygen and are being looked after at the home. Bosses said staff and residents were being ""tested very regularly"" and ""we'll never know how it came into the home"". Read more here. With new lockdowns now in force in England, most of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we've been answering some of your questions. Cheryle Locke asked: ""My 89-year-old father had the vaccine a week ago. Is it safe to hug him now?"" If someone is vaccinated they should still follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. Thatâs because no vaccine is 100% effective and it is not yet clear if immunisation will stop people catching and spreading coronavirus, even though it protects against severe illness and death. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection. However, if you have alreadyformed a support bubblewith your father, you can have close physical contact with him.

Campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford helped secured changes last year We reported earlier on the outcry about the supply of food parcels to children on free school meals in England during lockdown after the contents of one company's hamper went viral on social media. A mother had posted a photo of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of food items, and questioned whether the contents were sufficient. It came to the attention of footballer Marcus Rashford, who secured changes to government policy on free school meals last year after launching a campaign on the issue. He sought a meeting with the supplier, Chartwells. The company has now apologised, but stressed the hamper was not for five days - not 10 - as had been suggested on social media. But it said: ""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.""

The NHS trust with the largest intensive care capacity in the UK has confirmed it now has almost 200 more Covid patients in its four hospitals than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. University Hospitals Birmingham said it has 873 patients with Covid-19 in its hospitals and 125 in intensive care. It comes after the Health Service Journal
published a leaked email to staff which suggested the trust risked being ""overwhelmed"". A hospital spokesperson said: ""We continue to expand our
intensive care and acute medical teams so they are able to treat the rising
number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery
including cancer operations. ""Every member of staff will be
supported by the Trust in delivering the best care wherever they are
working.""  Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The police are stepping up enforcement because they believe many people
breaking the Covid regulations are doing so because they are stubborn, not
because they donât understand what is allowed. The public, police, and legal experts do struggle to keep up with
the ever-changing rules. But the organisers of a party on a boat in Hertfordshire, the passengers
on a minibus heading for Wales, and the couple who travelled 120 miles to ""watch seals"" would have struggled to explain to the officers issuing them with
fines that they were confused. Those were clear breaches.  More complicated is the fine line
between the law - which police officers can enforce - and the government
guidance, which they canât. No law says exercise can only be conducted once a day, or for a specific
duration. These are pieces of firm guidance, along with the request to ""stay
local"", which resulted in criticism of the prime minister after his bike ride
in east London. It would be difficult to set a distance limit which would work for both
people living in rural areas and inner cities.  Impossible to prove that a
65-minute run was in breach of the law. Which is why the success of the measures will rely on personal
responsibility in the end. And why some experts are saying that different
messages such as ""act like youâve got it"" or ""thanks for doing the right thing"" might
cut through better than a list of regulations to be obeyed.   Ben WrightBBC political correspondent National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt says a limit on
how far people can travel for exercise in England would be difficult for police
to enforce. Earlier today the Metropolitan Police said exercise should begin and end at
someoneâs front door if possible. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wonât
speculate about tougher rules but says there are âendless discussionsâ within
government about tightening the measures. It wonât happen today but it clearly
could soon. In the meantime she hopes to clear up confusion and firm up
compliance but is insisting the current rules are clear. In a very stern voice. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Questions keep cropping up
about when key workers, such as supermarket staff and teachers, will be
vaccinated. There was one at todayâs
televised briefing. Some argue key workers should
be part of this first phase of the vaccination programme, which will see all over-50s, front-line health and care staff, and younger adults with health conditions
vaccinated by the end of April. But the assessment by the
governmentâs scientific advisers is pretty simple. They have targeted those who
are most at risk of dying if infected. Someone who is over the age
of 75 â the age group that is being prioritised immediately for vaccination by
mid-February - has a one in eight chance of dying if they catch Covid. By comparison, a person who
is 40 has a one in 1,000 chance. And that risk almost entirely
lies with those in that age group who have a health condition and therefore
would be part of this first phase anyway.  Reality Check At Home Secretary Priti Patelâs
news conference, Ian from Preston asked why the rules are more relaxed than
they were during the first lockdown last year if the new variant is more infectious. We know the government
recognises the situation is more serious because the UK is at threat level five - the highest level - which means there is a
danger of the NHS being overwhelmed within
21 days. In the first lockdown the UK was
only at threat level four. But the restrictions appear less
severe than they were in March. For example, support bubbles and childcare
bubbles exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds are open when they were
closed last time. And communal worship is still allowed as long as social distancing is observed. But one significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops and public transport. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened: Priti Patel mentioned the latest government statistics on coronavirus during the briefing this evening. A further 1,243 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to thelatest figures on the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external That brings the UK total to 81,960. The UK has also recorded a further 45,533 positive coronavirus test results. And 2,431,648 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But
what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started
falling. There have now been two consecutive days where newly
diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the
average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in
London, the South East and East of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. The North West is
causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having
any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the
tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look
like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising â patients being admitted at
the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago â but it does at
least offer a glimmer of hope. Alan Tolhurst from Politics Home asks whether the vaccination centres are Covid secure and have adequate ventilation. The home secretary cites the government's vaccination delivery plan and says the sites have spaced-out cubicles and other features to support social distancing and protect staff, following all of the guidance from Public Health England. Dr Diwakar says ""absolutely rigid"" infection controls are in place, including in the ExCel centre in London, which he visited recently. He says gels and masks are provided and the last thing staff want is to inadvertently pass on the virus to those being vaccinated, particularly the over-80s and other vulnerable people. ""We have spent months preparing to set these centres up and we are guided by really strict rules."" With that, Ms Patel brings the presser to an end.  The home secretary is asked how the public can understand what constitutes staying local,after two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk but had the penalties withdrawn. Priti Patel says the police ""exercise their professional judgement"" and points out that the fine in that case was rescinded. ""When we have people dying... we all have to exercise our judgement,"" she says. The new lockdown in England allows people to exercise with one other person from another household in an open public space, but says you should staytwo metres apartfrom each other. Ms Patel says: ""When it comes to exercising, again I do say stay local. Stay local is absolutely crucial. ""By all means take your daily exercise, but it's up to all of us in the right way to exercise that judgement as to how we do it - not socialising, making sure we're acting in the right way, staying away from other people."" She says that is ""clearly what the prime minister"" did when herode his bicycle seven miles from home. She adds: ""We all have to ask ourselves what can we do to keep everyone safe."" Martin Hewitt says ""this is unprecedented territory"" for police. ""Sometimes mistakes will be made but we always have looked at those, we've looked at those quickly... and we have said when we've got something wrong."" The home secretary says the government is ""absolutely working"" on getting frontline workers such as police, teachers and supermarket staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Diane from York, Priti Patel acknowledged they were ""at occupational risk of coming in in contact with the virus"". But she said the government was following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation who had ""thought carefully"" when it identified the top priority groups to receive the vaccine first. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, said he would ""obviously"" back the call for vaccinations for police as the ""nature of policing is that those officers are having daily to deal with people where they have no idea whether they are infected"".  Next up is the Telegraph's Gordon Rayner, who says countries such as France and Italy were able to cope with 40,000 patients going into hospital without asking everyone to stay at home. Could the NHS have been better prepared, he asks? Dr Diwakar said the NHS spent the summer learning the lessons of the first wave and preparing for the winter, investing in critical care. Hundreds of extra beds have been made available in London and patients have been moved elsewhere in the UK where extra capacity is available and that is how the NHS is coping. On a separate question, Ms Patel says there is a ""live"" debate within government on the current rules but says she will not speculate on whether they could be tightened up further. ""All rules are constantly under review within government but right now we are focusing very much on compliance enforcement"". Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel has reinforced the governmentâs
âstay at homeâ message. But to what extent is that being
followed and how has our behaviour changed compared with Englandâs first national
lockdown last March? Apple and Google record mobility
data which is pulled together by recording the location histories on people's
mobile devices and comparing it to a pre-coronavirus level. On Friday, the number of people
driving was down by 31% compared with the pre-Covid level. But it was down 63% on the first
Friday of the first lockdown in March 2020. Similar data shows that a higher
proportion of people were in workplaces, parks and grocery shops last Friday
compared with the first lockdown. But this could be in part down to
more places, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents, being open
this time. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. Sam Coates from Sky asks whether the government is concentrating too much on enforcing the rules in spaces like parks when they should be looking at workplaces and public transport. Ms Patel says ""when it comes to the rules... our target and our objective is to save lives, this isn't about picking out individual groups"". ""When it comes to the enforcement of those rules, it is right that we go after those breaches,"" she says, referring to things like parties. But she adds that ""this is a collective effort"" and that police are working with local authorities and other bodies to enforce the rules. She thanks supermarkets that have ""stepped up their efforts"" to make sure people are social distancing. On workplaces, Martin Hewitt says: ""That is ultimately the responsibility of any business or owner in that space."" He adds: ""Primarily our space is the public space."" ITV's Dan Hewitt asks whether the rules are tough enough to contain the virus and whether they need to be clarified, referring to the row over Boris Johnson's Olympic Park bike ride. Martin Hewitt answers first, saying there has been a lot of focus on the definition of local and he doesn't think it is sensible to mandate a certain distance people can travel as this would be challenging for the police to enforce. He says exemptions for exercise are fair and they are easily understood. People need to ask themselves whether their actions are essential and being done in the safest way possible. Ms Patel says exercise is important for people's health and wellbeing and says most people are adhering to the stay local guidance. ""The rules are tough enough,"" she adds. ""The message is clear. ""The more we follow the rules is the sooner we can drive this awful, atrocious virus down."" Mark Easton from the BBC asks Priti Patel why the rules of this lockdown aren't as tough as they were last spring. She says: ""The rules are actually very simple and clear - we are meant to stay at home and only leave home for a very very limited number of reasons."" She adds that ""everyone has to be conscientious in our actions"" and echoes Dr Diwakar's comment that people should act as if they have the virus. ""The rules are clear,"" she says. Martin Hewitt says: ""From our perspective we will carry on engaging [with] people... but I think the rules are clear."" He adds: ""You're right that the regulations have shifted over that period of time... but I think it's very clear what people need to do."" Â© 2025 BBC.

London's Nightingale hospital taking patients,"London's Nightingale hospital was built in nine days, with the help of hundreds of soldiers London's Nightingale hospital has been reopened and is admitting patients to help with the coronavirus spread in the capital. Medical director Dr Vin Diwakar said the facility at London's ExCeL Centre also had a vaccination centre on site. It wasplaced on standby in Mayafter fewer than 20 patients were treated following a grand opening on 3 April. Dr Diwakar said the Nightingale was being used to treat non-coronavirus patients. In the Downing Street press conference, he explained it was taking non-Covid patients to help free up beds in London's hospitals. He said: ""This means that hospitals have more beds to care for Covid-19 patients and for our very sickest patients. We cannot do this indefinitely. ""There comes a point where if the infection gets further out of control, more and more patients from London will need to be transferred elsewhere."" This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? At the start of November, he said, London had 1,000 Covid-19 patients.

"Play your part in fight against Covid, says Patel","This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""Our selfless police officers... will enforce the regulations and I will back them to do so"" People have been urged to ""play your part"" and follow Covid rules by Home Secretary Priti Patel, who says she will back police to enforce laws. At a No 10 briefing, Ms Patel said a minority were ""putting the health of the nation at risk"" by flouting rules. Police are ""moving more quickly to issuing fines"", she added, with nearly 45,000 fixed penalty notices issued across the UK. Another 1,243 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid. And there have beena further 45,533 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK,external. Meanwhile, another 145,076 people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 20,768 a second dose, bringing the totals respectively to 2,431,648 and 412,167. What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? Could police fine me for exercising? Can I hug my vaccinated dad? And other questions Four arrested over 'public nuisance' at hospitals At the briefing, Ms Patel said: ""My message today to anyone refusing to do the right thing is simple: if you do not play your part, our selfless police officers - who are out there risking their own lives every day to keep us safe - they will enforce the regulations. ""And I will back them to do so, to protect our NHS and to save lives."" It comes after the UK's most senior police officer saidlockdown rule-breakers were more likely to be finedas Covid laws would be enforced ""more quickly"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said her officers had been forced to break up parties, despite hospitals in London struggling to cope with rising patient numbers. Chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Martin Hewitt, who also spoke at the Downing Street briefing, said people should be asking themselves whether their reason for leaving home was ""truly essential"". He stressed that police officers had been ""putting themselves at risk in order to keep people safe"", and said it had been ""disappointing"" to see some of the behaviour by rule-breakers. He said examples of recent breaches included: a boat party in Hertfordshire with a bar and DJ booth, where more than 40 people had each paid Â£30 for a ticket a minibus full of people from different households travelling from Cheltenham to Wales for a walk a Â£10,000 fine in Surrey for the organiser of a party who was trying to claim it was a business event Mr Hewitt said he made ""no apology"" for police issuing fines, and warned people breaking rules - such as by organising parties or not wearing face coverings on public transport - to ""expect"" a fine. Asked if there needed to be more clarity on the guidance around exercise and staying local, Mr Hewitt said it would be wrong to put a ""particular distance"" on how far people could exercise from their home - as it would be too difficult for police to enforce. He said it was right there was an exception to allow people to exercise, but insisted it was the public's responsibility to make sure they were doing so safely. There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started falling. There has now been two consecutive days where newly diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the average was close to 60,000.

Dr Diwakar warned that if levels of hospitalisation in the capital continued to rise then more patients would need to be transferred out of London, adding that the NHS across the country was under pressure. In Birmingham, 200 doctors are being redeployed to one of the country's largest intensive care units as it nears capacity.

""We are urging the small minority of people who aren't taking this seriously to do so now, and [we say] to them that, if they don't, they are much more likely to get fined by the police,"" he told BBC Breakfast.

Cheryle Locke asked: ""My 89-year-old father had the vaccine a week ago. Is it safe to hug him now?"" If someone is vaccinated they should still follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. Thatâs because no vaccine is 100% effective and it is not yet clear if immunisation will stop people catching and spreading coronavirus, even though it protects against severe illness and death. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection.

could soon. In the meantime she hopes to clear up confusion and firm up
compliance but is insisting the current rules are clear. In a very stern voice. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Questions keep cropping up
about when key workers, such as supermarket staff and teachers, will be
vaccinated. There was one at todayâs
televised briefing. Some argue key workers should
be part of this first phase of the vaccination programme, which will see all over-50s, front-line health and care staff, and younger adults with health conditions
vaccinated by the end of April. But the assessment by the
governmentâs scientific advisers is pretty simple. They have targeted those who
are most at risk of dying if infected. Someone who is over the age
of 75 â the age group that is being prioritised immediately for vaccination by
mid-February - has a one in eight chance of dying if they catch Covid. By comparison, a person who
is 40 has a one in 1,000 chance. And that risk almost entirely
lies with those in that age group who have a health condition and therefore
would be part of this first phase anyway.  Reality Check At Home Secretary Priti Patelâs
news conference, Ian from Preston asked why the rules are more relaxed than
they were during the first lockdown last year if the new variant is more infectious. We know the government
recognises the situation is more serious because the UK is at threat level five - the highest level - which means there is a
danger of the NHS being overwhelmed within
21 days. In the first lockdown the UK was
only at threat level four. But the restrictions appear less
severe than they were in March. For example, support bubbles and childcare
bubbles exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds are open when they were
closed last time. And communal worship is still allowed as long as social distancing is observed. But one significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops and public transport. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened: Priti Patel mentioned the latest government statistics on coronavirus during the briefing this evening. A further 1,243 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to thelatest figures on the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external That brings the UK total to 81,960. The UK has also recorded a further 45,533 positive coronavirus test results. And 2,431,648 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But
what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started
falling. There have now been two consecutive days where newly
diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the
average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in
London, the South East and East of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. The North West is
causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having
any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the
tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look
like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising â patients being admitted at
the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago â but it does at
least offer a glimmer of hope. Alan Tolhurst from Politics Home asks whether the vaccination centres are Covid secure and have adequate ventilation. The home secretary cites the government's vaccination delivery plan and says the sites have spaced-out cubicles and other features to support social distancing and protect staff, following all of the guidance from Public Health England. Dr Diwakar says ""absolutely rigid"" infection controls are in place, including in the ExCel centre in London, which he visited recently. He says gels and masks are provided and the last thing staff want is to inadvertently pass on the virus to those being vaccinated, particularly the over-80s and other vulnerable people. ""We have spent months preparing to set these centres up and we are guided by really strict rules."" With that, Ms Patel brings the presser to an end.  The home secretary is asked how the public can understand what constitutes staying local,after two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk but had the penalties withdrawn. Priti Patel says the police ""exercise their professional judgement"" and points out that the fine in that case was rescinded. ""When we have people dying... we all have to exercise our judgement,"" she says. The new lockdown in England allows people to exercise with one other person from another household in an open public space, but says you should staytwo metres apartfrom each other. Ms Patel says: ""When it comes to exercising, again I do say stay local. Stay local is absolutely crucial. ""By all means take your daily exercise, but it's up to all of us in the right way to exercise that judgement as to how we do it - not socialising, making sure we're acting in the right way, staying away from other people."" She says that is ""clearly what the prime minister"" did when herode his bicycle seven miles from home. She adds: ""We all have to ask ourselves what can we do to keep everyone safe."" Martin Hewitt says ""this is unprecedented territory"" for police. ""Sometimes mistakes will be made but we always have looked at those, we've looked at those quickly... and we have said when we've got something wrong."" The home secretary says the government is ""absolutely working"" on getting frontline workers such as police, teachers and supermarket staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Diane from York, Priti Patel acknowledged they were ""at occupational risk of coming in in contact with the virus"". But she said the government was following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation who had ""thought carefully"" when it identified the top priority groups to receive the vaccine first. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, said he would ""obviously"" back the call for vaccinations for police as the ""nature of policing is that those officers are having daily to deal with people where they have no idea whether they are infected"".  Next up is the Telegraph's Gordon Rayner, who says countries such as France and Italy were able to cope with 40,000 patients going into hospital without asking everyone to stay at home. Could the NHS have been better prepared, he asks? Dr Diwakar said the NHS spent the summer learning the lessons of the first wave and preparing for the winter, investing in critical care. Hundreds of extra beds have been made available in London and patients have been moved elsewhere in the UK where extra capacity is available and that is how the NHS is coping. On a separate question, Ms Patel says there is a ""live"" debate within government on the current rules but says she will not speculate on whether they could be tightened up further. ""All rules are constantly under review within government but right now we are focusing very much on compliance enforcement"". Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel has reinforced the governmentâs
âstay at homeâ message. But to what extent is that being
followed and how has our behaviour changed compared with Englandâs first national
lockdown last March? Apple and Google record mobility
data which is pulled together by recording the location histories on people's
mobile devices and comparing it to a pre-coronavirus level. On Friday, the number of people
driving was down by 31% compared with the pre-Covid level. But it was down 63% on the first
Friday of the first lockdown in March 2020. Similar data shows that a higher
proportion of people were in workplaces, parks and grocery shops last Friday
compared with the first lockdown. But this could be in part down to
more places, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents, being open
this time. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. Sam Coates from Sky asks whether the government is concentrating too much on enforcing the rules in spaces like parks when they should be looking at workplaces and public transport. Ms Patel says ""when it comes to the rules... our target and our objective is to save lives, this isn't about picking out individual groups"". ""When it comes to the enforcement of those rules, it is right that we go after those breaches,"" she says, referring to things like parties. But she adds that ""this is a collective effort"" and that police are working with local authorities and other bodies to enforce the rules. She thanks supermarkets that have ""stepped up their efforts"" to make sure people are social distancing. On workplaces, Martin Hewitt says: ""That is ultimately the responsibility of any business or owner in that space."" He adds: ""Primarily our space is the public space."" ITV's Dan Hewitt asks whether the rules are tough enough to contain the virus and whether they need to be clarified, referring to the row over Boris Johnson's Olympic Park bike ride. Martin Hewitt answers first, saying there has been a lot of focus on the definition of local and he doesn't think it is sensible to mandate a certain distance people can travel as this would be challenging for the police to enforce. He says exemptions for exercise are fair and they are easily understood. People need to ask themselves whether their actions are essential and being done in the safest way possible. Ms Patel says exercise is important for people's health and wellbeing and says most people are adhering to the stay local guidance. ""The rules are tough enough,"" she adds. ""The message is clear. ""The more we follow the rules is the sooner we can drive this awful, atrocious virus down."" Mark Easton from the BBC asks Priti Patel why the rules of this lockdown aren't as tough as they were last spring. She says: ""The rules are actually very simple and clear - we are meant to stay at home and only leave home for a very very limited number of reasons."" She adds that ""everyone has to be conscientious in our actions"" and echoes Dr Diwakar's comment that people should act as if they have the virus. ""The rules are clear,"" she says. Martin Hewitt says: ""From our perspective we will carry on engaging [with] people... but I think the rules are clear."" He adds: ""You're right that the regulations have shifted over that period of time... but I think it's very clear what people need to do."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"2020 saw most excess deaths since World War TwoLast year saw 697,000 deaths registered in the UK - 14% above what would be expected.","The Covid pandemic has caused excess deaths to rise to their highest level in the UK since World War Two. There were close to 697,000 deaths in 2020 - nearly 85,000 more than would be expected based on the average in the previous five years. This represents an increase of 14% - making it the largest rise in excess deaths for more than 75 years. When the age and size of the population is taken into account, 2020 saw the worst death rates since the 2000s. This measure - known as age-standardised mortality - takes into account population growth and age. The data is only available until November - so the impact of deaths in December have not yet been taken into account - but it shows the death rate at that stage was at its highest in England since 2008. The data on deaths can be confusing. On one hand, excess deaths are at their highest since World War Two, while on the other, death rates, once age and size of population are taken into account, are at their worst level for a little over a decade 'only'. How should that be interpreted? Excess deaths are basically a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years. Clearly, 2020 saw a huge and unexpected rise in deaths because of the pandemic, just as World War Two led to a sudden jump. But in determining how much those jumps affected the chances of dying, a measure known as age-standardised mortality, which takes into account the age and size of the population, is important. It shows the pandemic has undone the progress made in the last decade or so. That is significant - especially given this has happened despite lockdowns and social-distancing measures to stop the spread of the virus. But it also helps put the death toll over the past 12 months in a wider context. King's Fund chief executive Richard Murray said the picture was likely to worsen, given Covid deaths were rising following the surge in infections over recent weeks. ""The UK has one of the highest rates of excess deaths in the world, with more excess deaths per million people than most other European countries or the US,"" he said. 'It will take a public inquiry to determine exactly what went wrong, but mistakes have been made. ""In a pandemic, mistakes cost lives. Decisions to enter lockdown have consistently come late, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes or the experiences of other countries. ""The promised 'protective ring' around social care in the first wave was slow to materialise and often inadequate, a contributing factor to the excess deaths among care home residents last year. 'Like many countries, the UK was poorly prepared for this type of pandemic."" Matthew Reed, of the end-of-life care charity Marie Curie said the focus on Covid should not hide the fact there has been a ""silent crisis"" of deaths at home. He said people have died prematurely in 2020 from other causes - with a big jump in deaths at home. ""We are concerned many have not had the care they needed,"" he added.

We'll be back again tomorrow. Before we go, here are some of the main stories from the day:  Today's live coverage was written by Hazel Shearing, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Alexandra Fouche and Gavin Stamp, and edited by James Clarke, Rob Corp and Vicky Baker.  Eleven ambulances were sent to a care home in Cornwall at the weekend after a coronavirus outbreak, it has been confirmed. Coronavirus rapidly spread to 25 residents at Trengrouse care home in Helston and many staff were off sick or self-isolating despite best efforts to prevent the spread, bosses said. Three residents were taken to hospital. Others needed oxygen and are being looked after at the home. Bosses said staff and residents were being ""tested very regularly"" and ""we'll never know how it came into the home"". Read more here. With new lockdowns now in force in England, most of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we've been answering some of your questions. Cheryle Locke asked: ""My 89-year-old father had the vaccine a week ago. Is it safe to hug him now?"" If someone is vaccinated they should still follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. Thatâs because no vaccine is 100% effective and it is not yet clear if immunisation will stop people catching and spreading coronavirus, even though it protects against severe illness and death. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection. However, if you have alreadyformed a support bubblewith your father, you can have close physical contact with him. Read more answers to your questions - including about the rollout of vaccination, new international travel rules and school closures -here. Campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford helped secured changes last year We reported earlier on the outcry about the supply of food parcels to children on free school meals in England during lockdown after the contents of one company's hamper went viral on social media. A mother had posted a photo of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of food items, and questioned whether the contents were sufficient. It came to the attention of footballer Marcus Rashford, who secured changes to government policy on free school meals last year after launching a campaign on the issue. He sought a meeting with the supplier, Chartwells. The company has now apologised, but stressed the hamper was not for five days - not 10 - as had been suggested on social media. But it said: ""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance."" Read more about this story here. The NHS trust with the largest intensive care capacity in the UK has confirmed it now has almost 200 more Covid patients in its four hospitals than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. University Hospitals Birmingham said it has 873 patients with Covid-19 in its hospitals and 125 in intensive care. It comes after the Health Service Journal
published a leaked email to staff which suggested the trust risked being ""overwhelmed"". A hospital spokesperson said: ""We continue to expand our
intensive care and acute medical teams so they are able to treat the rising
number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery
including cancer operations. ""Every member of staff will be
supported by the Trust in delivering the best care wherever they are
working.""  Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The police are stepping up enforcement because they believe many people
breaking the Covid regulations are doing so because they are stubborn, not
because they donât understand what is allowed. The public, police, and legal experts do struggle to keep up with
the ever-changing rules. But the organisers of a party on a boat in Hertfordshire, the passengers
on a minibus heading for Wales, and the couple who travelled 120 miles to ""watch seals"" would have struggled to explain to the officers issuing them with
fines that they were confused. Those were clear breaches.  More complicated is the fine line
between the law - which police officers can enforce - and the government
guidance, which they canât. No law says exercise can only be conducted once a day, or for a specific
duration. These are pieces of firm guidance, along with the request to ""stay
local"", which resulted in criticism of the prime minister after his bike ride
in east London. It would be difficult to set a distance limit which would work for both
people living in rural areas and inner cities.  Impossible to prove that a
65-minute run was in breach of the law. Which is why the success of the measures will rely on personal
responsibility in the end. And why some experts are saying that different
messages such as ""act like youâve got it"" or ""thanks for doing the right thing"" might
cut through better than a list of regulations to be obeyed.   Ben WrightBBC political correspondent National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt says a limit on
how far people can travel for exercise in England would be difficult for police
to enforce. Earlier today the Metropolitan Police said exercise should begin and end at
someoneâs front door if possible. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wonât
speculate about tougher rules but says there are âendless discussionsâ within

Hill, an expert on the Soviet Union, has argued in Politico that what happened last week could be defined as an attempted ""self-coup"" by the outgoing president. ""Trump disguised what he was doing by operating in plain sight, talking openly about his intent. He normalized his actions so people would accept them. Iâve been studying authoritarian regimes for three decades, and I know the signs of a coup when I see them,"" she wrote, before comparing events of recent months to a ""checklist"" analysts use to evaluate coups and attempts around the world. Hill was born in north-east England and gained worldwide attention in 2019for her straight-talking testimony during Trump's first impeachment inquiry. Republicans applaud Stefanik at an event to mark the end Trump's first impeachment last year Harvard University's prestigious Institute of Politics has made the decision to remove Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik from its advisory board. Douglas Elmendorf, the dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said on Tuesday in a note to colleagues that he had asked Stefanik to step down. When she refused, he informed her that she had been kicked out. The dean said in his letter that Stefanik, who represents northern New York state and voted to object to Biden's win, had made ""public assertions about voter fraud in Novemberâs presidential election that have no basis in evidence"". ""She has made public statements about court actions related to the election that are incorrect,"" he continued. ""Moreover, these assertions and statements do not reflect policy disagreements but bear on the foundations of the electoral process through which this countryâs leaders are chosen."" Hitting back, Stefanik called the decision ""a rite of passage and badge of honour"". ""The decision by Harvard's administration to cower and cave to the woke Left will continue to erode diversity of thought,"" she tweeted. ""The Ivory Tower's march toward a monoculture of like-minded, intolerant liberal views demonstrates the sneering disdain for everyday Americans and will instill a culture of fear for students."" The FBI previously released a handout image showing a suspect Acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin says the two pipe bombs found near the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Democratic National Committee (DNC) on 6 January ""were real devices"" with explosive igniters and timers. ""We don't know exactly why they did not go off, that's being investigated,"" he said. ""What was the purpose of those devices being planted? Was it a diversionary type of a tactic used by some of these rioters? ""Or did it have some other type of nefarious purpose? That is what the ATF, the FBI, and PD are looking at as we speak right now."" The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the identification of the individual, or individuals, who left the pipe bombs. The FBI is appealing for those involved in the Capitol riots to hand themselves into law enforcement. âEven if you left DC, agents from our local field offices will be knocking on your door,â the assistant director in charge of the FBI's DC office warned offenders at Tuesday's briefing. Michael Sherwin, the acting US Attorney for District of Washington, said some of the misdemeanor charges filed so far are ""just the beginning"" with officials looking at ""significant felony cases"" tied to sedition and conspiracy - with prison terms of up to 20 years. The Department of Justice and the FBI are giving an update on the violence at the US Capitol last week. Steven D'Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington DC office, says that they have received some 100,000 pieces of digital evidence from the public to work through. He and the US Attorney for District of Washington, Michael Sherwin, say they have opened more than 160 case files and have charged 70 people so far. D'Antuono described this as the ""tip of the iceberg"" with the number of investigations and charges expected to go into the hundreds. This video can not be played Trump: 'The 25th amendment is of zero risk to me' Speaking from the US-Mexico border, President Trump begins his speech by telling border agents that he delivered the wall ""exactly as you wanted it"". ""So you got no excuses. I don't want you to have any excuses,"" he says, referring to his signature campaign promise. He then turns to the events of last week that have led to the House to call for Vice-President Mike Pence to replace him as president under the 25th Amendment of the Constitution. ""Free speech is under assault like never before,"" he says. ""The 25th amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration."" He adds that ""the impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in history"". ""Now is the time for our nation to heal. A time for peace and calm,"" he says. He adds that ""respect for law enforcement is the foundation of the MAGA agenda,â in a reference to his campaign acronym meaning ""Make America Great Again"". Trump shouts to supporters at the airport in Texas President Trump, who is due to speak imminently, was seen by reporters autographing the border wall with Mexico. He appears to have used a black Sharpie. The president was earlier greeted by throngs of supporters upon his arrival. ""Thank you for the votes,"" he told the Texans who welcomed him at the airport.

Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News Therevelation from the Washington Post that an FBI office in Virginia warned of violence,externaladds to the serious questions over what went wrong. The report from the Norfolk office was said to have been approved for release the day before the attack on the Capitol and warned that extremists planned to travel to commit violence, and even ""war"", and were sharing maps of the tunnels beneath Congress. Some have suggested that the events marked an ""intelligence failure"" but this suggests otherwise. Instead, it looks like there was intelligence in the system but it did not find its way to the right people, was not taken seriously, or was not acted on. That final possibility goes to what may be the most difficult question â did calculations about politics or how security measures might look dictate the lack of proper preparation? Trump is speaking in a town named for a famous battle against Mexico President Trump is due to speak in Texas in the coming hour as he visits the wall on the US-Mexico border. The White House said his visit would ""mark the completion of more than 400 miles of border wall -- a promise made, promise kept..."" However, only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there were none before - that includes 47 miles of primary wall, and 33 miles of secondary wall built to reinforce the initial barrier. The city he'll visit, Alamo, is full of symbolism. It's named after the San Antonio mission where Texan fighters fought against Mexican forces for 13 days in 1836. The fighters were annihilated but became a symbol of resistance for Texans, who defeated the Mexican army about a month later. The city of Alamo in a press release yesterday said that they had been given no advance warning of Trump's visit. Read more: Trump's wall: How much has been built during his term? South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has hitched a ride on Air Force One with President Trump today on his visit to Texas. Graham, a top Trump ally, had previously been close to his Senate colleague John McCain, who frequently clashed with Trump until McCain's death in 2018. After last week's violence, Graham begged his colleagues on the Senate floor to vote to certify Biden's win. ""Trump and I, we've had a hell of a journey. I hate it to end this way. Oh my God, I hate it,"" he said. ""All I can say, is count me out, enough is enough,"" he continued. He's certainly not the first Republican senator to have an on-again/off-again relationship with Trump. Senator Ted Cruz, the first in his chamber to back an objection to Biden's victory, had previously called Trump a ""pathological liar"". This video can not be played Senator Ted Cruz on Donald Trump: Then and now German investment bank Deutsche Bank is the latest organisation to decide that it will terminate business with the US president or his companies, according to reports. As the primary lender to the Trump Organization, the bank's move could hit the Trump family wallet where it hurts. It comes as several other entities that have been crucial to the growth of the Trump brand - from Twitter to the Professional Golfers' Association - are severing ties. The bank has so far declined to comment on the matter, though reports say it will no longer do future business with the president. In the 1990s, as Trump reeled from a series of bankruptcies, Deutsche Bank was the only lender that did business with him. When he sued the bank's real estate division in 2008 after defaulting on a $40m (Â£29m) loan repayment,its private wealth division loaned him money to pay off the existing debt, according to Newsweek.,external Thebank has also been pulled into investigations by Democrats in Congress into Trump's financial dealingsas well as into investigations into the Trump Organization  by state prosecutors in New York, where Trump used to live. The Trump Organization is reported to owe Deutsche Bank about $340m (Â£249m) in outstanding loans, which are due in the next few years. Meanwhile, another of Trump's main lenders - Signature Bank - is saying it will close his two personal accounts. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is urging federal authorities to put ""anybody who was inside the Capitol"" building last Wednesday to be added to a national no-fly list. ""We cannot allow these same insurrectionists to get on a plane and cause more violence and more damage,"" said the New York Democrat. Calling on the FBI, TSA, the Department of Homeland Security to act ""immediately"", he called those involved in the riots ""a threat to the homeland as defined by the law"". Schumer - who will become Majority Leader of the US Senate in eight days - is the highest-ranking government official so far to call for a no-fly list. Social media has been abuzz in recent days, with several videos of those allegedly involved in the Capitol invasion being ejected from flights and banned by airlines. There have also been multiple reports of unruly passengers physically and verbally abusing crew members and others aboard their flights. Over the weekend, the Federal Aviation Administration threatened severe fines for misbehaviour. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Members of the National Guard are seen here outside the US Capitol, which was raided by Trump supporters last week The flag on the building is flying at half-staff in honour of two Capitol Police officers who have died since the riot This sign near the building calls for US President Donald Trump to be impeached or removed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived at the Capitol earlier ahead of the vote on the resolution calling on Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment Trump ally Jim Jordan is seen here during the rules committee hearing Meanwhile, work is under way to clean the Capitol building following the riot Donald Trump spoke to the media before flying to Texas to visit the border wall Raskin pictured in Congress on Wednesday after the session resumed to confirm the electoral college results One of the Democrats pushing for President Trump's removal has had a tragic and challenging start to 2021. Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin's son died by suicide, his office announced on the last day of 2020. One week later - and only two days after the laying to rest of 25-year-old Thomas Bloom Raskin - a mob rioted through the Capitol where lawmakers were meeting to certify November's election result. Raskin, who co-authored the impeachment resolution while sheltering from the crowd, had invited his daughter and son-in-law to be with him that day in the Capitol, and became separated from them as the melee began. They were forced to barricade themselves in a room with other lawmakers as the mob beat at their doors. Speaking to the Washington Post,external, Raskin said that his son, who was studying law at Harvard University, would have considered last week's violence ""the absolute worst form of crime against democracy"". âIt really is Tommy Raskin,â he added, âand his love and his values and his passion, that have kept me going.â Michigan's Attorney General Dana Nessel has warned that the Michigan Capitol ""is not safe"", despite a state decision to ban the open carrying of weapons in the building. On Monday, a state panel unanimously voted to allow only police officers to openly carry guns inside the Capitol. However, the decision does not prevent people with concealed weapons licences from bringing their guns - and, according to Nessel, no rules are in place to check people do have licences. ""That means anyone - irrespective of criminal history, membership with an anti-government org, or stated intention to harm government employees - can still enter the Capitol fully locked and loaded with firearms or explosive devices hidden by clothing, backpacks, etc,"" she wrote in a series of tweets on Tuesday. ""I repeat - the Michigan Capitol is not safe."" Nessel's response came after the FBI warned of possible armed protests by Trump supporters and far-right groups across the country ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration later this month. Representative Norma Torres, a Democrat from California, has just delivered an emotional account of her experience last week. Urging her colleagues to support a resolution asking for the 25th Amendment to be invoked to remove President Trump from office, Rep Torres recalled her experience as one of the last members to get out of the chamber as a ""raging mob"" tried to get inside.

Her voice shaking, Rep Torres spoke about hearing a pro-Trump protester get shot and having to crawl across the floor to safety. She urged Vice President Mike Pence to ""do the right thing.... for the future of America"". BBC Monitoring As major social media platforms crack down on accounts promoting US election conspiracy theories, many conspiracy and far-right groups in the US are looking for a new home online. Twitter hasnât just kicked the president off the platform. Itâs also closed down some 70,000 accounts associated with the QAnon conspiracy, while Facebook said it is continuing efforts to shut down âStop the Stealâ groups which allege, with no evidence, that Donald Trump was cheated of the presidency. One of the most popular alternatives had been the self-styled âfree speechâ social media outlet Parler, but then over the weekendthat was banned toofor posts inciting violence. Then thereâs Gab, a Twitter-like platform popular with right-wing groups, which is awash with extreme content and welcomes QAnon followers with open arms. It claims to have added 600,000 new users since the riots. Itâs thought Gabâs user base is far smaller than that of the now-closed Parler, which had around 16m users. Others seem to be moving to MeWe, which is similar to Facebook. There are some parallels with online jihadists, who also found their voices silenced after the rise of Islamic State in the Middle East. The Islamic State group and al-Qaeda frequently have to re-establish their online presence after social media companies identify and close their accounts, leading to a nomadic online existence. They have already adapted to life outside the big social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook and have exploited less well known platforms and apps to get their messages out. Read more: The House of Representatives rules committee is holding a hearing on a resolution that claims Trump ""widely advertised and broadly encouraged"" the mob that ransacked Congress last week, and that Vice-President Mike Pence should take over as president. Democrats, who control the chamber, are calling for Pence to ""immediately"" invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump unfit for office. ""Lead us out of this nightmare that weâve been plunged into with these recent events,"" Democrat Jamie Raskin says during the hearing, addressing Pence and the other cabinet officials. The 25th Amendment allows the vice-president to become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. They would need to sign a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the presiding officer of the Senate declaring the president is unfit to govern or incapable ""of discharging the powers and duties of his office"". At this point, Vice-President Mike Pence would automatically take over. The president is given the chance to offer a written response, and if he contests the finding, then it falls on Congress to decide. Any vote in the Senate and House of Representatives ordering the president's removal requires a two-thirds majority. Until the issue is resolved, the vice-president would act as president.

Pre-riot speech was 'totally acceptable' - TrumpThe US president is facing impeachment for inciting insurrection before last week's Capitol riot.,"This video can not be played President Trump: ""Be careful what you wish for"" US President Donald Trump has said his speech before last week's deadly Capitol riot, when he urged his supporters to march on Congress, was ""totally appropriate"". Mr Trump dismissed as ""ridiculous"" efforts by Democrats in Congress to impeach him for inciting insurrection. He leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on an article of impeachment on Wednesday. ""I think it's [the impeachment procedure] causing tremendous danger to our country and it's causing tremendous anger. I want no violence,"" Mr Trump said. Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? How many arrests so far from Capitol riots? How much of Trump's wall has been built? He was speaking as he left the White House for a visit to Texas to inspect a section of the border wall with Mexico. It was his first public appearance since the violence at the Capitol, in which five people died and dozens of people were injured, including at least 60 police officers. During his speech at the rally in Washington on 6 January, Mr Trump repeated his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud during the 3 November presidential election and urged his supporters to march on Congress. ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength,"" he told the crowd of several thousand supporters. He said Vice-President Mike Pence should have ""the courage to do what he has to do"", claiming without foundation that Mr Pence had the constitutional power to overturn the votes which were being formally tallied in Congress that day. ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,"" Mr Trump said. Dozens of people have since been detained in connection with last week's violence. Of the five who lost their lives, one was a police officer and one was a rioter shot dead by police. Meanwhile,a third US lawmaker has said he has Covid-19 after sheltering with maskless Republicans in a safe roomduring the events of 6 January. This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol The House of Representatives will vote on Tuesday to ask Mr Pence to invoke the 25th amendment to the constitution to remove Mr Trump from office - an idea Mr Pence is said to oppose. That vote is expected to fail, and so the House will then consider an article of impeachment against Mr Trump for ""incitement of insurrection"". Democrats have the majority in the House, so the impeachment vote is likely to pass. If it does, Mr Trump will become the first president in US history to be impeached twice. However, the impeachment will only lead to his removal from office if a two-thirds majority votes in favour of his conviction in the Senate. That would need the assent of a substantial number of Republicans and so far, few have shown any willingness to vote against a president from their own party. Speaking on his visit to Texas, Mr Trump brushed off the threat of removal from office under the constitution. ""The 25th amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration,"" he said. According to the New York Times, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has told confidants he is pleased Democrats want to impeach the president. The Kentucky senator believes the punishment will make it easier to cleanse Mr Trump from the Republican party, reports the newspaper. Mr McConnell has also told associates he believes the president committed impeachable offences, reports the Washington Post. Neither Mr McConnell nor his Republican counterpart in the House, Kevin McCarthy, plan to whip votes for or against impeachment, according to US media. On Tuesday afternoon, one of the most senior House Republicans, Liz Cheney, said she would vote to impeach Mr Trump. The Wyoming representative said in a statement: ""There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution."" Ms Cheney, the number three Republican in the lower chamber and the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, said Mr Trump had ""summoned this mob, assembled the mob, lit the flame of this attack"". Trump almost never shies away from a fight. He didn't on Tuesday, either. When asked about his incendiary speech to supporters outside the White House last week - the one many allege helped incite a riot - he did not apologise. Instead, he lashed out at his critics and cast himself as a victim. The Democrats, he said, were the problem. Their effort at impeachment, he explained, was ""causing tremendous danger to our country"", along with ""tremendous anger"". It was vintage Trump. In his final days, he is relying on a strategy borrowed from his beloved sport, mixed martial arts, to defend himself: throw quick punches and duck. Meanwhile in the West Wing, offices are emptying, cardboard boxes are lying on the floor next to people's desks, and aides are leaving in droves. Calls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots in Congress. The FBI is warning of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Mr Biden's inauguration. Up to 15,000 National Guard troops will be deployed in Washington DC for the event. The leaders of the US military's different branches, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, issued a message describing the riots as a direct assault on Congress and the constitution, Reuters news agency and CNN report. The message said Mr Biden would be inaugurated on 20 January and warned service members: ""Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law."" Tuesday:The House of Representatives votes on a resolution calling on Vice-President Pence and the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unfit for office. It is likely to pass but Mr Pence has shown no sign he is planning to act Wednesday:Democrats vow to hold a vote on impeachment.

School meal parcels 'not good enough' - Rashford,"Marcus Rashford helps out at a food bank The company at the centre of an outcry over the size of food parcels going to the poorest pupils while schools are in lockdown in England has apologised. Marcus Rashford sought a meeting with the firm, Chartwells, after seeing a photo of the measly parcel on Twitter. The post, by someone calling herself Roadside Mum, was picked up by news outlets which then quizzed Downing Street officials about it. Some hours later the firm agreed the parcel had fallen short on quantity. Food parcels are currently being sent to school children in England who would normally get free school meals. The mother, who posted the photo of two carrots, two potatoes and a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items, said she calculated the cost to be only about Â£5. It was retweeted 15,000 times on Twitter and received 36,000 likes. The mother, who does not want to be identified, had thought it was supposed to last 10 school days and should have been worth Â£30. Chartwells said it was actually only intended to last one school week, but acknowledged it was insufficient. ""Public funds were charged Â£30. I'd have bought this for Â£5.22,"" said Twitter user Roadside Mum of the parcel she received It said in a statement: ""For clarity, this shows five days of free school lunches (not 10 days) and the charge for food, packing and distribution was actually Â£10.50 and not Â£30 as suggested. ""However, in our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance."" It added that its ""10-day hampers"" typically included a wide variety of nutritious food items to support the provision of lunches for children. Marcus Rashford hadshared images,externalof what appeared to be food parcels, saying they were ""not good enough"", that children should not go hungry and that ""we must do better"" - and he asked for a meeting with Chartwells. This prompted Downing Street to say it was ""completely unacceptable"", and that the parcels should be healthy and sufficient for the task. Children's minister Vicky Ford then began an investigation. What free school meals are children supposed to get? Lockdown meals teacher restarts deliveries A spokesman for Chartwells, which is owned by Compass group, said the firm would further enhance its food parcels following the Department for Education's additional allowance of Â£3.50 per week per child, in line with nutritional guidelines. The DfE, which has clear guidelines for parcels, will shortly be opening a similar voucher scheme to the one operational during the first school lockdown. During the lockdown, schools have been told to continue providing free meals for those who are learning at home and have currently been urged to use their usual caterers to offer food parcels. If schools cannot provide parcels, they can consider other arrangements which might include vouchers for local shops and supermarkets. The post prompted others to complain about the quality and quantity of the food in the parcels. Mother-of-three Kerry Wilks, from Redcar in north-east England, received a package at her youngest child's school containing a loaf of bread, three yoghurts, a tin of beans, tuna, two potatoes, four pieces of fruit and two slices of cheese. ""Even the teaching staff were quite embarrassed by giving them out,"" Ms Wilks, 38, said. ""I think what's really bugged me about it is the fact that there's two pieces of square cheese wrapped in cling film - I just find it so degrading."" Elaine Stacey, 41, from Reading, said she received a loaf of bread, weighed-out pasta in a sandwich bag, three jelly pots and a jar of Dolmio sauce to feed her 17-year-old son for a week. The parcel fell so short of what he needed that she said she was having to give up food herself so he would have enough. Chef Wayne Sullivan, who lives in the Cotswolds and has three school-age children, criticised school food more generally, saying he has been collecting packed lunches from his two boys' school daily and was ""horrified"" by the contents. How many children need free meals? 'I remember going to bed with hunger pains' Mr Sullivan, a former MasterChef contestant, told the BBC: ""There's probably about 55p worth of food. It's not been prepared with any care or attention, and nutritionally it's not balanced."" Wayne Sullivan said he was ""horrified"" by the contents of his boys' packed lunches Jack Monroe, food campaigner and chef, said the government should reinstate the voucher system ""that gave people dignity"" and allowed people to make choices about what they could feed themselves and their children ""in these difficult times"". Meanwhile, some head teachers have been going to extraordinary lengths to make sure their pupils can eat. Zane Powles, assistant head teacher at Western Primary School in Grimsby, said the night after the school lockdown was announced he went to the supermarket to get ""all our packed lunches for the next two days"". What he bought was ""much better"" and cheaper than what he gets from the company he uses, he said. This video can not be played Jack Monroe: Free school meals ""replaced with a poverty picnic"" A spokesman for Laca, the professional body for catering managers in schools, said it was ""disappointed"" to see the pictures of food parcels, adding they did not meet the standards. After his meeting with Chartwells, Rashford said: ""One thing that is clear is that there was very little communication with the suppliers that a national lockdown was coming. ""We MUST do better. Children shouldn't be going hungry on the basis that we aren't communicating or being transparent with plans. That is unacceptable."" Reacting to the initial images, Sir Keir Starmertweeted,externalthat the food appeared to be ""woefully inadequate"" and said it needed ""sorting immediately"". Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner, criticised the food parcels posted online and called on companies to provide ""real food and real amounts that will really help families"". ""Children need nutritious food for their lunch that helps them learn and keeps them warm in winter. Some lunch boxes I've seen are great but they all should be and there are too many examples of very poor ones on view today that are paltry, cheap and demeaning,""she said,external. Children's minister Vicky Ford said,external: ""Food parcels should cover all lunchtime meals and be nutritious. ""We've increased funding for parcels and will support local vouchers - national voucher also rolling out ASAP, working night and day on this."" The DfE says it will open a national scheme to provide supermarket vouchers via an online portal ""as soon as possible"". parcels should contain food items rather than pre-prepared meals due to food safety considerations minimise the fridge and freezer space that schools and families will need to store foods contain items which parents can use to prepare healthy lunches for their child/children across the week not rely on parents having additional ingredients at home to prepare meals not contain items restricted under the school food standards cater for pupils who require special diets, for example, allergies, vegetarians or religious diets - schools should ensure there are systems in place to avoid cross-contamination contain appropriate packaging sizes for household use, rather than wholesale sizes Source:Department for Education,external Rashford has been a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals and brought about several U-turns on the provision of food during the school holidays. This video can not be played Rashfordâs mum says she worked three jobs, but still couldn't afford to feed herself sometimes In Wales, free school meals during the holidays has been extended by a year, and the Northern Ireland Executive made a pledge in November to provide free school meals in holidays until Easter 2022. In Scotland - where holiday provision is currently promised up to Easter 2021 - both the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives have pledged to fund free school meals for all primary school pupils during term-time and holidays if they win the 2021 Scottish election.

Disneyland to become mass US vaccination site,"California's Disneyland theme park is set to become a massive Covid-19 vaccination site this week, county officials announced on Monday. The ""happiest place on earth"" is one of several large distribution sites opening up in the state as cases soar and hospitals near capacity. The most populous US state has lagged behind in its vaccination rate, doling out around a third of its doses so far. The state reported just under 40,000 new cases on Monday and 264 deaths. California ranks 42nd out of 50 states in its vaccination rate per 100,000 residents,according to Centers for Disease Control data,external. The Disneyland resort in Orange County will become the region's first ""super"" distribution site, Orange County Supervisor Andrew Do said on Monday. It will have the capacity to vaccinate thousands of people daily. The park has been closed to visitors since mid-March - unlike its sister resort, Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been open to reduced numbers of guests since July. Walt Disney World reopens amid Covid-19 surge California Governor Gavin Newsom announced similar vaccination sites would be opening up as early as this week at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium, Cal Expo in Sacramento and Petco Park in San Diego. ""We recognise that the current strategy is not going to get us to where we need to go as quickly as we all need to go,"" Mr Newsom said. ""That's why we're speeding up the administration not just for priority groups but opening up large sites to do so."" The state's current vaccination campaign is focusing on high priority individuals, like health care workers and long-term care facility residents. How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? The Golden State has the third highest death rate in the country. More than 22,600 people have been admitted to hospital due to the virus,and state data shows that as of Monday,external, just over 1,200 intensive care beds were still available statewide. ""The damaging impact to our families and our local hospitals from this surge is the worst disaster our county has experienced for decades,"" Los Angeles County's top public health official, Barbara Ferrer told reporters on Monday. The US has seen 22.6m Covid-19 cases and more than 376,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. In Tuscaloosa, Alabama, there are fears of an impending Covid spike in the wake of huge celebrations after a college American football championship victory, despite pleas from the mayor to call off parties.

Around half of Covid intensive care patients dying,"The data showed men were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units Around half of patients admitted to Welsh intensive care units during the second wave of the pandemic have died, a study has found. The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) found men aged in their 60s were more likely to need intensive care. It also found those from Asian backgrounds and deprived areas were disproportionately affected. But a leading doctor said, overall, people were more likely to survive now. Intensive care consultant Matt Morgan said new treatments meant only the sickest patients were reaching intensive care, where outcomes were poorer. ICNARC collected information on 431 Welsh patients who were critically ill with coronavirus from 1 September to 31 December 2020 as part of a UK-wide audit of intensive care patients. Of the patients who were admitted, 68% were men and 32% women. The average age of a patient was 59.5 years. Intensive care consultant Matt Morgan said, overall, patients were more likely to survive Covid now While the vast majority of patients were white (91.6%), the number of patients of Asian ethnicity was more than double the proportion of the Asian population, with 6.3% of patients recorded as being Asian, compared to an average of 2.4% in their local population. The audit of patients found that, excluding those still being treated at the unit, half had died while half had been discharged. Although the numbers of patients surveyed is relatively low for statistical purposes, Dr Morgan said the survival rate reflected the situation in hospitals. Covid patients 'could reach double April peak' New variant blamed for Wrexham Covid spike Hospital stretched as Covid cases rise rapidly ""We are putting fewer people, who are in the first stage of their illness, on to life support machines. And that is because we have treatments now that we know can help,"" he said. ""Overall, you are more likely now to survive Covid than ever before, and that is in every age group - sometimes by as much as 10% more. ""What we do know is that overall, out of every ten people who come to intensive care with Covid about six of them will survive and will leave the intensive care unit. Which means sadly four of them won't, four of them will die. ""That's similar overall to the first wave but that data is based on some patients who are still in the intensive care unit. So that may change and it's more likely to get worse rather than better."" ""We also know patients who are on life support machines in the intensive care unit will do worse than those who come to the intensive care unit and are not on life support machines. ""For those people, it's probably five out of 10 people who will survive and five who will sadly die and that may be worse when we have the data on those who are still there. ""And there's a big effect of age. So for those over the age of 70 it may be as little as four people out of 10 who survive, maybe less. And for those over the age of 80 it may be as low as one or two people out of ten who survive. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? The figures from ICNARC also highlight how people from poorer backgrounds were more likely to need treatment in intensive care. Using a deprivation score from 1 to 5, more than half of patients scored 4 or 5, representing the most deprived postcodes in Wales. Dr Morgan said: ""Sadly, disease is an illness of deprivation. ""And so that's why we feel it, particularly in Wales where the industrial scars of our past are still very much there - and our health is there.""

Sonic boom heard as RAF intercepts civilian plane,"RAF Typhoons, similar to the aircraft pictured, took off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and escorted the civilian aircraft to London Stansted Airport A sonic boom has been heard across the East of England after RAF Typhoon aircraft were launched to intercept a plane that had lost communications. The Typhoons took off from RAF Coningsby and ""safely escorted"" the civilian aircraft to Stansted Airport in Essex, an RAF spokesman said. The boom, at about 13:05 GMT, was reported by people across social media. ""The Typhoon aircraft were authorised to transit at supersonic speed for operational reasons,"" the RAF said. People in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire and parts of London heard the boom. This video can not be played People's reaction to the sonic boom was caught on camera ""We have received numerous calls from the public with reports of a sonic boom... between Huntingdon and Cambridge,"" Cambridgeshire police said,in a Facebook post,external. ""Nobody has been injured. Some callers reported the incident had shaken properties but no major damage is thought to have occurred."" An image from a police officer's body-worn camera captured the RAF Typhoon aircraft flying over Cambridgeshire Communications with the aircraft were re-established after the Typhoons were launched and it was intercepted before being escorted to Stansted. What is a sonic boom? Pilot grounded for causing sonic boom 'Sonic boom' caused by military jets A spokesman for the airport said the ""private jet"" was believed to have been flying from Germany to Birmingham. He confirmed the plane had been brought into land at about 13:40. When an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, the air in front of the nose of the plane builds up a pressure front because it has ""nowhere to escape"", saidDr Jim Wild of Lancaster University. A sonic boom happens when that air ""escapes"", creating a ripple effect which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap. The speed of sound varies. It is about 770mph (1,200km/h) at sea level, but slower at higher altitudes. A plane flying at 30,000ft would reach the speed of sound at about 675mph (1,085km/h), according toNASA's educational website,external. It can be heard over such a large area because it moves with the plane, rather like the wake of a boat spreading out behind the vessel. RAF jets are only given permission to go supersonic over populated areas in emergencies, usually when they are required to intercept another aircraft.

London's Nightingale Hospital taking patients,"London's Nightingale hospital was built in nine days, with the help of hundreds of soldiers London's Nightingale hospital has been reopened and is admitting patients to help with the coronavirus spread in the capital. Medical director Dr Vin Diwakar said the facility at London's ExCeL Centre also had a vaccination centre on site. It wasplaced on standby in Mayafter fewer than 20 patients were treated following a grand opening on 3 April. Dr Diwakar said the Nightingale was being used to treat non-coronavirus patients. In the Downing Street press conference, he explained it was taking non-Covid patients to help free up beds in London's hospitals. He said: ""This means that hospitals have more beds to care for Covid-19 patients and for our very sickest patients. We cannot do this indefinitely. ""There comes a point where if the infection gets further out of control, more and more patients from London will need to be transferred elsewhere."" This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? At the start of November, he said, London had 1,000 Covid-19 patients. This increased four-fold to 4,000 on Christmas Day and has doubled to just under 8,000 today, with more than 1,000 of those on critical care, he told the press conference. Allow Twitter content?

A member of Ms Harris's teamtold AP news agency,externalthat Vogue staff, including Ms Wintour, agreed to feature the blue-suited image on cover.

Fines 'increasingly likely' for rule-breakers,"Lockdown rule-breakers are more likely to be fined as Covid laws will be enforced ""more quickly"", the UK's most senior police officer has said. London's Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said her officers have had to break up parties, despite hospitals struggling to cope with rising patient numbers. A minister confirmed her pledge that fines were ""increasingly likely"". Kit Malthouse said people have a ""duty"" to make this lockdown ""the last one"". ""We are urging the small minority of people who aren't taking this seriously to do so now, and [are illustrating] to them that if they don't they are much more likely to get fined by the police,"" Mr Malthouse, the policing minister, told BBC Breakfast. ""These current measures should in theory, if we all stick by them, be enough to drive the numbers down so that we can start to move through the gears of tiers from mid-February,"" he added. Asked if tighter restrictions for England were on the way -something the health secretary has refused to rule out- Mr Malthouse said ministers were ""on tenterhooks"" watching the daily figures for Covid deaths, new cases and hospital admissions, as rules continue to be kept under review. How could lockdown rules be tougher? Could I be fined for breaking lockdown rules? Johnson's bike ride 'didn't break Covid rules' He said the government's ramped-up efforts to give vulnerable people the coronavirus vaccine should help the UK to ""get back to some sort of normality later this year"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssbergsaid there was currently no expectation that Westminster will impose more extensive restrictions. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she discussed possible tighter restrictions with members of her cabinet on Tuesday morning. Home Secretary Priti Patel and chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, will hold a coronavirus press conference at Downing Street later. The latest figures on Monday,externalshowed a further 529 people had died within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, while another 46,169 cases were reported. There are also more than 32,200 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, data shows. Dame Cressida told BBC Radio 4's Today programme some 75 police officers are joining185 firefighters,externalin being trained to drive ambulances in the capital, to help London Ambulance Service as the number of cases of the virus continues to rise. Andwriting in the Times,external, she said her officers had found people hosting raves, house parties and basement gambling events, despite clear laws that ban social gatherings. ""It is preposterous to me that anyone could be unaware of our duty to do all we can to stop the spread of the virus,"" she said, adding that people breaking Covid laws were ""increasingly likely to face fines"". Police chiefs in other parts of England have also warned""patience is running out"" with rule-breakers, with the public increasingly willing to report alleged rule breaches. Since March, some 32,000 penalties for breaching Covid laws have been issued in England and Wales - with a sharp rise in penalties during England's November lockdown. Almost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out in the weeks up to Christmas as police began moving more quickly from ""engage"", ""explain"" and ""encourage"" tothe fourth ""e""- ""enforcement"". Expect the rate of fines to continue upwards during January, given the scale of the emergency and the pressure from government on constabularies to enforce the law. But there is also a tension here. Police chiefs have told their officers they will often have to use their own judgement because the list of ""reasonable excuses"" in the law for why someone can be outside is not fixed in stone. There is a lot of wriggle room in the law to allow daily lives to continue. While ministers, scientists and health experts are all hammering home the message that people should stay at home as much as possible, the law is more liberal - for instance, there is no restriction on exercise in England. And that's why some police officers believe they are stuck between a rock and a hard place as people who don't want to be locked down find more and more creative ways to stretch the rules to breaking point. Fines start at Â£200 inEngland,externalandNorthern Ireland,external, and Â£60 inWales,externalandScotland,external. Large parties can be shut down by the police, with fines of up to Â£10,000. Dame Cressida told the Today programme the move towards greater enforcement was ""common sense"" rather than a show of ""dictatorial policing"". She also saidPrime Minister Boris Johnson's cycle in east Londonat the weekend was ""not against the law"", but added the ""stay local"" guidance on exercise for England could be made more clear. What are the lockdown rules across the UK? Track the number of cases in your area Tesco, Asda and Waitrose ban shoppers without masks Under Scotland's lockdown restrictions, people must start and finish their exercise in the same place - and to do so, they may travel up to five miles from the boundary of their local authority area. People in Wales should start and finish exercising from their home, while those in Northern Ireland are advised not to go more than 10 miles from home when exercising. Asked if she would like to see similar detail in England's guidance, Dame Cressida said: ""That is certainly something the government could consider. ""Anything that brings greater clarity, for officers and the public, in general, will be a good thing."" Dame Cressida also said she was delighted that a proposal to prioritise frontline officers for vaccines was being discussed Police chiefs have been under increasing pressure to enforce the lockdown laws - with a number of news reports about breaches of Covid rules in recent days. In one case, Derbyshire Police withdrew penalties for two women who had been fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk together - following widespread media attention. Watch: 'Police need to be firm to save lives' 'Blatant' Covid breaches in pubs and gyms Women's lockdown exercise fines dropped Home Secretary Priti Patel has defended the way police have handled breaches, saying there is a need for ""strong enforcement"". Four people were arrested in Edinburgh on Monday after anti-lockdown protesters clashed with police England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - which are in charge of making their own coronavirus restrictions. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters In her article, Dame Cressida said she was ""delighted to hear"" that a proposal to prioritise frontline officers to get vaccinated was being ""actively discussed"", as the rate of officers self-isolating has risen. So far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, as part of the government's plan to vaccinate tens of millions of people by the spring. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said members of the armed forces were working ""hand in hand with the NHS"" to help with the response to the UK's epidemic.

'Play your part' in fight against Covid - Patel,"This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""Our selfless police officers... will enforce the regulations and I will back them to do so"" People have been urged to ""play your part"" and follow Covid rules by Home Secretary Priti Patel, who says she will back police to enforce laws. At a No 10 briefing, Ms Patel said a minority were ""putting the health of the nation at risk"" by flouting rules. Police are ""moving more quickly to issuing fines"", she added, with nearly 45,000 fixed penalty notices issued across the UK. Another 1,243 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid. And there have beena further 45,533 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK,external. Meanwhile, another 145,076 people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 20,768 a second dose, bringing the totals respectively to 2,431,648 and 412,167. What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? Could police fine me for exercising? Can I hug my vaccinated dad? And other questions Four arrested over 'public nuisance' at hospitals At the briefing, Ms Patel said: ""My message today to anyone refusing to do the right thing is simple: if you do not play your part, our selfless police officers - who are out there risking their own lives every day to keep us safe - they will enforce the regulations. ""And I will back them to do so, to protect our NHS and to save lives."" It comes after the UK's most senior police officer saidlockdown rule-breakers were more likely to be finedas Covid laws would be enforced ""more quickly"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said her officers had been forced to break up parties, despite hospitals in London struggling to cope with rising patient numbers. Chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Martin Hewitt, who also spoke at the Downing Street briefing, said people should be asking themselves whether their reason for leaving home was ""truly essential"". He stressed that police officers had been ""putting themselves at risk in order to keep people safe"", and said it had been ""disappointing"" to see some of the behaviour by rule-breakers. He said examples of recent breaches included: a boat party in Hertfordshire with a bar and DJ booth, where more than 40 people had each paid Â£30 for a ticket a minibus full of people from different households travelling from Cheltenham to Wales for a walk a Â£10,000 fine in Surrey for the organiser of a party who was trying to claim it was a business event Mr Hewitt said he made ""no apology"" for police issuing fines, and warned people breaking rules - such as by organising parties or not wearing face coverings on public transport - to ""expect"" a fine. Asked if there needed to be more clarity on the guidance around exercise and staying local, Mr Hewitt said it would be wrong to put a ""particular distance"" on how far people could exercise from their home - as it would be too difficult for police to enforce. He said it was right there was an exception to allow people to exercise, but insisted it was the public's responsibility to make sure they were doing so safely. There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started falling. There has now been two consecutive days where newly diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in London, the south east and east of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. Thenorth west of Englandis causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having any significant impact, so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising - patients being admitted at the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago - but it does at least offer a glimmer of hope. Later in the news conference, NHS medical director for London Dr Vin Diwakar said the capital'sNightingale hospital has reopenedand was admitting patients to help with the coronavirus spread. He told reporters it was taking non-Covid patients to help free up beds in London's hospitals. Dr Diwakar warned that if levels of hospitalisation in the capital continued to rise then more patients would need to be transferred out of London, adding that the NHS across the country was under pressure. In Birmingham, 200 doctors are being redeployed to one of the country's largest intensive care units as it nears capacity. TheUniversity Hospitals Birmingham Trust saidthere were 873 patients with Covid-19 in their hospitals, with 125 in intensive care. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Earlier, crime and policing minister Kit Malthouse said people have a ""duty"" to make this lockdown ""the last one"". ""We are urging the small minority of people who aren't taking this seriously to do so now, and [we say] to them that, if they don't, they are much more likely to get fined by the police,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Dame Cressida told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move towards greater enforcement was ""common sense"" rather than a show of ""dictatorial policing"". Fines start at Â£200 inEngland,externalandNorthern Ireland,external, and Â£60 inWales,externalandScotland,external. Large parties can be shut down by the police, with fines of up to Â£10,000. England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - all of which are in charge of deciding and enforcing their own coronavirus restrictions.

The people who have died with Covid-19,"More than 12,500 people have died with coronavirus, since the first reported death in Scotland on 13 March 2020. Here are the stories of some of those who lost their lives. If you would like to pay tribute to a loved one lost to Covid, please use the form below or email newsonline-scotland@bbc.co.uk and ensure you have read ourterms and conditionsandprivacy policy. Jean was born in 1937 Maryhill and spoke often and fondly of her childhood in ""the Butney"". This involved real hardships - including war-time evacuation to Holytown - though Jean's memories were all good and Maryhill became a touchstone when dementia became a factor in recent years. Working at Rolls-Royce Hillington, Jean was transferred to its Derby HQ where, as a young woman, she made small component parts for jet engines. Even in her 80s, Jean could still perform all the machinist actions (with sound effects). She loved to paint landscapes and had a life-long passion for music, especially jazz (with Frankie and Ella being constants). She was a great singer and dancer, always up for fun and laughs, brightening up any party. Her family said Jean was a fabulous mum to two daughters, a brilliant friend, and a warm-hearted women with kindness for everyone and anyone. She died on 27 October 2020. Rashelle Baird's family describe her as ""kind, bubbly, and always the life and soul of the party"". The 27-year-old mother-of-three from Brechin had put off appointments to get the vaccine because she was busy with her children. Her family stressed she was not anti-vaccine. ""She wanted to get her vaccine but she put her kids first,"" her father Stephen said. Rashelle, who had asthma, initially thought she had caught a cold from her children, but her symptoms worsened and she was admitted to hospital. She died in November 2021 after several days in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, having been placed in an induced coma in the intensive care unit. Family's vaccine plea after 27-year-old's Covid death David Trower worked as a clerical officer in the A&E department of University Hospital Monklands in Airdrie before retiring in 2016. But he was committed to the NHS and even in retirement he chose to continue to work shifts, through NHS Lanarkshire's staff bank, right up until February. He died on 9 March 2021, aged 67. His colleagues thought highly of him, saying: ""We have many happy memories of shifts together, laughs, nights out, and listening to all his stories of his many holidays abroad. We will miss him."" Bernadette White, his sister, said he was a caring, gentle and loving man with a wicked sense of humour. She added: ""The last seven years, I would say, is when David started to live his life, doing the things that made him happy without having to worry about anyone else."" Stephen Stewart met his future wife, Heather, at a youth club when he was just 14. They got engaged on his 17th birthday and he had just turned 20 when they married. The couple, who lived in Motherwell, came from ""very different"" backgrounds but they grew up together during their 25-year marriage while raising their only child. Stephen took pride in his work for concrete manufacturer FP McCann, latterly as a lab technician working out what strength the concrete needed to be for certain projects. Outside work, he loved fishing, computer games, gadgets and during the first lockdown he managed to build a hot tub shelter with the help of a series of YouTube videos. He died of Covid pneumonia at University Hospital Wishaw on 19 February 2021, aged 45. Family of 45-year-old Covid victim warn of dangers Nan Douglas worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. She was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. After losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. Following a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a ""living wake"" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. She lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she picked up Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. Graeme McGrath's greatest passions were rowing and the River Clyde. On the day of his funeral, fellow rowers held oars in a guard of honour at Glasgow Green in a tribute appreciated by his wife Anne and their three sons. For 40 years Graeme volunteered with the Glasgow Humane Society and was often called on to row rescue boats on the Clyde, or to help evacuate families during floods. After undergoing a kidney transplant in his 50s, he was unable to get out on the river as much. He retired from his job as a Thomas Cook travel agent and moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire. But he still felt the pull of the Clyde and regularly returned to the city to meet friends and row safety boats at regattas. He died with Covid on 15 February 2021 at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, aged 66, after being admitted for an infection affecting his heart. Tommy Morrow spent most of his life in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, where he met his partner Jackie and raised their children, Demi and Mark. His family described him as a character and not a day went by without them laughing at his jokes. He loved camping and fishing in places like Stornoway with his friends but the most important people in his life were his family, including grandchildren, Lacey and Louden. During his career he worked in various well-known hotels and restaurants in Glasgow but he had not worked for some years due to poor health, including COPD. He died with Covid on 15 February 2021, aged 53. ""It was so cruel - he was so close to getting the vaccine,"" his family said. Tommy Rooney was a bus driver for 36 years and hugely popular with colleagues at First Bus in Larbert. On the day of his funeral they were among dozens of people who lined the streets and applauded as his cortege passed the depot. First Bus operations managerJason Hackett told the Falkirk Herald that Tommy was the ""heart and soul"",externalof the Larbert station. Married to Margaret, the Bonnybridge man had two daughters and a granddaughter who described him as a ""humble but proud family man who put everyone else's needs before his own"". An avid Celtic fan, he spent much of the pandemic driving key workers to their essential duties. He died on 12 February 2021, aged 57. David Gray's first grandchild - a girl called Islay - was born in July 2020. The proud ""papa"" used to say that she was the love of his life and she gave him a reason to wake up in the morning. Tragically, the 62-year-old only got to spend five months with her before falling ill with Covid. He died on 3 February 2021. David lived in Erskine and worked for BAE Systems for 20 years, first as a mechanical fitter then as records manager dealing with secret files for the Ministry of Defence. His family describe him as ""music daft"" - he played guitar and he was performing a gig with his band in Glasgow when he met his wife, Joyce, 40 years ago. They went on to have two children - Darren and Danielle - as well as his beloved Cocker Spaniels, Buster and Shimmer, who he described as his ""bairns"". Harry Osborne was a Dunkirk veteran whose life was full of adventures - his daughter said he was still able to recall stories until just a few days before he died. Mr Osborne was deployed to France months after joining the Territorial Army in Glasgow, served with the 77th Highland Field Regiment of the Royal Artillery and later became a surveyor. Friends recall how upon joining, he promised his mother he would not swear and instead would say ""cricky jings"", which became his nickname in the forces. He was also known as a keen golfer with a ""wicked sense of humour"". Mr Osborne died from Covid-19 on 25 January, nine months after celebrating his 100th birthday. Connie Simpson's grandchildren say she was more like a pal than a granny - she was full of fun and laughter, and was always the first up to dance at a party. Born in Kinning Park, Glasgow, she moved to the east end after marrying John who she met at the Barrowlands when they were teenagers. While John was away with the Merchant Navy, she brought up their four children in a house ""surrounded by love"", before taking work as a curtain consultant. She was fabulous even in her 80s - she loved getting her hair, eyebrows and manicure done, meeting friends at Mecca Bingo in Parkhead and at a local pensioners' club. Connie died on 23 January 2021 at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow, aged 82. Sheila Gartly was as ""bright as a button"" and the ""heart of our family"", her loved ones said.

During her working life she had jobs in a florist and in a fish shop - both of which she thoroughly enjoyed. She loved to watch the birds in her garden, read her daily newspaper, listen to traditional Scottish music, and the spring and summer when the nights were lighter and flowers bloomed. In 2019 she had surgery on a broken leg but she was recovering well.  She died with Covid on 19 January 2021, aged 86.

During his long life he enjoyed skiing, tennis, pottery, sailing, golf, holidays in Europe, Australia and North America, single malts and red wine. He had been well cared for by Randolph Hill nursing home in Dunblane for 19 months after developing dementia. Covid restrictions meant he had not seen his family, other than by Skype, for a year.

He died on 14 January, aged 79, the day after his friend the Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia. ""Both bishops succumbed to the lethal effects of the coronavirus,"" the current Bishop of Dunkeld, Stephen Robson, added. The Archbishop of Glasgow, the Most Reverend Philip Tartaglia, died suddenly at his home in the city on 13 January - the Feast of St Mungo, the Patron Saint of Glasgow. He had been self-isolating after testing positive for Covid shortly after Christmas. Born in Glasgow in 1951, he was ordained a priest in 1975 and had served as leader of Scotland's largest Catholic community since 2012.

Liz spent her early childhood in New Luce but moved to the railway station cottage in Dunragit where her father worked as a signalman. During a varied working life, Liz left school to work in the laboratory of the nearby Nestle factory and later replaced her own mother as the local school's dinner lady.

""Everyone wanted him at their party not just to take photos but because of his personality,"" said his son, Tony McAllister. ""Everyone loved him because what you seen is what you got."" Shug died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 5 January, aged 70. His sudden death has left his family heartbroken. For more than 75 years George Wight lived on his dairy farm in the village of Drumoak in Aberdeenshire. But he had more than one string to his bow - as well as being a dairy farmer, for 25 years he was also the publican of his local, the Irvine Arms. A loyal Aberdeen FC fan, he was one of the lucky ones - he was in Gothenburg in 1983 to see the his beloved Dons lift the European Cup Winners Cup. He was devoted to his family, including wife Claire and their four children, and despite suffering a series of bereavements and health setbacks, he always bounced back.

They usually decorate a small table-top tree for the festive season, but this year Mr Maley ordered a 5ft showstopper illuminated with multi-coloured stars to fill the window of their Grangemouth home. The great-grandfather will never get to see the tree in its full glory. He died at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert on 12 November, shortly after falling ill with Covid-19.

He would stand up for people. ""We were together for 40 years and he was a very good father and a very good husband to me.""

Unable to visit the home, his family spoke to him for the last time in a video-call a few hours before he died on 5 May. As he listened to their voices, he reached out to the hand of the carer sitting with him, dressed in full personal protective equipment. ""We found it quite poignant that my dad put out his hand to hers and she was wearing these blue protective gloves,"" said his son, John. Son's grief at not being at father's bedside Paul McCaffrey was an ""amazing dad"" of two children and two step-children who was always busy, according to his partner Caroline McNultry.

She was a real homemaker who could as easily run up a set of curtains as make a batch of jam from fruit she had grown in her own garden. She never turned anyone away who needed help. A mild-mannered woman, she never had any need to raise her voice - a look over the top of her spectacles was enough to keep her children under control.

When the holiday - including a trip to Fiji - was cancelled due to coronavirus restrictions, David was pragmatic and told his wife, Glenda, they could rearrange for a later date. It was a shock when he tested positive for Covid-19 after being admitted to hospital with a chest infection. He died on 24 April after more than four weeks in ICU. Glenda took comfort from the funeral, when neighbours lined the streets, running club friends and former colleagues stood outside the crematorium, and hundreds watched the service online.

She was a ""remarkable, formidable woman with a strong work ethic"", Mr McCaffery told BBC Scotland, but she was also a ""gentle soul with an incredibly child-like sense of humour"". A grandmother and great-grandmother, Mrs Tonner died at a nursing home in Glasgow where she was living with Alzheimer's, on 8 April. She was 84. Mary Nixon was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when she was just 18 but she was determined to never let it hold her back. Born and raised in Greenock, she was a lone parent to four children who described her as a ""strong, independent woman who lived life to the full"". ""My mum made being a single parent look easy"", her daughter Alexis said. ""We were very happy kids growing up. Everyone loved her and always said she was a 'wee gem'."" When she fell seriously ill in 2014, her family was told to prepare for the worst, but their ""invincible"" mum rallied, though she lost her mobility. She died with Covid on 7 April 2020, aged 66. After everything she had been through in life, her family said they felt ""robbed... that this awful virus has taken her from us"". Janice Graham was the first NHS worker to die with coronavirus in Scotland. The health care support worker and district nurse died at Inverclyde Royal Hospital on 6 April. One colleague said she had a ""bright and engaging personality and razor sharp wit"". Another said the 58-year-old was the ""most kind, caring and compassionate HCA I have had the privilege to work with"". Her son, Craig,told STV News,externalhe would miss everything about her. Nurse remembered for her 'kindness and compassion' Newly-wed Andy Wyness developed a high temperature and a cough following a trip to Wales. When his symptoms worsened the 53-year-old drove himself from his Wishaw home to an appointment at an assessment centre. That was the last time his wife, Sandra, saw him. The grandfather, who was a keen bowler, was taken straight to hospital by ambulance. He died on 6 April. ""Even walking out the house that night, although I knew he wasn't well, I never imagined he would never walk back in,"" Sandra said. My husband went to the doctor and never came back Rita Hawthorn spent the first 35 years of her life in Hamilton, where she was born, grew up and had her own family. But when her husband, Robert, lost his job as a miner the couple and their three children re-located from the west of Scotland to the far north in 1973. While Robert took up a new job at the Scottish Instruments Factory in Wick, she worked as a cleaner at a nearby job centre and became secretary of the Highlands and Islands Civil Service Union. She was sadly widowed at 51 but she was ""fiercely independent"" and went on to fulfil her dreams of travelling - a trip up the Nile, a safari in South Africa, and solo bus tours to Austria and Paris. Rita, who was a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, fell ill during the first week of lockdown. She died at Caithness General Hospital on 6 April, aged 82. Bill Paul grew up in Giffnock on the south side of Glasgow and did his national service as a radar operator with the RAF in Malta. In his youth he was an extremely accomplished tennis player and it was through the sport that he met his first wife, Frances, who died in 1984. With his second wife, Liz, he loved to play golf and travel - hobbies that he continued after her death in 2012. An extremely active man, he loved to go on cruises with a group of like-minded friends. However his last cruise to the Caribbean was cut short by the pandemic in March. He returned home to Arran and fell ill with Covid within a week. He died at Lamlash Hospital on 5 April, aged 81. Mofizul Islam was beginning a new life in Scotland after relocating from Bangladesh when he fell ill with coronavirus. His family believe the 49-year-old caught the virus on his daily three-hour journeys between their Edinburgh home and his job at a pizza outlet in Midlothian. He died on 5 April and was buried in the Muslim section of a city cemetery but his wife and children were in isolation and unable to attend. His death has left the family ""completely helpless"", according to a family friend as they have no documents, no bank account and they are struggling for money. ""We are very worried about our future because we don't have our father,"" said Mofizul's 19-year-old son, Azahural. ""He was everything for us. And now we are just hopeless."" Family 'helpless' after father's coronavirus death Catherine Sweeney was a ""wonderful mother, sister and beloved aunty"", her family said after her death on 4 April. Born and raised in Dumbarton, she worked as a home carer for more than 20 years. Her family said she would be sorely missed after a ""lifetime of service"" to the community. And they praised the medics at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley who ""heroically"" looked after her in her final days. Carer was 'dedicated to the most vulnerable' Jimmy Andrews was 17 years old when began his career in Glasgow Corporation's finance department in 1955. By the turn of the century, he had risen to become chief executive of Glasgow City Council and in 2001 he was appointed CBE for services to local government - a ""career highlight"". He was born in Kilsyth but spent much of his life living in Strathblane, Stirlingshire, with his wife of 52 years, Mary. In retirement, he ""enjoyed life to the full"", spending time with his three children and six grandchildren, and visiting horse racing courses throughout the country. A gentle, intelligent man with a great sense of humour, he died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 3 April 2020, aged 81. Lord Gordon of Strathblane was a former political editor of STV and he founded Radio Clyde. He died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 31 March after contracting coronavirus, Radio Clyde reported. He was 83. His family paid tribute to his ""generosity, his kindness and his enthusiasm for life"". Former First Minister Jack McConnell said Lord Gordon had ""an outstanding career in business and public service"". Labour peer dies 'after contracting coronavirus' Ryan Storrie was in Scotland to celebrate his 40th birthday with a trip to a Rangers match when he fell ill. The father-of-two was from Ardrossan but lived in Dubai. When he developed symptoms, the asthmatic isolated in his hotel room and waited for the virus to run its course. His condition deteriorated but he wouldn't let his wife, Hilary, phone 999 as he was convinced he would recover and didn't want to bother the NHS. She found him dead in his room on 31 March. 'Ryan was the last person I expected to die' Mary and Andy Leaman began self-isolating at the end of March after falling ill with flu-like symptoms. Their son, Andy, told theGlasgow Evening Times,externalthe couple were married 50 years and doted on their only granddaughter, nine-year-old Anna. Mrs Leaman died at home in Castlemilk on 30 March - four days after the death of Anna's maternal grandfather, Dougie Chambers. The schoolgirl lost her third grandparent almost three weeks later when Mr Leaman died in hospital on 19 April. Her mother, Lynsey Chalmers, told BBC Scotland: ""For a nine-year-old girl whose three grandparents were her world... why does a wee girl need to get punished like that over and over again?"" Earlier lockdown 'could have stopped 2,000 deaths' Robert Tarbet was ""self-opinionated and witty"", according to his daughter, Paula Karoly, but also ""hardworking, loyal and beautiful"". He spent his working life as a plumber with Glasgow City Council before retiring in the early 2000s. In his spare time, the sociable man was a mason who was a keen follower of Rangers FC. He loved country and western music and watching musicals in the theatre. A father and a grandfather-of-three, he was being treated for cancer when he contracted coronavirus. He died on 29 March at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, aged 76. School janitor Ian Wilson was at home in Coatbridge for two weeks with a high temperature and delirium before being admitted to hospital. Despite his worsening condition, doctors initially told his wife, Sandra, she would not be able to visit the 72-year-old who had a heart condition and diabetes. Staff eventually granted access provided she wore protective equipment - a decision which meant she could be at her husband's side when he died on 29 March. Although nurses were unable to comfort her with a hug due to social distancing protocols, Mrs Wilson is grateful they allowed her to be with her partner at the end. ""I was able to talk to him and just say goodbye. I've got strength from that,"" she said. The impact my husband's death had on NHS staff Dougie Chambers was one of several people who fell ill after the 40th birthday party of his daughter, Wendy, on 7 March. Within days, the 66-year-old, who had an underlying health condition, went into hospital and tested positive for Covid-19. Mr Chambers, who was from Castlemilk in Glasgow, died two weeks later, on 26 March. Two other members of his extended family - Andy and Mary Leaman - also contracted the virus and later died. Wendy said: ""If we knew then what we know now, we wouldn't have had the party. It wouldn't have happened."" Earlier lockdown 'could have stopped 2,000 deaths' Danny Cairns was a healthy 68-year-old before he fell ill with coronavirus, according to his brother, Hugh. When he developed a cough and sore throat at the end of March, he isolated at home in Greenock. But within days he was so ill he had to be taken to hospital by ambulance. In a video call from his hospital bed, his last words to his brother were: ""I'm on my way out, mate"". He died on 26 March, three days after arriving in hospital. 'I'm on my way out, mate' Margaret Innes lived with her daughter, Sally McNaught, in Edinburgh for four years before her death at the very beginning of the pandemic. She was housebound and very frail but she loved sitting with their pet cat and dog, doing crosswords and watching quiz shows. Her favourite soap was Neighbours and she used to say ""I'm off to Australia now"". Ms McNaught said they stopped visitors coming to the house a week before lockdown, they washed their hands, cleaned everything and thought they would be safe. But Ms Innes woke up on Mother's Day with severe breathing difficulties. She died on 25 March, three days after going into hospital. She was 93. .

Eleven ambulances were sent to a care home in Cornwall at the weekend after a coronavirus outbreak, it has been confirmed. Coronavirus rapidly spread to 25 residents at Trengrouse care home in Helston and many staff were off sick or self-isolating despite best efforts to prevent the spread, bosses said. Three residents were taken to hospital. Others needed oxygen and are being looked after at the home. Bosses said staff and residents were being ""tested very regularly"" and ""we'll never know how it came into the home"". Read more here. With new lockdowns now in force in England, most of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we've been answering some of your questions. Cheryle Locke asked: ""My 89-year-old father had the vaccine a week ago. Is it safe to hug him now?"" If someone is vaccinated they should still follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. Thatâs because no vaccine is 100% effective and it is not yet clear if immunisation will stop people catching and spreading coronavirus, even though it protects against severe illness and death. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection. However, if you have alreadyformed a support bubblewith your father, you can have close physical contact with him.

Campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford helped secured changes last year We reported earlier on the outcry about the supply of food parcels to children on free school meals in England during lockdown after the contents of one company's hamper went viral on social media. A mother had posted a photo of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of food items, and questioned whether the contents were sufficient. It came to the attention of footballer Marcus Rashford, who secured changes to government policy on free school meals last year after launching a campaign on the issue. He sought a meeting with the supplier, Chartwells. The company has now apologised, but stressed the hamper was not for five days - not 10 - as had been suggested on social media. But it said: ""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance."" Read more about this story here. The NHS trust with the largest intensive care capacity in the UK has confirmed it now has almost 200 more Covid patients in its four hospitals than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. University Hospitals Birmingham said it has 873 patients with Covid-19 in its hospitals and 125 in intensive care. It comes after the Health Service Journal
published a leaked email to staff which suggested the trust risked being ""overwhelmed"". A hospital spokesperson said: ""We continue to expand our
intensive care and acute medical teams so they are able to treat the rising
number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery
including cancer operations. ""Every member of staff will be
supported by the Trust in delivering the best care wherever they are
working.""  Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The police are stepping up enforcement because they believe many people
breaking the Covid regulations are doing so because they are stubborn, not
because they donât understand what is allowed. The public, police, and legal experts do struggle to keep up with
the ever-changing rules. But the organisers of a party on a boat in Hertfordshire, the passengers
on a minibus heading for Wales, and the couple who travelled 120 miles to ""watch seals"" would have struggled to explain to the officers issuing them with
fines that they were confused. Those were clear breaches.  More complicated is the fine line
between the law - which police officers can enforce - and the government
guidance, which they canât. No law says exercise can only be conducted once a day, or for a specific
duration. These are pieces of firm guidance, along with the request to ""stay
local"", which resulted in criticism of the prime minister after his bike ride
in east London. It would be difficult to set a distance limit which would work for both
people living in rural areas and inner cities.  Impossible to prove that a
65-minute run was in breach of the law. Which is why the success of the measures will rely on personal
responsibility in the end. And why some experts are saying that different
messages such as ""act like youâve got it"" or ""thanks for doing the right thing"" might
cut through better than a list of regulations to be obeyed.   Ben WrightBBC political correspondent National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt says a limit on
how far people can travel for exercise in England would be difficult for police
to enforce. Earlier today the Metropolitan Police said exercise should begin and end at
someoneâs front door if possible. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wonât
speculate about tougher rules but says there are âendless discussionsâ within
government about tightening the measures. It wonât happen today but it clearly
could soon. In the meantime she hopes to clear up confusion and firm up
compliance but is insisting the current rules are clear. In a very stern voice. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Questions keep cropping up
about when key workers, such as supermarket staff and teachers, will be
vaccinated. There was one at todayâs
televised briefing. Some argue key workers should
be part of this first phase of the vaccination programme, which will see all over-50s, front-line health and care staff, and younger adults with health conditions
vaccinated by the end of April. But the assessment by the
governmentâs scientific advisers is pretty simple. They have targeted those who
are most at risk of dying if infected. Someone who is over the age
of 75 â the age group that is being prioritised immediately for vaccination by
mid-February - has a one in eight chance of dying if they catch Covid. By comparison, a person who
is 40 has a one in 1,000 chance. And that risk almost entirely
lies with those in that age group who have a health condition and therefore
would be part of this first phase anyway.  Reality Check At Home Secretary Priti Patelâs
news conference, Ian from Preston asked why the rules are more relaxed than
they were during the first lockdown last year if the new variant is more infectious. We know the government
recognises the situation is more serious because the UK is at threat level five - the highest level - which means there is a
danger of the NHS being overwhelmed within
21 days. In the first lockdown the UK was
only at threat level four. But the restrictions appear less
severe than they were in March. For example, support bubbles and childcare
bubbles exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds are open when they were
closed last time. And communal worship is still allowed as long as social distancing is observed. But one significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops and public transport. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened: Priti Patel mentioned the latest government statistics on coronavirus during the briefing this evening. A further 1,243 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to thelatest figures on the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external That brings the UK total to 81,960. The UK has also recorded a further 45,533 positive coronavirus test results. And 2,431,648 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But
what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started
falling. There have now been two consecutive days where newly
diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the
average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in
London, the South East and East of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. The North West is
causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having
any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the
tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look
like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising â patients being admitted at
the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago â but it does at
least offer a glimmer of hope. Alan Tolhurst from Politics Home asks whether the vaccination centres are Covid secure and have adequate ventilation. The home secretary cites the government's vaccination delivery plan and says the sites have spaced-out cubicles and other features to support social distancing and protect staff, following all of the guidance from Public Health England. Dr Diwakar says ""absolutely rigid"" infection controls are in place, including in the ExCel centre in London, which he visited recently. He says gels and masks are provided and the last thing staff want is to inadvertently pass on the virus to those being vaccinated, particularly the over-80s and other vulnerable people. ""We have spent months preparing to set these centres up and we are guided by really strict rules."" With that, Ms Patel brings the presser to an end.  The home secretary is asked how the public can understand what constitutes staying local,after two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk but had the penalties withdrawn. Priti Patel says the police ""exercise their professional judgement"" and points out that the fine in that case was rescinded. ""When we have people dying... we all have to exercise our judgement,"" she says. The new lockdown in England allows people to exercise with one other person from another household in an open public space, but says you should staytwo metres apartfrom each other. Ms Patel says: ""When it comes to exercising, again I do say stay local. Stay local is absolutely crucial. ""By all means take your daily exercise, but it's up to all of us in the right way to exercise that judgement as to how we do it - not socialising, making sure we're acting in the right way, staying away from other people."" She says that is ""clearly what the prime minister"" did when herode his bicycle seven miles from home. She adds: ""We all have to ask ourselves what can we do to keep everyone safe."" Martin Hewitt says ""this is unprecedented territory"" for police. ""Sometimes mistakes will be made but we always have looked at those, we've looked at those quickly... and we have said when we've got something wrong."" The home secretary says the government is ""absolutely working"" on getting frontline workers such as police, teachers and supermarket staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Diane from York, Priti Patel acknowledged they were ""at occupational risk of coming in in contact with the virus"". But she said the government was following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation who had ""thought carefully"" when it identified the top priority groups to receive the vaccine first. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, said he would ""obviously"" back the call for vaccinations for police as the ""nature of policing is that those officers are having daily to deal with people where they have no idea whether they are infected"".  Next up is the Telegraph's Gordon Rayner, who says countries such as France and Italy were able to cope with 40,000 patients going into hospital without asking everyone to stay at home. Could the NHS have been better prepared, he asks? Dr Diwakar said the NHS spent the summer learning the lessons of the first wave and preparing for the winter, investing in critical care. Hundreds of extra beds have been made available in London and patients have been moved elsewhere in the UK where extra capacity is available and that is how the NHS is coping. On a separate question, Ms Patel says there is a ""live"" debate within government on the current rules but says she will not speculate on whether they could be tightened up further. ""All rules are constantly under review within government but right now we are focusing very much on compliance enforcement"". Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel has reinforced the governmentâs
âstay at homeâ message. But to what extent is that being
followed and how has our behaviour changed compared with Englandâs first national
lockdown last March? Apple and Google record mobility
data which is pulled together by recording the location histories on people's
mobile devices and comparing it to a pre-coronavirus level. On Friday, the number of people
driving was down by 31% compared with the pre-Covid level. But it was down 63% on the first
Friday of the first lockdown in March 2020. Similar data shows that a higher
proportion of people were in workplaces, parks and grocery shops last Friday
compared with the first lockdown. But this could be in part down to
more places, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents, being open
this time. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. Sam Coates from Sky asks whether the government is concentrating too much on enforcing the rules in spaces like parks when they should be looking at workplaces and public transport. Ms Patel says ""when it comes to the rules... our target and our objective is to save lives, this isn't about picking out individual groups"". ""When it comes to the enforcement of those rules, it is right that we go after those breaches,"" she says, referring to things like parties. But she adds that ""this is a collective effort"" and that police are working with local authorities and other bodies to enforce the rules. She thanks supermarkets that have ""stepped up their efforts"" to make sure people are social distancing. On workplaces, Martin Hewitt says: ""That is ultimately the responsibility of any business or owner in that space."" He adds: ""Primarily our space is the public space."" ITV's Dan Hewitt asks whether the rules are tough enough to contain the virus and whether they need to be clarified, referring to the row over Boris Johnson's Olympic Park bike ride. Martin Hewitt answers first, saying there has been a lot of focus on the definition of local and he doesn't think it is sensible to mandate a certain distance people can travel as this would be challenging for the police to enforce. He says exemptions for exercise are fair and they are easily understood. People need to ask themselves whether their actions are essential and being done in the safest way possible. Ms Patel says exercise is important for people's health and wellbeing and says most people are adhering to the stay local guidance. ""The rules are tough enough,"" she adds. ""The message is clear. ""The more we follow the rules is the sooner we can drive this awful, atrocious virus down."" Mark Easton from the BBC asks Priti Patel why the rules of this lockdown aren't as tough as they were last spring. She says: ""The rules are actually very simple and clear - we are meant to stay at home and only leave home for a very very limited number of reasons."" She adds that ""everyone has to be conscientious in our actions"" and echoes Dr Diwakar's comment that people should act as if they have the virus. ""The rules are clear,"" she says. Martin Hewitt says: ""From our perspective we will carry on engaging [with] people... but I think the rules are clear."" He adds: ""You're right that the regulations have shifted over that period of time... but I think it's very clear what people need to do."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lockdown lifting 'unlikely' as deaths pass 5,000Scotland's first minister says the current restrictions are ""very unlikely"" to be lifted at the end of the month.","This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Lockdown likely to extend to February Scotland's first minister has said the country's current lockdown is ""very unlikely"" to be lifted at the end of the month. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed that more than 5,000 people have now died after testing positive for the virus. A review of the current restrictions is due to be carried out at the end of January. Ms Sturgeon said it was possible that there would be no easing at that point. A further 54 deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours - bringing the total by that measure to 5,023. But the most recent figures from the National Records of Scotland - which record all deaths registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate - put the total at 6,686. Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing that the figures were a reminder of the toll the virus had taken. And she said every death had caused heartbreak to friends, families and loved ones across the country. The people who have died with Covid-19 Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? The first minister also said Scotland's NHS would be under far greater pressure if the current restrictions had not been put in place on Boxing Day. And she urged people not to raise their expectations about what will be announced when the lockdown review is completed in a fortnight as wholesale lifting of the restrictions was ""very unlikely"". She added: ""There may not even be any lifting of these restrictions as soon as the end of January - we will have to consider all of that carefully and set it out in due course."" All of mainland Scotland and some islands were placed into level four restrictions on 26 December, with schools remaining closed to most pupils until at least the end of the month. A further 1,875 positive cases of the virus were recorded on Monday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 153,423. The number of people in hospital with the virus stands at 1,717 - an increase of 53 since yesterday and higher than the peak of about 1,500 in the first wave in April. Of these, 133 patients are intensive care units, with Ms Sturgeon saying that the virus was putting ""very acute pressure"" on hospitals. The first minister also said that 175,942 people in Scotland had received their first vaccine dose by Monday. Opposition parties have claimed that the rollout of the vaccine has been ""sluggish"" in Scotland compared to south of the border - a charge that the government denies. And they have called for greater transparency over how many people are being given the jab every day. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said on Monday that the government was aiming to vaccinate about 560,000 people in Scotland by 31 January. Non-essential shops have been closed in Scotland since 26 December The Scottish government has previously said it is concerned that too many people have not been following the ""stay at home"" rules that are in place across the whole of the mainland and some islands. Ministers have been discussing the possibility of imposing tougher rules on click and collect shopping and takeaway food, with an announcement expected to be made on Wednesday. Retail industry representatives have described click and collect services as a ""lifeline"" for struggling businesses amid the forced closure of all non-essential shops. And they said they had not been shown any evidence that click and collect was driving transmission of the virus. Ms Sturgeon told her daily coronavirus briefing that the government may not stop click and collect services altogether. But she added: ""If we are saying to people right now that you should not be out of your home for shopping unless it is essential, then do we need to have click and collect for non-essential services instead of having that for delivery?"" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Scotland that he did not want to see further restrictions put in place unless there was evidence that they would have the desired effect. He also suggested that restricting click and collect would simply result in more people going back into supermarkets to do their shopping. The Scottish government is also under pressure to lift the the current ban on public Sunday worship, with a group of 500 church leaders from across the UK - including 200 in Scotland - insisting that there is ""no evidence of any tangible contribution to community transmission through churches in Scotland"". In a letter to the first minister, they claim that the ban may be unlawful and accuse the government of failing to understand that ""Christian worship is an essential public service, and especially vital to our nation in a time of crisis"". A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Test and Protect tells us where people were in their 48-hour infectious period. ""So we know that on one day last week the seven-day number for places of worship was 120, and data from yesterday shows the seven-day number for places of worship is 38, underlining the essential decision to require places of worship to close for public health reasons."" Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that everyone arriving in Scotland from overseas will need to show proof of a negative test from Friday. The test will need to be ""highly reliable"", the first minister said, and will need to have been from the previous three days - although young children may be exempt from the restriction. Those travelling from countries not on the quarantine exemption list will still need to self-isolate on arrival.

Did Nicola Sturgeon break the ministerial code?That is the question an independent investigation has been tasked with answering.Scotland,"Nicola Sturgeon referred herself for an independent investigation of whether she breached the code in January 2019 Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is facing questions after her predecessor Alex Salmond accused her of ""repeatedly"" misleading parliament and breaking the ministerial code. Ms Sturgeon has rejected the accusations, but has referred herself for an independent investigation. What exactly are the claims, who will adjudicate and what could it all mean? The row centres on the Scottish government's botched investigation of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond, something which has now been subject to a wide range of inquiries. A special Holyrood committee has been looking into the circumstances which saw the government admit its probe had been ""unlawful"" and pay Mr Salmond more than Â£500,000 in legal costs. Questions have been raised about the role of Ms Sturgeon, and her contact with Mr Salmond during the investigation in 2018 - questions which prompted herto refer herself to an independent panelwhich adjudicates on the ministerial code. There has always been acode of conduct for Scottish ministers,external, setting out expected behaviours and responsibilities, but it was Mr Salmond who introduced the panel in 2008. He was investigated and cleared of breaching the code on five occasions. Suggestions that Ms Sturgeon might have broken the rules came to the fore thanks to Mr Salmond, who claimed his successor in Bute House had ""repeatedly misled"" parliament and made ""wholly false"" statements. Ms Sturgeon has insisted shehas ""nothing to hide"", did not mislead parliament, and will set out her side of the story to both inquiries in the coming weeks. Mr Salmond may get to put his side across first, having been invited to give evidence to the Holyrood committee next week. Ms Sturgeon says she has not spoken to her former mentor since their last meeting in 2018 One central question is when Ms Sturgeon learned of the two internal complaints against her predecessor. The first minister has said on a number of occasions that she first heard about them from Mr Salmond himself, at a meeting at her Glasgow home on 2 April, 2018. She has since accepted that she met Mr Salmond's former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein at her office four days earlier, on 29 March, buthad ""forgotten"" about it. Ms Sturgeon still maintains that she learned of the fact and detail of the complaints from Mr Salmond himself - an encounter which she says was ""seared on my memory"" and had ""somehow overwritten in my mind a much more fleeting, opportunistic meeting that took place a few days earlier"". However, Mr Salmond says this claim is ""simply untrue"" and ""untenable"". He says Mr Aberdein's evidence is that he ""personally discussed the existence of the complaints and summarised the substance of the complaints"" in a ""pre-arranged meeting"" on 29 March - and had shared this information with Mr Salmond and others at the time. Section 1.3of theministerial codestates that ""ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the first minister"". Pressed about this, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I do not consider that I misled parliament, but that is for others to judge."" Mr Salmond won a Â£500,000 expenses payout from the government after it conceded its investigation had been unlawful Ms Sturgeon has also insisted that she did not intervene in the complaints process - and that she did not meet Mr Salmond in her capacity as first minister, but rather as leader of the SNP. This matters in the context of the ministerial code becauseSection 4.22states that ""the basic facts"" of government meetings with ""external individuals"" should be recorded, including a list of those present and the reasons for the meeting. The 2 April meeting at Ms Sturgeon's home was not formally recorded - shetold the inquiry committee,externalshe had ""met a friend of 30 years"" as leader of the party, because she ""suspected that he may be about to resign from the SNP"". Mr Salmond says this position is ""ridiculous"", and that ""all participants in that meeting were fully aware of what the meeting was about and why it had been arranged"". He added: ""The first minister's claim that it was ever thought to be about anything other than the complaints made against me is wholly false."" Ms Sturgeon's husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, suggested in his evidence that the situation might not be quite so clear cut. He says Ms Sturgeon never discussed the complaints with him because they were government business. But his view was that Ms Sturgeon could have initially agreed the meetings thinking they were a party matter, before subsequently realising they were ""something else"". However, this does not settle the fact there were two further meetings between the pair - another in Glasgow and one in Aberdeen - which again were not formally recorded. Ms Sturgeon's response to this is that she was ""trying to protect the confidentiality and integrity"" of the complaints process. She says this section of the code is designed to ""prevent a minister having meetings about decisions that they are taking in government and not declaring them"", but says ""that was a decision I was not involved in"". Peter Murrell said Nicola Sturgeon would not discuss government business with him Yet another row concerns whether the government followed its own legal advice while contesting the judicial review case raised by Mr Salmond. The former first minister insists that counsel had informed the government before the end of October 2018 that they were staring defeat in the face, but that the case ultimately continued into the following January at the cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mr Salmond says this is contrary toSection 2.30of the code, which sets out the ""overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law"" and to ""ensure their decisions are informed by appropriate analysis of the legal considerations"". The Scottish government meanwhile says it was only much later that it became clear the case was doomed, with Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans beinggiven explicit advice,externalthat ""the only sensible and defensible action is to concede the petition"" on 29 December. The ins and outs of this may be harder to judge than the matter of the meetings, because much of the government's legal advice remains shrouded in secrecy. MSPs have twice voted to demand legal privilege be waived so that advice can be published in full. But the government argues that to do so would undermine the whole system of free and fair legal advice, and prevent lawyers from providing frank opinions in future. The Holyrood inquiry committee has beengiven some access to reports summarising the advice, but are still calling for more. The Holyrood inquiry is separate to the code investigation, but has been tracking its progress The inquiry committee might come up with a view of Ms Sturgeon's conduct, but the one that really matters is that of James Hamilton. A former head of the prosecution service in Ireland, Mr Hamilton was appointed to the ministerial standards panel in 2013. He will pen a report setting out whether or not in his judgement Ms Sturgeon breached the rules. However, as an external advisor, he would not have any power to impose a punishment - that power lies with the first minister herself, as the ultimate arbiter of the code. If he says there was no breach, Ms Sturgeon will move on unscathed. But what will happen if he returns a judgement saying the first minister broke the code? It could be argued that Mr Salmond's goal is to remove Ms Sturgeon from office given he has called for the codeinquiry to be expandedand highlighted a string of alleged infractions which the code itself suggests could prompt a resignation. Whether this would actually be the outcome of a breach is far less clear. Ms Sturgeon is at the peak of her popularity, is currently leading Scotland through a pandemic, and will be facing the judgement of the voters in a few months' time anyway. The defences she has offered so far also point to where mitigation of any breach could be offered - she could argue that it was right to focus on protecting the anonymity of the complainers, rather than minor matters like making sure meetings were minuted. On the one hand, the history of Holyrood is littered with leaders who fell from the top over relatively technical matters - Henry McLeish forsub-letting his constituency office,external, David McLetchieover taxi fares,externaland Wendy Alexander overregistering donations,external. But equally, there is a more up-to-date example of a minister being found to have breached a ministerial code and remaining in office,in Home Secretary Priti Patel. Few things about this inquiry have been clear-cut or straightforward, and the outcome may well turn out to be every bit as muddy as the process has been.

"Scotland lockdown lifting 'unlikely' as deaths pass 5,000","This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Lockdown likely to extend to February Scotland's first minister has said the country's current lockdown is ""very unlikely"" to be lifted at the end of the month. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed that more than 5,000 people have now died after testing positive for the virus. A review of the current restrictions is due to be carried out at the end of January. Ms Sturgeon said it was possible that there would be no easing at that point. A further 54 deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours - bringing the total by that measure to 5,023. But the most recent figures from the National Records of Scotland - which record all deaths registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate - put the total at 6,686. Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing that the figures were a reminder of the toll the virus had taken. And she said every death had caused heartbreak to friends, families and loved ones across the country. The people who have died with Covid-19 Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? The first minister also said Scotland's NHS would be under far greater pressure if the current restrictions had not been put in place on Boxing Day. And she urged people not to raise their expectations about what will be announced when the lockdown review is completed in a fortnight as wholesale lifting of the restrictions was ""very unlikely"". She added: ""There may not even be any lifting of these restrictions as soon as the end of January - we will have to consider all of that carefully and set it out in due course."" All of mainland Scotland and some islands were placed into level four restrictions on 26 December, with schools remaining closed to most pupils until at least the end of the month. A further 1,875 positive cases of the virus were recorded on Monday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 153,423. The number of people in hospital with the virus stands at 1,717 - an increase of 53 since yesterday and higher than the peak of about 1,500 in the first wave in April. Of these, 133 patients are intensive care units, with Ms Sturgeon saying that the virus was putting ""very acute pressure"" on hospitals. The first minister also said that 175,942 people in Scotland had received their first vaccine dose by Monday. Opposition parties have claimed that the rollout of the vaccine has been ""sluggish"" in Scotland compared to south of the border - a charge that the government denies. And they have called for greater transparency over how many people are being given the jab every day. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said on Monday that the government was aiming to vaccinate about 560,000 people in Scotland by 31 January. Non-essential shops have been closed in Scotland since 26 December The Scottish government has previously said it is concerned that too many people have not been following the ""stay at home"" rules that are in place across the whole of the mainland and some islands. Ministers have been discussing the possibility of imposing tougher rules on click and collect shopping and takeaway food, with an announcement expected to be made on Wednesday. Retail industry representatives have described click and collect services as a ""lifeline"" for struggling businesses amid the forced closure of all non-essential shops. And they said they had not been shown any evidence that click and collect was driving transmission of the virus. Ms Sturgeon told her daily coronavirus briefing that the government may not stop click and collect services altogether. But she added: ""If we are saying to people right now that you should not be out of your home for shopping unless it is essential, then do we need to have click and collect for non-essential services instead of having that for delivery?"" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Scotland that he did not want to see further restrictions put in place unless there was evidence that they would have the desired effect. He also suggested that restricting click and collect would simply result in more people going back into supermarkets to do their shopping. The Scottish government is also under pressure to lift the the current ban on public Sunday worship, with a group of 500 church leaders from across the UK - including 200 in Scotland - insisting that there is ""no evidence of any tangible contribution to community transmission through churches in Scotland"". In a letter to the first minister, they claim that the ban may be unlawful and accuse the government of failing to understand that ""Christian worship is an essential public service, and especially vital to our nation in a time of crisis"". A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Test and Protect tells us where people were in their 48-hour infectious period. ""So we know that on one day last week the seven-day number for places of worship was 120, and data from yesterday shows the seven-day number for places of worship is 38, underlining the essential decision to require places of worship to close for public health reasons."" Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that everyone arriving in Scotland from overseas will need to show proof of a negative test from Friday. The test will need to be ""highly reliable"", the first minister said, and will need to have been from the previous three days - although young children may be exempt from the restriction. Those travelling from countries not on the quarantine exemption list will still need to self-isolate on arrival. The new rules, which will also come into force in England, werefirst outlined last week. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Can I hug my vaccinated dad? And other questions,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

Execution halted of only woman on US death row,"Lisa Montgomery was sentenced to death in 2007 A US judge has granted a stay of execution to Lisa Montgomery - just hours before the only woman on America's federal death row was due to be given a lethal injection. Judge James Hanlon said a competency hearing should be held first. Montgomery's lawyers had argued she was mentally incompetent to be executed, saying she was born brain-damaged. Lisa Montgomery strangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. Montgomery, now 52, would have been the first female federal inmate to be put to death in almost 70 years had her execution in Terre Haute, Indiana, gone ahead as scheduled on 12 January. Looking for answers in the life of a killer In Trumpâs final days, a rush of federal executions US resumption of federal executions criticised In Monday's ruling,Judge Hanlon of the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana wrote:,external""Ms Montgomery's motion to stay execution is granted to allow the court to conduct a hearing to determine Ms Montgomery's competence to be executed. ""Ms. Montgomery's current mental state is so divorced from reality that she cannot rationally understand the government's rationale for her execution. ""The court will set a time and date for the hearing in a separate order in due course,"" Judge Hanlon wrote. Montgomery's attorneys welcomed the ruling. ""The court was right to put a stop to Lisa Montgomery's execution,"" attorney Kelley Henry said in a statement. ""As the court found, Mrs Montgomery 'made a strong showing' of her current incompetence to be executed. ""Mrs Montgomery has brain damage and severe mental illness that was exacerbated by the lifetime of sexual torture she suffered at the hands of caretakers,"" the attorney added. Prosecutors have filed a notice to appeal the judge's ruling, CNN reports. It is the second time that Montgomery's execution has been postponed. Her execution date was originally set for last December - but a stay was put in place after her attorneys contracted Covid-19. The last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who died in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before President Donald Trump ordered them to resume earlier last year. There are suggestions that Montgomery now may even escape the death penalty entirely, as President-elect Joe Biden - who is due to take office on 20 January - has said he will seek to end federal executions.

'Tell us why park terror attacker was free',"This video can not be played Gary Furlong described his son as ""an amazing, kind boy"" The father of one of three men murdered in a park terror attack has called on the home secretary to ""tell us why"" the killer was deemed safe to be free. Gary Furlong, whose son James, 36, was killed in Reading's Forbury Gardens attack in June, said it was ""beyond"" him why Khairi Saadallah was considered ""not a danger to the public"". Saadallahwas jailed for the rest of his life over the murders. The Home Office has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment. At the time of the attackHome Secretary Priti Patel said: ""We must learn the lessons from what has happened... to prevent anything like this from happening again."" During his trial, London's Old Bailey heard Saadallah ""executed"" James Furlong, David Wails, 49, and Joe Ritchie-Bennett, 39, as an ""act of religious jihad"" on the afternoon of 20 June. He was jailed on Monday having previously admitted the three murders and the attempted murders of three other men. Khairi Saadallah admitted three counts of murder and three of attempted murder The Ministry of Justice said a Serious Further Offence (SFO) review had been completed into how Saadallah was managed by the National Probation Service. The victims' families would be offered a meeting to discuss the findings of the review, it added. It comes after the killer had been subject to licence conditions at the time of the attack. The court previously heard on the 18 June, two days before the attack, Saadallah's probation officer had emailed his mental health team as he had been talking about ""magic"". Saadallah also contacted the mental health crisis team himself, but he did not not open the door when they visited on 19 June. Park attack killer gets whole-life jail term Reading attack: 'We did all we could to save them' Reading stabbings: Who were the victims? The court heard Saadallah, who arrived in Britain from Libya in 2012, had previously been involved with militias who had been part of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, and was pictured handling weapons, including firearms. Since seeking asylum in Britain, hehad been repeatedly arrested and convicted of various offences, including theft and assault, between 2013 and 2020. Analysis of Saadallah's phone revealed an interest in extremist material and the court heard while at HMP Bullingdon in 2017, he was seen to associate with radical preacher Omar Brookes, who has connections with banned terrorist organisation Al-Muhajiroun. Speaking after the sentencing, Gary Furlong, from Liverpool, said Ms Patel needed to ""tell us why this guy wasn't put into some form of detention centre before they could deport him"". ""He was not safe to be released back on the streets,"" he added. Saadallah, 26, had been told just before his release from prison that the Home Office wanted to deport him, but it was not legally possible due to the situation in Libya. In law, what are known as the Hardial Singh principles place certain limits on the government's power to detain people ahead of deportation. The Prime Minister's spokesman said the government ""always tries to remove foreign national offenders where possible"". He was released from custody on 5 June, and proceeded to research the location for his attack online and carry out reconnaissance in the park. (L-R) David Wails, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and James Furlong were pronounced dead at the scene Following concerns from his brother, police visited the killer on 19 June, but he told officers he was ""alright"" while he stood near to a knife he bought from a supermarket. Saadallah's brother, Aiman,said he had asked for police to detain him under the Mental Health Act, and added ""lives would have been saved"" if more had been done. Thames Valley Police has been contacted for comment. Reading Refugee Support Group's (RRSG) also said it had raised concerns about his potential for radicalisation over three years and the possibility of a""London Bridge"" scenario. In a statement, it said Saadallah had a ""known, significant mental health problem"". ""This in no way excuses what he did. He murdered three innocent people. But there must be accountability on the part of services that should have supported him,"" it said. But passing sentence Mr Justice Sweeney said it was ""clear that the defendant did not, and does not, have any major mental illness"". Gary Furlong said: ""Given the volume of crimes he's committed and the information that they had on him, for an assessment to be done the night before to say that he's not a danger to the public - it is beyond me. ""How was he ever allowed to stay in this country? How was he allowed in, in the first place?"" History teacher James Furlong and pharmaceutical manager Mr Ritchie-Bennett each died from a single stab wound to the neck, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed once in the back. Despite treatment from paramedics and doctors, all three friends, who were members of the LGBT community, died at the scene. Gary Furlong described his son as ""an amazing, kind boy"" who was loved by family, friends and students.

Royal Mail names areas hit by Covid postal delays,"Royal Mail has published a list of areas where there have been delivery delays due to its workforce being affected by the Covid pandemic. The postal service said some areas will see a reduced service due to workers being off sick or self-isolating. Royal Mail listed 28 areas where post might be late, with 27 in England and one in Northern Ireland. Problems with deliveries over Christmas had prompted shoppers to complain about parcels not arriving on time. Royal Mail said: ""Despite our best efforts and significant investment in extra resource, some customers may experience slightly longer delivery timescales than our usual service standards. ""This is due to the exceptionally high volumes we are seeing, exacerbated by the coronavirus-related measures we have put in place in local mail centres and delivery offices to keep our people and customers safe."" Many of the affected areas are in or near London, while others include Chelmsford in Essex, Leeds in West Yorkshire, Margate in Kent, and Widnes in Cheshire. Labour MP Wes Streeting, whose Ilford constituency is one of the areas affected, tweeted on Sunday that he was concerned about vaccination invitations getting caught up in Royal Mail delays.

Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years',"Retailers suffered their worst annual sales performance on record in 2020, driven by slump in demand for fashion and homeware products, figures show. While food sales growth rose 5.4% on 2019, non-food fell about 5%, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. It meant an overall fall of 0.3% in a year dominated by the Covid-19 impact, the worst annual change since the BRC began collating the figures in 1995. Christmas offered little cheer, with much of the High Street still closed. ""Physical non-food stores, including all of non-essential retail, saw sales drop by a quarter compared with 2019,"" said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive. ""Christmas offered little respite for these retailers, as many shops were forced to shut during the peak trading period,"" she said. The 5.4% rise in food sales was fuelled by shoppers flocking to supermarkets and online grocers to ensure they were stocked up during the pandemic. UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better' 'Worst year for High Street job losses in 25 years' In December, total retail sales increased by 1.8% as shoppers spent more in the run-up to Christmas. Like-for-like sales for the month were up 4.8% as overall shop takings were still affected by restrictions and temporary closures. Online non-food sales jumped by 44.8% in December, according to the new figures, as a higher proportion of shopping took place online. The BRC's sales monitor is collated with the consultancy KPMG, whose UK head of retail, Paul Martin, said: ""In the most important month for the retail industry, there was some positive growth due to the ongoing shift of expenditure from other categories such as travel and leisure. ""Once again we saw big swings in the types of products being purchased and the channels used for shopping, with much of the growth taking place online, where nearly half of all non-food purchases were made."" But he warned that the new lockdown would worsen conditions for many non-essential shops and the High Street generally. Last week, a report from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, the CRR said.

Kuenssberg: What next for Covid rules?,"What is the next move? The disease is still spreading. There are more people in hospital with Covid-19 in the UK than at any other point in the pandemic. Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, hit the airwaves on Monday morning to tell us it's ""everyone's problem"". And a possible further increase in the numbers from those get-togethers that did take place over Christmas is yet to filter through. It is cheering, and crucial, to see the elderly and vulnerable attending vaccine super-centres in huge numbers for their injections. But there is no getting away from it: at this moment, the coronavirus situation seems pretty dire. And there is real concern in government that the public, this time round, is just not paying attention to the rules as closely as they did back in the spring. 'Most dangerous time' of the pandemic, says Whitty What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? What could be done to tighten lockdown rules? What is the government's answer? It is not, at least not yet, despite calls from the opposition, another big clampdown. It might not feel like it, but it is only seven days since Boris Johnson took what used to be the rare step of making a national address, live on primetime TV, telling us, across the UK, once more to ""stay at home"". There is hardly any political appetite to go even further. As one senior minister said today: ""We have gone as far as we possibly can in terms of shutting things down"". The prime minister was reluctant to go this far, only moving back to a lockdown in England when the evidence put forward by the government's top medics got worse, and worse and worse. There are in fact even more limits that ministers, not just in Westminster but in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast too, could introduce. Schools could be forcibly closed to all pupils. Nurseries could shut. Government sources say the nurseries policy isn't going to change. Number 10 firmly denies they would ever take such a drastic step on schools which have always been open to key workers' children and it is hard to imagine that ever happening. In extremis though there are measures that could be taken - in theory the government does not want to do any of this, but in practice there are other potential steps. Building sites could be made to lock their gates. Factories where machines are still whirring because they are operating under Covid guidelines could be made to pause. England, Scotland and Northern Ireland could follow Wales and ban people from seeing anyone they don't live with even outdoors. Playgrounds, launderettes and chiropractors, could, along with many others on the list of premises allowed to stay open, have to shut up shop after all. But while ministers have talked about squeezing the advice for takeaways to try to prevent big queues gathering at popular places, encouraged the supermarkets to make sure they are doing as much as they can to be safe, and even discussed the prospect of asking for masks to be worn outdoors, there is no expectation, at least at the start of this week, that a more extensive clampdown is coming from Westminster. Although, it's worth noting that the Scottish cabinet will discuss restrictions again on Tuesday. This video can not be played On Monday Matt Hancock ruled out getting rid of support bubbles. One reason for the reluctance to go much further is that every step that affects a business affects jobs and livelihoods too. The chancellor told MPs on Monday that 800,000 people have lost their jobs since February, admitting the economy willget worse before it gets better. So trying to preserve activity that can be done safely matters to the government too. There's also a question in government circles about whether cranking up different rules bit by bit is really what would help. Chris Whitty this morning bluntly suggested there was limited value in ""tinkering"" with the rules, and what is required instead is for all of us to realise how grave the situation really is. Instead of worrying about whether we are allowed to sit on a park bench at all, (and yes, this has been a lively conversation in Westminster today) , perhaps we should be asking ourselves whether we really need to be out at all. The NHS has been under huge pressure dealing with a surge in Covid cases this winter. But when what happens next will be in large part shaped by our behaviour as individuals, working out the dos and don'ts can get sticky fast. Two women who hit the headlines for driving five miles to go for a snowy walk with a takeaway cuppa had theirfines withdrawn today, just as the prime minister caused a stir when a newspaper revealed he'd gone seven miles to the other side of Londonfor a cycle in the Olympic Park. You might be a reader who feels, 'so what?'. In both cases they were exercising outside, within the law, so who cares? But you might feel when the firm instruction is to stay at home, and stay local, that is pushing the rules. (For what it's worth, the government's guidance is to ""stay local"" for exercise. There is no mileage limit, but the definition in the official advice says people should ""stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live"". And there aren't many inhabitants of SW1 who would see Stratford in East London as local to them, or East Enders who would see Downing Street as round the corner.) For now though, with grimmer and grimmer medics' warnings ringing in our ears, and reminders about enforcement from the police coming too, ministers seem resolved to encourage the public to comply rather than crack down further. But it is however, only a week since the lockdown the prime minister had so hoped to avoid returned. By now, it's not surprising, Boris Johnson would never quite rule anything out. P.S. In all the gloom, the cheerier news is that the vaccination programme across the UK is certainly getting going, with 2.3 million peoplehaving had their first jab. The number of people getting vaccinated has been added to the list of statistics that the governmentpublishes every day,external. The targets the government has set are tough, but the numbers so far, are growing fast. PM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home What could be done to tighten lockdown rules?

Eleven ambulances were sent to a care home in Cornwall at the weekend after a coronavirus outbreak, it has been confirmed. Coronavirus rapidly spread to 25 residents at Trengrouse care home in Helston and many staff were off sick or self-isolating despite best efforts to prevent the spread, bosses said. Three residents were taken to hospital. Others needed oxygen and are being looked after at the home. Bosses said staff and residents were being ""tested very regularly"" and ""we'll never know how it came into the home"". Read more here. With new lockdowns now in force in England, most of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we've been answering some of your questions. Cheryle Locke asked: ""My 89-year-old father had the vaccine a week ago. Is it safe to hug him now?"" If someone is vaccinated they should still follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. Thatâs because no vaccine is 100% effective and it is not yet clear if immunisation will stop people catching and spreading coronavirus, even though it protects against severe illness and death. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection. However, if you have alreadyformed a support bubblewith your father, you can have close physical contact with him. Read more answers to your questions - including about the rollout of vaccination, new international travel rules and school closures -here. Campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford helped secured changes last year We reported earlier on the outcry about the supply of food parcels to children on free school meals in England during lockdown after the contents of one company's hamper went viral on social media. A mother had posted a photo of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of food items, and questioned whether the contents were sufficient. It came to the attention of footballer Marcus Rashford, who secured changes to government policy on free school meals last year after launching a campaign on the issue. He sought a meeting with the supplier, Chartwells. The company has now apologised, but stressed the hamper was not for five days - not 10 - as had been suggested on social media. But it said: ""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.""

The NHS trust with the largest intensive care capacity in the UK has confirmed it now has almost 200 more Covid patients in its four hospitals than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. University Hospitals Birmingham said it has 873 patients with Covid-19 in its hospitals and 125 in intensive care. It comes after the Health Service Journal
published a leaked email to staff which suggested the trust risked being ""overwhelmed"". A hospital spokesperson said: ""We continue to expand our
intensive care and acute medical teams so they are able to treat the rising
number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery
including cancer operations. ""Every member of staff will be
supported by the Trust in delivering the best care wherever they are
working.""  Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The police are stepping up enforcement because they believe many people
breaking the Covid regulations are doing so because they are stubborn, not
because they donât understand what is allowed. The public, police, and legal experts do struggle to keep up with
the ever-changing rules. But the organisers of a party on a boat in Hertfordshire, the passengers
on a minibus heading for Wales, and the couple who travelled 120 miles to ""watch seals"" would have struggled to explain to the officers issuing them with
fines that they were confused. Those were clear breaches.  More complicated is the fine line
between the law - which police officers can enforce - and the government
guidance, which they canât. No law says exercise can only be conducted once a day, or for a specific
duration. These are pieces of firm guidance, along with the request to ""stay
local"", which resulted in criticism of the prime minister after his bike ride
in east London. It would be difficult to set a distance limit which would work for both
people living in rural areas and inner cities.  Impossible to prove that a
65-minute run was in breach of the law. Which is why the success of the measures will rely on personal
responsibility in the end. And why some experts are saying that different
messages such as ""act like youâve got it"" or ""thanks for doing the right thing"" might
cut through better than a list of regulations to be obeyed.   Ben WrightBBC political correspondent National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt says a limit on
how far people can travel for exercise in England would be difficult for police
to enforce. Earlier today the Metropolitan Police said exercise should begin and end at
someoneâs front door if possible. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wonât
speculate about tougher rules but says there are âendless discussionsâ within
government about tightening the measures. It wonât happen today but it clearly
could soon. In the meantime she hopes to clear up confusion and firm up
compliance but is insisting the current rules are clear. In a very stern voice. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Questions keep cropping up
about when key workers, such as supermarket staff and teachers, will be
vaccinated. There was one at todayâs
televised briefing. Some argue key workers should
be part of this first phase of the vaccination programme, which will see all over-50s, front-line health and care staff, and younger adults with health conditions
vaccinated by the end of April. But the assessment by the
governmentâs scientific advisers is pretty simple. They have targeted those who
are most at risk of dying if infected. Someone who is over the age
of 75 â the age group that is being prioritised immediately for vaccination by
mid-February - has a one in eight chance of dying if they catch Covid. By comparison, a person who
is 40 has a one in 1,000 chance. And that risk almost entirely
lies with those in that age group who have a health condition and therefore
would be part of this first phase anyway.  Reality Check At Home Secretary Priti Patelâs
news conference, Ian from Preston asked why the rules are more relaxed than
they were during the first lockdown last year if the new variant is more infectious. We know the government
recognises the situation is more serious because the UK is at threat level five - the highest level - which means there is a
danger of the NHS being overwhelmed within
21 days. In the first lockdown the UK was
only at threat level four. But the restrictions appear less
severe than they were in March. For example, support bubbles and childcare
bubbles exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds are open when they were
closed last time. And communal worship is still allowed as long as social distancing is observed. But one significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops and public transport. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened: Priti Patel mentioned the latest government statistics on coronavirus during the briefing this evening. A further 1,243 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to thelatest figures on the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external That brings the UK total to 81,960. The UK has also recorded a further 45,533 positive coronavirus test results. And 2,431,648 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But
what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started
falling. There have now been two consecutive days where newly
diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the
average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in
London, the South East and East of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. The North West is
causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having
any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the
tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look
like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising â patients being admitted at
the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago â but it does at
least offer a glimmer of hope. Alan Tolhurst from Politics Home asks whether the vaccination centres are Covid secure and have adequate ventilation. The home secretary cites the government's vaccination delivery plan and says the sites have spaced-out cubicles and other features to support social distancing and protect staff, following all of the guidance from Public Health England. Dr Diwakar says ""absolutely rigid"" infection controls are in place, including in the ExCel centre in London, which he visited recently. He says gels and masks are provided and the last thing staff want is to inadvertently pass on the virus to those being vaccinated, particularly the over-80s and other vulnerable people. ""We have spent months preparing to set these centres up and we are guided by really strict rules."" With that, Ms Patel brings the presser to an end.  The home secretary is asked how the public can understand what constitutes staying local,after two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk but had the penalties withdrawn. Priti Patel says the police ""exercise their professional judgement"" and points out that the fine in that case was rescinded. ""When we have people dying... we all have to exercise our judgement,"" she says. The new lockdown in England allows people to exercise with one other person from another household in an open public space, but says you should staytwo metres apartfrom each other. Ms Patel says: ""When it comes to exercising, again I do say stay local. Stay local is absolutely crucial. ""By all means take your daily exercise, but it's up to all of us in the right way to exercise that judgement as to how we do it - not socialising, making sure we're acting in the right way, staying away from other people."" She says that is ""clearly what the prime minister"" did when herode his bicycle seven miles from home. She adds: ""We all have to ask ourselves what can we do to keep everyone safe."" Martin Hewitt says ""this is unprecedented territory"" for police. ""Sometimes mistakes will be made but we always have looked at those, we've looked at those quickly... and we have said when we've got something wrong."" The home secretary says the government is ""absolutely working"" on getting frontline workers such as police, teachers and supermarket staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Diane from York, Priti Patel acknowledged they were ""at occupational risk of coming in in contact with the virus"". But she said the government was following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation who had ""thought carefully"" when it identified the top priority groups to receive the vaccine first. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, said he would ""obviously"" back the call for vaccinations for police as the ""nature of policing is that those officers are having daily to deal with people where they have no idea whether they are infected"".  Next up is the Telegraph's Gordon Rayner, who says countries such as France and Italy were able to cope with 40,000 patients going into hospital without asking everyone to stay at home. Could the NHS have been better prepared, he asks? Dr Diwakar said the NHS spent the summer learning the lessons of the first wave and preparing for the winter, investing in critical care. Hundreds of extra beds have been made available in London and patients have been moved elsewhere in the UK where extra capacity is available and that is how the NHS is coping. On a separate question, Ms Patel says there is a ""live"" debate within government on the current rules but says she will not speculate on whether they could be tightened up further. ""All rules are constantly under review within government but right now we are focusing very much on compliance enforcement"". Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel has reinforced the governmentâs
âstay at homeâ message. But to what extent is that being
followed and how has our behaviour changed compared with Englandâs first national
lockdown last March? Apple and Google record mobility
data which is pulled together by recording the location histories on people's
mobile devices and comparing it to a pre-coronavirus level. On Friday, the number of people
driving was down by 31% compared with the pre-Covid level. But it was down 63% on the first
Friday of the first lockdown in March 2020. Similar data shows that a higher
proportion of people were in workplaces, parks and grocery shops last Friday
compared with the first lockdown. But this could be in part down to
more places, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents, being open
this time. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. Sam Coates from Sky asks whether the government is concentrating too much on enforcing the rules in spaces like parks when they should be looking at workplaces and public transport. Ms Patel says ""when it comes to the rules... our target and our objective is to save lives, this isn't about picking out individual groups"". ""When it comes to the enforcement of those rules, it is right that we go after those breaches,"" she says, referring to things like parties. But she adds that ""this is a collective effort"" and that police are working with local authorities and other bodies to enforce the rules. She thanks supermarkets that have ""stepped up their efforts"" to make sure people are social distancing. On workplaces, Martin Hewitt says: ""That is ultimately the responsibility of any business or owner in that space."" He adds: ""Primarily our space is the public space."" ITV's Dan Hewitt asks whether the rules are tough enough to contain the virus and whether they need to be clarified, referring to the row over Boris Johnson's Olympic Park bike ride. Martin Hewitt answers first, saying there has been a lot of focus on the definition of local and he doesn't think it is sensible to mandate a certain distance people can travel as this would be challenging for the police to enforce. He says exemptions for exercise are fair and they are easily understood. People need to ask themselves whether their actions are essential and being done in the safest way possible. Ms Patel says exercise is important for people's health and wellbeing and says most people are adhering to the stay local guidance. ""The rules are tough enough,"" she adds. ""The message is clear. ""The more we follow the rules is the sooner we can drive this awful, atrocious virus down."" Mark Easton from the BBC asks Priti Patel why the rules of this lockdown aren't as tough as they were last spring. She says: ""The rules are actually very simple and clear - we are meant to stay at home and only leave home for a very very limited number of reasons."" She adds that ""everyone has to be conscientious in our actions"" and echoes Dr Diwakar's comment that people should act as if they have the virus. ""The rules are clear,"" she says. Martin Hewitt says: ""From our perspective we will carry on engaging [with] people... but I think the rules are clear."" He adds: ""You're right that the regulations have shifted over that period of time... but I think it's very clear what people need to do."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fines 'increasingly likely' for rule-breakersPeople are still holding house parties, raves and gambling gatherings, the UK's most senior police officer says.UK","Lockdown rule-breakers are more likely to be fined as Covid laws will be enforced ""more quickly"", the UK's most senior police officer has said. London's Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said her officers have had to break up parties, despite hospitals struggling to cope with rising patient numbers. A minister confirmed her pledge that fines were ""increasingly likely"". Kit Malthouse said people have a ""duty"" to make this lockdown ""the last one"". ""We are urging the small minority of people who aren't taking this seriously to do so now, and [are illustrating] to them that if they don't they are much more likely to get fined by the police,"" Mr Malthouse, the policing minister, told BBC Breakfast. ""These current measures should in theory, if we all stick by them, be enough to drive the numbers down so that we can start to move through the gears of tiers from mid-February,"" he added. Asked if tighter restrictions for England were on the way -something the health secretary has refused to rule out- Mr Malthouse said ministers were ""on tenterhooks"" watching the daily figures for Covid deaths, new cases and hospital admissions, as rules continue to be kept under review. How could lockdown rules be tougher? Could I be fined for breaking lockdown rules? Johnson's bike ride 'didn't break Covid rules' He said the government's ramped-up efforts to give vulnerable people the coronavirus vaccine should help the UK to ""get back to some sort of normality later this year"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssbergsaid there was currently no expectation that Westminster will impose more extensive restrictions. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she discussed possible tighter restrictions with members of her cabinet on Tuesday morning. Home Secretary Priti Patel and chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, will hold a coronavirus press conference at Downing Street later. The latest figures on Monday,externalshowed a further 529 people had died within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, while another 46,169 cases were reported. There are also more than 32,200 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, data shows. Dame Cressida told BBC Radio 4's Today programme some 75 police officers are joining185 firefighters,externalin being trained to drive ambulances in the capital, to help London Ambulance Service as the number of cases of the virus continues to rise. Andwriting in the Times,external, she said her officers had found people hosting raves, house parties and basement gambling events, despite clear laws that ban social gatherings. ""It is preposterous to me that anyone could be unaware of our duty to do all we can to stop the spread of the virus,"" she said, adding that people breaking Covid laws were ""increasingly likely to face fines"". Police chiefs in other parts of England have also warned""patience is running out"" with rule-breakers, with the public increasingly willing to report alleged rule breaches. Since March, some 32,000 penalties for breaching Covid laws have been issued in England and Wales - with a sharp rise in penalties during England's November lockdown. Almost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out in the weeks up to Christmas as police began moving more quickly from ""engage"", ""explain"" and ""encourage"" tothe fourth ""e""- ""enforcement"". Expect the rate of fines to continue upwards during January, given the scale of the emergency and the pressure from government on constabularies to enforce the law. But there is also a tension here. Police chiefs have told their officers they will often have to use their own judgement because the list of ""reasonable excuses"" in the law for why someone can be outside is not fixed in stone. There is a lot of wriggle room in the law to allow daily lives to continue. While ministers, scientists and health experts are all hammering home the message that people should stay at home as much as possible, the law is more liberal - for instance, there is no restriction on exercise in England. And that's why some police officers believe they are stuck between a rock and a hard place as people who don't want to be locked down find more and more creative ways to stretch the rules to breaking point. Fines start at Â£200 inEngland,externalandNorthern Ireland,external, and Â£60 inWales,externalandScotland,external. Large parties can be shut down by the police, with fines of up to Â£10,000. Dame Cressida told the Today programme the move towards greater enforcement was ""common sense"" rather than a show of ""dictatorial policing"". She also saidPrime Minister Boris Johnson's cycle in east Londonat the weekend was ""not against the law"", but added the ""stay local"" guidance on exercise for England could be made more clear. What are the lockdown rules across the UK? Track the number of cases in your area Tesco, Asda and Waitrose ban shoppers without masks Under Scotland's lockdown restrictions, people must start and finish their exercise in the same place - and to do so, they may travel up to five miles from the boundary of their local authority area. People in Wales should start and finish exercising from their home, while those in Northern Ireland are advised not to go more than 10 miles from home when exercising. Asked if she would like to see similar detail in England's guidance, Dame Cressida said: ""That is certainly something the government could consider. ""Anything that brings greater clarity, for officers and the public, in general, will be a good thing."" Dame Cressida also said she was delighted that a proposal to prioritise frontline officers for vaccines was being discussed Police chiefs have been under increasing pressure to enforce the lockdown laws - with a number of news reports about breaches of Covid rules in recent days. In one case, Derbyshire Police withdrew penalties for two women who had been fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk together - following widespread media attention. Watch: 'Police need to be firm to save lives' 'Blatant' Covid breaches in pubs and gyms Women's lockdown exercise fines dropped Home Secretary Priti Patel has defended the way police have handled breaches, saying there is a need for ""strong enforcement"". Four people were arrested in Edinburgh on Monday after anti-lockdown protesters clashed with police England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - which are in charge of making their own coronavirus restrictions. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters In her article, Dame Cressida said she was ""delighted to hear"" that a proposal to prioritise frontline officers to get vaccinated was being ""actively discussed"", as the rate of officers self-isolating has risen. So far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, as part of the government's plan to vaccinate tens of millions of people by the spring. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said members of the armed forces were working ""hand in hand with the NHS"" to help with the response to the UK's epidemic. Some 5,300 members of the armed forces are currently involved in the Covid response including personnel to help with vaccinations and community testing across the UK, he said.

"Williamson pledges 300,000 extra laptops for pupils","Mr Williamson says his department is doing all it can to support remote learning An extra 300,000 laptops and tablets have been bought to help disadvantaged children in England learn at home, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Mr Williamson said the devices would be delivered to schools. He also pledged to publish a remote education framework to support schools and colleges with delivering lessons during the latest national lockdown. It comes as research says children from poorer families are likely to struggle more with remote learning. The Department for Education said its data showed that over 700,000 devices had been delivered to schools in England so far during the pandemic - 100,000 of which were delivered last week. The department says the additional 300,000 laptops and tablets lifts government investment by another Â£100m, meaning over Â£400m will have been invested in supporting disadvantaged children who need help with access to technology during the pandemic. But the department has faced mounting criticism over huge percentages of pupils not having access to digital devices, nine months into the pandemic. Mr Williamson said the DfE was ""doing everything in our power to support schools with high-quality remote education"". He said: ""These additional devices, on top of the 100,000 delivered last week, add to the significant support we are making available to help schools deliver high-quality online learning, as we know they have been doing."" Fears pupils without laptops could overwhelm schools Laptop shortage 'may see hundreds' back in school On top of this, the remote education framework would support schools and colleges with delivering education for pupils who are learning from home, he said. The frameworks, which are voluntary and should be adapted for schools' individual circumstances, will ""help them to identify the strengths and areas for improvement in the lessons and teaching they provide remotely"". But Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said:  ""While we welcome the extra laptops and tablets announced, it is pretty poor that nearly a year after this crisis began we are only now inching up to the number of devices that are needed. ""The reality is that this extra provision is coming when we are already well into the new lockdown and after a heavily disrupted autumn term in which many children had to self-isolate in line with coronavirus protocols,"" he said. ""The government was slow off the mark to address the digital divide early in the crisis and is now trying to make up for lost time."" Mr Williamson's laptop announcement comes as research by the University of Sussex found that nearly one in five less advantaged parents said they struggled with home-learning during the first lockdown. The research surveyed 3,409 parents in the UK between 5 May until 31 July last year and found  families of lower socioeconomic status were more likely to report their home environment made it harder for pupils to complete schoolwork from home. The study says secondary school pupils eligible for free school meals (39%) were more likely to report that a lack of technology - such as laptops and computers - made learning from home more difficult, compared to 19% of pupils who are not eligible for free school meals. There are concerns poorer children will fall further behind Primary school pupils from struggling households were found to be more likely to find home learning learning harder than their more comfortable off peers due to the environment - such as noise levels (59% to 50%), lack of space (45% to 22%), lack of technology (45% to 26%) and lack of internet (35% to 16%). The researchers warned that educational inequalities were likely to increase due to further school closures this year. Lead researcher Dr Matthew Easterbrook said: ""These results show that school closures disproportionately disrupt the education of those who are most economically disadvantaged, suggesting that educational inequalities are likely to rise because of the pandemic. ""The results show that parents of pupils from disadvantaged families - those who are eligible for free school meals, who have lower levels of education, or who are financially struggling - are much more likely to report that learning from home is challenging."" Report co-author Lewis Doyle, doctoral researcher at the University of Sussex, added: ""School closures, while clearly necessary during this public health crisis, risk entrenching inequality."" On Tuesday the government also published figures on how many pupils were physically in schools across England before the Christmas holidays. The data shows 79% of pupils in state schools were in class on Wednesday16 December - down from 85% on Thursday 10 December. In secondary schools, attendance fell from 80% to 72% on 16 December, while  pupil attendance in primary schools fell from 89% to 86%, the figures show. Between 9% and 11% of pupils - up to 872,000 children - did not attend school for Covid-19 related reasons on  16  December.

Sonic boom heard as RAF escorts civilian aircraft,"RAF Typhoons, similar to the aircraft pictured, took off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and escorted the civilian aircraft to London Stansted Airport A sonic boom has been heard across the East of England after RAF Typhoon aircraft were launched to intercept a plane that had lost communications. The Typhoons took off from RAF Coningsby and ""safely escorted"" the civilian aircraft to Stansted Airport in Essex, an RAF spokesman said. The boom, at about 13:05 GMT, was reported by people across social media. ""The Typhoon aircraft were authorised to transit at supersonic speed for operational reasons,"" the RAF said. People in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire and parts of London heard the boom. This video can not be played People's reaction to the sonic boom was caught on camera ""We have received numerous calls from the public with reports of a sonic boom... between Huntingdon and Cambridge,"" Cambridgeshire police said,in a Facebook post,external. ""Nobody has been injured. Some callers reported the incident had shaken properties but no major damage is thought to have occurred."" An image from a police officer's body-worn camera captured the RAF Typhoon aircraft flying over Cambridgeshire Communications with the aircraft were re-established after the Typhoons were launched and it was intercepted before being escorted to Stansted. What is a sonic boom? Pilot grounded for causing sonic boom 'Sonic boom' caused by military jets A spokesman for the airport said the ""private jet"" was believed to have been flying from Germany to Birmingham. He confirmed the plane had been brought into land at about 13:40. When an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, the air in front of the nose of the plane builds up a pressure front because it has ""nowhere to escape"", saidDr Jim Wild of Lancaster University. A sonic boom happens when that air ""escapes"", creating a ripple effect which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap. The speed of sound varies. It is about 770mph (1,200km/h) at sea level, but slower at higher altitudes. A plane flying at 30,000ft would reach the speed of sound at about 675mph (1,085km/h), according toNASA's educational website,external. It can be heard over such a large area because it moves with the plane, rather like the wake of a boat spreading out behind the vessel. RAF jets are only given permission to go supersonic over populated areas in emergencies, usually when they are required to intercept another aircraft.

"Tesco, Asda and Waitrose ban shoppers without masksIt follows similar moves by Morrisons and Sainsbury's, but those with medical excuses will be exempt.Business","Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have become the latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. Retailers have been criticised for not doing enough to stop people breaking Covid rules as infections spread. But enforcement of face coverings is officially a police responsibility. However, supermarkets can deny entry to their premises which is private property, and can call the police if someone refuses to follow the rules or becomes abusive. Morrisons and Sainsbury's ban maskless shoppers Supermarkets: 'We're lucky if people wear masks' Senior police figures have reportedly said there is little officers can do to enforce the rules in shops because they are so busy. But policing minister Kit Malthouse said that they would offer ""backup if things go seriously wrong"". ""What we hope is that in the vast majority of cases the enforcement, or the reminders if you like, put in place by the store owners will be enough,"" he told BBC News. A Tesco spokeswoman said the supermarket chain had decided to strengthen its policies. ""To protect our customers and colleagues, we won't let anyone into our stores who is not wearing a face covering, unless they are exempt in line with government guidance,"" she said. ""We are also asking our customers to shop alone, unless they're a carer or with children. To support our colleagues, we will have additional security in stores to help manage this."" An Asda spokesman said if customers had forgotten their face coverings, it would continue to offer them one free of charge. But he added: ""Should a customer refuse to wear a covering without a valid medical reason and be in any way challenging to our colleagues about doing so, our security colleagues will refuse their entry."" This video can not be played How to wear your mask. Hint: it's not any of these three options Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations at Waitrose, said: ""We've listened carefully to the clear change in tone and emphasis of the views and information shared by the UK's governments in recent days. ""By insisting on the wearing of face coverings, over and above the social distancing measures we already have in place, we aim to make our shops even safer for customers."" On Tuesday, Sainsbury's told the BBC it did not have the power to deny entry to shoppers without masks. However, trials showed customers complied more when asked to wear masks by security guards at the door, it said. In an interview with the BBC, Sainsbury's boss, Simon Roberts, said ""we are not going to ban customers"". But he urged shoppers to wear a mask and shop alone. ""By doing that we will help keep everybody safe,"" he said. The Co-op also said it would not ban shoppers without masks from entering, and instead urged customers to take responsibility for wearing a face covering when visiting its stores, as it was mandatory by law. Boss of Co-op Food Jo Whitfield said: ""We've increased our in-store messaging to remind customers and government guidance does state that the police can take measures if members of the public don't comply with this law."" Iceland said it would take a similar approach, adding the vast majority of its customers continued to shop in compliance with the law. ""In view of the rising tide of abuse and violence being directed at our store colleagues, we do not expect them to confront the small minority of customers who aggressively refuse to comply with the law,"" a spokesman added. In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines.

"Johnson's bike ride 'didn't break Covid rules'Downing Street defends the PM, while the Met Police chief says he did not act ""against the law"".UK Politics","Boris Johnson - pictured here in 2013 - is a keen cyclist Downing Street has defended Boris Johnson for riding his bicycle seven miles from home, saying he complied with Covid rules during his trip. Labour accused the prime minister of having double standards, after it was reported he had been spotted in the saddle at east London's Olympic Park. Government guidance says daily outdoor exercise is allowed but people should not travel outside their local area. The PM's spokesman said any suggestion he had broken the rules was ""wrong"". But he did not confirm whether Mr Johnson had been driven to the Olympic Park from Downing Street or cycled there. Could police fine me for exercising? PM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home Women on exercise trip 'surrounded by police' What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the trip had not been ""against the law - that's for sure"". People should go for exercise ""from your front door and come back to your front door"", she said, adding: ""That's my view of local."" The prime minister's press secretary said the Commissioner's words were ""wise"". ""The instruction is to stay local and for her a reasonable interpretation was to exercise from their front door but for some people it's more complicated. Everyone needs to exercise their own judgement"", she added. The Evening Standard,externalreported that the prime minister had been seen in the Olympic Park, with his security detail, on Sunday. There's nothing in English lockdown law that says Boris Johnson shouldn't have pedalled around London's Olympic park on Sunday, seven miles from Downing Street. But this comes at a time when the government is desperately pleading with people to take Covid-19 seriously and follow the rules. In England that means leaving home only for essential work, shopping and exercise. The guidance also says ""stay local"" without defining how far people can roam. Travel for exercise is allowed ""a short distance within your area"" to access an open space. Number 10 will insist that's precisely what Mr Johnson did. But his ride highlights the problem everyone faces trying to interpret rules, and relying on people using common sense. The outing certainly doesn't help ministers straining to tell the public - in clear, consistent, easy-to-understand terms - to stay at home. Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, west London, criticised the prime minister for having a ""do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do"" attitude. Speaking to Today, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said: ""What we are asking people to do is when they exercise to stay local. ""Now local is, obviously, open to interpretation, but people broadly know what local means. ""If you can get there under your own steam and you are not interacting with somebody... then that seems perfectly reasonable to me."" The PM's official spokesman added: ""We have always trusted the public to exercise good judgement. We did throughout the first lockdown and continue to do so."" Dame Cressida Dick said Boris Johnson had not broken the law The issue of travelling for exercise was highlighted at the weekend after police in Derbyshire fined two women Â£200 after they drove five miles from home to take a walk - a penalty that was later dropped. Government advice for England says people can leave home to exercise, but adds: ""This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area."" The guidance adds: ""Stay local means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live."" The government also states:,external""The law is what you must do; the guidance might be a mixture of what you must do and what you should do."" In Scotland, the advice is that exercise can be taken if it ""starts and finishes at the same place, which can beup to five miles,externalfrom the boundary of your local authority area"". In Wales, exercise also has tostart from and finish at home.,externalThere no limits on distance travelled, although the advice is that ""the nearer you stay to your home, the better"". People in Northern Ireland are advisednot to go more than 10 miles,externalfrom home when exercising.

Executive meets amid mounting hospital pressures,"Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster appeared at their first joint press conference in weeks A fall in Northern Ireland's rate of Covid-19 infection has been achieved by many people ""doing the right thing"", Arlene Foster has said. But she said she was concerned by reports of some employers not adhering to the ""stay-at-home"" order for staff. Earlier, ministers also discussed a potential crackdown on larger retailers selling non-essential items. The first minister said that was a ""selfish spirit"" which would not help beat the virus. Stormont's first and deputy first ministers were appearing in Dungannon, County Tyrone, at their first joint press conference in more than a month. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered What is Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine plan? Their comments came as a further 1,205 cases of the virus were reported by Northern Ireland's Department of Health on Tuesday. Twenty-two more people have died with the virus, taking the department's total number of deaths to 1,498. There are 785 people in hospital with Covid-19, 55 are in intensive care. The reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. But it has now fallen ""significantly"", according to the Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young. The first and deputy first ministers will meet the PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne on Tuesday evening to discuss enforcement of the coronavirus laws. Michelle O'Neill, NI's Deputy First Minister, said there would also be an ""urgent roundtable"" with the retail sector to reinforce the need to ""comply with the spirit and letter"" of the restrictions. ""Adherence will get us through this difficult period,"" said Ms O'Neill. Northern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with many sectors forced to close. People havealso been told they should only leave homefor exercise, food and medical needs or if they cannot work from home. Mrs Foster said the evidence provided to ministers showed that the restrictions were working, and she paid tribute to the public for complying. ""It's people choosing to Facetime and phone friends rather than visiting, it's doing one big shop and not nipping out every day, doing the best job you can at home and not going into the work place when you don't have to,"" she added. Dr McBride said Northern Ireland had some distance to go before restrictions are lifted Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer warned that there are ""some hard yards to go"" and lockdown would not be ending soon. ""I'm not certain we will be emerging from lockdown in February. I think that would be optimistic in the extreme,"" said Dr Michael McBride. ""We have a long, long way to go with this virus. I don't think any of us can anticipate a return to normality come the 6th of February."" Mr McBride said restrictions would be in place for a considerable number of months, until a time when more of the population who are extremely clinically vulnerable are vaccinated. Earlier, Prof Young said Northern Ireland had passed the peak in terms of new cases of Covid-19 for this wave of the pandemic. But he warned: ""We still have a long way to go and the number of cases we are seeing each day is still averaging well over 1,000 cases a day - which by any measure in the course of the epidemic represents a very high level."" He said he expects the number of hospital inpatients to continue to rise ""until some time in last two weeks in January"". Prof Young said he believed that the current restrictions are ""sufficient"" for the moment, if people stick to them. Health bosses say hospitals are facing major pressure due to the high number of Covid-19 cases Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said it was estimated that on average about one in 60 people have Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. He said the rising number of cases was a ""payback"" for the relaxation of restrictions in December. New lockdown restrictions came into force in Northern Ireland on Friday 8 January,meaning people can only leave their home for essential reasons. Prof Young said while compliance with the stay-at-home order was better than it was at the start of December, it was still not as good as it was in the first lockdown in March. Police have set up checkpoints with officers questioning people about whether their travel is essential Amid the pressure on the health service, health trusts have said more cancer operations could be cancelled. The Belfast Health Trust has already cancelled urgent cancer surgeries. Father James O'Reilly, a chaplain at Antrim Area Hospital, said he has been called to the hospital almost every day in the past year to give Covid-19 patients their last rites and to provide comfort to families and staff. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme he said: ""You can see the toll it's taking on the nurses and doctors now. Tens of thousands of Covid-19 vaccines have been given to people in Northern Ireland ""They are giving everything and quite honestly they don't have much more to give it seems. ""That's a scary thought because they're our last line of defence against this disease."" As of Monday evening, almost 92,000 people in Northern Irelandhad received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Dr Frances O'Hagan, whose clinic in Armagh city began vaccinating people aged over 80 last week, expects to have administered the jab to more than 300 patients by the end of the week.

Covid capacity could be hit by NHS staff shortages,"The NHS Louisa Jordan was built in two weeks in April response to concerns over hospital capacity A shortage of NHS staff could prevent the opening of the NHS Louisa Jordan to Covid patients if capacity is exceeded elsewhere, a leading doctor has said. President of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, Prof Mike Griffin, said the increasing numbers off work was a ""major problem"". The Scottish government says the NHS is not being ""overwhelmed"" andstaffing plans are in place to deal with demand. The NHS Louisa Jordan is currently being used for outpatient services. The temporary hospital at the SEC in Glasgowwas set up in April in response to concerns over hospital capacity. It was not used for Covid care during the first surge of the pandemic and has since been made available for outpatient services, such as orthopaedics, plastic surgery and dermatology. It is also being used for Covid vaccinations. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Prof Mike Griffin toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethat the pressure on the NHS workforce was particularly acute in the west of Scotland, where the number of cases was high. ""Particularly in Glasgow and Lanarkshire, there's been significant increases recently because of the new variant. Without any doubt, that new variant is increasing transmissibility, and therefore increasing infection rates and increasing hospital admissions,"" he said. ""But it's not just the admissions that's the problem. Our doctors, surgeons, nurses and everyone are really working extremely hard - but there is an increase in absenteeism because of illness and because of self-isolation amongst nursing staff."" Two of Scotland's health boards - NHS Ayrshire and Arran and NHS Lanarkshire - are currently over their capacity for Covid patients. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has reached 85% capacity and NHS Tayside is at 81% capacity,according to the latest Scottish government figures,external. The NHS Louisa Jordan has capacity for 1,000 Covid patients if it is needed, but Prof Griffin said that using it as a Covid facility could be dependent on retired or former staff returning to work for NHS Scotland. ""Opening the Louisa Jordan as a Covid institution without staff is impossible,"" he said. ""It is equipped to be able to do it. And if the staffing is there, if we get returners and so on, then perhaps that might happen."" The number of Covid patients in hospital across Scotland is now higher than it was in April, although the numbers in intensive care are lower. Numbers initially appeared to be declining in November, but never reached low levels and began to climb sharply again at the end of the year. Prof Griffin added that it was likely that better treatments for Covid patients were also reducing mortality and so keeping those patients in hospital for longer. NHS Scotland has an overall capacity for 13,000 beds,with 2,400 assigned to Covid patients,external. This is down from a capacity of about 3,600 in the autumn because of additional seasonal pressures on the NHS, including weather-related issues and increased staff absence. Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, accepted that having around 1,500 patients in hospital with Covid had forced the cancellation of procedures such as cataract operations and hip replacements. But he said that ability to ""flex"" within the system meant that the NHS remained within capacity. Prof Leitch also pointed to the situation in England where there have been reports of limits being put on the amount of oxygen that patients can receive and some intensive care patients having to be treated in non-ICU beds. Speaking at the first minister's coronavirus briefing, he said: ""People shouldn't be scared that the health service is full or overwhelmed - it isn't. ""It is fragile, and you just have to look a few hundred miles south to see what happens when it is even more fragile. ""So we need to avoid that as much as we can in Scotland.""

"2020 saw most excess deaths since World War TwoLast year saw 697,000 deaths registered in the UK - 15% above what would be expected.HealthComments","The Covid pandemic has caused excess deaths to rise to their highest level in the UK since World War Two. There were close to 697,000 deaths in 2020 - nearly 85,000 more than would be expected based on the average in the previous five years. This represents an increase of 14% - making it the largest rise in excess deaths for more than 75 years. When the age and size of the population is taken into account, 2020 saw the worst death rates since the 2000s. This measure - known as age-standardised mortality - takes into account population growth and age. The data is only available until November - so the impact of deaths in December have not yet been taken into account - but it shows the death rate at that stage was at its highest in England since 2008. The data on deaths can be confusing. On one hand, excess deaths are at their highest since World War Two, while on the other, death rates, once age and size of population are taken into account, are at their worst level for a little over a decade 'only'. How should that be interpreted? Excess deaths are basically a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years. Clearly, 2020 saw a huge and unexpected rise in deaths because of the pandemic, just as World War Two led to a sudden jump. But in determining how much those jumps affected the chances of dying, a measure known as age-standardised mortality, which takes into account the age and size of the population, is important. It shows the pandemic has undone the progress made in the last decade or so. That is significant - especially given this has happened despite lockdowns and social-distancing measures to stop the spread of the virus. But it also helps put the death toll over the past 12 months in a wider context. King's Fund chief executive Richard Murray said the picture was likely to worsen, given Covid deaths were rising following the surge in infections over recent weeks. ""The UK has one of the highest rates of excess deaths in the world, with more excess deaths per million people than most other European countries or the US,"" he said. 'It will take a public inquiry to determine exactly what went wrong, but mistakes have been made. ""In a pandemic, mistakes cost lives. Decisions to enter lockdown have consistently come late, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes or the experiences of other countries. ""The promised 'protective ring' around social care in the first wave was slow to materialise and often inadequate, a contributing factor to the excess deaths among care home residents last year. 'Like many countries, the UK was poorly prepared for this type of pandemic."" Matthew Reed, of the end-of-life care charity Marie Curie said the focus on Covid should not hide the fact there has been a ""silent crisis"" of deaths at home. He said people have died prematurely in 2020 from other causes - with a big jump in deaths at home. ""We are concerned many have not had the care they needed,"" he added.

With new lockdowns now in force in England, most of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we've been answering some of your questions. Cheryle Locke asked: ""My 89-year-old father had the vaccine a week ago. Is it safe to hug him now?"" If someone is vaccinated they should still follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. Thatâs because no vaccine is 100% effective and it is not yet clear if immunisation will stop people catching and spreading coronavirus, even though it protects against severe illness and death. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection. However, if you have alreadyformed a support bubblewith your father, you can have close physical contact with him.

Campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford helped secured changes last year We reported earlier on the outcry about the supply of food parcels to children on free school meals in England during lockdown after the contents of one company's hamper went viral on social media. A mother had posted a photo of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of food items, and questioned whether the contents were sufficient. It came to the attention of footballer Marcus Rashford, who secured changes to government policy on free school meals last year after launching a campaign on the issue. He sought a meeting with the supplier, Chartwells. The company has now apologised, but stressed the hamper was not for five days - not 10 - as had been suggested on social media. But it said: ""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.""

The NHS trust with the largest intensive care capacity in the UK has confirmed it now has almost 200 more Covid patients in its four hospitals than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. University Hospitals Birmingham said it has 873 patients with Covid-19 in its hospitals and 125 in intensive care. It comes after the Health Service Journal
published a leaked email to staff which suggested the trust risked being ""overwhelmed"". A hospital spokesperson said: ""We continue to expand our
intensive care and acute medical teams so they are able to treat the rising
number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery
including cancer operations. ""Every member of staff will be
supported by the Trust in delivering the best care wherever they are
working.""  Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The police are stepping up enforcement because they believe many people
breaking the Covid regulations are doing so because they are stubborn, not
because they donât understand what is allowed. The public, police, and legal experts do struggle to keep up with
the ever-changing rules. But the organisers of a party on a boat in Hertfordshire, the passengers
on a minibus heading for Wales, and the couple who travelled 120 miles to ""watch seals"" would have struggled to explain to the officers issuing them with
fines that they were confused. Those were clear breaches.  More complicated is the fine line
between the law - which police officers can enforce - and the government
guidance, which they canât. No law says exercise can only be conducted once a day, or for a specific
duration. These are pieces of firm guidance, along with the request to ""stay
local"", which resulted in criticism of the prime minister after his bike ride
in east London. It would be difficult to set a distance limit which would work for both
people living in rural areas and inner cities.  Impossible to prove that a
65-minute run was in breach of the law. Which is why the success of the measures will rely on personal
responsibility in the end. And why some experts are saying that different
messages such as ""act like youâve got it"" or ""thanks for doing the right thing"" might
cut through better than a list of regulations to be obeyed.   Ben WrightBBC political correspondent National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt says a limit on
how far people can travel for exercise in England would be difficult for police
to enforce. Earlier today the Metropolitan Police said exercise should begin and end at
someoneâs front door if possible. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wonât
speculate about tougher rules but says there are âendless discussionsâ within
government about tightening the measures. It wonât happen today but it clearly
could soon. In the meantime she hopes to clear up confusion and firm up
compliance but is insisting the current rules are clear. In a very stern voice. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Questions keep cropping up
about when key workers, such as supermarket staff and teachers, will be
vaccinated. There was one at todayâs
televised briefing. Some argue key workers should
be part of this first phase of the vaccination programme, which will see all over-50s, front-line health and care staff, and younger adults with health conditions
vaccinated by the end of April. But the assessment by the
governmentâs scientific advisers is pretty simple. They have targeted those who
are most at risk of dying if infected. Someone who is over the age
of 75 â the age group that is being prioritised immediately for vaccination by
mid-February - has a one in eight chance of dying if they catch Covid. By comparison, a person who
is 40 has a one in 1,000 chance. And that risk almost entirely
lies with those in that age group who have a health condition and therefore
would be part of this first phase anyway.  Reality Check At Home Secretary Priti Patelâs
news conference, Ian from Preston asked why the rules are more relaxed than
they were during the first lockdown last year if the new variant is more infectious. We know the government
recognises the situation is more serious because the UK is at threat level five - the highest level - which means there is a
danger of the NHS being overwhelmed within
21 days. In the first lockdown the UK was
only at threat level four. But the restrictions appear less
severe than they were in March. For example, support bubbles and childcare
bubbles exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds are open when they were
closed last time. And communal worship is still allowed as long as social distancing is observed. But one significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops and public transport. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened: Priti Patel mentioned the latest government statistics on coronavirus during the briefing this evening. A further 1,243 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to thelatest figures on the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external That brings the UK total to 81,960. The UK has also recorded a further 45,533 positive coronavirus test results. And 2,431,648 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But
what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started
falling. There have now been two consecutive days where newly
diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the
average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in
London, the South East and East of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. The North West is
causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having
any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the
tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look
like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising â patients being admitted at
the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago â but it does at
least offer a glimmer of hope. Alan Tolhurst from Politics Home asks whether the vaccination centres are Covid secure and have adequate ventilation. The home secretary cites the government's vaccination delivery plan and says the sites have spaced-out cubicles and other features to support social distancing and protect staff, following all of the guidance from Public Health England. Dr Diwakar says ""absolutely rigid"" infection controls are in place, including in the ExCel centre in London, which he visited recently. He says gels and masks are provided and the last thing staff want is to inadvertently pass on the virus to those being vaccinated, particularly the over-80s and other vulnerable people. ""We have spent months preparing to set these centres up and we are guided by really strict rules."" With that, Ms Patel brings the presser to an end.  The home secretary is asked how the public can understand what constitutes staying local,after two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk but had the penalties withdrawn. Priti Patel says the police ""exercise their professional judgement"" and points out that the fine in that case was rescinded. ""When we have people dying... we all have to exercise our judgement,"" she says. The new lockdown in England allows people to exercise with one other person from another household in an open public space, but says you should staytwo metres apartfrom each other. Ms Patel says: ""When it comes to exercising, again I do say stay local. Stay local is absolutely crucial. ""By all means take your daily exercise, but it's up to all of us in the right way to exercise that judgement as to how we do it - not socialising, making sure we're acting in the right way, staying away from other people."" She says that is ""clearly what the prime minister"" did when herode his bicycle seven miles from home. She adds: ""We all have to ask ourselves what can we do to keep everyone safe."" Martin Hewitt says ""this is unprecedented territory"" for police. ""Sometimes mistakes will be made but we always have looked at those, we've looked at those quickly... and we have said when we've got something wrong."" The home secretary says the government is ""absolutely working"" on getting frontline workers such as police, teachers and supermarket staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Diane from York, Priti Patel acknowledged they were ""at occupational risk of coming in in contact with the virus"". But she said the government was following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation who had ""thought carefully"" when it identified the top priority groups to receive the vaccine first. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, said he would ""obviously"" back the call for vaccinations for police as the ""nature of policing is that those officers are having daily to deal with people where they have no idea whether they are infected"".  Next up is the Telegraph's Gordon Rayner, who says countries such as France and Italy were able to cope with 40,000 patients going into hospital without asking everyone to stay at home. Could the NHS have been better prepared, he asks? Dr Diwakar said the NHS spent the summer learning the lessons of the first wave and preparing for the winter, investing in critical care. Hundreds of extra beds have been made available in London and patients have been moved elsewhere in the UK where extra capacity is available and that is how the NHS is coping. On a separate question, Ms Patel says there is a ""live"" debate within government on the current rules but says she will not speculate on whether they could be tightened up further. ""All rules are constantly under review within government but right now we are focusing very much on compliance enforcement"". Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel has reinforced the governmentâs
âstay at homeâ message. But to what extent is that being
followed and how has our behaviour changed compared with Englandâs first national
lockdown last March? Apple and Google record mobility
data which is pulled together by recording the location histories on people's
mobile devices and comparing it to a pre-coronavirus level. On Friday, the number of people
driving was down by 31% compared with the pre-Covid level. But it was down 63% on the first
Friday of the first lockdown in March 2020. Similar data shows that a higher
proportion of people were in workplaces, parks and grocery shops last Friday
compared with the first lockdown. But this could be in part down to
more places, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents, being open
this time. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. Sam Coates from Sky asks whether the government is concentrating too much on enforcing the rules in spaces like parks when they should be looking at workplaces and public transport. Ms Patel says ""when it comes to the rules... our target and our objective is to save lives, this isn't about picking out individual groups"". ""When it comes to the enforcement of those rules, it is right that we go after those breaches,"" she says, referring to things like parties. But she adds that ""this is a collective effort"" and that police are working with local authorities and other bodies to enforce the rules. She thanks supermarkets that have ""stepped up their efforts"" to make sure people are social distancing. On workplaces, Martin Hewitt says: ""That is ultimately the responsibility of any business or owner in that space."" He adds: ""Primarily our space is the public space."" ITV's Dan Hewitt asks whether the rules are tough enough to contain the virus and whether they need to be clarified, referring to the row over Boris Johnson's Olympic Park bike ride. Martin Hewitt answers first, saying there has been a lot of focus on the definition of local and he doesn't think it is sensible to mandate a certain distance people can travel as this would be challenging for the police to enforce. He says exemptions for exercise are fair and they are easily understood. People need to ask themselves whether their actions are essential and being done in the safest way possible. Ms Patel says exercise is important for people's health and wellbeing and says most people are adhering to the stay local guidance. ""The rules are tough enough,"" she adds. ""The message is clear. ""The more we follow the rules is the sooner we can drive this awful, atrocious virus down."" Mark Easton from the BBC asks Priti Patel why the rules of this lockdown aren't as tough as they were last spring. She says: ""The rules are actually very simple and clear - we are meant to stay at home and only leave home for a very very limited number of reasons."" She adds that ""everyone has to be conscientious in our actions"" and echoes Dr Diwakar's comment that people should act as if they have the virus. ""The rules are clear,"" she says. Martin Hewitt says: ""From our perspective we will carry on engaging [with] people... but I think the rules are clear."" He adds: ""You're right that the regulations have shifted over that period of time... but I think it's very clear what people need to do."" Â© 2025 BBC.

the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago â but it does at
least offer a glimmer of hope. Alan Tolhurst from Politics Home asks whether the vaccination centres are Covid secure and have adequate ventilation. The home secretary cites the government's vaccination delivery plan and says the sites have spaced-out cubicles and other features to support social distancing and protect staff, following all of the guidance from Public Health England. Dr Diwakar says ""absolutely rigid"" infection controls are in place, including in the ExCel centre in London, which he visited recently. He says gels and masks are provided and the last thing staff want is to inadvertently pass on the virus to those being vaccinated, particularly the over-80s and other vulnerable people. ""We have spent months preparing to set these centres up and we are guided by really strict rules."" With that, Ms Patel brings the presser to an end.  The home secretary is asked how the public can understand what constitutes staying local,after two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk but had the penalties withdrawn. Priti Patel says the police ""exercise their professional judgement"" and points out that the fine in that case was rescinded. ""When we have people dying... we all have to exercise our judgement,"" she says. The new lockdown in England allows people to exercise with one other person from another household in an open public space, but says you should staytwo metres apartfrom each other. Ms Patel says: ""When it comes to exercising, again I do say stay local. Stay local is absolutely crucial. ""By all means take your daily exercise, but it's up to all of us in the right way to exercise that judgement as to how we do it - not socialising, making sure we're acting in the right way, staying away from other people."" She says that is ""clearly what the prime minister"" did when herode his bicycle seven miles from home. She adds: ""We all have to ask ourselves what can we do to keep everyone safe."" Martin Hewitt says ""this is unprecedented territory"" for police. ""Sometimes mistakes will be made but we always have looked at those, we've looked at those quickly... and we have said when we've got something wrong."" The home secretary says the government is ""absolutely working"" on getting frontline workers such as police, teachers and supermarket staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Diane from York, Priti Patel acknowledged they were ""at occupational risk of coming in in contact with the virus"". But she said the government was following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation who had ""thought carefully"" when it identified the top priority groups to receive the vaccine first. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, said he would ""obviously"" back the call for vaccinations for police as the ""nature of policing is that those officers are having daily to deal with people where they have no idea whether they are infected"".  Next up is the Telegraph's Gordon Rayner, who says countries such as France and Italy were able to cope with 40,000 patients going into hospital without asking everyone to stay at home. Could the NHS have been better prepared, he asks? Dr Diwakar said the NHS spent the summer learning the lessons of the first wave and preparing for the winter, investing in critical care. Hundreds of extra beds have been made available in London and patients have been moved elsewhere in the UK where extra capacity is available and that is how the NHS is coping. On a separate question, Ms Patel says there is a ""live"" debate within government on the current rules but says she will not speculate on whether they could be tightened up further. ""All rules are constantly under review within government but right now we are focusing very much on compliance enforcement"". Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel has reinforced the governmentâs
âstay at homeâ message. But to what extent is that being
followed and how has our behaviour changed compared with Englandâs first national
lockdown last March? Apple and Google record mobility
data which is pulled together by recording the location histories on people's
mobile devices and comparing it to a pre-coronavirus level. On Friday, the number of people
driving was down by 31% compared with the pre-Covid level. But it was down 63% on the first
Friday of the first lockdown in March 2020. Similar data shows that a higher
proportion of people were in workplaces, parks and grocery shops last Friday
compared with the first lockdown. But this could be in part down to
more places, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents, being open
this time. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. Sam Coates from Sky asks whether the government is concentrating too much on enforcing the rules in spaces like parks when they should be looking at workplaces and public transport. Ms Patel says ""when it comes to the rules... our target and our objective is to save lives, this isn't about picking out individual groups"". ""When it comes to the enforcement of those rules, it is right that we go after those breaches,"" she says, referring to things like parties. But she adds that ""this is a collective effort"" and that police are working with local authorities and other bodies to enforce the rules. She thanks supermarkets that have ""stepped up their efforts"" to make sure people are social distancing. On workplaces, Martin Hewitt says: ""That is ultimately the responsibility of any business or owner in that space."" He adds: ""Primarily our space is the public space."" ITV's Dan Hewitt asks whether the rules are tough enough to contain the virus and whether they need to be clarified, referring to the row over Boris Johnson's Olympic Park bike ride. Martin Hewitt answers first, saying there has been a lot of focus on the definition of local and he doesn't think it is sensible to mandate a certain distance people can travel as this would be challenging for the police to enforce. He says exemptions for exercise are fair and they are easily understood. People need to ask themselves whether their actions are essential and being done in the safest way possible. Ms Patel says exercise is important for people's health and wellbeing and says most people are adhering to the stay local guidance. ""The rules are tough enough,"" she adds. ""The message is clear. ""The more we follow the rules is the sooner we can drive this awful, atrocious virus down."" Mark Easton from the BBC asks Priti Patel why the rules of this lockdown aren't as tough as they were last spring. She says: ""The rules are actually very simple and clear - we are meant to stay at home and only leave home for a very very limited number of reasons."" She adds that ""everyone has to be conscientious in our actions"" and echoes Dr Diwakar's comment that people should act as if they have the virus. ""The rules are clear,"" she says. Martin Hewitt says: ""From our perspective we will carry on engaging [with] people... but I think the rules are clear."" He adds: ""You're right that the regulations have shifted over that period of time... but I think it's very clear what people need to do."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Execution halted of only woman on US death rowThe judge orders a mental competency hearing to be held - just hours before the scheduled execution.US & Canada,"Lisa Montgomery was sentenced to death in 2007 A US judge has granted a stay of execution to Lisa Montgomery - just hours before the only woman on America's federal death row was due to be given a lethal injection. Judge James Hanlon said a competency hearing should be held first. Montgomery's lawyers had argued she was mentally incompetent to be executed, saying she was born brain-damaged. Lisa Montgomery strangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. Montgomery, now 52, would have been the first female federal inmate to be put to death in almost 70 years had her execution in Terre Haute, Indiana, gone ahead as scheduled on 12 January. Looking for answers in the life of a killer In Trumpâs final days, a rush of federal executions US resumption of federal executions criticised In Monday's ruling,Judge Hanlon of the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana wrote:,external""Ms Montgomery's motion to stay execution is granted to allow the court to conduct a hearing to determine Ms Montgomery's competence to be executed. ""Ms. Montgomery's current mental state is so divorced from reality that she cannot rationally understand the government's rationale for her execution. ""The court will set a time and date for the hearing in a separate order in due course,"" Judge Hanlon wrote. Montgomery's attorneys welcomed the ruling. ""The court was right to put a stop to Lisa Montgomery's execution,"" attorney Kelley Henry said in a statement. ""As the court found, Mrs Montgomery 'made a strong showing' of her current incompetence to be executed. ""Mrs Montgomery has brain damage and severe mental illness that was exacerbated by the lifetime of sexual torture she suffered at the hands of caretakers,"" the attorney added. Prosecutors have filed a notice to appeal the judge's ruling, CNN reports. It is the second time that Montgomery's execution has been postponed. Her execution date was originally set for last December - but a stay was put in place after her attorneys contracted Covid-19. The last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who died in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before President Donald Trump ordered them to resume earlier last year. There are suggestions that Montgomery now may even escape the death penalty entirely, as President-elect Joe Biden - who is due to take office on 20 January - has said he will seek to end federal executions.

Johnson's bike ride 'didn't break Covid rules',"Boris Johnson - pictured here in 2013 - is a keen cyclist Downing Street has defended Boris Johnson for riding his bicycle seven miles from home, saying he complied with Covid rules during his trip. Labour accused the prime minister of having double standards, after it was reported he had been spotted in the saddle at east London's Olympic Park. Government guidance says daily outdoor exercise is allowed but people should not travel outside their local area. The PM's spokesman said any suggestion he had broken the rules was ""wrong"". But he did not confirm whether Mr Johnson had been driven to the Olympic Park from Downing Street or cycled there. Could police fine me for exercising? PM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home Women on exercise trip 'surrounded by police' What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the trip had not been ""against the law - that's for sure"". People should go for exercise ""from your front door and come back to your front door"", she said, adding: ""That's my view of local."" The prime minister's press secretary said the Commissioner's words were ""wise"". ""The instruction is to stay local and for her a reasonable interpretation was to exercise from their front door but for some people it's more complicated. Everyone needs to exercise their own judgement"", she added. The Evening Standard,externalreported that the prime minister had been seen in the Olympic Park, with his security detail, on Sunday. There's nothing in English lockdown law that says Boris Johnson shouldn't have pedalled around London's Olympic park on Sunday, seven miles from Downing Street. But this comes at a time when the government is desperately pleading with people to take Covid-19 seriously and follow the rules. In England that means leaving home only for essential work, shopping and exercise. The guidance also says ""stay local"" without defining how far people can roam. Travel for exercise is allowed ""a short distance within your area"" to access an open space. Number 10 will insist that's precisely what Mr Johnson did. But his ride highlights the problem everyone faces trying to interpret rules, and relying on people using common sense. The outing certainly doesn't help ministers straining to tell the public - in clear, consistent, easy-to-understand terms - to stay at home. Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, west London, criticised the prime minister for having a ""do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do"" attitude. Speaking to Today, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said: ""What we are asking people to do is when they exercise to stay local. ""Now local is, obviously, open to interpretation, but people broadly know what local means. ""If you can get there under your own steam and you are not interacting with somebody... then that seems perfectly reasonable to me."" The PM's official spokesman added: ""We have always trusted the public to exercise good judgement. We did throughout the first lockdown and continue to do so."" Dame Cressida Dick said Boris Johnson had not broken the law The issue of travelling for exercise was highlighted at the weekend after police in Derbyshire fined two women Â£200 after they drove five miles from home to take a walk - a penalty that was later dropped. Government advice for England says people can leave home to exercise, but adds: ""This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area."" The guidance adds: ""Stay local means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live."" The government also states:,external""The law is what you must do; the guidance might be a mixture of what you must do and what you should do."" In Scotland, the advice is that exercise can be taken if it ""starts and finishes at the same place, which can beup to five miles,externalfrom the boundary of your local authority area"". In Wales, exercise also has tostart from and finish at home.,externalThere no limits on distance travelled, although the advice is that ""the nearer you stay to your home, the better"". People in Northern Ireland are advisednot to go more than 10 miles,externalfrom home when exercising.

"Edinburgh Woollen Mill rescue to save 2,500 jobsInvestors are close to agreeing a deal to save the chain, along with Ponden Home and BonmarchÃ©.Business","A deal has been agreed for the sale of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home and BonmarchÃ© chains, which were on the brink of closure. The businesses went into administration last year after a collapse in sales due to the pandemic. Almost 2,000 staff will be kept on but as many as 260 stores could close. The buyers are a consortium of international investors who will inject fresh funds into the business, led by the existing management team. Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which sells mid-price knitwear and other clothing to older shoppers, is part of a stable of retail brands owned by billionaire businessman, Philip Day. Retail sales in 2020 worst on record, report says It is understood that Mr Day will effectively lend the group the money to buy the businesses which will be paid back over a number of years. The deal also covers two other brands in the group, value retailer BonmarchÃ©, and Ponden Home, an interiors chain based in the south east of England. The new owners plan to operate 246 stores across both the Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home brands, retaining 1,453 staff in those stores, the head office and distribution centres in Carlisle. However, 85 Edinburgh Woollen Mill stores and 34 Ponden Home stores have been closed permanently, with the loss of  485 jobs. Wakefield-based BonmarchÃ© will retain 72 of its stores and 531 staff including head office and distribution centre staff. The majority of its stores, 148 outlets, remain under review with staff on furlough. Administrators representing Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home said the deal represented the best chance to save stores and jobs, given the difficult outlook for UK retail. ""We regret that not all of Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home could be rescued,"" said Tony Wright, partner at FRP. ""This has resulted in a significant number of redundancies at a particularly challenging time of year and period of economic uncertainty."" Retail has been particularly hard hit by measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. Even when shops have been open many shoppers stayed away, wary of the health risks. The British Retail Consortium said consumers bought 5% less last year than the year before (not including food). Much of that custom switched from the High Street to online, making it harder for chains whose customers usually shop in person. Physical stores saw sales drop by a quarter, the BRC said. Other major brands including Topshop-owner Arcadia and Debenhams have also gone into administration, costing hundreds of jobs. ""Lockdowns have proved hugely damaging for mid-range fashion chains like Edinburgh Woollen Mill and BonmarchÃ© whose traditional customer base has not adapted so quickly to online shopping as younger shoppers,"" said Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The backers of this rescue deal clearly believe there is pent-up demand amongst core customers which will be released once the doors are flung open once more,"" she added. On Monday,Marks & Spencer announced it was buying Jaeger,another brand that had belonged to Philip Day's portfolio. Peacocks, another High Street fashion brand in the EWM group remains in administration. Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' Marks & Spencer snaps up Jaeger fashion brand Edinburgh Woollen Mill collapse puts jobs at risk BonmarchÃ© collapses into administration Paperchase on the brink of administration 'Worst year for High Street job losses in 25 years' At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Crashed Indonesian plane's 'black box' recoveredThe flight data recorder could help investigators determine the cause of the crash on Saturday.Asia,"This video can not be played Debris from Indonesia plane crash laid out in Jakarta port Indonesian search teams have retrieved one of the two ""black boxes"" from the Boeing 737 plane that crashed into the Java Sea on Saturday, killing all 62 people on board. The flight data recorder was brought ashore, but the teams are still trying to locate the cockpit voice recorder. The authorities hope that data from the black boxes can give vital clues on the possible cause of the crash. The 26-year-old aircraft passed an airworthiness inspection last month. It was still functioning and intact before it crashed, preliminary results showed. Flight SJ182 was en route from the capital Jakarta to the city of Pontianak on Borneo island. Indonesian officials will now try to retrieve data from the recovered black box Separately, Indonesian police have identified the first victim - Okky Bisma, a 29-year-old flight attendant. 'Kind' pilot and newly-weds among air crash missing Video of Indonesia plane wreckage search released Indonesia's transport ministry on Tuesday said the aircraft had been grounded during the pandemic, and passed an inspection on 14 December. It made its first flight five days later with no passengers before resuming commercial flights on 22 December. The National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said that preliminary findings showed that the plane had reached the height of 10,900ft (3.3km) at 14:36 local time on Saturday (07:36 GMT), then made a steep drop to 250ft at 14:40, before it stopped transmitting data. This video can not be played What's in a plane's black box flight recorder? KNKT head Soerjanto Tjahjono added that the plane's turbine disc had been found with a damaged fan blade - ruling out the theory that the plane had exploded mid-air. ""The damaged fan blade indicates that the machine was still functioning when it crashed. This [is] also in line with the belief that the plane's system was still functioning when it reached 250ft,"" said Mr Soerjanto in a written statement to reporters. Search teams are continuing to comb the waters at the crash site, trying to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder. Earlier on Tuesday, the KNKT said a device used to locate the black boxes had experienced ""technical problems or equipment damage"". Several pieces of debris, body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing have already been recovered. According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel were involved in the search operation on Monday, along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. An engine turbine has also been recovered. Safety officials say this stage of the investigation could take up to a year. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact was recorded. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations.

Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact was recorded. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations. The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes.

'Welcome to Brexit': Driver has sandwiches seizedDutch TV films officials confiscating ham sandwiches from UK drivers under new food import rules.,"Rules governing the import of personal goods from the UK to the EU changed after Brexit formally came into effect A Dutch TV network has filmed border officials confiscating ham sandwiches and other foods from drivers arriving in the Netherlands from the UK, under post-Brexit rules. The officials were shown explaining import regulations imposed since the UK formalised its separation from the EU. Under EU rules, travellers from outside the bloc are banned from bringing in meat and dairy products. The rules appeared to bemuse one driver. ""Since Brexit, you are no longer allowed to bring certain foods to Europe, like meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, that kind of stuff,"" a Dutch border official told the driver infootage broadcast by TV network NPO 1,external. In one scene, a border official asked the driver whether several of his tin-foil wrapped sandwiches had meat in them. When the driver said they did, the border official said: ""Okay, so we take them all."" Surprised, the driver then asked the officials if he could keep the bread, to which one replied: ""No, everything will be confiscated - welcome to the Brexit, sir. I'm sorry."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK officially finished its formal separation from the EU on 31 December, 2020. From 23:00 GMT on that date, the UK stopped following EU rules, with new arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation coming into force. A trade deal with the EU was agreed on 24 December, and a week later, UK lawmakers voted in favour of the agreement. The UK's departure means big changes for business - with the UK and EU forming two separate markets - the end of free movement, and new regulations, including those governing the import of personal goods. Boris Johnson hails free trade deal with EU What are the key points of the Brexit deal? Are the borders ready? The UK government has issued guidance,externalto commercial drivers travelling to the EU, warning them to ""be aware of additional restrictions to personal imports"". ""You cannot bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (e.g. a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU,"" the guidance says. ""There are exceptions to this rule for certain quantities of powdered infant milk, infant food, special foods, or special processed pet feed."" On its website, the European Commission says,externalthe ban is necessary because such goods ""continue to present a real threat to animal health throughout the Union"". ""It is known, for example, that dangerous pathogens that cause animal diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease and classical swine fever can reside in meat, milk or their products,"" the Commission says. Separately, the Dutch customs agency shared a picture of foodstuffs it had confiscated from motorists in the ferry terminal the Hook of Holland. ""Since 1 January, you can't just bring more food from the UK,"" the agency said. ""So prepare yourself if you travel to the Netherlands from the UK and spread the word. This is how we prevent food waste and together ensure that the controls are speeded up."" The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam described the confiscation of ham sandwiches and other foodstuffs at the EU's borders with the UK as ""a standard implication of [the] Brexit deal"".

"Covid deaths in Scotland pass 5,000 milestone","This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Lockdown likely to extend to February Scotland's first minister has said the country's current lockdown is ""very unlikely"" to be lifted at the end of the month. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed that more than 5,000 people have now died after testing positive for the virus. A review of the current restrictions is due to be carried out at the end of January. Ms Sturgeon said it was possible that there would be no easing at that point. A further 54 deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours - bringing the total by that measure to 5,023. But the most recent figures from the National Records of Scotland - which record all deaths registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate - put the total at 6,686. Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing that the figures were a reminder of the toll the virus had taken. And she said every death had caused heartbreak to friends, families and loved ones across the country. The people who have died with Covid-19 Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? The first minister also said Scotland's NHS would be under far greater pressure if the current restrictions had not been put in place on Boxing Day. And she urged people not to raise their expectations about what will be announced when the lockdown review is completed in a fortnight as wholesale lifting of the restrictions was ""very unlikely"". She added: ""There may not even be any lifting of these restrictions as soon as the end of January - we will have to consider all of that carefully and set it out in due course."" All of mainland Scotland and some islands were placed into level four restrictions on 26 December, with schools remaining closed to most pupils until at least the end of the month. A further 1,875 positive cases of the virus were recorded on Monday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 153,423. The number of people in hospital with the virus stands at 1,717 - an increase of 53 since yesterday and higher than the peak of about 1,500 in the first wave in April. Of these, 133 patients are intensive care units, with Ms Sturgeon saying that the virus was putting ""very acute pressure"" on hospitals. The first minister also said that 175,942 people in Scotland had received their first vaccine dose by Monday. Opposition parties have claimed that the rollout of the vaccine has been ""sluggish"" in Scotland compared to south of the border - a charge that the government denies. And they have called for greater transparency over how many people are being given the jab every day. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said on Monday that the government was aiming to vaccinate about 560,000 people in Scotland by 31 January. Non-essential shops have been closed in Scotland since 26 December The Scottish government has previously said it is concerned that too many people have not been following the ""stay at home"" rules that are in place across the whole of the mainland and some islands. Ministers have been discussing the possibility of imposing tougher rules on click and collect shopping and takeaway food, with an announcement expected to be made on Wednesday. Retail industry representatives have described click and collect services as a ""lifeline"" for struggling businesses amid the forced closure of all non-essential shops. And they said they had not been shown any evidence that click and collect was driving transmission of the virus. Ms Sturgeon told her daily coronavirus briefing that the government may not stop click and collect services altogether. But she added: ""If we are saying to people right now that you should not be out of your home for shopping unless it is essential, then do we need to have click and collect for non-essential services instead of having that for delivery?"" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Scotland that he did not want to see further restrictions put in place unless there was evidence that they would have the desired effect. He also suggested that restricting click and collect would simply result in more people going back into supermarkets to do their shopping. The Scottish government is also under pressure to lift the the current ban on public Sunday worship, with a group of 500 church leaders from across the UK - including 200 in Scotland - insisting that there is ""no evidence of any tangible contribution to community transmission through churches in Scotland"". In a letter to the first minister, they claim that the ban may be unlawful and accuse the government of failing to understand that ""Christian worship is an essential public service, and especially vital to our nation in a time of crisis"". A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Test and Protect tells us where people were in their 48-hour infectious period. ""So we know that on one day last week the seven-day number for places of worship was 120, and data from yesterday shows the seven-day number for places of worship is 38, underlining the essential decision to require places of worship to close for public health reasons."" Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that everyone arriving in Scotland from overseas will need to show proof of a negative test from Friday. The test will need to be ""highly reliable"", the first minister said, and will need to have been from the previous three days - although young children may be exempt from the restriction. Those travelling from countries not on the quarantine exemption list will still need to self-isolate on arrival. The new rules, which will also come into force in England, werefirst outlined last week. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Capitol police officer hailed as a 'hero'Footage of the riot shows Mr Goodman lure a mob away from the Senate and the lawmakers hiding inside.US & Canada,"Officer Eugene Goodman is being celebrated for his heroics Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman is being called a hero for a second time after footage shown at the impeachment trial shows him directing Mitt Romney away from an advancing mob. In the video, the officer is seen notifying Mr Romney that the rioters were heading in his direction and guiding him away. The Utah senator, an unpopular figure among Trump supporters, said he looked forward to thanking the police officer for his actions. Officer Goodman was already being praised for his bravery that day, after singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers. Video footage showed him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing towards the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Five people, including a police officer, died as a result of the riots. The officer was seen confronting a pro-Trump rioter during the attack Members of the 2,000-person Capitol police department are tasked with protecting the Capitol building and those inside, it. A group of senators has introduced a bill to award Officer Goodman with the Congressional Gold Medal. News of his additional heroics involving Senator Romney will only amplify calls for him to be recognised. The senator said he was unaware of the danger he was in until he saw the footage at the trial on Wednesday. Senator Mitt Romney said he was looking forward to thanking Officer Goodman It formed part of the Democratic prosecution in trying to underline the peril the heart of US government was under as Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol. Senator Romney said it was ""overwhelmingly distressing and emotional"" to see the violence again, six weeks after the attack. And reflecting on his own narrow escape, he added he was looking forward to thanking Officer Goodman ""when I next see him"". This video can not be played See how close the mob got to Mike Pence, Mitt Romney and other lawmakers New York Law School criminal law professor and 20-year veteran of the New York City Police Department Kirk Burkhalter called Mr Goodman's response to the rioters ""tremendous"". ""I don't think there was any type of training that would prepare you for that situation,"" Mr Burkhalter told the BBC, speaking days after the attack. In the video shot by Huffington Post reporter Igor Bobic, Mr Goodman, who is black, is antagonised by the group of Trump supporters - who are all white men. The man at the front of the pack, wearing a QAnon T-shirt, has been identified as Doug Jensen of Iowa. He was later arrested by local police and the FBI for his role in the riots. Footage shows Mr Jensen leading the mob that chased Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber. Allow Twitter content?

Crashed Indonesian plane passed inspection last month,"This video can not be played Debris from Indonesia plane crash laid out in Jakarta port Indonesian search teams have retrieved one of the two ""black boxes"" from the Boeing 737 plane that crashed into the Java Sea on Saturday, killing all 62 people on board. The flight data recorder was brought ashore, but the teams are still trying to locate the cockpit voice recorder. The authorities hope that data from the black boxes can give vital clues on the possible cause of the crash. The 26-year-old aircraft passed an airworthiness inspection last month. It was still functioning and intact before it crashed, preliminary results showed. Flight SJ182 was en route from the capital Jakarta to the city of Pontianak on Borneo island. Indonesian officials will now try to retrieve data from the recovered black box Separately, Indonesian police have identified the first victim - Okky Bisma, a 29-year-old flight attendant. 'Kind' pilot and newly-weds among air crash missing Video of Indonesia plane wreckage search released Indonesia's transport ministry on Tuesday said the aircraft had been grounded during the pandemic, and passed an inspection on 14 December. It made its first flight five days later with no passengers before resuming commercial flights on 22 December. The National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said that preliminary findings showed that the plane had reached the height of 10,900ft (3.3km) at 14:36 local time on Saturday (07:36 GMT), then made a steep drop to 250ft at 14:40, before it stopped transmitting data. This video can not be played What's in a plane's black box flight recorder? KNKT head Soerjanto Tjahjono added that the plane's turbine disc had been found with a damaged fan blade - ruling out the theory that the plane had exploded mid-air. ""The damaged fan blade indicates that the machine was still functioning when it crashed. This [is] also in line with the belief that the plane's system was still functioning when it reached 250ft,"" said Mr Soerjanto in a written statement to reporters. Search teams are continuing to comb the waters at the crash site, trying to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder. Earlier on Tuesday, the KNKT said a device used to locate the black boxes had experienced ""technical problems or equipment damage"". Several pieces of debris, body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing have already been recovered. According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel were involved in the search operation on Monday, along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. An engine turbine has also been recovered. Safety officials say this stage of the investigation could take up to a year. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday.

Here are some of the top stories we covered:  We will be back tomorrow, as Congress hurtles towards a historic second impeachment vote against President Trump. The manager of cult favourite actor Chuck Norris has dealt a flying kick to claims that the action movie star was at the Capitol riot last week.

""This is not Chuck Norris and is a wannabe lookalike although Chuck is much more handsome,"" his manager told Fox News on Tuesday. ""Chuck remains on his ranch in Texas, where he has been with his family."" Phew! For a minute there, it was beginning to look like a terrible sequel to this 1985 Norris classic: Fiona Hill, a former top White House Security adviser, has written an opinion piece around language being used to characterise last week's violence at the Capitol. Hill, an expert on the Soviet Union, has argued in Politico that what happened last week could be defined as an attempted ""self-coup"" by the outgoing president. ""Trump disguised what he was doing by operating in plain sight, talking openly about his intent. He normalized his actions so people would accept them. Iâve been studying authoritarian regimes for three decades, and I know the signs of a coup when I see them,"" she wrote, before comparing events of recent months to a ""checklist"" analysts use to evaluate coups and attempts around the world. Hill was born in north-east England and gained worldwide attention in 2019for her straight-talking testimony during Trump's first impeachment inquiry. Republicans applaud Stefanik at an event to mark the end Trump's first impeachment last year Harvard University's prestigious Institute of Politics has made the decision to remove Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik from its advisory board. Douglas Elmendorf, the dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said on Tuesday in a note to colleagues that he had asked Stefanik to step down. When she refused, he informed her that she had been kicked out. The dean said in his letter that Stefanik, who represents northern New York state and voted to object to Biden's win, had made ""public assertions about voter fraud in Novemberâs presidential election that have no basis in evidence"". ""She has made public statements about court actions related to the election that are incorrect,"" he continued. ""Moreover, these assertions and statements do not reflect policy disagreements but bear on the foundations of the electoral process through which this countryâs leaders are chosen."" Hitting back, Stefanik called the decision ""a rite of passage and badge of honour"". ""The decision by Harvard's administration to cower and cave to the woke Left will continue to erode diversity of thought,"" she tweeted. ""The Ivory Tower's march toward a monoculture of like-minded, intolerant liberal views demonstrates the sneering disdain for everyday Americans and will instill a culture of fear for students."" The FBI previously released a handout image showing a suspect Acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin says the two pipe bombs found near the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Democratic National Committee (DNC) on 6 January ""were real devices"" with explosive igniters and timers. ""We don't know exactly why they did not go off, that's being investigated,"" he said. ""What was the purpose of those devices being planted? Was it a diversionary type of a tactic used by some of these rioters? ""Or did it have some other type of nefarious purpose? That is what the ATF, the FBI, and PD are looking at as we speak right now."" The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the identification of the individual, or individuals, who left the pipe bombs. The FBI is appealing for those involved in the Capitol riots to hand themselves into law enforcement. âEven if you left DC, agents from our local field offices will be knocking on your door,â the assistant director in charge of the FBI's DC office warned offenders at Tuesday's briefing. Michael Sherwin, the acting US Attorney for District of Washington, said some of the misdemeanor charges filed so far are ""just the beginning"" with officials looking at ""significant felony cases"" tied to sedition and conspiracy - with prison terms of up to 20 years. The Department of Justice and the FBI are giving an update on the violence at the US Capitol last week. Steven D'Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington DC office, says that they have received some 100,000 pieces of digital evidence from the public to work through. He and the US Attorney for District of Washington, Michael Sherwin, say they have opened more than 160 case files and have charged 70 people so far. D'Antuono described this as the ""tip of the iceberg"" with the number of investigations and charges expected to go into the hundreds. This video can not be played Trump: 'The 25th amendment is of zero risk to me' Speaking from the US-Mexico border, President Trump begins his speech by telling border agents that he delivered the wall ""exactly as you wanted it"". ""So you got no excuses. I don't want you to have any excuses,"" he says, referring to his signature campaign promise. He then turns to the events of last week that have led to the House to call for Vice-President Mike Pence to replace him as president under the 25th Amendment of the Constitution. ""Free speech is under assault like never before,"" he says. ""The 25th amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration."" He adds that ""the impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in history"". ""Now is the time for our nation to heal. A time for peace and calm,"" he says. He adds that ""respect for law enforcement is the foundation of the MAGA agenda,â in a reference to his campaign acronym meaning ""Make America Great Again"". Trump shouts to supporters at the airport in Texas President Trump, who is due to speak imminently, was seen by reporters autographing the border wall with Mexico. He appears to have used a black Sharpie. The president was earlier greeted by throngs of supporters upon his arrival. ""Thank you for the votes,"" he told the Texans who welcomed him at the airport.

Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News Therevelation from the Washington Post that an FBI office in Virginia warned of violence,externaladds to the serious questions over what went wrong. The report from the Norfolk office was said to have been approved for release the day before the attack on the Capitol and warned that extremists planned to travel to commit violence, and even ""war"", and were sharing maps of the tunnels beneath Congress. Some have suggested that the events marked an ""intelligence failure"" but this suggests otherwise. Instead, it looks like there was intelligence in the system but it did not find its way to the right people, was not taken seriously, or was not acted on. That final possibility goes to what may be the most difficult question â did calculations about politics or how security measures might look dictate the lack of proper preparation? Trump is speaking in a town named for a famous battle against Mexico President Trump is due to speak in Texas in the coming hour as he visits the wall on the US-Mexico border. The White House said his visit would ""mark the completion of more than 400 miles of border wall -- a promise made, promise kept..."" However, only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there were none before - that includes 47 miles of primary wall, and 33 miles of secondary wall built to reinforce the initial barrier. The city he'll visit, Alamo, is full of symbolism. It's named after the San Antonio mission where Texan fighters fought against Mexican forces for 13 days in 1836. The fighters were annihilated but became a symbol of resistance for Texans, who defeated the Mexican army about a month later. The city of Alamo in a press release yesterday said that they had been given no advance warning of Trump's visit. Read more: Trump's wall: How much has been built during his term? South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has hitched a ride on Air Force One with President Trump today on his visit to Texas. Graham, a top Trump ally, had previously been close to his Senate colleague John McCain, who frequently clashed with Trump until McCain's death in 2018. After last week's violence, Graham begged his colleagues on the Senate floor to vote to certify Biden's win. ""Trump and I, we've had a hell of a journey. I hate it to end this way. Oh my God, I hate it,"" he said. ""All I can say, is count me out, enough is enough,"" he continued. He's certainly not the first Republican senator to have an on-again/off-again relationship with Trump. Senator Ted Cruz, the first in his chamber to back an objection to Biden's victory, had previously called Trump a ""pathological liar"". This video can not be played Senator Ted Cruz on Donald Trump: Then and now German investment bank Deutsche Bank is the latest organisation to decide that it will terminate business with the US president or his companies, according to reports. As the primary lender to the Trump Organization, the bank's move could hit the Trump family wallet where it hurts. It comes as several other entities that have been crucial to the growth of the Trump brand - from Twitter to the Professional Golfers' Association - are severing ties. The bank has so far declined to comment on the matter, though reports say it will no longer do future business with the president. In the 1990s, as Trump reeled from a series of bankruptcies, Deutsche Bank was the only lender that did business with him. When he sued the bank's real estate division in 2008 after defaulting on a $40m (Â£29m) loan repayment,its private wealth division loaned him money to pay off the existing debt, according to Newsweek.,external Thebank has also been pulled into investigations by Democrats in Congress into Trump's financial dealingsas well as into investigations into the Trump Organization  by state prosecutors in New York, where Trump used to live. The Trump Organization is reported to owe Deutsche Bank about $340m (Â£249m) in outstanding loans, which are due in the next few years. Meanwhile, another of Trump's main lenders - Signature Bank - is saying it will close his two personal accounts. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is urging federal authorities to put ""anybody who was inside the Capitol"" building last Wednesday to be added to a national no-fly list. ""We cannot allow these same insurrectionists to get on a plane and cause more violence and more damage,"" said the New York Democrat. Calling on the FBI, TSA, the Department of Homeland Security to act ""immediately"", he called those involved in the riots ""a threat to the homeland as defined by the law"". Schumer - who will become Majority Leader of the US Senate in eight days - is the highest-ranking government official so far to call for a no-fly list. Social media has been abuzz in recent days, with several videos of those allegedly involved in the Capitol invasion being ejected from flights and banned by airlines. There have also been multiple reports of unruly passengers physically and verbally abusing crew members and others aboard their flights. Over the weekend, the Federal Aviation Administration threatened severe fines for misbehaviour. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin's son died by suicide, his office announced on the last day of 2020. One week later - and only two days after the laying to rest of 25-year-old Thomas Bloom Raskin - a mob rioted through the Capitol where lawmakers were meeting to certify November's election result. Raskin, who co-authored the impeachment resolution while sheltering from the crowd, had invited his daughter and son-in-law to be with him that day in the Capitol, and became separated from them as the melee began. They were forced to barricade themselves in a room with other lawmakers as the mob beat at their doors. Speaking to the Washington Post,external, Raskin said that his son, who was studying law at Harvard University, would have considered last week's violence ""the absolute worst form of crime against democracy"". âIt really is Tommy Raskin,â he added, âand his love and his values and his passion, that have kept me going.â Michigan's Attorney General Dana Nessel has warned that the Michigan Capitol ""is not safe"", despite a state decision to ban the open carrying of weapons in the building. On Monday, a state panel unanimously voted to allow only police officers to openly carry guns inside the Capitol. However, the decision does not prevent people with concealed weapons licences from bringing their guns - and, according to Nessel, no rules are in place to check people do have licences. ""That means anyone - irrespective of criminal history, membership with an anti-government org, or stated intention to harm government employees - can still enter the Capitol fully locked and loaded with firearms or explosive devices hidden by clothing, backpacks, etc,"" she wrote in a series of tweets on Tuesday. ""I repeat - the Michigan Capitol is not safe."" Nessel's response came after the FBI warned of possible armed protests by Trump supporters and far-right groups across the country ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration later this month. Representative Norma Torres, a Democrat from California, has just delivered an emotional account of her experience last week. Urging her colleagues to support a resolution asking for the 25th Amendment to be invoked to remove President Trump from office, Rep Torres recalled her experience as one of the last members to get out of the chamber as a ""raging mob"" tried to get inside.

Her voice shaking, Rep Torres spoke about hearing a pro-Trump protester get shot and having to crawl across the floor to safety. She urged Vice President Mike Pence to ""do the right thing.... for the future of America"". BBC Monitoring As major social media platforms crack down on accounts promoting US election conspiracy theories, many conspiracy and far-right groups in the US are looking for a new home online. Twitter hasnât just kicked the president off the platform. Itâs also closed down some 70,000 accounts associated with the QAnon conspiracy, while Facebook said it is continuing efforts to shut down âStop the Stealâ groups which allege, with no evidence, that Donald Trump was cheated of the presidency. One of the most popular alternatives had been the self-styled âfree speechâ social media outlet Parler, but then over the weekendthat was banned toofor posts inciting violence. Then thereâs Gab, a Twitter-like platform popular with right-wing groups, which is awash with extreme content and welcomes QAnon followers with open arms. It claims to have added 600,000 new users since the riots. Itâs thought Gabâs user base is far smaller than that of the now-closed Parler, which had around 16m users. Others seem to be moving to MeWe, which is similar to Facebook. There are some parallels with online jihadists, who also found their voices silenced after the rise of Islamic State in the Middle East. The Islamic State group and al-Qaeda frequently have to re-establish their online presence after social media companies identify and close their accounts, leading to a nomadic online existence. They have already adapted to life outside the big social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook and have exploited less well known platforms and apps to get their messages out. Read more: The House of Representatives rules committee is holding a hearing on a resolution that claims Trump ""widely advertised and broadly encouraged"" the mob that ransacked Congress last week, and that Vice-President Mike Pence should take over as president. Democrats, who control the chamber, are calling for Pence to ""immediately"" invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump unfit for office. ""Lead us out of this nightmare that weâve been plunged into with these recent events,"" Democrat Jamie Raskin says during the hearing, addressing Pence and the other cabinet officials. The 25th Amendment allows the vice-president to become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. They would need to sign a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the presiding officer of the Senate declaring the president is unfit to govern or incapable ""of discharging the powers and duties of his office"". At this point, Vice-President Mike Pence would automatically take over. The president is given the chance to offer a written response, and if he contests the finding, then it falls on Congress to decide. Any vote in the Senate and House of Representatives ordering the president's removal requires a two-thirds majority. Until the issue is resolved, the vice-president would act as president.

FBI fears armed protests by Trump supportersLaw enforcement officials warn of plans to hold armed protests before Joe Biden's inauguration.,"Security has been stepped up at the US Capitol following deadly violence last week The FBI has warned of possible armed protests across the US as Trump supporters and far-right groups call for demonstrations before Joe Biden is sworn in as president. There are reports of armed groups planning to gather at all 50 state capitols and in Washington DC in the run-up to his 20 January inauguration. Security will be tight for the event after a pro-Trump mob stormed Congress. House Democrats say a vote to impeach the president will happen on Wednesday. They accuse President Trump of ""incitement of insurrection""and say the vote will be held unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office. There is no sign Mr Pence is prepared to do so. Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden is sworn in What is the 25th Amendment? Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol Mr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris are expected to be sworn in at a ceremony at the Capitol. The Biden team had already urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital because of the Covid-19 pandemic, a call that is now being repeated by local authorities. Security officials have said there will be no repeat of the breach seen on 6 January, when thousands of pro-Trump supporters were able to break into the building where members of Congress were voting to certify the election result. This video can not be played Speaker Nancy Pelosi walks through Capitol riots damage Five people died in the riot, which happened after Mr Trump repeated unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the November vote and encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol. Since then, calls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans. Mr Trump has made no public statements sincehe was banned from several social media platforms - including Twitter- on Friday. He became the third US president to be impeached in December 2019over charges of breaking the law by asking Ukraine to investigate his rival in the presidential election. The Senate cleared him. Tuesday:The House of Representatives will vote on a resolution calling on Vice-President Pence and the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unfit for office and remove him immediately. The resolution is likely to pass as Democrats hold a majority, but Mr Pence has shown no sign he is planning to act Wednesday:Democrats vow to hold a vote on impeachment. As they have a majority, Mr Trump is likely to become the first president to be impeached twice. The single article of impeachment - a formal charge - will then need to be sent to the Senate where a trial will be held but the timeline is not known 20 January:Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are sworn in as president and vice-president Posts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protests on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself. An internal FBI bulletin, reported by ABC News and other outlets,,externalcarries a warning that one group is calling for the ""storming"" of state, local and federal courthouses around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ Although the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were also reported elsewhere in the country. Local police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses, according to US media. FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. Companies and social media networks are cracking down against users and websites seen to be encouraging violence, including social network Parler,which said it was suing Amazon for removing it from its web hosting service. Twitter said it had suspended more than 70,000 accounts that promotedthe Q-Anon conspiracy theorywhile Facebook said it was banning any content that refers to Stop the Steal, a slogan associated with Mr Trump's claim the election was rigged. In other developments: US media report that Mr Trump had a phone call with the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, on Monday. According to CBS and Politico, Mr McCarthy told fellow Republicans that Mr Trump had accepted some responsibility for last week's violence while Axios said Mr Trump claimed the loose-knit left-wing group antifa were involved, although there is no evidence of that Mr Trump is expected to make his first public appearance since the riot on Tuesday, as he travels to Texas to visit a stretch of the border wall with Mexico On Monday, Mr Trump and Mr Pence met for the first time since the riot, which happened as the vice-president was presiding over certification of the election result. No details have been released of the meeting. Mr Pence had refused Mr Trump's call not to certify the result On Monday President Trump declared a state of emergency for Washington DC until 24 January, which enables the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to act to ""avert the threat of a catastrophe"". Chad Wolf, acting head of the DHS, said he had instructed the US Secret Service to begin operations for the inauguration on Wednesday - six days early - ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape"". Later on Monday, Mr Wolf became the third Trump cabinet secretary to step down since the riots, after Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao. He said his departure had been prompted by ""recent events"", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment. This video can not be played ""President Trump could face charges even with a pardon"" - Prof Bruce Ackerman from Yale law school More than 10,000 National Guard troops will be in the capital by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested, Chief of the National Guard Bureau General Daniel Hokanson said. For Mr Trump's inauguration in 2017, about 8,000 National Guard troops were deployed. Meanwhile, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called for more security after what she described as an ""unprecedented terrorist attack"" at the US Capitol last week. Capitol riots: What's happening with arrests? Capitol police officer hailed as a 'hero' The National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid ""credible threats"" of violence, adding it could also temporarily close areas of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. Speaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was ""not afraid"" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears. Biden said on Monday he had spoken to some senators about their moves to impeach Donald Trump After being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. Donald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years to refuse to do so.

You cannot exercise in groups, but you can run or go on a wander with someone else from your household, support bubble or one person you don't live with. The government's Covid guidance for exercise explains that law - andmixes it with a non-legal recommendation,externalto only go out once a day - and to stay local. It says local ""means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live"", but that has no legal force. Derbyshire Police have been taking the ""stay local"" principle seriously. Officers have issued tickets to people who drive five miles to their local beauty spot - includingtwo women accused of an illegal picnicbecause they were carrying takeaway cups of tea. They might. This refers to the ban on ""gatherings"". The last-but-one version of the restrictions made it a potential crime to ""mingle"". That language has now gone from the law - but the rules are far stricter. While the law in England doesn't criminalise bumping into someone in the street, you can no longer meet anyone socially - other than those in your household, support bubble or people you care for. The Home Office has given the police an extra Â£30m to pay for Covid patrols in England and Wales. Over Christmas there were more than 800 fines for what Home Secretary Priti Patel says were ""egregious"" breaches of the rules. The National Police Chiefs' Council hasn't abandoned the Four Es - but expect more fines and more officers asking people what they are doing. Leicester woman fined for Wales trip to see horse Group fined for playing dominoes in restaurant Border police patrols to double after travel ban Police patrols were stepped up around the Scotland-England border around Christmas For instance, the Metropolitan Police has told officers to issue fines ""more quickly"" to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches. Derbyshire Police, who famouslyput a drone up over hikersin the first lockdown, has issued a similar warning. Yes - while in shops and on public transport. You could face a fixed penalty notice if you don't. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings?

Execution halted of only woman on US death rowThe judge orders a mental competency hearing to be held - just hours before the scheduled execution.,"Lisa Montgomery was sentenced to death in 2007 A US judge has granted a stay of execution to Lisa Montgomery - just hours before the only woman on America's federal death row was due to be given a lethal injection. Judge James Hanlon said a competency hearing should be held first. Montgomery's lawyers had argued she was mentally incompetent to be executed, saying she was born brain-damaged. Lisa Montgomery strangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. Montgomery, now 52, would have been the first female federal inmate to be put to death in almost 70 years had her execution in Terre Haute, Indiana, gone ahead as scheduled on 12 January. Looking for answers in the life of a killer In Trumpâs final days, a rush of federal executions US resumption of federal executions criticised In Monday's ruling,Judge Hanlon of the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana wrote:,external""Ms Montgomery's motion to stay execution is granted to allow the court to conduct a hearing to determine Ms Montgomery's competence to be executed. ""Ms. Montgomery's current mental state is so divorced from reality that she cannot rationally understand the government's rationale for her execution. ""The court will set a time and date for the hearing in a separate order in due course,"" Judge Hanlon wrote. Montgomery's attorneys welcomed the ruling. ""The court was right to put a stop to Lisa Montgomery's execution,"" attorney Kelley Henry said in a statement. ""As the court found, Mrs Montgomery 'made a strong showing' of her current incompetence to be executed. ""Mrs Montgomery has brain damage and severe mental illness that was exacerbated by the lifetime of sexual torture she suffered at the hands of caretakers,"" the attorney added. Prosecutors have filed a notice to appeal the judge's ruling, CNN reports. It is the second time that Montgomery's execution has been postponed. Her execution date was originally set for last December - but a stay was put in place after her attorneys contracted Covid-19. The last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who died in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before President Donald Trump ordered them to resume earlier last year. There are suggestions that Montgomery now may even escape the death penalty entirely, as President-elect Joe Biden - who is due to take office on 20 January - has said he will seek to end federal executions.

"2020 saw most excess deaths since World War TwoLast year saw 697,000 deaths registered in the UK - 15% above the five-year average.Health","The Covid pandemic has caused excess deaths to rise to their highest level in the UK since World War Two. There were close to 697,000 deaths in 2020 - nearly 85,000 more than would be expected based on the average in the previous five years. This represents an increase of 14% - making it the largest rise in excess deaths for more than 75 years. When the age and size of the population is taken into account, 2020 saw the worst death rates since the 2000s. This measure - known as age-standardised mortality - takes into account population growth and age. The data is only available until November - so the impact of deaths in December have not yet been taken into account - but it shows the death rate at that stage was at its highest in England since 2008. The data on deaths can be confusing. On one hand, excess deaths are at their highest since World War Two, while on the other, death rates, once age and size of population are taken into account, are at their worst level for a little over a decade 'only'. How should that be interpreted? Excess deaths are basically a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years. Clearly, 2020 saw a huge and unexpected rise in deaths because of the pandemic, just as World War Two led to a sudden jump. But in determining how much those jumps affected the chances of dying, a measure known as age-standardised mortality, which takes into account the age and size of the population, is important. It shows the pandemic has undone the progress made in the last decade or so. That is significant - especially given this has happened despite lockdowns and social-distancing measures to stop the spread of the virus. But it also helps put the death toll over the past 12 months in a wider context. King's Fund chief executive Richard Murray said the picture was likely to worsen, given Covid deaths were rising following the surge in infections over recent weeks. ""The UK has one of the highest rates of excess deaths in the world, with more excess deaths per million people than most other European countries or the US,"" he said. 'It will take a public inquiry to determine exactly what went wrong, but mistakes have been made. ""In a pandemic, mistakes cost lives. Decisions to enter lockdown have consistently come late, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes or the experiences of other countries. ""The promised 'protective ring' around social care in the first wave was slow to materialise and often inadequate, a contributing factor to the excess deaths among care home residents last year. 'Like many countries, the UK was poorly prepared for this type of pandemic."" Matthew Reed, of the end-of-life care charity Marie Curie said the focus on Covid should not hide the fact there has been a ""silent crisis"" of deaths at home. He said people have died prematurely in 2020 from other causes - with a big jump in deaths at home. ""We are concerned many have not had the care they needed,"" he added.

"Eyesight risk warning over lockdown screen timeMore than a third of people using screens more in lockdown reported eyesight changes, a study suggests.HealthComments","An eye health charity is recommending people learn the ""20-20-20"" rule to protect their sight, as lockdown has increased people's time using screens. Fight for Sight advises looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds, every 20 minutes you look at a screen. Out of 2,000 people, half used screens more since Covid struck and a third (38%) of those believed their eyesight had worsened, a survey suggested. Opticians remain open for those who need them, the charity said. The representative survey of 2,000 adults suggested one in five were less likely to get an eye test now than before the pandemic, for fear of catching or spreading the virus. Respondents reported difficulty reading, as well as headaches and migraines and poorer night vision. The research charity, which commissioned a survey from polling company YouGov, said it wanted to emphasise the importance of having regular eye tests and to remind people ""the majority of opticians are open for appointments throughout lockdown restrictions"". Fight for Sight chief executive Sherine Krause said: ""More than half of all cases of sight loss are avoidable through early detection and prevention methods. Regular eye tests can often detect symptomless sight-threatening conditions."" But even simple screen breaks can help to prevent eye strain, the charity suggested. Government guidance states that under lockdownpeople can leave home for medical appointments,externaland to ""avoid injury, illness or risk of harm"". The College of Optometrists said its members should continue to provide eye care under lockdown for people who experience any eyesight changes or problems. Optometrists are the professionals who will carry out your eye test when you visit an optician's practice. Routine appointments can also be provided ""if capacity permits, and if it is in the patients' best interests"", the guidance states. Screen break advice for children in lockdown Nine ways lockdown is different from last time Clinical adviser Paramdeep Bilkhu said the college's own research suggested just under a quarter of people noticed their vision deteriorate during the first lockdown. ""Our research showed us that many people believe that spending more time in front of screens worsened their vision,"" he said. ""The good news is that this is unlikely to cause any permanent harm to your vision. However, it is very important that if you feel your vision has deteriorated or if you are experiencing any problems with your eyes, such as them becoming red or painful, you contact your local optometrist by telephone or online."" UK health and safety legislation statesemployers must pay for eye tests,externalfor their employees if they have to use a screen for work for more than one hour a day. In the summer, the UK Ophthalmology Alliance and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists calculated that at least10,000 people had missed out on essential eye carein Britain. In the most extreme cases, the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it feared some people were at risk of losing their sight because of a fear of attending hospital during the coronavirus pandemic. A Royal College of Ophthalmologists spokesperson said: ""It is important that people who have found significant changes in their vision seek the advice of an optometrist who will examine, and determine if the changes require further investigation by an ophthalmologist - a medically-trained eye doctor.""

Did Nicola Sturgeon break the ministerial code?,"Nicola Sturgeon referred herself for an independent investigation of whether she breached the code in January 2019 Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is facing questions after her predecessor Alex Salmond accused her of ""repeatedly"" misleading parliament and breaking the ministerial code. Ms Sturgeon has rejected the accusations, but has referred herself for an independent investigation. What exactly are the claims, who will adjudicate and what could it all mean? The row centres on the Scottish government's botched investigation of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond, something which has now been subject to a wide range of inquiries. A special Holyrood committee has been looking into the circumstances which saw the government admit its probe had been ""unlawful"" and pay Mr Salmond more than Â£500,000 in legal costs. Questions have been raised about the role of Ms Sturgeon, and her contact with Mr Salmond during the investigation in 2018 - questions which prompted herto refer herself to an independent panelwhich adjudicates on the ministerial code. There has always been acode of conduct for Scottish ministers,external, setting out expected behaviours and responsibilities, but it was Mr Salmond who introduced the panel in 2008. He was investigated and cleared of breaching the code on five occasions. Suggestions that Ms Sturgeon might have broken the rules came to the fore thanks to Mr Salmond, who claimed his successor in Bute House had ""repeatedly misled"" parliament and made ""wholly false"" statements. Ms Sturgeon has insisted shehas ""nothing to hide"", did not mislead parliament, and will set out her side of the story to both inquiries in the coming weeks. Mr Salmond may get to put his side across first, having been invited to give evidence to the Holyrood committee next week. Ms Sturgeon says she has not spoken to her former mentor since their last meeting in 2018 One central question is when Ms Sturgeon learned of the two internal complaints against her predecessor. The first minister has said on a number of occasions that she first heard about them from Mr Salmond himself, at a meeting at her Glasgow home on 2 April, 2018. She has since accepted that she met Mr Salmond's former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein at her office four days earlier, on 29 March, buthad ""forgotten"" about it. Ms Sturgeon still maintains that she learned of the fact and detail of the complaints from Mr Salmond himself - an encounter which she says was ""seared on my memory"" and had ""somehow overwritten in my mind a much more fleeting, opportunistic meeting that took place a few days earlier"". However, Mr Salmond says this claim is ""simply untrue"" and ""untenable"". He says Mr Aberdein's evidence is that he ""personally discussed the existence of the complaints and summarised the substance of the complaints"" in a ""pre-arranged meeting"" on 29 March - and had shared this information with Mr Salmond and others at the time. Section 1.3of theministerial codestates that ""ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the first minister"". Pressed about this, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I do not consider that I misled parliament, but that is for others to judge."" Mr Salmond won a Â£500,000 expenses payout from the government after it conceded its investigation had been unlawful Ms Sturgeon has also insisted that she did not intervene in the complaints process - and that she did not meet Mr Salmond in her capacity as first minister, but rather as leader of the SNP. This matters in the context of the ministerial code becauseSection 4.22states that ""the basic facts"" of government meetings with ""external individuals"" should be recorded, including a list of those present and the reasons for the meeting. The 2 April meeting at Ms Sturgeon's home was not formally recorded - shetold the inquiry committee,externalshe had ""met a friend of 30 years"" as leader of the party, because she ""suspected that he may be about to resign from the SNP"". Mr Salmond says this position is ""ridiculous"", and that ""all participants in that meeting were fully aware of what the meeting was about and why it had been arranged"". He added: ""The first minister's claim that it was ever thought to be about anything other than the complaints made against me is wholly false."" Ms Sturgeon's husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, suggested in his evidence that the situation might not be quite so clear cut. He says Ms Sturgeon never discussed the complaints with him because they were government business. But his view was that Ms Sturgeon could have initially agreed the meetings thinking they were a party matter, before subsequently realising they were ""something else"". However, this does not settle the fact there were two further meetings between the pair - another in Glasgow and one in Aberdeen - which again were not formally recorded. Ms Sturgeon's response to this is that she was ""trying to protect the confidentiality and integrity"" of the complaints process. She says this section of the code is designed to ""prevent a minister having meetings about decisions that they are taking in government and not declaring them"", but says ""that was a decision I was not involved in"". Peter Murrell said Nicola Sturgeon would not discuss government business with him Yet another row concerns whether the government followed its own legal advice while contesting the judicial review case raised by Mr Salmond. The former first minister insists that counsel had informed the government before the end of October 2018 that they were staring defeat in the face, but that the case ultimately continued into the following January at the cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mr Salmond says this is contrary toSection 2.30of the code, which sets out the ""overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law"" and to ""ensure their decisions are informed by appropriate analysis of the legal considerations"". The Scottish government meanwhile says it was only much later that it became clear the case was doomed, with Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans beinggiven explicit advice,externalthat ""the only sensible and defensible action is to concede the petition"" on 29 December. The ins and outs of this may be harder to judge than the matter of the meetings, because much of the government's legal advice remains shrouded in secrecy. MSPs have twice voted to demand legal privilege be waived so that advice can be published in full. But the government argues that to do so would undermine the whole system of free and fair legal advice, and prevent lawyers from providing frank opinions in future. The Holyrood inquiry committee has beengiven some access to reports summarising the advice, but are still calling for more. The Holyrood inquiry is separate to the code investigation, but has been tracking its progress The inquiry committee might come up with a view of Ms Sturgeon's conduct, but the one that really matters is that of James Hamilton. A former head of the prosecution service in Ireland, Mr Hamilton was appointed to the ministerial standards panel in 2013. He will pen a report setting out whether or not in his judgement Ms Sturgeon breached the rules. However, as an external advisor, he would not have any power to impose a punishment - that power lies with the first minister herself, as the ultimate arbiter of the code. If he says there was no breach, Ms Sturgeon will move on unscathed. But what will happen if he returns a judgement saying the first minister broke the code? It could be argued that Mr Salmond's goal is to remove Ms Sturgeon from office given he has called for the codeinquiry to be expandedand highlighted a string of alleged infractions which the code itself suggests could prompt a resignation. Whether this would actually be the outcome of a breach is far less clear. Ms Sturgeon is at the peak of her popularity, is currently leading Scotland through a pandemic, and will be facing the judgement of the voters in a few months' time anyway. The defences she has offered so far also point to where mitigation of any breach could be offered - she could argue that it was right to focus on protecting the anonymity of the complainers, rather than minor matters like making sure meetings were minuted. On the one hand, the history of Holyrood is littered with leaders who fell from the top over relatively technical matters - Henry McLeish forsub-letting his constituency office,external, David McLetchieover taxi fares,externaland Wendy Alexander overregistering donations,external. But equally, there is a more up-to-date example of a minister being found to have breached a ministerial code and remaining in office,in Home Secretary Priti Patel. Few things about this inquiry have been clear-cut or straightforward, and the outcome may well turn out to be every bit as muddy as the process has been.

Royal Mail lists areas hit by Covid postal delays,"Royal Mail has published a list of areas where there have been delivery delays due to its workforce being affected by the Covid pandemic. The postal service said some areas will see a reduced service due to workers being off sick or self-isolating. Royal Mail listed 28 areas where post might be late, with 27 in England and one in Northern Ireland. Problems with deliveries over Christmas had prompted shoppers to complain about parcels not arriving on time. Royal Mail said: ""Despite our best efforts and significant investment in extra resource, some customers may experience slightly longer delivery timescales than our usual service standards. ""This is due to the exceptionally high volumes we are seeing, exacerbated by the coronavirus-related measures we have put in place in local mail centres and delivery offices to keep our people and customers safe."" Many of the affected areas are in or near London, while others include Chelmsford in Essex, Leeds in West Yorkshire, Margate in Kent, and Widnes in Cheshire. Labour MP Wes Streeting, whose Ilford constituency is one of the areas affected, tweeted on Sunday that he was concerned about vaccination invitations getting caught up in Royal Mail delays.

FBI fears armed protests by Trump supporters,"Security has been stepped up at the US Capitol following deadly violence last week The FBI has warned of possible armed protests across the US as Trump supporters and far-right groups call for demonstrations before Joe Biden is sworn in as president. There are reports of armed groups planning to gather at all 50 state capitols and in Washington DC in the run-up to his 20 January inauguration. Security will be tight for the event after a pro-Trump mob stormed Congress. House Democrats say a vote to impeach the president will happen on Wednesday. They accuse President Trump of ""incitement of insurrection""and say the vote will be held unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office. There is no sign Mr Pence is prepared to do so. Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden is sworn in What is the 25th Amendment? Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol Mr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris are expected to be sworn in at a ceremony at the Capitol. The Biden team had already urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital because of the Covid-19 pandemic, a call that is now being repeated by local authorities. Security officials have said there will be no repeat of the breach seen on 6 January, when thousands of pro-Trump supporters were able to break into the building where members of Congress were voting to certify the election result. This video can not be played Speaker Nancy Pelosi walks through Capitol riots damage Five people died in the riot, which happened after Mr Trump repeated unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the November vote and encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol. Since then, calls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans. Mr Trump has made no public statements sincehe was banned from several social media platforms - including Twitter- on Friday. He became the third US president to be impeached in December 2019over charges of breaking the law by asking Ukraine to investigate his rival in the presidential election. The Senate cleared him. Tuesday:The House of Representatives will vote on a resolution calling on Vice-President Pence and the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unfit for office and remove him immediately. The resolution is likely to pass as Democrats hold a majority, but Mr Pence has shown no sign he is planning to act Wednesday:Democrats vow to hold a vote on impeachment. As they have a majority, Mr Trump is likely to become the first president to be impeached twice. The single article of impeachment - a formal charge - will then need to be sent to the Senate where a trial will be held but the timeline is not known 20 January:Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are sworn in as president and vice-president Posts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protests on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself. An internal FBI bulletin, reported by ABC News and other outlets,,externalcarries a warning that one group is calling for the ""storming"" of state, local and federal courthouses around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ Although the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were also reported elsewhere in the country. Local police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses, according to US media. FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. Companies and social media networks are cracking down against users and websites seen to be encouraging violence, including social network Parler,which said it was suing Amazon for removing it from its web hosting service. Twitter said it had suspended more than 70,000 accounts that promotedthe Q-Anon conspiracy theorywhile Facebook said it was banning any content that refers to Stop the Steal, a slogan associated with Mr Trump's claim the election was rigged. In other developments: US media report that Mr Trump had a phone call with the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, on Monday. According to CBS and Politico, Mr McCarthy told fellow Republicans that Mr Trump had accepted some responsibility for last week's violence while Axios said Mr Trump claimed the loose-knit left-wing group antifa were involved, although there is no evidence of that Mr Trump is expected to make his first public appearance since the riot on Tuesday, as he travels to Texas to visit a stretch of the border wall with Mexico On Monday, Mr Trump and Mr Pence met for the first time since the riot, which happened as the vice-president was presiding over certification of the election result. No details have been released of the meeting. Mr Pence had refused Mr Trump's call not to certify the result On Monday President Trump declared a state of emergency for Washington DC until 24 January, which enables the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to act to ""avert the threat of a catastrophe"". Chad Wolf, acting head of the DHS, said he had instructed the US Secret Service to begin operations for the inauguration on Wednesday - six days early - ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape"". Later on Monday, Mr Wolf became the third Trump cabinet secretary to step down since the riots, after Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao. He said his departure had been prompted by ""recent events"", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment. This video can not be played ""President Trump could face charges even with a pardon"" - Prof Bruce Ackerman from Yale law school More than 10,000 National Guard troops will be in the capital by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested, Chief of the National Guard Bureau General Daniel Hokanson said. For Mr Trump's inauguration in 2017, about 8,000 National Guard troops were deployed. Meanwhile, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called for more security after what she described as an ""unprecedented terrorist attack"" at the US Capitol last week. Capitol riots: What's happening with arrests? Capitol police officer hailed as a 'hero' The National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid ""credible threats"" of violence, adding it could also temporarily close areas of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. Speaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was ""not afraid"" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears. Biden said on Monday he had spoken to some senators about their moves to impeach Donald Trump After being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. Donald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years to refuse to do so.

"Eyesight risk warning over lockdown screen timeMore than a third of people using screens more in lockdown reported eyesight changes, a study suggests.Health","An eye health charity is recommending people learn the ""20-20-20"" rule to protect their sight, as lockdown has increased people's time using screens. Fight for Sight advises looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds, every 20 minutes you look at a screen. Out of 2,000 people, half used screens more since Covid struck and a third (38%) of those believed their eyesight had worsened, a survey suggested. Opticians remain open for those who need them, the charity said. The representative survey of 2,000 adults suggested one in five were less likely to get an eye test now than before the pandemic, for fear of catching or spreading the virus. Respondents reported difficulty reading, as well as headaches and migraines and poorer night vision. The research charity, which commissioned a survey from polling company YouGov, said it wanted to emphasise the importance of having regular eye tests and to remind people ""the majority of opticians are open for appointments throughout lockdown restrictions"". Fight for Sight chief executive Sherine Krause said: ""More than half of all cases of sight loss are avoidable through early detection and prevention methods. Regular eye tests can often detect symptomless sight-threatening conditions."" But even simple screen breaks can help to prevent eye strain, the charity suggested. Government guidance states that under lockdownpeople can leave home for medical appointments,externaland to ""avoid injury, illness or risk of harm"". The College of Optometrists said its members should continue to provide eye care under lockdown for people who experience any eyesight changes or problems. Optometrists are the professionals who will carry out your eye test when you visit an optician's practice. Routine appointments can also be provided ""if capacity permits, and if it is in the patients' best interests"", the guidance states. Screen break advice for children in lockdown Nine ways lockdown is different from last time Clinical adviser Paramdeep Bilkhu said the college's own research suggested just under a quarter of people noticed their vision deteriorate during the first lockdown. ""Our research showed us that many people believe that spending more time in front of screens worsened their vision,"" he said. ""The good news is that this is unlikely to cause any permanent harm to your vision. However, it is very important that if you feel your vision has deteriorated or if you are experiencing any problems with your eyes, such as them becoming red or painful, you contact your local optometrist by telephone or online.""

"American Football coach snubs presidential medalNew England Patriots coach Bill Belichick turns down Donald Trump's offer, citing the Capitol riots.","New England Patriots's Bill Belichick is considered one of the most successful coaches in NFL history Top NFL coach Bill Belichick says he will not accept President Donald Trump's offer of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, citing the US Capitol riot. Belichick, of the New England Patriots, said he was flattered when he was first offered the medal - the top award given to civilians in the US. But he said he changed his mind after a mob of Trump supporters stormed Congress last week. Five people died. The celebrated coach had previously spoken of his friendship with Mr Trump. ""Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honour represents and admiration for prior recipients,"" Belichick said in a statement. ""Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award."" Belichick, who has won a record six Super Bowl titles, is considered one of the most successful coaches in NFL history. The Presidential Medal of Freedom recognises individuals who have made outstanding contributions to ""the security or national interests of America"". In 2019Mr Trump gave the award to golfer Tiger Woods, as well as radio personality Rush Limbaugh and posthumously Elvis Presley. This video can not be played Super Bowl: How Tom Brady and Bill Belichick built a New England Patriots dynasty Donald Trump may only have recently made a career of politics, but he's always loved sport. He owns 17 golf courses and once bought and ran the New Jersey Generals of the US Football League. Just last week, he awarded three presidential medals of freedom to professional golfers. This week he was planning to honour the most successful professional football coach in modern times, Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots. The president seems to particularly enjoy the company of sport figures and revel in their achievements and prowess. So for Belichick, a personal friend of the president's, to decline the award is a stinging rebuke. The coach's decision reflects the depth of the political crisis president has created in the past week. It also highlights the troubled relationship Trump has had with the National Football League and its players, who he has disparaged for Black Lives Matter protests during the US national anthem. Belichick, a sometimes bristling, controversial figure with more than a few detractors, is used to public animosity. A coach can't win without the commitment of his players, however, and Belichick clearly believed his relationship with his team would be jeopardised by associating himself with Trump at this point.

Capitol police officer hailed as a 'hero',"Officer Eugene Goodman is being celebrated for his heroics Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman is being called a hero for a second time after footage shown at the impeachment trial shows him directing Mitt Romney away from an advancing mob. In the video, the officer is seen notifying Mr Romney that the rioters were heading in his direction and guiding him away. The Utah senator, an unpopular figure among Trump supporters, said he looked forward to thanking the police officer for his actions. Officer Goodman was already being praised for his bravery that day, after singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers. Video footage showed him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing towards the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Five people, including a police officer, died as a result of the riots. The officer was seen confronting a pro-Trump rioter during the attack Members of the 2,000-person Capitol police department are tasked with protecting the Capitol building and those inside, it. A group of senators has introduced a bill to award Officer Goodman with the Congressional Gold Medal. News of his additional heroics involving Senator Romney will only amplify calls for him to be recognised. The senator said he was unaware of the danger he was in until he saw the footage at the trial on Wednesday. Senator Mitt Romney said he was looking forward to thanking Officer Goodman It formed part of the Democratic prosecution in trying to underline the peril the heart of US government was under as Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol. Senator Romney said it was ""overwhelmingly distressing and emotional"" to see the violence again, six weeks after the attack. And reflecting on his own narrow escape, he added he was looking forward to thanking Officer Goodman ""when I next see him"". This video can not be played See how close the mob got to Mike Pence, Mitt Romney and other lawmakers New York Law School criminal law professor and 20-year veteran of the New York City Police Department Kirk Burkhalter called Mr Goodman's response to the rioters ""tremendous"". ""I don't think there was any type of training that would prepare you for that situation,"" Mr Burkhalter told the BBC, speaking days after the attack. In the video shot by Huffington Post reporter Igor Bobic, Mr Goodman, who is black, is antagonised by the group of Trump supporters - who are all white men. The man at the front of the pack, wearing a QAnon T-shirt, has been identified as Doug Jensen of Iowa. He was later arrested by local police and the FBI for his role in the riots. Footage shows Mr Jensen leading the mob that chased Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber. Allow Twitter content?

After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves Mr Jensen - a move seemingly designed to draw attention on to himself, luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The image of Mr Goodman trailed by a mob - some armed with Confederate flags, others with allusions to the Nazi flag - was  extremely disturbing, Mr Burkhalter said. ""Police officer, not a police officer, to see a black man being chased by someone carrying a Confederate flag - there is something wrong with that picture. That should never happen again,"" he said. ""It just reeks of everything we need to correct."" Mr Goodman's standoff with the mob came just minutes before authorities were able to seal the chamber, according to reporting from the Washington Post.

Executive to meet amid mounting hospital pressuresFirst Minister Arlene Foster says ministers have few options left to tighten lockdown rules.Northern Ireland,"Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster appeared at their first joint press conference in weeks A fall in Northern Ireland's rate of Covid-19 infection has been achieved by many people ""doing the right thing"", Arlene Foster has said. But she said she was concerned by reports of some employers not adhering to the ""stay-at-home"" order for staff. Earlier, ministers also discussed a potential crackdown on larger retailers selling non-essential items. The first minister said that was a ""selfish spirit"" which would not help beat the virus. Stormont's first and deputy first ministers were appearing in Dungannon, County Tyrone, at their first joint press conference in more than a month. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered What is Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine plan? Their comments came as a further 1,205 cases of the virus were reported by Northern Ireland's Department of Health on Tuesday. Twenty-two more people have died with the virus, taking the department's total number of deaths to 1,498. There are 785 people in hospital with Covid-19, 55 are in intensive care. The reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. But it has now fallen ""significantly"", according to the Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young. The first and deputy first ministers will meet the PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne on Tuesday evening to discuss enforcement of the coronavirus laws. Michelle O'Neill, NI's Deputy First Minister, said there would also be an ""urgent roundtable"" with the retail sector to reinforce the need to ""comply with the spirit and letter"" of the restrictions. ""Adherence will get us through this difficult period,"" said Ms O'Neill. Northern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with many sectors forced to close. People havealso been told they should only leave homefor exercise, food and medical needs or if they cannot work from home. Mrs Foster said the evidence provided to ministers showed that the restrictions were working, and she paid tribute to the public for complying. ""It's people choosing to Facetime and phone friends rather than visiting, it's doing one big shop and not nipping out every day, doing the best job you can at home and not going into the work place when you don't have to,"" she added. Dr McBride said Northern Ireland had some distance to go before restrictions are lifted Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer warned that there are ""some hard yards to go"" and lockdown would not be ending soon. ""I'm not certain we will be emerging from lockdown in February. I think that would be optimistic in the extreme,"" said Dr Michael McBride. ""We have a long, long way to go with this virus. I don't think any of us can anticipate a return to normality come the 6th of February."" Mr McBride said restrictions would be in place for a considerable number of months, until a time when more of the population who are extremely clinically vulnerable are vaccinated. Earlier, Prof Young said Northern Ireland had passed the peak in terms of new cases of Covid-19 for this wave of the pandemic. But he warned: ""We still have a long way to go and the number of cases we are seeing each day is still averaging well over 1,000 cases a day - which by any measure in the course of the epidemic represents a very high level."" He said he expects the number of hospital inpatients to continue to rise ""until some time in last two weeks in January"". Prof Young said he believed that the current restrictions are ""sufficient"" for the moment, if people stick to them. Health bosses say hospitals are facing major pressure due to the high number of Covid-19 cases Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said it was estimated that on average about one in 60 people have Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. He said the rising number of cases was a ""payback"" for the relaxation of restrictions in December. New lockdown restrictions came into force in Northern Ireland on Friday 8 January,meaning people can only leave their home for essential reasons. Prof Young said while compliance with the stay-at-home order was better than it was at the start of December, it was still not as good as it was in the first lockdown in March. Police have set up checkpoints with officers questioning people about whether their travel is essential Amid the pressure on the health service, health trusts have said more cancer operations could be cancelled. The Belfast Health Trust has already cancelled urgent cancer surgeries. Father James O'Reilly, a chaplain at Antrim Area Hospital, said he has been called to the hospital almost every day in the past year to give Covid-19 patients their last rites and to provide comfort to families and staff. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme he said: ""You can see the toll it's taking on the nurses and doctors now. Tens of thousands of Covid-19 vaccines have been given to people in Northern Ireland ""They are giving everything and quite honestly they don't have much more to give it seems. ""That's a scary thought because they're our last line of defence against this disease."" As of Monday evening, almost 92,000 people in Northern Irelandhad received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Dr Frances O'Hagan, whose clinic in Armagh city began vaccinating people aged over 80 last week, expects to have administered the jab to more than 300 patients by the end of the week.

"Around half of Covid intensive care patients dyingOverall, patients are now more likely to survive, but death rates are high in intensive care.Wales","The data showed men were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units Around half of patients admitted to Welsh intensive care units during the second wave of the pandemic have died, a study has found. The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) found men aged in their 60s were more likely to need intensive care. It also found those from Asian backgrounds and deprived areas were disproportionately affected. But a leading doctor said, overall, people were more likely to survive now. Intensive care consultant Matt Morgan said new treatments meant only the sickest patients were reaching intensive care, where outcomes were poorer. ICNARC collected information on 431 Welsh patients who were critically ill with coronavirus from 1 September to 31 December 2020 as part of a UK-wide audit of intensive care patients. Of the patients who were admitted, 68% were men and 32% women. The average age of a patient was 59.5 years. Intensive care consultant Matt Morgan said, overall, patients were more likely to survive Covid now While the vast majority of patients were white (91.6%), the number of patients of Asian ethnicity was more than double the proportion of the Asian population, with 6.3% of patients recorded as being Asian, compared to an average of 2.4% in their local population. The audit of patients found that, excluding those still being treated at the unit, half had died while half had been discharged. Although the numbers of patients surveyed is relatively low for statistical purposes, Dr Morgan said the survival rate reflected the situation in hospitals. Covid patients 'could reach double April peak' New variant blamed for Wrexham Covid spike Hospital stretched as Covid cases rise rapidly ""We are putting fewer people, who are in the first stage of their illness, on to life support machines. And that is because we have treatments now that we know can help,"" he said. ""Overall, you are more likely now to survive Covid than ever before, and that is in every age group - sometimes by as much as 10% more. ""What we do know is that overall, out of every ten people who come to intensive care with Covid about six of them will survive and will leave the intensive care unit. Which means sadly four of them won't, four of them will die. ""That's similar overall to the first wave but that data is based on some patients who are still in the intensive care unit. So that may change and it's more likely to get worse rather than better."" ""We also know patients who are on life support machines in the intensive care unit will do worse than those who come to the intensive care unit and are not on life support machines. ""For those people, it's probably five out of 10 people who will survive and five who will sadly die and that may be worse when we have the data on those who are still there. ""And there's a big effect of age. So for those over the age of 70 it may be as little as four people out of 10 who survive, maybe less. And for those over the age of 80 it may be as low as one or two people out of ten who survive. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? The figures from ICNARC also highlight how people from poorer backgrounds were more likely to need treatment in intensive care. Using a deprivation score from 1 to 5, more than half of patients scored 4 or 5, representing the most deprived postcodes in Wales. Dr Morgan said: ""Sadly, disease is an illness of deprivation. ""And so that's why we feel it, particularly in Wales where the industrial scars of our past are still very much there - and our health is there.""

How could rules be tougher?,"England is currently under a third national lockdown, in an attempt to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed by coronavirus cases. But there has been speculation that ministers could be considering tightening restrictions, amid concerns the ""stay-at-home"" message isn't being followed by enough people. At Monday evening's Downing Street briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged people to follow the existing rules but added, ""we won't rule out taking further action if it's needed"". Other ministers have struck a similar tone. But what is the case for more changes? In March, nurseries closed to all but vulnerable children and those whose parents were key workers. But so far this lockdown, early-years provision has remained open in England. Scotland and Northern Ireland have chosen to keep nurseries closed to most children for now. But England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said keeping them open ""would allow people who need to go to work, or need to do particular activities, to do so"". Younger children carry a lower risk of transmission than adolescents, scientists say. Butaccording to Public Health England,external, 10% of coronavirus outbreaks or clusters in educational settings since September have been in early-years provision. England's three main nursery organisations have called on the government to provide clear scientific evidence on the risks to early-years staff now there is a more transmissible variant of Covid-19. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he too would like to hear more from scientists about the risks - and nurseries should ""probably"" close. 'Show us it's safe', say worried nursery staff Going out to exercise once a day is one of the ""reasonable excuses"" for leaving home during lockdown. People can walk, run, cycle or swim with those they live - or are in a support bubble - with. In addition, they can exercise, on their own, with one person, each time, from another household - as long as they stay 2m (6ft) apart. However, Mr Hancock said, ""we've been seeing large groups and that is not acceptable"" and warned that, ""if too many people keep breaking this rule, then we are going to have to look at it"". The rules say exercise should be ""local"" - in the village, town, or part of the city where you live - but do not currently specify how far people can travel. Derbyshire Police recentlyfined two women Â£200 eachfor driving five miles to meet for a walk, saying driving for exercise was ""not in the spirit"" of lockdown. They were told the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed, either, as they were ""classed as a picnic"". The penaltieshave now been withdrawn. Brockwell Park, south London, 9 January 2021 Prof Whitty, meanwhile, has urged people to ""double down"", avoid unnecessary contact and stick to the rules. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live about coffee shops remaining open for takeaways, he advised against meeting up there. ""Really, please don't,"" he said. Face coverings must be worn in almost all public indoor settings - including shops -  unless people are exempt. Premises ""should take reasonable steps to promote compliance with the law"", government guidance says. Last summer, when customer face coverings became law, many supermarketssaid they would not make their staff responsible for enforcing the rules. However, Morrisons has now updated its policy to bar shoppers who refuse to cover their faces, unless they are medically exempt. Sainsbury's says security guards at its stores will challenge customers who do not comply. Tesco, Asda and Waitrosehave followed suitand say they too will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks unless they have an exemption. There have been suggestions face coverings should be required in outdoor public places. However, Sage has previously suggested it would have a ""very low impact"" on community transmission Prof Whitty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the risk posed by joggers, for example, was ""very low"" - but there ""might be some logic"" to people wearing masks in a busy outdoor queue or crowded around a market stall. One change the government has ruled out is to support bubbles - which allow people living alone and single, or new parents to mix with another household of any size, without having to socially distance. At the government briefing, Mr Hancock said: ""I can rule out removing the bubbles."" The official guidance says it's best if a support bubble is formed with a household who live locally. But there is currently no limit to how far people can travel to visit their bubble, meaning they could go from areas with high infection rates to those with lower ones, potentially spreading the virus. When ""bubbling"" was first suggested, in May,Sage rejected it as too dangerous,external, because the reproduction (R) number  - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - was close to one. Currently, the R number in England is between 1.1 and 1.4. Sage says stopping all indoor contact between different households could lower this by as much as 0.2. ""Active contract tracing should be a precondition of introducing bubbling"", Sage added. Unlike in March, places of worship are allowed to open in England, although they are closed in Scotland. They provide spiritual leadership for many and bring communities together - but their ""communal nature"" also makes them ""vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus"", the governmentguidance for England,externalsays. When the latest lockdown was announced, the Archbishop of Canterbury tweeted: ""The government hasn't suspended public worship - but some may feel it better not to attend in person and some parishes are expected to offer online services only for now."" Sage haspreviously suggested,externalplaces of worship pose a high risk to vulnerable groups but closing them would have a low to moderate impact on overall coronavirus transmission.

Eleven ambulances were sent to a care home in Cornwall at the weekend after a coronavirus outbreak, it has been confirmed. Coronavirus rapidly spread to 25 residents at Trengrouse care home in Helston and many staff were off sick or self-isolating despite best efforts to prevent the spread, bosses said. Three residents were taken to hospital. Others needed oxygen and are being looked after at the home. Bosses said staff and residents were being ""tested very regularly"" and ""we'll never know how it came into the home"". Read more here. With new lockdowns now in force in England, most of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we've been answering some of your questions. Cheryle Locke asked: ""My 89-year-old father had the vaccine a week ago. Is it safe to hug him now?"" If someone is vaccinated they should still follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. Thatâs because no vaccine is 100% effective and it is not yet clear if immunisation will stop people catching and spreading coronavirus, even though it protects against severe illness and death. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection. However, if you have alreadyformed a support bubblewith your father, you can have close physical contact with him. Read more answers to your questions - including about the rollout of vaccination, new international travel rules and school closures -here. Campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford helped secured changes last year We reported earlier on the outcry about the supply of food parcels to children on free school meals in England during lockdown after the contents of one company's hamper went viral on social media. A mother had posted a photo of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of food items, and questioned whether the contents were sufficient. It came to the attention of footballer Marcus Rashford, who secured changes to government policy on free school meals last year after launching a campaign on the issue. He sought a meeting with the supplier, Chartwells. The company has now apologised, but stressed the hamper was not for five days - not 10 - as had been suggested on social media. But it said: ""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance."" Read more about this story here. The NHS trust with the largest intensive care capacity in the UK has confirmed it now has almost 200 more Covid patients in its four hospitals than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. University Hospitals Birmingham said it has 873 patients with Covid-19 in its hospitals and 125 in intensive care. It comes after the Health Service Journal
published a leaked email to staff which suggested the trust risked being ""overwhelmed"". A hospital spokesperson said: ""We continue to expand our
intensive care and acute medical teams so they are able to treat the rising
number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery
including cancer operations. ""Every member of staff will be
supported by the Trust in delivering the best care wherever they are
working.""  Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The police are stepping up enforcement because they believe many people
breaking the Covid regulations are doing so because they are stubborn, not
because they donât understand what is allowed. The public, police, and legal experts do struggle to keep up with
the ever-changing rules. But the organisers of a party on a boat in Hertfordshire, the passengers
on a minibus heading for Wales, and the couple who travelled 120 miles to ""watch seals"" would have struggled to explain to the officers issuing them with
fines that they were confused. Those were clear breaches.  More complicated is the fine line
between the law - which police officers can enforce - and the government
guidance, which they canât. No law says exercise can only be conducted once a day, or for a specific
duration. These are pieces of firm guidance, along with the request to ""stay
local"", which resulted in criticism of the prime minister after his bike ride
in east London. It would be difficult to set a distance limit which would work for both
people living in rural areas and inner cities.  Impossible to prove that a
65-minute run was in breach of the law. Which is why the success of the measures will rely on personal
responsibility in the end. And why some experts are saying that different
messages such as ""act like youâve got it"" or ""thanks for doing the right thing"" might
cut through better than a list of regulations to be obeyed.   Ben WrightBBC political correspondent National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt says a limit on
how far people can travel for exercise in England would be difficult for police
to enforce. Earlier today the Metropolitan Police said exercise should begin and end at
someoneâs front door if possible. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wonât
speculate about tougher rules but says there are âendless discussionsâ within
government about tightening the measures. It wonât happen today but it clearly
could soon. In the meantime she hopes to clear up confusion and firm up
compliance but is insisting the current rules are clear. In a very stern voice. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Questions keep cropping up
about when key workers, such as supermarket staff and teachers, will be
vaccinated. There was one at todayâs
televised briefing. Some argue key workers should
be part of this first phase of the vaccination programme, which will see all over-50s, front-line health and care staff, and younger adults with health conditions
vaccinated by the end of April. But the assessment by the
governmentâs scientific advisers is pretty simple. They have targeted those who
are most at risk of dying if infected. Someone who is over the age
of 75 â the age group that is being prioritised immediately for vaccination by
mid-February - has a one in eight chance of dying if they catch Covid. By comparison, a person who
is 40 has a one in 1,000 chance. And that risk almost entirely
lies with those in that age group who have a health condition and therefore
would be part of this first phase anyway.  Reality Check At Home Secretary Priti Patelâs
news conference, Ian from Preston asked why the rules are more relaxed than
they were during the first lockdown last year if the new variant is more infectious. We know the government
recognises the situation is more serious because the UK is at threat level five - the highest level - which means there is a
danger of the NHS being overwhelmed within
21 days. In the first lockdown the UK was
only at threat level four. But the restrictions appear less
severe than they were in March. For example, support bubbles and childcare
bubbles exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds are open when they were
closed last time. And communal worship is still allowed as long as social distancing is observed. But one significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops and public transport. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened: Priti Patel mentioned the latest government statistics on coronavirus during the briefing this evening. A further 1,243 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to thelatest figures on the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external That brings the UK total to 81,960. The UK has also recorded a further 45,533 positive coronavirus test results. And 2,431,648 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But
what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started
falling. There have now been two consecutive days where newly
diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the
average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in
London, the South East and East of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. The North West is
causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having
any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the
tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look
like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising â patients being admitted at
the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago â but it does at
least offer a glimmer of hope. Alan Tolhurst from Politics Home asks whether the vaccination centres are Covid secure and have adequate ventilation. The home secretary cites the government's vaccination delivery plan and says the sites have spaced-out cubicles and other features to support social distancing and protect staff, following all of the guidance from Public Health England. Dr Diwakar says ""absolutely rigid"" infection controls are in place, including in the ExCel centre in London, which he visited recently. He says gels and masks are provided and the last thing staff want is to inadvertently pass on the virus to those being vaccinated, particularly the over-80s and other vulnerable people. ""We have spent months preparing to set these centres up and we are guided by really strict rules."" With that, Ms Patel brings the presser to an end.  The home secretary is asked how the public can understand what constitutes staying local,after two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk but had the penalties withdrawn. Priti Patel says the police ""exercise their professional judgement"" and points out that the fine in that case was rescinded. ""When we have people dying... we all have to exercise our judgement,"" she says. The new lockdown in England allows people to exercise with one other person from another household in an open public space, but says you should staytwo metres apartfrom each other. Ms Patel says: ""When it comes to exercising, again I do say stay local. Stay local is absolutely crucial. ""By all means take your daily exercise, but it's up to all of us in the right way to exercise that judgement as to how we do it - not socialising, making sure we're acting in the right way, staying away from other people."" She says that is ""clearly what the prime minister"" did when herode his bicycle seven miles from home. She adds: ""We all have to ask ourselves what can we do to keep everyone safe."" Martin Hewitt says ""this is unprecedented territory"" for police. ""Sometimes mistakes will be made but we always have looked at those, we've looked at those quickly... and we have said when we've got something wrong."" The home secretary says the government is ""absolutely working"" on getting frontline workers such as police, teachers and supermarket staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Diane from York, Priti Patel acknowledged they were ""at occupational risk of coming in in contact with the virus"". But she said the government was following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation who had ""thought carefully"" when it identified the top priority groups to receive the vaccine first. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, said he would ""obviously"" back the call for vaccinations for police as the ""nature of policing is that those officers are having daily to deal with people where they have no idea whether they are infected"".  Next up is the Telegraph's Gordon Rayner, who says countries such as France and Italy were able to cope with 40,000 patients going into hospital without asking everyone to stay at home. Could the NHS have been better prepared, he asks? Dr Diwakar said the NHS spent the summer learning the lessons of the first wave and preparing for the winter, investing in critical care. Hundreds of extra beds have been made available in London and patients have been moved elsewhere in the UK where extra capacity is available and that is how the NHS is coping. On a separate question, Ms Patel says there is a ""live"" debate within government on the current rules but says she will not speculate on whether they could be tightened up further. ""All rules are constantly under review within government but right now we are focusing very much on compliance enforcement"". Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel has reinforced the governmentâs
âstay at homeâ message. But to what extent is that being
followed and how has our behaviour changed compared with Englandâs first national
lockdown last March? Apple and Google record mobility
data which is pulled together by recording the location histories on people's
mobile devices and comparing it to a pre-coronavirus level. On Friday, the number of people
driving was down by 31% compared with the pre-Covid level. But it was down 63% on the first
Friday of the first lockdown in March 2020. Similar data shows that a higher
proportion of people were in workplaces, parks and grocery shops last Friday
compared with the first lockdown. But this could be in part down to
more places, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents, being open
this time. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. Sam Coates from Sky asks whether the government is concentrating too much on enforcing the rules in spaces like parks when they should be looking at workplaces and public transport. Ms Patel says ""when it comes to the rules... our target and our objective is to save lives, this isn't about picking out individual groups"". ""When it comes to the enforcement of those rules, it is right that we go after those breaches,"" she says, referring to things like parties. But she adds that ""this is a collective effort"" and that police are working with local authorities and other bodies to enforce the rules. She thanks supermarkets that have ""stepped up their efforts"" to make sure people are social distancing. On workplaces, Martin Hewitt says: ""That is ultimately the responsibility of any business or owner in that space."" He adds: ""Primarily our space is the public space."" ITV's Dan Hewitt asks whether the rules are tough enough to contain the virus and whether they need to be clarified, referring to the row over Boris Johnson's Olympic Park bike ride. Martin Hewitt answers first, saying there has been a lot of focus on the definition of local and he doesn't think it is sensible to mandate a certain distance people can travel as this would be challenging for the police to enforce. He says exemptions for exercise are fair and they are easily understood. People need to ask themselves whether their actions are essential and being done in the safest way possible. Ms Patel says exercise is important for people's health and wellbeing and says most people are adhering to the stay local guidance. ""The rules are tough enough,"" she adds. ""The message is clear. ""The more we follow the rules is the sooner we can drive this awful, atrocious virus down."" Mark Easton from the BBC asks Priti Patel why the rules of this lockdown aren't as tough as they were last spring. She says: ""The rules are actually very simple and clear - we are meant to stay at home and only leave home for a very very limited number of reasons."" She adds that ""everyone has to be conscientious in our actions"" and echoes Dr Diwakar's comment that people should act as if they have the virus. ""The rules are clear,"" she says. Martin Hewitt says: ""From our perspective we will carry on engaging [with] people... but I think the rules are clear."" He adds: ""You're right that the regulations have shifted over that period of time... but I think it's very clear what people need to do."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Indonesian plane crash: Black box locator damagedAuthorities are still searching for the data recorders of the crashed Sriwijaya Air plane.,"This video can not be played Debris from Indonesia plane crash laid out in Jakarta port Indonesian search teams have retrieved one of the two ""black boxes"" from the Boeing 737 plane that crashed into the Java Sea on Saturday, killing all 62 people on board. The flight data recorder was brought ashore, but the teams are still trying to locate the cockpit voice recorder. The authorities hope that data from the black boxes can give vital clues on the possible cause of the crash. The 26-year-old aircraft passed an airworthiness inspection last month. It was still functioning and intact before it crashed, preliminary results showed. Flight SJ182 was en route from the capital Jakarta to the city of Pontianak on Borneo island. Indonesian officials will now try to retrieve data from the recovered black box Separately, Indonesian police have identified the first victim - Okky Bisma, a 29-year-old flight attendant. 'Kind' pilot and newly-weds among air crash missing Video of Indonesia plane wreckage search released Indonesia's transport ministry on Tuesday said the aircraft had been grounded during the pandemic, and passed an inspection on 14 December. It made its first flight five days later with no passengers before resuming commercial flights on 22 December. The National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said that preliminary findings showed that the plane had reached the height of 10,900ft (3.3km) at 14:36 local time on Saturday (07:36 GMT), then made a steep drop to 250ft at 14:40, before it stopped transmitting data. This video can not be played What's in a plane's black box flight recorder? KNKT head Soerjanto Tjahjono added that the plane's turbine disc had been found with a damaged fan blade - ruling out the theory that the plane had exploded mid-air. ""The damaged fan blade indicates that the machine was still functioning when it crashed. This [is] also in line with the belief that the plane's system was still functioning when it reached 250ft,"" said Mr Soerjanto in a written statement to reporters. Search teams are continuing to comb the waters at the crash site, trying to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder. Earlier on Tuesday, the KNKT said a device used to locate the black boxes had experienced ""technical problems or equipment damage"". Several pieces of debris, body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing have already been recovered. According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel were involved in the search operation on Monday, along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. An engine turbine has also been recovered. Safety officials say this stage of the investigation could take up to a year. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact was recorded. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations.

Earlier on Tuesday, the KNKT said a device used to locate the black boxes had experienced ""technical problems or equipment damage"". Several pieces of debris, body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing have already been recovered. According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel were involved in the search operation on Monday, along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. An engine turbine has also been recovered. Safety officials say this stage of the investigation could take up to a year. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact was recorded. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations. The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes.

Pollutants 'may be threatening porpoise fertility',"A porpoise washed up on a beach in Kent Long-lived banned industrial chemicals may be threatening the fertility of male porpoises living off the UK. Polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs) were phased out decades ago, but can build up in whales, dolphins and porpoises. Scientists say harbour porpoises exposed to PCBs had shrunken testicles, suggesting an effect on sperm count and fertility. They say that while these are preliminary findings, more must be done to clean up the oceans. PCBs have been linked with a number of threats to whales and dolphins, but research has focused on mothers and their young. This video can not be played Lulu the killer whale was one of the most contaminated animals ever recorded (Image: John Bowler/RSPB Scotland) A study led by scientists at the Institute of Zoology at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) found high levels of PCBs were linked to smaller testicles in otherwise healthy animals. They think this could have an impact on sperm count, with obvious implications for reproductive success. ""In porpoises, reduced testes weights have been associated with lower sperm counts so we think that if PCBs are reducing testes weights they may also be reducing sperm counts but we hope to do further research to confirm this,"" said lead researcher Rosie Williams of ZSL. Populations of harbour porpoises around the UK are believed to be stable, though the animals face threats from pollution, accidental fishing and infection. The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals. PCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment. Killer whales, as apex predators, can be exposed to particularly high levels of PCBs A series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity. The chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea. PCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises. One killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded. 'Shocking' pollutant levels in UK whale Although levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely. PCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life. A recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a ""cocktail of pollutants"", which are passed down from mother to calf. 'Toxic chemical cocktail' passed to baby porpoises 'Cocktail of pollutants' found in dolphins Scientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain. In humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality. Strandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast. The deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections. In the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades. The study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility. ""Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,"" said Rosie Williams. Populations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility. ""This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,"" she said. ""That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals."" There are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber. The study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.

American Football coach snubs presidential medal,"New England Patriots's Bill Belichick is considered one of the most successful coaches in NFL history Top NFL coach Bill Belichick says he will not accept President Donald Trump's offer of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, citing the US Capitol riot. Belichick, of the New England Patriots, said he was flattered when he was first offered the medal - the top award given to civilians in the US. But he said he changed his mind after a mob of Trump supporters stormed Congress last week. Five people died. The celebrated coach had previously spoken of his friendship with Mr Trump. ""Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honour represents and admiration for prior recipients,"" Belichick said in a statement. ""Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award."" Belichick, who has won a record six Super Bowl titles, is considered one of the most successful coaches in NFL history. The Presidential Medal of Freedom recognises individuals who have made outstanding contributions to ""the security or national interests of America"". In 2019Mr Trump gave the award to golfer Tiger Woods, as well as radio personality Rush Limbaugh and posthumously Elvis Presley. This video can not be played Super Bowl: How Tom Brady and Bill Belichick built a New England Patriots dynasty Donald Trump may only have recently made a career of politics, but he's always loved sport. He owns 17 golf courses and once bought and ran the New Jersey Generals of the US Football League. Just last week, he awarded three presidential medals of freedom to professional golfers. This week he was planning to honour the most successful professional football coach in modern times, Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots. The president seems to particularly enjoy the company of sport figures and revel in their achievements and prowess. So for Belichick, a personal friend of the president's, to decline the award is a stinging rebuke. The coach's decision reflects the depth of the political crisis president has created in the past week. It also highlights the troubled relationship Trump has had with the National Football League and its players, who he has disparaged for Black Lives Matter protests during the US national anthem. Belichick, a sometimes bristling, controversial figure with more than a few detractors, is used to public animosity. A coach can't win without the commitment of his players, however, and Belichick clearly believed his relationship with his team would be jeopardised by associating himself with Trump at this point.

Cuba placed back on US terrorism sponsor list,"The US has placed Cuba back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism, citing the communist country's backing of Venezuela. President Donald Trump's administration made the announcement just days before he leaves the White House. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on 20 January, has previously said he wants to improve US-Cuban relations. Cuba called the move ""political opportunism"". Mr Biden has said he is seeking closer ties between the long-term adversaries but Mr Trump's decision is likely to hinder a quick repair of relations. Cuba's place on the list will require a formal review that could take months, analysts say. The Caribbean island was removed from the list by President Barack Obama in 2015, but Mr Trump has taken a harder line towards the country. What Biden's victory means for the rest of the world Key moments explaining tense Cuba-US relationship The man who saved Old Havana from decay In 2016 Barack Obama became the first US president to visit Cuba since 1928 When explaining the decision, officials cited Cuba's support ofVenezuelan leader Nicolas Madurowho the US refuses to recognise. ""With this action, we will once again hold Cuba's government accountable and send a clear message: the Castro regime must end its support for international terrorism and subversion of US justice,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Monday. In response, Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Bruno Rodriguez tweeted: ""We condemn the cynical and hypocritical qualification of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, announced by the United States."" In advance of the announcement, House Democrat Gregory Meeks called it ""another stunt by President Trump and Pompeo, trying to tie the hands of the incoming Biden administration on their way out the door."" This video can not be played What's changed in US-Cuba policy under Trump? Mr Biden's plans included allowing Cuban-Americans to visit family and send money. President Obama began to normalise relations with Cuba in 2015. He called the decades-long US efforts to isolate the country ""a failure"". Since the Cold War era, theUS had pursued various policies to undermine Cubawhich it saw as a great threat. Cuba now rejoins countries including Iran and North Korea,externalon the list of sponsors of terrorism. The impact on the island country include severe limits on foreign investment.

With new lockdowns now in force in England, most of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we've been answering some of your questions. Cheryle Locke asked: ""My 89-year-old father had the vaccine a week ago. Is it safe to hug him now?"" If someone is vaccinated they should still follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. Thatâs because no vaccine is 100% effective and it is not yet clear if immunisation will stop people catching and spreading coronavirus, even though it protects against severe illness and death. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection. However, if you have alreadyformed a support bubblewith your father, you can have close physical contact with him.

Campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford helped secured changes last year We reported earlier on the outcry about the supply of food parcels to children on free school meals in England during lockdown after the contents of one company's hamper went viral on social media. A mother had posted a photo of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of food items, and questioned whether the contents were sufficient. It came to the attention of footballer Marcus Rashford, who secured changes to government policy on free school meals last year after launching a campaign on the issue. He sought a meeting with the supplier, Chartwells. The company has now apologised, but stressed the hamper was not for five days - not 10 - as had been suggested on social media. But it said: ""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.""

The NHS trust with the largest intensive care capacity in the UK has confirmed it now has almost 200 more Covid patients in its four hospitals than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. University Hospitals Birmingham said it has 873 patients with Covid-19 in its hospitals and 125 in intensive care. It comes after the Health Service Journal
published a leaked email to staff which suggested the trust risked being ""overwhelmed"". A hospital spokesperson said: ""We continue to expand our
intensive care and acute medical teams so they are able to treat the rising
number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery
including cancer operations. ""Every member of staff will be
supported by the Trust in delivering the best care wherever they are
working.""  Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The police are stepping up enforcement because they believe many people
breaking the Covid regulations are doing so because they are stubborn, not
because they donât understand what is allowed. The public, police, and legal experts do struggle to keep up with
the ever-changing rules. But the organisers of a party on a boat in Hertfordshire, the passengers
on a minibus heading for Wales, and the couple who travelled 120 miles to ""watch seals"" would have struggled to explain to the officers issuing them with
fines that they were confused. Those were clear breaches.  More complicated is the fine line
between the law - which police officers can enforce - and the government
guidance, which they canât. No law says exercise can only be conducted once a day, or for a specific
duration. These are pieces of firm guidance, along with the request to ""stay
local"", which resulted in criticism of the prime minister after his bike ride
in east London. It would be difficult to set a distance limit which would work for both
people living in rural areas and inner cities.  Impossible to prove that a
65-minute run was in breach of the law. Which is why the success of the measures will rely on personal
responsibility in the end. And why some experts are saying that different
messages such as ""act like youâve got it"" or ""thanks for doing the right thing"" might
cut through better than a list of regulations to be obeyed.   Ben WrightBBC political correspondent National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt says a limit on
how far people can travel for exercise in England would be difficult for police
to enforce. Earlier today the Metropolitan Police said exercise should begin and end at
someoneâs front door if possible. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wonât
speculate about tougher rules but says there are âendless discussionsâ within
government about tightening the measures. It wonât happen today but it clearly
could soon. In the meantime she hopes to clear up confusion and firm up
compliance but is insisting the current rules are clear. In a very stern voice. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Questions keep cropping up
about when key workers, such as supermarket staff and teachers, will be
vaccinated. There was one at todayâs
televised briefing. Some argue key workers should
be part of this first phase of the vaccination programme, which will see all over-50s, front-line health and care staff, and younger adults with health conditions
vaccinated by the end of April. But the assessment by the
governmentâs scientific advisers is pretty simple. They have targeted those who
are most at risk of dying if infected. Someone who is over the age
of 75 â the age group that is being prioritised immediately for vaccination by
mid-February - has a one in eight chance of dying if they catch Covid. By comparison, a person who
is 40 has a one in 1,000 chance. And that risk almost entirely
lies with those in that age group who have a health condition and therefore
would be part of this first phase anyway.  Reality Check At Home Secretary Priti Patelâs
news conference, Ian from Preston asked why the rules are more relaxed than
they were during the first lockdown last year if the new variant is more infectious. We know the government
recognises the situation is more serious because the UK is at threat level five - the highest level - which means there is a
danger of the NHS being overwhelmed within
21 days. In the first lockdown the UK was
only at threat level four. But the restrictions appear less
severe than they were in March. For example, support bubbles and childcare
bubbles exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds are open when they were
closed last time. And communal worship is still allowed as long as social distancing is observed. But one significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops and public transport. Today's UK government press conference has ended. Here's what happened: Priti Patel mentioned the latest government statistics on coronavirus during the briefing this evening. A further 1,243 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to thelatest figures on the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external That brings the UK total to 81,960. The UK has also recorded a further 45,533 positive coronavirus test results. And 2,431,648 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But
what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started
falling. There have now been two consecutive days where newly
diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the
average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in
London, the South East and East of England. In some regions, cases are still going up. The North West is
causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having
any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the
tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look
like they may be beginning to have an impact. Care must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data. Hospital cases are still rising â patients being admitted at
the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago â but it does at
least offer a glimmer of hope. Alan Tolhurst from Politics Home asks whether the vaccination centres are Covid secure and have adequate ventilation. The home secretary cites the government's vaccination delivery plan and says the sites have spaced-out cubicles and other features to support social distancing and protect staff, following all of the guidance from Public Health England. Dr Diwakar says ""absolutely rigid"" infection controls are in place, including in the ExCel centre in London, which he visited recently. He says gels and masks are provided and the last thing staff want is to inadvertently pass on the virus to those being vaccinated, particularly the over-80s and other vulnerable people. ""We have spent months preparing to set these centres up and we are guided by really strict rules."" With that, Ms Patel brings the presser to an end.  The home secretary is asked how the public can understand what constitutes staying local,after two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk but had the penalties withdrawn. Priti Patel says the police ""exercise their professional judgement"" and points out that the fine in that case was rescinded. ""When we have people dying... we all have to exercise our judgement,"" she says. The new lockdown in England allows people to exercise with one other person from another household in an open public space, but says you should staytwo metres apartfrom each other. Ms Patel says: ""When it comes to exercising, again I do say stay local. Stay local is absolutely crucial. ""By all means take your daily exercise, but it's up to all of us in the right way to exercise that judgement as to how we do it - not socialising, making sure we're acting in the right way, staying away from other people."" She says that is ""clearly what the prime minister"" did when herode his bicycle seven miles from home. She adds: ""We all have to ask ourselves what can we do to keep everyone safe."" Martin Hewitt says ""this is unprecedented territory"" for police. ""Sometimes mistakes will be made but we always have looked at those, we've looked at those quickly... and we have said when we've got something wrong."" The home secretary says the government is ""absolutely working"" on getting frontline workers such as police, teachers and supermarket staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Diane from York, Priti Patel acknowledged they were ""at occupational risk of coming in in contact with the virus"". But she said the government was following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation who had ""thought carefully"" when it identified the top priority groups to receive the vaccine first. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council, said he would ""obviously"" back the call for vaccinations for police as the ""nature of policing is that those officers are having daily to deal with people where they have no idea whether they are infected"".  Next up is the Telegraph's Gordon Rayner, who says countries such as France and Italy were able to cope with 40,000 patients going into hospital without asking everyone to stay at home. Could the NHS have been better prepared, he asks? Dr Diwakar said the NHS spent the summer learning the lessons of the first wave and preparing for the winter, investing in critical care. Hundreds of extra beds have been made available in London and patients have been moved elsewhere in the UK where extra capacity is available and that is how the NHS is coping. On a separate question, Ms Patel says there is a ""live"" debate within government on the current rules but says she will not speculate on whether they could be tightened up further. ""All rules are constantly under review within government but right now we are focusing very much on compliance enforcement"". Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel has reinforced the governmentâs
âstay at homeâ message. But to what extent is that being
followed and how has our behaviour changed compared with Englandâs first national
lockdown last March? Apple and Google record mobility
data which is pulled together by recording the location histories on people's
mobile devices and comparing it to a pre-coronavirus level. On Friday, the number of people
driving was down by 31% compared with the pre-Covid level. But it was down 63% on the first
Friday of the first lockdown in March 2020. Similar data shows that a higher
proportion of people were in workplaces, parks and grocery shops last Friday
compared with the first lockdown. But this could be in part down to
more places, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents, being open
this time. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. Sam Coates from Sky asks whether the government is concentrating too much on enforcing the rules in spaces like parks when they should be looking at workplaces and public transport. Ms Patel says ""when it comes to the rules... our target and our objective is to save lives, this isn't about picking out individual groups"". ""When it comes to the enforcement of those rules, it is right that we go after those breaches,"" she says, referring to things like parties. But she adds that ""this is a collective effort"" and that police are working with local authorities and other bodies to enforce the rules. She thanks supermarkets that have ""stepped up their efforts"" to make sure people are social distancing. On workplaces, Martin Hewitt says: ""That is ultimately the responsibility of any business or owner in that space."" He adds: ""Primarily our space is the public space."" ITV's Dan Hewitt asks whether the rules are tough enough to contain the virus and whether they need to be clarified, referring to the row over Boris Johnson's Olympic Park bike ride. Martin Hewitt answers first, saying there has been a lot of focus on the definition of local and he doesn't think it is sensible to mandate a certain distance people can travel as this would be challenging for the police to enforce. He says exemptions for exercise are fair and they are easily understood. People need to ask themselves whether their actions are essential and being done in the safest way possible. Ms Patel says exercise is important for people's health and wellbeing and says most people are adhering to the stay local guidance. ""The rules are tough enough,"" she adds. ""The message is clear. ""The more we follow the rules is the sooner we can drive this awful, atrocious virus down."" Mark Easton from the BBC asks Priti Patel why the rules of this lockdown aren't as tough as they were last spring. She says: ""The rules are actually very simple and clear - we are meant to stay at home and only leave home for a very very limited number of reasons."" She adds that ""everyone has to be conscientious in our actions"" and echoes Dr Diwakar's comment that people should act as if they have the virus. ""The rules are clear,"" she says. Martin Hewitt says: ""From our perspective we will carry on engaging [with] people... but I think the rules are clear."" He adds: ""You're right that the regulations have shifted over that period of time... but I think it's very clear what people need to do."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Indonesian plane crash: Black box locator damagedAuthorities are still searching for the data recorders of the crashed Sriwijaya Air plane.Asia,"This video can not be played Debris from Indonesia plane crash laid out in Jakarta port Indonesian search teams have retrieved one of the two ""black boxes"" from the Boeing 737 plane that crashed into the Java Sea on Saturday, killing all 62 people on board. The flight data recorder was brought ashore, but the teams are still trying to locate the cockpit voice recorder. The authorities hope that data from the black boxes can give vital clues on the possible cause of the crash. The 26-year-old aircraft passed an airworthiness inspection last month. It was still functioning and intact before it crashed, preliminary results showed. Flight SJ182 was en route from the capital Jakarta to the city of Pontianak on Borneo island.

It made its first flight five days later with no passengers before resuming commercial flights on 22 December. The National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said that preliminary findings showed that the plane had reached the height of 10,900ft (3.3km) at 14:36 local time on Saturday (07:36 GMT), then made a steep drop to 250ft at 14:40, before it stopped transmitting data.

KNKT head Soerjanto Tjahjono added that the plane's turbine disc had been found with a damaged fan blade - ruling out the theory that the plane had exploded mid-air. ""The damaged fan blade indicates that the machine was still functioning when it crashed. This [is] also in line with the belief that the plane's system was still functioning when it reached 250ft,"" said Mr Soerjanto in a written statement to reporters. Search teams are continuing to comb the waters at the crash site, trying to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder. Earlier on Tuesday, the KNKT said a device used to locate the black boxes had experienced ""technical problems or equipment damage"". Several pieces of debris, body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing have already been recovered. According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel were involved in the search operation on Monday, along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. An engine turbine has also been recovered. Safety officials say this stage of the investigation could take up to a year. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact was recorded. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations.

Care home boss 'frightened' over vaccine delay,"Meddyg Care Dementia Home was due to receive vaccinations last week A care home manager is ""frightened"" for the residents after its delivery of Covid vaccinations failed to arrive. Lorna Jones said Meddyg Care Dementia Home in Criccieth, Gwynedd, was due to have a delivery of the new Oxford-AstraZeneca jab a week ago. However the vaccine has not arrived amid claims other people in the area have already had the jab. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board admitted there had been ""logistical problems"" in north west Wales. The health board insisted it is ""committed"" to vaccinating those most vulnerable. On Monday, it was announced thatall over-50s in Wales are to be offered jab by spring, after criticism the rollout of the vaccine in Wales has been slower than in other parts of the UK. With family visits suspended, the care home has not recorded a single Covid-19 case and a phone call on New Year's Eve to say it was to receive the vaccine was met with ""glee and happiness"". Under the Welsh Government's vaccination rollout plan, care home residents and staff are first in line to get the immunisation - or priority one - ahead of elderly people within communities across Wales. However the vaccine has not arrived while, the home claimed, local GP surgeries have been administering the vaccine to over 80s in the community. All over-50s in Wales to be offered jab by spring Q&A: When will I get my Covid-19 vaccine? Covid: Wales 'ready to vaccinate at a higher rate' Lorna Jones is demanding answers as to why the vaccine has not arrived Ms Jones said: ""I can't understand why Betsi Cadwaladr have veered away from the priority list. ""It's very clear. If there are vaccines coming into the local community, which there are, why have our residents not been vaccinated? ""I know some care homes have had it in Caernarfon, so why haven't we. What's the difference?"" Ms Jones said the delay is causing concern among staff, residents and families. ""I'm frightened for our residents. I'm getting a lot of contact from families and I just can't give them anything,"" she said. The home's owner said he had now taken matters into his own hands. Kevin Edwards, managing director of Meddyg Care, said he had spent hours ringing around GP surgeries ""begging"" for spare vaccines. He said the residents would now be vaccinated on Tuesday. ""We're a specialist dementia home, you can't just turn up one day and give the vaccine to the residents, there needs to be an element of preparation,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. Betsi Cadwaladr health board said it was working to ensure those with the highest priority are vaccinated. Teresa Owen, the health board's executive director of public health, said: ""Last week we vaccinated nearly 10,000 people in north Wales. ""This week, staff from primary care practices will be going into the local nursing and residential homes to administer the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccination to residents. ""The initial supply of vaccinations to the west of BCUHB has caused some logistical problems with commencing this programme, but vaccines have now been allocated for all the nursing and residential homes in the locality.""

"UAE dropped from UK travel corridor listThe decision follows a rise in cases across the emirates in the past week, officials say.UK","The United Arab Emirates is being removed from the UK list of travel corridors amid a spike in Covid cases. That means anyone who arrives from the UAE after 04:00 GMT on Tuesday now needs to self-isolate for 10 days, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. UK officials say Covid cases have risen 52% in the UAE in the last seven days and cite ""a significant acceleration in the number of imported cases"". It comes after Scotland removed the UAE city Dubai from its safe travel list. The Foreign Office has also updated its advice to advise against all but essential travel to the emirates. The recent lockdown restrictions imposed across the UK mean leisure travel is currently banned. But the UAE has been in particular focus in recent weeks after a number of UKreality TV and social media stars posted photographs of themselves holidayingthere before the rules came into place.

Morrisons and Sainsbury's ban maskless shoppersPeople refusing to wear face coverings who are not medically exempt will not be allowed to shop inside.,"Morrisons will bar customers who refuse to wear face coverings from its shops amid rising coronavirus infections. From Monday, shoppers who refuse to wear face masks offered by staff will not be allowed inside, unless they are medically exempt. Sainsbury's also said it would challenge those not wearing a mask or who were shopping in groups. The announcements come amid concerns that social distancing measures are not being adhered to in supermarkets. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government is ""concerned"" shops are not enforcing rules strictly enough. ""Ultimately, the most important thing to do now is to make sure that actually enforcement - and of course the compliance with the rules - when people are going into supermarkets are being adhered to,"" Mr Zahawi told Sky News. ""We need to make sure people actually wear masks and follow the one-way system,"" he said. What are the lockdown rules across the UK? Supermarket staff: We're lucky if people wear masks Stricter Covid supermarket rules being considered in Wales What are the social distancing rules? Should I wear a face covering in the supermarket? Morrisons said it had ""introduced and consistently maintained thorough and robust safety measures in all our stores"" since the start of the pandemic. But it said: ""From today we are further strengthening our policy on masks."" Security guards at the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain will be enforcing the new rules. Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: ""Those who are offered a face covering and decline to wear one won't be allowed to shop at Morrisons unless they are medically exempt. ""Our store colleagues are working hard to feed you and your family, please be kind."" Following Morrisons' announcement, Sainsbury's said that it was also putting trained security guards at the front of its stores to challenge shoppers who did not comply. Chief executive Simon Roberts said: ""I've spent a lot of time in our stores reviewing the latest situation over the last few days and on behalf of all my colleagues, I am asking our customers to help us keep everyone safe. ""The vast majority of customers are shopping safely, but I have also seen some customers trying to shop without a mask and shopping in larger family groups. ""Please help us to keep all our colleagues and customers safe by always wearing a mask and by shopping alone. Everyone's care and consideration matters now more than ever."" Earlier on Monday, Mr Zahawi stopped short of saying that supermarket staff should be responsible for enforcing rules on face masks. Enforcement of face coverings is the responsibility of the police, not retailers.Wearing face masks in supermarkets and shops is compulsory across the UK. In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines. This video can not be played How to wear your mask. Hint: it's not any of these three options However, retail industry body the British Retail Consortium said that, workers have faced an increase in incidents of violence and abuse when trying to encourage shoppers to put them on. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, added: ""Supermarkets continue to follow all safety guidance and customers should be reassured that supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit during lockdown and beyond. ""Customers should play their part too by following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers."" Under current lockdown restrictions across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people must only leave home for essential reasons, such as buying food or medicine. In a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus, supermarkets introduced social distancing measures during the UK's first nationwide lockdown last March. They included limits on the numbers of customers in the shops at any one time, protective plastic screens at tills and ""marshals"" to ensure shoppers were maintaining a two-metre distance. But amid rising numbers of infections, some have expressed concerns about a ""lack of visible protections"" implemented by supermarkets in recent weeks. The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturdaythat he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown as people were worried the strict enforcement of rules did not ""appear to be there this time"". ""Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,"" he said. Supermarket Waitrose said that it was taking a ""cautious approach"" to the virus, with marshals checking that customers are wearing face coverings on the door, hand sanitiser stations at its entrances and written communications to shoppers reminding them to maintain their distance. Tesco said it was limiting the number of customers in store and was also reminding customers to wear masks. ""We have clear signage explaining this, and we have packs of face coverings available for purchase near the front of our stores for any customers who have forgotten them."" Meanwhile, Asda announced last week,externalthat it would extend its marshals' hours to 08:00 to 20:00 and increase how often baskets and trollies are cleaned. Shop workers' union Usdaw has also called for firms to apply more stringent measures again. The union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said that it had received reports that ""too many customers are not following necessary safety measures like social distancing, wearing a face covering and only shopping for essential items"". ""It is going to take some time to roll out the vaccine and we cannot afford to be complacent in the meantime, particularly with a new strain sweeping the nation,"" Mr Lillis said. The trade union also suggested that ""'one-in one-out"" policies and proper queuing systems should be reintroduced in supermarkets. It added that these systems should be managed by trained security staff where necessary.

"American Football coach snubs presidential medalNew England Patriots coach Bill Belichick turns down Donald trump's offer, citing the Capitol riots.US & Canada","New England Patriots's Bill Belichick is considered one of the most successful coaches in NFL history Top NFL coach Bill Belichick says he will not accept President Donald Trump's offer of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, citing the US Capitol riot. Belichick, of the New England Patriots, said he was flattered when he was first offered the medal - the top award given to civilians in the US. But he said he changed his mind after a mob of Trump supporters stormed Congress last week. Five people died. The celebrated coach had previously spoken of his friendship with Mr Trump. ""Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honour represents and admiration for prior recipients,"" Belichick said in a statement. ""Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award."" Belichick, who has won a record six Super Bowl titles, is considered one of the most successful coaches in NFL history. The Presidential Medal of Freedom recognises individuals who have made outstanding contributions to ""the security or national interests of America"". In 2019Mr Trump gave the award to golfer Tiger Woods, as well as radio personality Rush Limbaugh and posthumously Elvis Presley. This video can not be played Super Bowl: How Tom Brady and Bill Belichick built a New England Patriots dynasty Donald Trump may only have recently made a career of politics, but he's always loved sport. He owns 17 golf courses and once bought and ran the New Jersey Generals of the US Football League. Just last week, he awarded three presidential medals of freedom to professional golfers. This week he was planning to honour the most successful professional football coach in modern times, Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots. The president seems to particularly enjoy the company of sport figures and revel in their achievements and prowess. So for Belichick, a personal friend of the president's, to decline the award is a stinging rebuke. The coach's decision reflects the depth of the political crisis president has created in the past week. It also highlights the troubled relationship Trump has had with the National Football League and its players, who he has disparaged for Black Lives Matter protests during the US national anthem. Belichick, a sometimes bristling, controversial figure with more than a few detractors, is used to public animosity. A coach can't win without the commitment of his players, however, and Belichick clearly believed his relationship with his team would be jeopardised by associating himself with Trump at this point.

""Please help us to keep all our colleagues and customers safe by always wearing a mask and by shopping alone. Everyone's care and consideration matters now more than ever."" Earlier on Monday, Mr Zahawi stopped short of saying that supermarket staff should be responsible for enforcing rules on face masks. Enforcement of face coverings is the responsibility of the police, not retailers.Wearing face masks in supermarkets and shops is compulsory across the UK. In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines.

Hint: it's not any of these three options However, retail industry body the British Retail Consortium said that, workers have faced an increase in incidents of violence and abuse when trying to encourage shoppers to put them on. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, added: ""Supermarkets continue to follow all safety guidance and customers should be reassured that supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit during lockdown and beyond. ""Customers should play their part too by following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers."" Under current lockdown restrictions across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people must only leave home for essential reasons, such as buying food or medicine. In a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus, supermarkets introduced social distancing measures during the UK's first nationwide lockdown last March. They included limits on the numbers of customers in the shops at any one time, protective plastic screens at tills and ""marshals"" to ensure shoppers were maintaining a two-metre distance. But amid rising numbers of infections, some have expressed concerns about a ""lack of visible protections"" implemented by supermarkets in recent weeks. The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturdaythat he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown as people were worried the strict enforcement of rules did not ""appear to be there this time"". ""Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,"" he said. Supermarket Waitrose said that it was taking a ""cautious approach"" to the virus, with marshals checking that customers are wearing face coverings on the door, hand sanitiser stations at its entrances and written communications to shoppers reminding them to maintain their distance. Tesco said it was limiting the number of customers in store and was also reminding customers to wear masks. ""We have clear signage explaining this, and we have packs of face coverings available for purchase near the front of our stores for any customers who have forgotten them."" Meanwhile, Asda announced last week,externalthat it would extend its marshals' hours to 08:00 to 20:00 and increase how often baskets and trollies are cleaned. Shop workers' union Usdaw has also called for firms to apply more stringent measures again. The union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said that it had received reports that ""too many customers are not following necessary safety measures like social distancing, wearing a face covering and only shopping for essential items"". ""It is going to take some time to roll out the vaccine and we cannot afford to be complacent in the meantime, particularly with a new strain sweeping the nation,"" Mr Lillis said. The trade union also suggested that ""'one-in one-out"" policies and proper queuing systems should be reintroduced in supermarkets. It added that these systems should be managed by trained security staff where necessary.

UK at 'worst point' of pandemic despite jab hope,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The bubbles policy will stay"". The UK is at the ""worst point"" of the pandemic, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned, but said the actions of the public ""could make a difference"". At a No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock pleaded with people to follow the government's Covid rules until the vaccine could provide a ""way out"" of the pandemic. The government earlierpublished its plan to immunise,externaltens of millions of people by spring. So far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first Covid vaccine shot. And a total of 2.6 million doses have been given out across the country, with some people having received both doses. Mr Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus was putting the NHS under ""significant pressure"", adding it was ""imperative"" that people limit their social contacts. ""The NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now - and that something is to follow the rules,"" he said. ""I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don't rule out taking further action if it is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a difference."" The health secretary said he could ""rule out"" tightening restrictions by removing support and childcare bubbles, however. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Laura Kuenssberg: What next for Covid rules? Inside a mass vaccination centre PM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home His comments follow similar warnings from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said that the next few weekswill be ""the worst"" of the pandemicfor the NHS. According to the latest figures, there have been another 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, and another 46,169 cases reported. There are also more than 32,000 people in hospital with coronavirus, data shows. Matt Hancock has previously said he's learned to rule nothing out when it comes to dealing with the pandemic. But today he took the unusual step of doing just that. Support bubbles and childcare bubbles, hugely valued by so many, will stay. Senior Whitehall sources have previously told me bubbles were ""untouchable"" but for a minister to say as much, so explicitly and on the record, means there's now very little wriggle room for the government to change its mind. Ministers will know that scrapping bubbles, for those that rely on them, could have proved deeply unpopular. But this certainty is a rarity. Whilst the current emphasis is on compliance, the idea of toughening up controls in other areas is not being ruled out. The vaccine delivery plan says it is expected to take until spring to give a first dose to all 32 million people in the UK's priority groups, including everyone over 55 and those who are clinically vulnerable. Under the plan, the government has pledged to carry out at least two million vaccinations in England per week by the end of January, which it says will be made possible by rolling out jabs at 206 hospital sites, 50 vaccination centres and around 1,200 local vaccination sites. It also reiterates the government's aim of offering vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. According to Mr Hancock, two fifths of over-80s have now received their first dose, and almost a quarter of care home residents have received theirs. Also at the briefing, NHS England's national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said the NHS was aiming to vaccinate the rest of thetop nine priority groupsby April, with a final push to offer all adults over 18 a jab by the autumn. He stressed it would take until February before there were ""early signs"" that vaccination was leading to a drop in hospitalisations. The country has still not seen the full impact of the Christmas loosening of lockdown restrictions, Prof Powis added, although he noted there are now 13,000 more Covid patients in hospital than there were on Christmas Day. Speaking in Bristol earlier, Mr Johnson warned the vaccination programme was in a ""race against time"" because of pressure on the NHS. He said it was ""a very perilous moment because everyone can sense the vaccine is coming in - my worry is that will breed false complacency"". When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Morrisons to ban shoppers who refuse to wear masks The newly-published vaccination plan also says ministers are aiming to offer jabs at more than 2,700 sites across the UK. And it says that daily vaccination figures for England will be published from now on - showing the total number vaccinated to date, including first and second doses. Earlier, NHS England's chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, told MPs that there was a ""strong case"" for asking the the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider prioritising ""teachers and other key workers"" for vaccination after the ""first nine [priority] groups have been vaccinated"". A quarter of coronavirus admissions to hospital are for people under the age of 55, he added. In the first four weeks of the vaccination campaign, the NHS did 1.3 million vaccinations. News that in the past week almost the same again has been done shows progress is being made - even though there has been some concern rollout to care home residents has been slower than hoped. Hitting two million doses a week is the next target - and is something the NHS is aiming to get close to this week. With more vaccination sites opening by the day, it should be achievable as long as there is good supply. There is already enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all 15 million people in the highest at-risk groups that have been promised an offer of a vaccine by mid-February. However, not all of it has been through the final safety checks or been packaged up ready for distribution. Challenges remain, but even at this early stage it is clear there is growing optimism that the programme is on track. Asseven mass vaccination centresopened across England on Monday, NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK. On Friday, a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use,although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. Vaccine programmes are also progressing in the UK's devolved nations. All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid in Wales will be offered a vaccine by spring,under new plans. And Scotland's health secretary has said every aged over 80 or over in the nationwill be offered a jab by February, while care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at homecan now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine. England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar lockdown measuresare in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said: ""I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"".

And England's Test and Trace scheme has revised one of its definitions of a ""close contact"" - the people who need to be reached if they have been near to someone who has tested positive for Covid. This now refers to anyone who has been within two metres of someone for more than 15 minutes, whether in a single period or cumulatively over the course of one day. Previously the definition was just a single period of at least 15 minutes.

Could I be fined?,"The police's role in the coronavirus pandemic is simple: to ensure we follow national lockdown restrictions. But in practice, that is a huge challenge for officers who are being asked to monitor behaviour that, until March last year, was perfectly legal. Police chiefs have followed a system called ""The Four Es"". Before fines are issued to rule-breakers, police will first: Engage with people, to ask why they appear to be breaking the rules Explain the law, stressing the risks to public health and the NHS Encourage them to change their behaviour The fourth ""E"" is ""Enforce"" by issuing penalty notices, as a last resort. Covid rule-breakers are now ""increasingly likely"" to be finedby officers, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said. The police have a legal duty to make sure the rules are enforced, alongside council, environmental health and trading standards officers. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live If you break coronavirus regulations, you could get a fixed penalty notice , the Covid equivalent of a traffic offence like speeding. Since March, 32,000 have been issued in England and Wales. Penalties rose sharply during England's November lockdown. Almost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out as police moved more quickly to enforcement. In England and Northern Ireland fines start at Â£200. Fines start at Â£60in Wales,external, andin Scotland,external, although this is reduced to Â£30 if paid within 28 days. Large parties can also be shut down by the police - with fines of up to Â£10,000. In extreme circumstances, you could be prosecuted and face an even greater fine imposed by a court. Hundreds of people were caught on a drone camera at an illegal party by West Midlands Police Yes. All of England is now in a ""tier four"" national lockdown, with similar measures in place across the rest of the UK. Under the new lockdown law, you must stay at home unless you have a ""reasonable excuse"" to be outside. Your home includes property such as a garden, shed or garage - and also access to it. The government's lockdown guidance sets outexamples of reasonable excuses,external. Police won't fine you for leaving home to go shopping for essential goods, or to use a business that can remain open, or for going to work or education, training or childcare. There are other reasonable excuses - such as helping other people in their moment of need. Police chiefs are telling frontline officers to use their judgement if they come across a situation not defined in the regulations. If you want to take part in a protest, the law does not define that as a reasonable excuse to leave home. There is, however, an exception for joining a picket as part of lawful industrial action. Exercise is one of the reasonable excuses for being outside in a public space. You cannot be fined for exercising. But there has been enormous confusion since last March over how long people could exercise for. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove pronounced that spring that he thought half an hour was enough. There are also questions over how far you can go to exercise. Boris Johnson has beencriticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Streetto go cycling during lockdown. There are no restrictions in law in England on how you exercise and for how long. You cannot exercise in groups, but you can run or go on a wander with someone else from your household, support bubble or one person you don't live with. The government's Covid guidance for exercise explains that law - andmixes it with a non-legal recommendation,externalto only go out once a day - and to stay local. It says local ""means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live"", but that has no legal force. Derbyshire Police have been taking the ""stay local"" principle seriously. Officers have issued tickets to people who drive five miles to their local beauty spot - includingtwo women accused of an illegal picnicbecause they were carrying takeaway cups of tea. They might. This refers to the ban on ""gatherings"". The last-but-one version of the restrictions made it a potential crime to ""mingle"". That language has now gone from the law - but the rules are far stricter. While the law in England doesn't criminalise bumping into someone in the street, you can no longer meet anyone socially - other than those in your household, support bubble or people you care for. The Home Office has given the police an extra Â£30m to pay for Covid patrols in England and Wales. Over Christmas there were more than 800 fines for what Home Secretary Priti Patel says were ""egregious"" breaches of the rules. The National Police Chiefs' Council hasn't abandoned the Four Es - but expect more fines and more officers asking people what they are doing. Leicester woman fined for Wales trip to see horse Group fined for playing dominoes in restaurant Border police patrols to double after travel ban Police patrols were stepped up around the Scotland-England border around Christmas For instance, the Metropolitan Police has told officers to issue fines ""more quickly"" to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches. Derbyshire Police, who famouslyput a drone up over hikersin the first lockdown, has issued a similar warning. Yes - while in shops and on public transport. You could face a fixed penalty notice if you don't. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? If you have returned from an overseas Covid hotspot, or have been told by the NHS Test and Trace system to stay at home, you must quarantine for 10 days. The police can now check the NHS Test and Trace database to investigate a tip-off about a quarantine-breaker. Police won't get to see your personal health records.

Eyesight risk warning from lockdown screen time,"An eye health charity is recommending people learn the ""20-20-20"" rule to protect their sight, as lockdown has increased people's time using screens. Fight for Sight advises looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds, every 20 minutes you look at a screen. Out of 2,000 people, half used screens more since Covid struck and a third (38%) of those believed their eyesight had worsened, a survey suggested. Opticians remain open for those who need them, the charity said. The representative survey of 2,000 adults suggested one in five were less likely to get an eye test now than before the pandemic, for fear of catching or spreading the virus. Respondents reported difficulty reading, as well as headaches and migraines and poorer night vision. The research charity, which commissioned a survey from polling company YouGov, said it wanted to emphasise the importance of having regular eye tests and to remind people ""the majority of opticians are open for appointments throughout lockdown restrictions"". Fight for Sight chief executive Sherine Krause said: ""More than half of all cases of sight loss are avoidable through early detection and prevention methods. Regular eye tests can often detect symptomless sight-threatening conditions."" But even simple screen breaks can help to prevent eye strain, the charity suggested. Government guidance states that under lockdownpeople can leave home for medical appointments,externaland to ""avoid injury, illness or risk of harm"". The College of Optometrists said its members should continue to provide eye care under lockdown for people who experience any eyesight changes or problems. Optometrists are the professionals who will carry out your eye test when you visit an optician's practice. Routine appointments can also be provided ""if capacity permits, and if it is in the patients' best interests"", the guidance states. Screen break advice for children in lockdown Nine ways lockdown is different from last time Clinical adviser Paramdeep Bilkhu said the college's own research suggested just under a quarter of people noticed their vision deteriorate during the first lockdown. ""Our research showed us that many people believe that spending more time in front of screens worsened their vision,"" he said. ""The good news is that this is unlikely to cause any permanent harm to your vision. However, it is very important that if you feel your vision has deteriorated or if you are experiencing any problems with your eyes, such as them becoming red or painful, you contact your local optometrist by telephone or online."" UK health and safety legislation statesemployers must pay for eye tests,externalfor their employees if they have to use a screen for work for more than one hour a day. In the summer, the UK Ophthalmology Alliance and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists calculated that at least10,000 people had missed out on essential eye carein Britain. In the most extreme cases, the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it feared some people were at risk of losing their sight because of a fear of attending hospital during the coronavirus pandemic. A Royal College of Ophthalmologists spokesperson said: ""It is important that people who have found significant changes in their vision seek the advice of an optometrist who will examine, and determine if the changes require further investigation by an ophthalmologist - a medically-trained eye doctor.""

What could be done to tighten lockdown rules?,"England is currently under a third national lockdown, in an attempt to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed by coronavirus cases. But there has been speculation that ministers could be considering tightening restrictions, amid concerns the ""stay-at-home"" message isn't being followed by enough people. At Monday evening's Downing Street briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged people to follow the existing rules but added, ""we won't rule out taking further action if it's needed"". Other ministers have struck a similar tone. But what is the case for more changes? In March, nurseries closed to all but vulnerable children and those whose parents were key workers. But so far this lockdown, early-years provision has remained open in England. Scotland and Northern Ireland have chosen to keep nurseries closed to most children for now. But England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said keeping them open ""would allow people who need to go to work, or need to do particular activities, to do so"". Younger children carry a lower risk of transmission than adolescents, scientists say. Butaccording to Public Health England,external, 10% of coronavirus outbreaks or clusters in educational settings since September have been in early-years provision. England's three main nursery organisations have called on the government to provide clear scientific evidence on the risks to early-years staff now there is a more transmissible variant of Covid-19. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he too would like to hear more from scientists about the risks - and nurseries should ""probably"" close. 'Show us it's safe', say worried nursery staff Going out to exercise once a day is one of the ""reasonable excuses"" for leaving home during lockdown. People can walk, run, cycle or swim with those they live - or are in a support bubble - with. In addition, they can exercise, on their own, with one person, each time, from another household - as long as they stay 2m (6ft) apart. However, Mr Hancock said, ""we've been seeing large groups and that is not acceptable"" and warned that, ""if too many people keep breaking this rule, then we are going to have to look at it"". The rules say exercise should be ""local"" - in the village, town, or part of the city where you live - but do not currently specify how far people can travel. Derbyshire Police recentlyfined two women Â£200 eachfor driving five miles to meet for a walk, saying driving for exercise was ""not in the spirit"" of lockdown. They were told the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed, either, as they were ""classed as a picnic"". The penaltieshave now been withdrawn. Brockwell Park, south London, 9 January 2021 Prof Whitty, meanwhile, has urged people to ""double down"", avoid unnecessary contact and stick to the rules. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live about coffee shops remaining open for takeaways, he advised against meeting up there. ""Really, please don't,"" he said. Face coverings must be worn in almost all public indoor settings - including shops -  unless people are exempt. Premises ""should take reasonable steps to promote compliance with the law"", government guidance says. Last summer, when customer face coverings became law, many supermarketssaid they would not make their staff responsible for enforcing the rules. However, Morrisons has now updated its policy to bar shoppers who refuse to cover their faces, unless they are medically exempt. Sainsbury's says security guards at its stores will challenge customers who do not comply. Tesco, Asda and Waitrosehave followed suitand say they too will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks unless they have an exemption. There have been suggestions face coverings should be required in outdoor public places. However, Sage has previously suggested it would have a ""very low impact"" on community transmission Prof Whitty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the risk posed by joggers, for example, was ""very low"" - but there ""might be some logic"" to people wearing masks in a busy outdoor queue or crowded around a market stall. One change the government has ruled out is to support bubbles - which allow people living alone and single, or new parents to mix with another household of any size, without having to socially distance. At the government briefing, Mr Hancock said: ""I can rule out removing the bubbles."" The official guidance says it's best if a support bubble is formed with a household who live locally. But there is currently no limit to how far people can travel to visit their bubble, meaning they could go from areas with high infection rates to those with lower ones, potentially spreading the virus. When ""bubbling"" was first suggested, in May,Sage rejected it as too dangerous,external, because the reproduction (R) number  - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - was close to one. Currently, the R number in England is between 1.1 and 1.4. Sage says stopping all indoor contact between different households could lower this by as much as 0.2. ""Active contract tracing should be a precondition of introducing bubbling"", Sage added. Unlike in March, places of worship are allowed to open in England, although they are closed in Scotland. They provide spiritual leadership for many and bring communities together - but their ""communal nature"" also makes them ""vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus"", the governmentguidance for England,externalsays. When the latest lockdown was announced, the Archbishop of Canterbury tweeted: ""The government hasn't suspended public worship - but some may feel it better not to attend in person and some parishes are expected to offer online services only for now."" Sage haspreviously suggested,externalplaces of worship pose a high risk to vulnerable groups but closing them would have a low to moderate impact on overall coronavirus transmission.

Pollutants 'have negative effect on male fertility',"A porpoise washed up on a beach in Kent Long-lived banned industrial chemicals may be threatening the fertility of male porpoises living off the UK. Polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs) were phased out decades ago, but can build up in whales, dolphins and porpoises. Scientists say harbour porpoises exposed to PCBs had shrunken testicles, suggesting an effect on sperm count and fertility. They say that while these are preliminary findings, more must be done to clean up the oceans. PCBs have been linked with a number of threats to whales and dolphins, but research has focused on mothers and their young. This video can not be played Lulu the killer whale was one of the most contaminated animals ever recorded (Image: John Bowler/RSPB Scotland) A study led by scientists at the Institute of Zoology at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) found high levels of PCBs were linked to smaller testicles in otherwise healthy animals. They think this could have an impact on sperm count, with obvious implications for reproductive success. ""In porpoises, reduced testes weights have been associated with lower sperm counts so we think that if PCBs are reducing testes weights they may also be reducing sperm counts but we hope to do further research to confirm this,"" said lead researcher Rosie Williams of ZSL. Populations of harbour porpoises around the UK are believed to be stable, though the animals face threats from pollution, accidental fishing and infection. The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals. PCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment. Killer whales, as apex predators, can be exposed to particularly high levels of PCBs A series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity. The chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea. PCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises. One killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded. 'Shocking' pollutant levels in UK whale Although levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely. PCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life. A recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a ""cocktail of pollutants"", which are passed down from mother to calf. 'Toxic chemical cocktail' passed to baby porpoises 'Cocktail of pollutants' found in dolphins Scientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain. In humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality. Strandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast. The deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections. In the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades. The study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility. ""Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,"" said Rosie Williams. Populations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility. ""This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,"" she said. ""That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals."" There are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber. The study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.

FBI warning amid fears of more pro-Trump violence,"Security has been stepped up at the US Capitol following deadly violence last week The FBI has warned of possible armed protests across the US as Trump supporters and far-right groups call for demonstrations before Joe Biden is sworn in as president. There are reports of armed groups planning to gather at all 50 state capitols and in Washington DC in the run-up to his 20 January inauguration. Security will be tight for the event after a pro-Trump mob stormed Congress. House Democrats say a vote to impeach the president will happen on Wednesday. They accuse President Trump of ""incitement of insurrection""and say the vote will be held unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office. There is no sign Mr Pence is prepared to do so. Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden is sworn in What is the 25th Amendment? Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol Mr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris are expected to be sworn in at a ceremony at the Capitol. The Biden team had already urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital because of the Covid-19 pandemic, a call that is now being repeated by local authorities. Security officials have said there will be no repeat of the breach seen on 6 January, when thousands of pro-Trump supporters were able to break into the building where members of Congress were voting to certify the election result. This video can not be played Speaker Nancy Pelosi walks through Capitol riots damage Five people died in the riot, which happened after Mr Trump repeated unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the November vote and encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol. Since then, calls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans. Mr Trump has made no public statements sincehe was banned from several social media platforms - including Twitter- on Friday. He became the third US president to be impeached in December 2019over charges of breaking the law by asking Ukraine to investigate his rival in the presidential election. The Senate cleared him. Tuesday:The House of Representatives will vote on a resolution calling on Vice-President Pence and the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unfit for office and remove him immediately. The resolution is likely to pass as Democrats hold a majority, but Mr Pence has shown no sign he is planning to act Wednesday:Democrats vow to hold a vote on impeachment. As they have a majority, Mr Trump is likely to become the first president to be impeached twice. The single article of impeachment - a formal charge - will then need to be sent to the Senate where a trial will be held but the timeline is not known 20 January:Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are sworn in as president and vice-president Posts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protests on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself. An internal FBI bulletin, reported by ABC News and other outlets,,externalcarries a warning that one group is calling for the ""storming"" of state, local and federal courthouses around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ Although the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were also reported elsewhere in the country. Local police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses, according to US media. FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. Companies and social media networks are cracking down against users and websites seen to be encouraging violence, including social network Parler,which said it was suing Amazon for removing it from its web hosting service. Twitter said it had suspended more than 70,000 accounts that promotedthe Q-Anon conspiracy theorywhile Facebook said it was banning any content that refers to Stop the Steal, a slogan associated with Mr Trump's claim the election was rigged. In other developments: US media report that Mr Trump had a phone call with the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, on Monday. According to CBS and Politico, Mr McCarthy told fellow Republicans that Mr Trump had accepted some responsibility for last week's violence while Axios said Mr Trump claimed the loose-knit left-wing group antifa were involved, although there is no evidence of that Mr Trump is expected to make his first public appearance since the riot on Tuesday, as he travels to Texas to visit a stretch of the border wall with Mexico On Monday, Mr Trump and Mr Pence met for the first time since the riot, which happened as the vice-president was presiding over certification of the election result. No details have been released of the meeting. Mr Pence had refused Mr Trump's call not to certify the result On Monday President Trump declared a state of emergency for Washington DC until 24 January, which enables the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to act to ""avert the threat of a catastrophe"". Chad Wolf, acting head of the DHS, said he had instructed the US Secret Service to begin operations for the inauguration on Wednesday - six days early - ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape"". Later on Monday, Mr Wolf became the third Trump cabinet secretary to step down since the riots, after Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao. He said his departure had been prompted by ""recent events"", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment. This video can not be played ""President Trump could face charges even with a pardon"" - Prof Bruce Ackerman from Yale law school More than 10,000 National Guard troops will be in the capital by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested, Chief of the National Guard Bureau General Daniel Hokanson said. For Mr Trump's inauguration in 2017, about 8,000 National Guard troops were deployed. Meanwhile, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called for more security after what she described as an ""unprecedented terrorist attack"" at the US Capitol last week. Capitol riots: What's happening with arrests? Capitol police officer hailed as a 'hero' The National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid ""credible threats"" of violence, adding it could also temporarily close areas of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. Speaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was ""not afraid"" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears. Biden said on Monday he had spoken to some senators about their moves to impeach Donald Trump After being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. Donald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years to refuse to do so.

Women's lockdown exercise fines dropped,"Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore said their cars were surrounded by police when they arrived at the reservoir Two women who were fined Â£200 each when they drove five miles for a walk have had the penalties withdrawn. Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore were walking at Foremark Reservoir, Derbyshire, when they were ""surrounded"" by officers. At the time Derbyshire Police insisted driving to exercise was ""not in the spirit"" of the most recent lockdown. But new national guidance for police has led the force to quash the fines, and apologise to the women. Chief Constable Rachel Swann said the fines ""have been withdrawn and we have notified the women directly, apologising for any concern caused"". The two friends travelled the short distance to the reservoir from their homes in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, on Wednesday afternoon. They said their cars were ""surrounded"" by police. They were then questioned on why they were there and told the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed as they were ""classed as a picnic"". Covid fine review welcomed by 'intimidated' women Sixty-mile lockdown trip pair rescued from hilltop Could I be fined for breaking lockdown rules? In a statement, the women said: ""This afternoon we both received a phone call from Derbyshire Police. ""After reviewing our case, our fines have been rescinded and we have received an apology on behalf of the constabulary for the treatment we received. ""We welcomed this apology and we are pleased to draw a line under this event."" After the incident gained media attention, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) ""clarified the policing response concerning travel and exercise"". The guidance said: ""The Covid regulations which officers enforce and which enables them to issue FPNs [fixed penalty notices] for breaches, do not restrict the distance travelled for exercise."" This video can not be played Covid: Fined women 'could have been dealt with differently' Derbyshire Police said: ""Having received clarification of the guidance issued by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) on Friday, these FPNs as well as a small number of others issued, were reviewed in line with that latest advice, and so it is right that we have taken this action."" The county's police and crime commissioner Hardyal Dhinsda said: ""While the police are doing their absolute best to protect public safety during what is a critical time of the pandemic, the public should rightly expect a proportionate and balanced approach, taking full consideration of individual circumstances. ""We recognise that errors will occur in the face of complex guidance and legislation and it is important such situations are resolved quickly and fairly, as has been the case here.""

"Retail sales in 2020 worst on record, report says","Retailers suffered their worst annual sales performance on record in 2020, driven by slump in demand for fashion and homeware products, figures show. While food sales growth rose 5.4% on 2019, non-food fell about 5%, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. It meant an overall fall of 0.3% in a year dominated by the Covid-19 impact, the worst annual change since the BRC began collating the figures in 1995. Christmas offered little cheer, with much of the High Street still closed. ""Physical non-food stores, including all of non-essential retail, saw sales drop by a quarter compared with 2019,"" said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive. ""Christmas offered little respite for these retailers, as many shops were forced to shut during the peak trading period,"" she said. The 5.4% rise in food sales was fuelled by shoppers flocking to supermarkets and online grocers to ensure they were stocked up during the pandemic. UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better' 'Worst year for High Street job losses in 25 years' In December, total retail sales increased by 1.8% as shoppers spent more in the run-up to Christmas. Like-for-like sales for the month were up 4.8% as overall shop takings were still affected by restrictions and temporary closures. Online non-food sales jumped by 44.8% in December, according to the new figures, as a higher proportion of shopping took place online. The BRC's sales monitor is collated with the consultancy KPMG, whose UK head of retail, Paul Martin, said: ""In the most important month for the retail industry, there was some positive growth due to the ongoing shift of expenditure from other categories such as travel and leisure. ""Once again we saw big swings in the types of products being purchased and the channels used for shopping, with much of the growth taking place online, where nearly half of all non-food purchases were made."" But he warned that the new lockdown would worsen conditions for many non-essential shops and the High Street generally. Last week, a report from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, the CRR said.
