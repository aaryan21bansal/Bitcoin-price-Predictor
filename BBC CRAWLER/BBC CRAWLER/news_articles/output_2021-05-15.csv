"Vaccine passports inevitable, says airport boss","Coronavirus has led to a 70% fall in passenger numbers at the world's busiest airport for international passengers in Dubai The boss of the world's busiest airport for international passengers has said Covid passports are the only way to restart mass foreign travel. Dubai Airports chief executive Paul Griffiths told the BBC: ""I don't think there is an alternative."" Critics of the digital systems argue they discriminate against those who cannot get vaccinated. But Mr Griffiths says he is a complete supporter of the documents, which he says are ""inevitable"". ""I think the problem is not the vaccine passport and its discrimination. It's the need to roll things out and have a proper globally equitable vaccine programme,"" he said. EU unveils plans for overseas tourists to return 'Two-tier society' warning over Covid passports US rules out coronavirus vaccine passports The World Health Organisation and World Travel & Tourism Council are among those opposed to vaccine passports amid fears they will create a  ""two-tier society"". Last month, Dr Mike Ryan from the WHO repeated concerns about the ethical and fairness issues surrounding vaccine passports. ""They do need to be considered, especially in a world where vaccine is distributed in such a grossly inequitable way,"" he said. Dubai Airports' Paul Griffiths thinks there is no alternative to vaccine passports The aviation industry is desperately looking for ways to pick up speed after the damage wrought by government restrictions and a collapse in passenger confidence. According to the Air Transport Action Group, it was making a $3.5 trillion annual contribution to the global economy before the pandemic. However, with flights grounded, the numbers going through Dubai International Airport have collapsed in a similar way to the rest of the industry. Even so, 2020 was Dubai's seventh year in a row as the world's busiest airport for international passengers,having overtaken London Heathrowin 2014. A record 86.3 million people passed through in 2019, but as the coronavirus pandemic grounded flights, that fell 70% to 25.8 million last year. Coronavirus passports could become as vital as security checks, like these in Dubai, for international travel Mr Griffiths wants that number to rise again: ""We need to get into risk management rather than risk avoidance."" He added: ""I just don't think the world can survive without that mobility for much longer, certainly socially and economically, but you can understand why countries around the world are being very conservative. The last thing any politician wants is a surge of infection on their turf."" Last year, the United Arab Emirates saw its economy contract by 6.1% amid the global slowdown. For Dubai, a Middle Eastern hub which plays a key role in joining East and West, air travel is key to repairing the damage. Mr Griffiths says: ""The city's been  built as a global hub and it's enabled a tremendous commercial and tourism centre to be developed here in the UAE. ""So we are pretty dependent, because at least 35% of GDP is based around the enablement of travel and tourism, so it has a big dramatic effect here."" Dubai International Airport has played a crucial part in the city's economic success but its had to close entire terminals To get through the crisis, the airport has cut costs by closing entire terminals and concourses, which means a bailout from Dubai's government has been avoided. ""We were able to get into a position where we could cover all of our costs with about 20% of our throughput, which is where we are at the moment,"" explains Mr Griffiths. He adds that 8,500 jobs have been reduced to 2,500. ""It's been a lot of pain for a lot of people. But we're well positioned to recover now."" The desire to recover and avoid new outbreaks of coronavirus has led to the emergence of several different Covid travel passes. The European Union, the G20 and International Air Transport Association are all working on schemes. Mr Griffiths says even if multiple systems are introduced for checking passengers, his airport can avoid queues such as those seen at London Heathrow. ""Whatever the system, we will adapt our processes to ensure that our passengers aren't put in huge long queues,"" he adds. Heathrow could divert aircraft to ease crowding Airlines' Covid travel pass ready 'within weeks' This video can not be played Covid-19 passports: What are the issues? Those passengers that are flying are being looked after by ""near-hospital theatre levels of cleanliness"" as well as physical distancing and insistence on mask wearing. Technology is also helping stop the spread of germs, with the acceleration of contactless check-in and immigration arrangements. When it comes to the rules, passengers are ""adhering extremely well, because we make sure they adhere to them"", Mr Griffiths says. ""We've got a very, very close eye on them: 6,000 CCTV cameras watch the passenger flow, because obviously, we've got to keep everything moving, to keep everything safe and secure."" The luggage belts at Dubai International Airport have been quieter after passenger numbers fell 70% If international air travel is to get moving again, ""it's up to the countries to decide what the entry requirements are, and it's up to the airlines and the airports around the world to enforce it"", says Mr Griffiths. ""If this all works, and everyone comes together, vaccine passports will be a very, very simple way of us travelling without documents around the world.""

Santander banking resumes after day of disruption,"For much of Saturday, a technical problem affected Santander's services Santander has said all of its services are now working as normal, after widespread problems left customers unable to access their money. On Saturdaythe bank's online banking and app stopped workingand there were also issues in branches and with cards, cash machines and telephone banking. Customers called it a ""nightmare"", with people unable to pay for petrol to get to work and payments being rejected. The bank apologised and promised ""no one will be out of pocket"". The problems began on Saturday morning and lasted much of the day until about 21:15 BST when Santander tweeted that all of its services were running again as normal. However, some customers repliedto Santander's tweet,externalsaying they were still having problems - including the app still not working, transactions not showing or being unable to use cards online. ""We are very sorry for the inconvenience you've experienced today,"" said the bank, which has 14 million active UK customers. ""If you need help, some of our branches will be open on Sunday from 10am to 12pm. We'll publish a list of these tomorrow."" Earlier, the bank said it will share details on its website and social media channels from Monday about how impacted customers can make a claim. The problems on Saturday left many people stuck in difficulty after they were unable to make payments. One customer, Marcus Evans from Aberdare in south Wales, told the BBC he had lost a day's wages as he could not buy petrol to travel to his job as a CCTV operator. ""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" said the former member of the Armed Forces, who also said he could not do his weekly shop. ""It's ridiculous. ""I get my military pension and my wages paid into a Co-operative savings account and I transfer money on a weekly basis into my Santander account."" Mr Evans said Santander ""should have things in place to ensure that this doesn't happen"" Samantha Stewart said she had travelled all the way from her rural home in Argyll to the mainland to go shopping with her mother, when she realised she could not access her money. ""It wasn't until I was in the first store that I'd tried to log on,"" she said. ""I was wanting to transfer money from savings over to my account because I was planning to do quite a big shop. ""Essentially I was left with Â£27 in my account. I had to decide whether to chance it with Apple Pay, knowing that it would take me into unarranged overdraft, or to go home."" Meanwhile, Stephen Curtis, 58, from Gloucester, said he was ""definitely leaving the bank"" after the problems. He said he was in a car showroom trying to buy a new car when his card was declined. ""It was so embarrassing,"" he said. ""This is unforgivable. I work in IT, I know about systems, I know about backups and upgrades. To have this happen, I would get the sack if it happened in my job."" Another customer, Jason Crossland, from Rotherham, told the BBC he became stuck in an outlet shopping centre with his children, unable to buy enough petrol to get home. The head of money at consumer magazine Which? said the technical issues would have left many customers stressed. ""Customers can incur fines, penalties and fees when they're not able to access their finances, so the bank must offer compensation to all those who have been impacted in this way,"" said Gareth Shaw. On Saturday evening, shortly before the problem was fixed, the UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, said it was aware of the issue and in contact with the firm. It is not yet clear what caused the problem. Planned maintenance had been due to be performed on the Santander mobile banking app overnight on Friday.

Tenth of British restaurants lost during pandemic,"Monday sees another milestone in the reopening of the economy: people in most of the UK will be able to go to a bar or restaurant and eat indoors. But some favourite haunts will no longer be there: over the last year, thousands of establishments have closed, latest surveys indicate. Across Britain, there are 9.7% fewer restaurants to choose from, compared with before the pandemic. And mid-market ""casual dining"" venues have fallen by 19.4%. The data in the latest Market Recovery Monitor from CGA and AlixPartners suggests that while many pubs and bars have also struggled to survive the pandemic, it is restaurants that have fared worst. What are the rules for pubs and restaurants across the UK? That includes places such as Oskar Ali's in Newport in Wales. Oskar and his wife opened Falafilo Island, serving grilled meats and vegetables and falafel, in August 2018. They invested thousands of pounds to set up the business, transforming the dark interior with a cheerful yellow ceiling and tree-patterned walls. ""We had so many lovely customers, but corona just hit us so hard, we had to close,"" Oskar told BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme. They hoped a busy Christmas might save them, but Oskar's wife caught Covid and they had to isolate for two weeks. ""Then it was January and we thought: we should just close,"" he says. ""We couldn't survive, even with the grants they gave."" Oskar, a computer science graduate, now has thousands of pounds of debt and is looking for other work. Oskar and his wife invested thousands of pounds to set up the restaurant CGA and AlixPartners measured the impact of the last 13 months on pubs and restaurants that hold a licence to serve alcohol. Looking at the net number of venues, once all closures and new openings were taken into account, they found pubs across Britain fared slightly better than the restaurant sector. The number of pubs serving food has fallen by 4.2%. Bars and pubs that only serve drinks fell by 5.2%. But on top of the near-20% fall in casual dining outlets, bar-restaurants, which make up a smaller part of the overall dining market, fell by 9.6%. General restaurants, which are the largest dining out category, are down 10.2%. ""The main challenge for restaurants, in comparison to pubs, is that the restaurants all tend to be leased premises - they all have landlords and rent to pay,"" says Graeme Smith, managing director of AlixPartners. ""When their revenues stopped, their rental bills continued to build up, unless they managed to reach an agreement with their landlord. ""Unfortunately, with the burn of costs of rent and other costs of business, for a number of restaurants, that was simply too much to keep going through the period of closure."" And while restaurants that belong to larger chains were sometimes able to fall back on the group financially, or negotiate agreements with landlords across the business, independent operators have found it harder to survive. The restaurant sector was already shrinking before the pandemic, but the net losses between 2017 and 2019 were between 0.9% and 2.2% a year, according to CGA AlixPartners data. Many of those earlier losses were in crowded sectors such as burger bars. But losses over the past year have included businesses with otherwise promising futures. Hendersons, an Edinburgh institution, was an early casualty of the pandemic Hendersons in Edinburgh was founded in the 1960s, and as vegetarian and vegan food became more fashionable, it had expanded to two new sites in the city. Before the pandemic hit, it was trading strongly thanks to loyal customers and Edinburgh's throngs of summer visitors. But it relied completely on in-person footfall, says Janet Home, the third generation of the family to be involved in managing the business. When Covid hit, they tried to adapt, offering veg boxes and dry goods deliveries. ""We didn't have anything set up, the website wasn't set up for online delivery, there were so many processes we needed to go through,"" says Janet. ""With all the competition out there, there was no way we could cover all the running costs of the business."" In July, faced with redundancy payments for 35 staff, they reached breaking point. ""It was a soul-destroying decision the family had to come to, says Janet. ""We knew it was game over."" Janet Home's family faced a ""heart-breaking decision"" last summer Looking back she has no doubt it was the right decision. They would need to run at 60-75% capacity to cover their costs, which is difficult with social distancing rules still in place. ""Even if we were in a position to reopen now, the tourists are going to take time to come back, the offices are not at capacity, [some] students are working from home."" The Local Data Company, which monitors changes to property use across England, Scotland and Wales, says the biggest net losses were in American and Italian restaurants. But some categories saw a net gain in the number of outlets, according to their data, including vegan and Japanese restaurants. Graeme Smith from AlixPartners says he expects the churn to continue in the next few months. There's a ""cliff edge"" at the end of June for many restaurants, he points out, because after that point landlords can demand unpaid rents again, as the rules to support the sector are lifted. That could prompt a new wave of closures as big as the number we've seen already he warns. But pent-up demand could encourage new openings too. ""Landlords will be keen to get new tenants into their sites,"" points out Mr Smith. ""And restaurateurs are naturally optimistic people. When you see a restaurant closed, it doesn't stay closed for long."" Tim Hall is one of the founders of a small sourdough pizza chain, Three Joes - one of the businesses poised to capitalise on a bounce-back in demand. Last year, they bought another small chain, The Stable, taking them from three to 12 sites, mostly in south-western England. ""We're quite nervous about what's going to happen,"" he says. ""We've taken a big risk."" Restaurateurs hope customers will return after a year of restrictions The new restaurants are all either waterside or market-square sites, most with outdoor spaces, that he thinks will appeal to customers post-Covid. Crucially, none rely on ""office block"" trade. ""I don't think overall the trend for people to eat out more is going to be damaged in the medium term,"" he says. ""And in the short term, it will accelerate hugely. ""We're anticipating a summer like no other. Apart from anything else, people are trapped in England, they want to spend their savings and enjoy themselves.""

Priti Patel accused of lobbying for face mask firm,"Priti Patel - pictured here receiving her vaccine on Saturday - is facing questions over a letter she sent Home Secretary Priti Patel has been accused of lobbying a fellow minister on behalf of a healthcare firm trying to get a government contract. In May last year, Ms Patel wrote to Michael Gove expressing disappointment the government had not bought face masks from a company that had links to someone she knew. Labour has called for an investigation, saying she breached ministerial rules. But Ms Patel's spokesman said she acted as she should have. ""The home secretary rightly followed up representations made to her about the vital supply of PPE,"" the spokesman said. ""During a time of national crisis, failure to do so would have been a dereliction of duty."" In recent weeks there have been a series of revelations about PPE deals awarded to those with government connections. What is lobbying? A brief guide What is going on with government Covid contracts? In May 2020, Ms Patel wrote a letter to Mr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, about a company called Pharmaceuticals Direct Ltd that was in talks with the government about an order for face masks. She said the government's ""late stage"" decision not to use the company had caused problems for the firm. ""I would be most grateful if you could review this matter urgently,"" she wrote in the letter to Mr Gove. The contact at Pharmaceuticals Direct Ltd was a man called Samir Jassal, a Conservative activist who Ms Patel knew. According to his LinkedIn, he worked as an adviser to Ms Patel between 2014 and 2015 and on social media describes her as a ""good friend"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock wrote back to Ms Patel to say the masks being offered by the firm were ""not suitable for use in the NHS"". But the company was later awarded a contract in July 2020, worth just under Â£103m, to supply a different type of mask. The letters -which were first reported in the Daily Mail,externaland now seen by the BBC - have come to light as part of a legal challenge by the Good Law Project. PPE fixer who was Tory donor named in admin error Labour called for an investigation, saying there was ""no evidence that the Home Secretary had any interest"" in the PPE deal until contacted by Mr Jassal, suggesting she did it ""as a favour to her friend"". ""This would represent a glaring and flagrant breach of the ministerial code,"" the party said, referring to the set of rules for ministers' conduct. Labour pointed tothis principle in the code:,external""Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise"". Samir Jassal (right), pictured with Boris Johnson in 2019, has campaigned alongside the prime minister The Good Law Project, a campaign group which took the government to court over not publishing PPE contracts, is taking legal action over the Â£103m contract for masks. The government has previously said ministers have no part in deciding who gets contracts. After coronavirus hit the UK, the government struck thousands of deals with private companies, spending billions of pounds of public money in the process. Because it was an emergency, the government was allowed to go directly to preferred suppliers without any competition. But it has led to questions about the way the contracts were chosen. Mr Jassal previously said the company has 20 years' experience in the healthcare sector and it asked to supply PPE via an online government portal. The company, he said, had supplied PPE to various outlets for many years. Pharmaceuticals Direct Limited said: ""The business is proud of its successful track record of procurement and supply to various medical organisations, including supplying NHS bodies. ""As a business that has specialised in the procurement and delivery of healthcare supplies for more than 20 years, PDL was (and is) both equipped and well suited to find solutions to the urgent demands of the pandemic."" The company also said Mr Jassal was not employed by PDL. This article was updated on 18 May after Pharmaceuticals Direct Limited responded with a comment.

Hendersons, an Edinburgh institution, was an early casualty of the pandemic Hendersons in Edinburgh was founded in the 1960s, and as vegetarian and vegan food became more fashionable, it had expanded to two new sites in the city. Before the pandemic hit, it was trading strongly thanks to loyal customers and Edinburgh's throngs of summer visitors. But it relied completely on in-person footfall, says Janet Home, the third generation of the family to be involved in managing the business. When Covid hit, they tried to adapt, offering veg boxes and dry goods deliveries. ""We didn't have anything set up, the website wasn't set up for online delivery, there were so many processes we needed to go through,"" says Janet. ""With all the competition out there, there was no way we could cover all the running costs of the business."" In July, faced with redundancy payments for 35 staff, they reached breaking point. ""It was a soul-destroying decision the family had to come to, says Janet. ""We knew it was game over."" Janet Home's family faced a ""heart-breaking decision"" last summer Looking back she has no doubt it was the right decision. They would need to run at 60-75% capacity to cover their costs, which is difficult with social distancing rules still in place. ""Even if we were in a position to reopen now, the tourists are going to take time to come back, the offices are not at capacity, [some] students are working from home."" The Local Data Company, which monitors changes to property use across England, Scotland and Wales, says the biggest net losses were in American and Italian restaurants. But some categories saw a net gain in the number of outlets, according to their data, including vegan and Japanese restaurants. Graeme Smith from AlixPartners says he expects the churn to continue in the next few months. There's a ""cliff edge"" at the end of June for many restaurants, he points out, because after that point landlords can demand unpaid rents again, as the rules to support the sector are lifted. That could prompt a new wave of closures as big as the number we've seen already he warns. But pent-up demand could encourage new openings too. ""Landlords will be keen to get new tenants into their sites,"" points out Mr Smith. ""And restaurateurs are naturally optimistic people. When you see a restaurant closed, it doesn't stay closed for long."" Tim Hall is one of the founders of a small sourdough pizza chain, Three Joes - one of the businesses poised to capitalise on a bounce-back in demand. Last year, they bought another small chain, The Stable, taking them from three to 12 sites, mostly in south-western England. ""We're quite nervous about what's going to happen,"" he says. ""We've taken a big risk."" Restaurateurs hope customers will return after a year of restrictions The new restaurants are all either waterside or market-square sites, most with outdoor spaces, that he thinks will appeal to customers post-Covid. Crucially, none rely on ""office block"" trade. ""I don't think overall the trend for people to eat out more is going to be damaged in the medium term,"" he says. ""And in the short term, it will accelerate hugely. ""We're anticipating a summer like no other. Apart from anything else, people are trapped in England, they want to spend their savings and enjoy themselves.""

Israelis and Palestinians turn to TikTok,"Young Palestinians and Israelis have been capturing the conflict on smartphones As fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants escalates on the ground, TikTok has become a forum for airing tensions. Once known primarily for viral dance trends, the video app has also become a key platform for sharing news. The Chinese-owned site has a vast, mostly younger audience, with an estimated 700 million active monthly users worldwide. Footage of rocket fire over Israel, destruction in Gaza and Palestinian protests have all gone viral on the site. It has brought the conflict to people's phone screens around the world. But there are also concerns that it and other social media sites are spreading falsehoods or extremism. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Mothers fear for children in Israel-Gaza conflict This week's violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. It came after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem, which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. Even before the latest fighting broke out, tensions between Palestinians and Israelis have played out on TikTok. In April, a video of teenagers in East Jerusalem slapping two Orthodox Jewish boys on public transport went viral on the app.Police arrested two suspects the following week,external. TikTok removed the video for violating its community guidelines shortly afterwards. The Israeli army are fighting Palestinian militants Protest clips also began to appear on TikTok. Users posted videos under the hashtag #SaveSheikhJarrah, in reference to the threatened evictions of Palestinian families in a neighbourhood in East Jerusalem. Such videos are now being viewed and shared around the globe. Chris Stokely-Walker, author of TikTok Boom: China, the US and the Superpower Race for Social Media, told the BBC that TikTok's ease of use and colossal popularity allowed the rapid spread of its content. ""Creating tools for video through the app are so simple that anybody from a 12-year-old to a 90-year-old can actually do it themselves without all that much technical nous,"" he said. ""It's also the size of the audience - we know that TikTok has something like 732 million monthly active users worldwide. So if you're posting something then the likelihood is it will be seen by a lot of people."" Why Jerusalem matters Israel-Palestinians: Old grievances fuel new fighting Users of TikTok - as well as other social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter - are using the #SaveSheikhJarrah hashtag alongside footage of clashes with Israeli security forces, as well as the situation on the ground in Gaza. One video allegedly showing people fleeing Israeli strikes in Gaza, posted under the hashtag by US-based news site Muslim, hasmore than 44 million views on TikTok,external. Another post by TikTok user Sabrina Abukhdeir -with more than 1.5 million views,external- showed crying Palestinian children and the destruction of a high-rise block in Gaza. ""You guys know what to do,"" she wrote, urging people to share the video. Palestinians have come out to protest in the occupied West Bank Supporters of Israel have also posted on TikTok.One video allegedly showing an Israeli soldier shielding a Palestinian woman,externalfrom rocks thrown by Palestinian protesters has been viewed more than 1.5 million times on the app. And the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has a strong presence online. It has 1.3 million followers on Twitter and more than 70,000 on TikTok, where it has been posting videos of its forces in action and scenes from inside Israel. One video asking viewers""What would you do if this was your city?"",externalhas more than 300,000 views on the site. Dr Gabriel Weimann at Haifa University in Israel said there was a battle of ""hearts and minds"" online - and that as of now ""it's not an equal war"". ""From the Israeli side you see a counter flow, which I must say is less powerful, not organised at all, and if you ask me less persuasive,"" he told the BBC. ""Maybe because in Israel nobody thought that TikTok would be a powerful or important platform."" This video can not be played BBC reporters are on the ground in Gaza, Lod and Jerusalem This month a video went viral on both TikTok and Twitter showingJews dancing and cheering while a tree burns,externalin the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem. Social media users claimed they were celebrating the destruction of the mosque. In reality, they were gathered to celebrate Jerusalem Day, and the mosque was not damaged in the fire. Israeli police said it was due to fireworks set off by Palestinian protesters, while demonstrators said it was due to stun grenades used by officers. On Thursday night, Israel's Defence Minister Benny Gantz asked Facebook and TikTok to remove posts from their sites which he said could encourage violence. ""These are measures that will directly prevent the violence that is being intentionally stirred through social media by extremist elements that are seeking to do damage to our country,"" he reportedly said. ""We are in a moment of social emergency, and we expect your assistance."" The executives of both companies promised to ""act quickly and effectively to prevent incitement on their networks"",according to Israel National News,external. ""Our teams have been working swiftly to remove misinformation, attempts to incite violence, and other content that violates our Community Guidelines, and will continue to do so,"" a spokesperson from TikTok told the BBC in an emailed statement.

""A lot of the things we have seen are old media taken out of context,"" she told the BBC. ""[Stories] circulating from a totally different time and a totally different place."" One of the most prominent examples -according to the New York Times,external- was footage shared widely of Palestinians allegedly faking a funeral.The video was viewed hundreds of thousands of times,externalon TikTok and seemed to show a group of people carrying a corpse on their shoulders before dropping it when a siren sounded, and the corpse springing into life and running away. But in fact, the New York Times said, the original video appeared over a year ago on YouTube with a caption saying it was a Jordanian family faking a funeral.

Israel-Gaza conflict rages as US envoy visits,"This video can not be played The Gaza tower block housing news outlets destroyed in an Israeli strike A US envoy has arrived in Tel Aviv for de-escalation talks as unrest between Israel and the Palestinians continues. Hady Amr will take part in talks with Israeli, Palestinian and UN officials and reinforce what US diplomats said was the need for a ""sustainable calm"". An Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip killed 10 people on Saturday, while a Palestinian rocket killed a man in Israel. This week's violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. US President Joe Biden made diplomatic phone calls to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday. The international community has urged both sides to end the escalation. At least 139 people have been killed in Gaza and nine in Israel since this fighting began on Monday. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead in Gaza, while Palestinian health officials say nearly half are women and children. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Follow our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza conflict The flare-up of violence over the last six days came after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem, which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. How did the fighting escalate on Saturday? Thirteen people died in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, with 10 killed by an Israeli air strike at a refugee camp west of Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said. A five-month-old baby is said to be the only survivor of that strike, found trapped in the rubble next to his dead mother. A number of people were also reported missing. A baby survived an Israeli air strike on Saturday in the Gaza Strip Akram Farouq, 36, dashed out of his home in Gaza along with his family after a neighbour told him they had received a call from an Israeli officer warning their building would be hit, Reuters news agency reports. ""We haven't slept all night because of the explosions, and now I am out in the street with my wife and children, who are weeping and trembling,"" he said. Mothers fear for their children Why an Israeli mayor is warning of civil war Israel's Iron Dome missile shield An estimated 10,000 Palestinians have left their homes in Gaza since Monday because of the conflict, according to the UN. Saturday also saw an Israeli air strike destroy a tower block in Gaza housing media organisations. No-one is known to have died in this attack. Israeli officials reported about 200 rocket launches from Gaza overnight, with homes hit in the southern cities of Ashdod, Beersheba and Sderot. A house was damaged by a rocket in the Israeli town of Sderot on Saturday In Beersheba,19 people were taken to hospital after getting slightly hurt,externalwhile running to shelters, and three suffered from shock, The Times of Israel reports. In the afternoon, a rocket hit a street in Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv, killing a man. He was reportedly hit by shrapnel in his apartment. About 2,300 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel since Monday, with about 1,000 intercepted by missile defences and 380 falling short and dropping into Gaza itself, Israel's military says. What is Hamas? What makes Jerusalem so holy? There had been concerns of heightened tensions on Saturday as Palestinians were commemorating what they call al-Nakba, the Catastrophe. It marks the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, who were forced or driven from their homes in the Arab-Israeli war, which began the day after Israel's declaration of independence in 1948. On Saturday afternoon, an Israeli air strike destroyed a high-rise building housing media organisations, including The Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, plus a number of offices and apartments. In a statement released shortly afterwards, the Israeli military said the building housed military assets belonging to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza. The building's landlord has denied this. The remains of the multi-storey Al-Jalaa tower, which was home to various media organisations The Associated Press (AP) said the block was hit roughly an hour after Israeli forces ordered people to evacuate. The news organisation's CEO, Gary Pruitt, said: ""This is an incredibly disturbing development. We narrowly avoided a terrible loss of life. A dozen AP journalists and freelancers were inside the building and thankfully we were able to evacuate them in time."" Mr Amr's arrival comes ahead of a UN Security Council meeting on Sunday. The US embassy in Israel said the aim of his trip was to ""reinforce the need to work toward a sustainable calm"". A major foreign policy headache for Biden Mr Biden's administration has had to rapidly step up its game on the diplomatic front without a full team in place: there is not even a nominee yet for ambassador to Israel. Mr Amr is a mid-level diplomat without the kind of rank held by special envoys in previous US administrations,the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher says. The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

Biden phones Israeli and Palestinian leaders,"This video can not be played Homes and buildings destroyed in Israel and Gaza Israel's military operation against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza will continue ""with full force"", Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said. ""We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore calm... It will take time,"" Mr Netanyahu warned. Gaza officials said 42 people, including 16 women and 10 children, died in the latest Israeli air strikes. Ten people, including two children, have been killed in rocket attacks on Israel since Monday, Israel said. The overall death toll in Gaza now stands at 197 people, including 58 children and 34 women, with 1,235 injured, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Meanwhile, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting, with international mediators hoping to broker a ceasefire. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres opened the meeting by describing the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Rockets launched by Hamas have hit Ashkelon, southern Israel Sunday was thedeadliest day so far The Israeli air strikes hit a busy street in Gaza just after midnight on Sunday, causing at least three buildings to collapse and dozens of deaths. Hamas launched barrage of rockets towards southern Israel overnight and during the afternoon. Millions of Israelis scrambled to safe rooms or shelters as sirens went off. Palestinians also tried to take precautions, but in the densely packed and poorly resourced Gaza Strip, many had nowhere to go. Riyad Eshkuntana told Reuters news agency he put his daughters to sleep in a room of his house that he thought was the furthest from the explosions. Only one of his daughters, Suzy, six, survived the night. His wife and three other children died. ""I ran to check upon the girls,"" said Mr Eshkuntana. ""My wife jumped she hugged the girls to take them out from the room, then a second airstrike hit the room... The ceilings were destroyed and I was under the rubble."" The Israeli military later said it had been conducted a strikes on a militant tunnel system in the area. The tunnels' collapsed caused the houses above to collapse as well, leading to unintended civilian casualties, it said. Suzy, six, was rescued from rubble in Gaza City on Sunday, but five members of her family died Israel's military says it has been targeting leaders and infrastructure linked to Hamas. It said it had also struck the homes of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his brother Muhammad Sinwar, whom it described as head of logistics and manpower for the movement. It was unlikely they were at home at the time of the strikes, according to the Associated Press news agency. Gazan rescue workers spent the day trying to rescue people from under the debris from the strikes. The Palestinian health ministry said a doctor was among the dead: Dr Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, head of internal medicine at Shifa hospital and part of the coronavirus team. What is Hamas? How Israel's Iron Dome missile shield works Boris Johnson condemns 'shameful' anti-Semitism in video In Israel, Hamas rockets hit Ashkelon, Ashdod, Netivot and other parts of central and southern Israel. There were no reports of casualties. The Israeli military said it had seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the past week. The country's Iron Dome defence systemhas intercepted many of them. But some caused damage to cars and buildings, including the Yad Michael synagogue in Ashkelon, where a hole was blasted through the wall just before an evening service for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. No-one was reported hurt and locals moved quickly to clear up the damage so the service could go ahead, according to the Times of Israel. Israelis clean up a rocket-damaged synagogue in Ashkelon A car-ramming incident also took place in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem on Sunday evening. An Israeli police spokesman said the driver had been shot dead and four Israeli officers injured. The threat to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah to make way for Israeli settlers sparked the current round of violence between Israel and the Palestinians. Those tensions culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews, and, on Monday, Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. By Paul Adams, BBCdiplomaticcorrespondent Is Israel's military operation in Gaza, dubbed ""Guardian of the Walls"", nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks are continuing with ""full force"" and will ""take time"". In a news conference on Sunday, he admitted there were ""pressures"" but thanked US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Biden's envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, such as Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israel's estimation, we have not reached that point yet. What happenedduringthe UN meeting? The 15-member UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a public statement in recent days and none was forthcoming after the meeting. The United States - a strong ally of Israel - is said to be the hold-out, believing it would be unhelpful in the diplomatic process. In Sunday's meeting, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the US was ready to offer support ""should the parties seek a ceasefire"" and had been working tirelessly to try to bring an end to the conflict. Palestinian Foreign Minister, Riyad al-Maliki, spoke of Saturday's attack on a refugee camp, which killed 10 members of the same family, leaving a five-month-old survivor to be pulled from the rubble. ""Israel often asks us to put ourselves in their shoes,"" he said, ""but they are not wearing shoes. They're wearing military boots."" In response, Israel's Permanent Representative, Gilad Erdan, cited the death of a 10-year-old Arab-Israeli girl, killed by a Hamas rocket. He insisted Israel was mounting what he called ""a heroic effort"" to ""dismantle terrorist infrastructure and avoid civilian casualties"". Mr Erdan ended by urging the Security Council to unequivocally condemn Hamas but warned that Israel would take all steps necessary to protect itself. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

Santander services recovering after online issues,"Santander has said ""key services are recovering"" following customers' problems accessing accounts online and withdrawing cash from its ATMs. The bank, which has 14 million active UK customers, said earlier that the problems affected branch, telephone, online, app and card services. In an updated statement, the bank said it was working on a ""full recovery by the end of the day"". It apologised and insisted: ""No-one will be out of pocket."" From Monday, the bank said it will post details on its website and social media channels about how impacted customers can make a claim. One customer told the BBC he had lost a day's wages because he could not buy petrol to travel to his job as a CCTV operator. ""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" said Marcus Evans, from Aberdare in south Wales. ""Nothing is working. It's ridiculous. ""I get my military pension and my wages paid into a Co-operative savings account and I transfer money on a weekly basis into my Santander account. ""I transferred money this morning. It's left my Co-op account but it hasn't arrived in my Santander account. ""We're left with very little food. It's disgusting. They need to compensate customers for this."" Another customer, Stephen Curtis, 58, from Gloucester, said he was trying to buy a new car when his card was rejected despite having enough funds in his account. ""It was so embarrassing,"" he said. ""This is unforgivable. I work in IT, I know about systems, I know about backups and upgrades. To have this happen, I would get the sack if it happened in my job. ""I'm definitely leaving the bank, and my wife's with the bank as well. We're on a tight schedule anyway, we're going on holiday Monday and we need the car for the holiday."" A third customer, Jason Crossland, from Rotherham, told the BBC he was stuck in an outlet shopping centre with his children, unable to buy enough petrol to get home. ""I'm just trying to keep the kids occupied and my mother's having to drive from Rotherham about 40 miles away, he said. ""I've been online - nothing. I can't get anything. ""I've been having issues as soon as I started trying to use the card about 10.15."" The head of money at consumer magazine Which? said many customers will be stressed, ""with people reporting that they have been unable to make online payments or in some cases purchase food in their local supermarket"". ""Customers can incur fines, penalties and fees when they're not able to access their finances, so the bank must offer compensation to all those who have been impacted in this way,"" added Gareth Shaw. The UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, said it was ""aware of the issue and in contact with the firm to ensure it resolves it as soon as possible"". Earlier, Santanderapologised on Twitter,externalthat a ""technical problem"" was affecting services and told customers they could ""access cash from other banks' ATMs, at the Post Office and can get cashback where that's available"". A service status pageon its website,externalhad said planned maintenance was due to be performed on the Santander mobile banking app overnight on Friday. It is not known whether this prompted Saturday's problems.

Call for debate on how to care for an ageing WalesA charity says urgent reform is needed to stop people going without support.Wales,"The rules on how much people pay for social care vary around the UK Wales needs a national debate on how to fund the future of social care, according to the head of the country's biggest charity for older people. Victoria Lloyd, chief executive of Age Cymru, said urgent reform of the social care system was essential to prevent people going without support. First Minister Mark Drakeford said there would be announcements on social care in the coming months. Although devolved, he said he intended to work on a four-nation approach. ""If this is a can the UK government continue to kick even further down the road, then the point will come when we will have to make our own decisions,"" he said. Welsh Labour promised in its manifesto for last week's Senedd election it would ""consult on a potential Wales-only solution"" if the UK government did not bring forward proposals within the current parliament. Wales 'ready to go' alone on social care reform Social care needs urgent transformation, PM told Tuesday's Queen's Speech made only passing reference to reforming social care, but the Secretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart, since said plans would be forthcoming ""within months"". Ms Lloyd said the commitment was welcome but action to properly fund the system - and a discussion on how to do so - was needed now. Victoria Lloyd says a debate is needed in Wales ""We know we've got an ageing population, we know there are people that need care out there that currently aren't receiving it,"" she said. ""We need more funding in the system. ""There are many ways of doing that and I think what we need is a big debate in Wales about how we best do that fairly, transparently and to meet the needs of all of us. ""We think it's really important that the Welsh government acts as soon as they are able."" This video can not be played ""It's worse now than in the first wave"" The Welsh government has made a number of reforms to social care in recent years, but has said a more wholesale solution to funding was a priority. The amount somebody can be asked to pay privately for care in Wales is capped at Â£100 a week, while in England there is currently no limit in place Domestic care recipients in Wales with savings or assets worth up to Â£24,000, or those in residential care with up to Â£50,000, are entitled to the maximum amount of local authority funding In England, those with more than Â£14,250 are required to contribute Speaking before the election, Mr Drakeford said his government had its own plan ""ready to go"" on social care, but said the integration of the benefits system was problematic. He told Politics Wales he would not give ""just an arbitrary month"" in terms of how long he was prepared to wait for the UK government to act. Economist SiÃ´n Jones says all options are difficult from a political perspective The Welsh government has also previously pledged to ensure care workers receive at least the real living wage, Â£9.50 per hour, by the end of this Senedd term in 2026. In the 2019-20 financial year, local authorities in Wales spent more than Â£653m on care for people over the age of 65. In the same year, the overall council spending on social services exceeded Â£2bn for the first time. Starmer: Lack of social care plan 'unforgivable' Call for tax increase to fund social care A study carried out in 2017 estimated the amount paid out privately for care in Wales at more than Â£400m. SiÃ´n Jones, an economist who has researched social care funding options for the Welsh government, said wholesale reform was feasible, but costly. ""In the absence of any more money coming via the Barnett Formula to Wales [the mechanism by which UK government spending is allocated to the devolved nations], their main options are to switch expenditure from other parts of the Welsh budget, which is certainly possible, but difficult. ""It might be quite likely that if there was a shift in spending from somewhere else, it may well need to come from the health service,"" he said. This video can not be played The Labour leader says it is 657 days since the PM announced he had a ""clear plan we have prepared"" to ""fix"" social care ""We know there's always pressure for more expenditure in the health sector and there's currently pressure to pay health workers more, as well as care workers. ""Another option could be to raise general tax revenue through an increase in the Welsh income tax, which is possible, but obviously has political difficulties. ""The third option is to introduce some kind of specific tax or levy, that would raise funds specifically for care services. ""They're all feasible in principle, and they're all difficult from a political perspective"".

Thousands protest in London over Gaza violence,"People expressing support for the Palestinians marched through Hyde Park towards the Israeli embassy Thousands of people have marched through central London in support of the Palestinians amid ongoing fighting between Israel and militants in Gaza. The organisers of the protest called on the UK government to stop allowing what they described as ""Israel's brutal violence against and oppression of the Palestinian people"". Demonstrators marched to the Israeli embassy chanting ""free Palestine"". It comes after theworst week of violence in Gaza and Israelsince 2014. At least 139 people have been killed in Gaza and nine in Israel since the fighting began on Monday. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead in Gaza, while Palestinian health officials say nearly half are women and children. It came after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas - the militant Islamist group which rules Gaza - began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. On Saturday, an Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in Gaza killed 10 people, while a Palestinian rocket killed a man in Israel. A separateIsraeli strike destroyed a high-rise building housing media organisations, including The Associated Press and Al Jazeera, plus a number of offices and apartments. The Israeli military said the building housed military assets belonging to Hamas. The demonstration in London has been organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Friends of Al-Aqsa, Palestinian Forum in Britain, Stop The War Coalition, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Muslim Association of Britain. A spokesperson for the organisers said: ""It is vital that the UK government takes immediate action. ""It must stop allowing Israel's brutal violence against and oppression of the Palestinian people to go unpunished."" They said the bombardment of Gaza ""which is killing civilians including children is a war crime"", adding: ""The UK government is complicit in these acts as long as it continues to offer Israel military, diplomatic and financial support."" James Waterhouse, BBC News reporter From the outset, it has been clear how high passions are running among the thousands who have turned out in central London. A river of protesters flows along Hyde Park towards the Israeli embassy in Kensington. Every once in a while, a red or green smoke flare is set off, which is met with cheers and waving Palestinian flags which match the colours. Their intended destination is sealed off down a private road, but that does not stop people chanting ""free Palestine"" and a minority climb scaffolding on Kensington High Street. They essentially want Israel to stop air strikes and for the UK government to step in. But as US negotiators call on both sides to calm things, few here think it will be resolved any time soon. Addressing the crowds at the rally, Husam Zumlot, Palestinian ambassador to the UK, said: ""This time is different. This time we will not be denied any more. We are united. We have had enough of oppression. ""Today we are saying enough, enough with the complicity. Thank you for standing with us."" Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott also spoke to those gathered outside the embassy. Ms Abbott said: ""We must remember we are part of an international movement. This is a worldwide movement for justice. ""Palestinian people are having their land seized... and they are now being killed in their homes. All of this is illegal."" The Twitter account of Israel's embassy in the UK posted a tweet that read:,external""Hamas couldn't care less about the lives of Palestinians, in its desperate attempt to terrorize and kill Israelis."" In a BBC interview, the former Israeli ambassador to the UK, Mark Regev, defended Israel's actions in Gaza. ""I don't want to see any innocent bystanders hurt, let alone children. I don't want to see Israeli children or Palestinian children caught up in the crossfire,"" he said. ""But Hamas says Israel has no right to exist. So, we're only talking about deterrence, about strength, about them understanding that it's not in their interest to shoot rockets into Israel,"" he added. ""And we want to come out of this conflict with them understanding that clearly, and then have a sustained period of quiet. Ultimately, that's good for Israelis, and that's good for the residents of Gaza, too."" A Foreign Office spokeswoman said the ongoing violence was ""deeply concerning and must end"". ""There is never any justification for targeting innocent civilians. Both sides need to de-escalate and offer hope to their peoples, which can only come through political dialogue."" The Metropolitan Police said a small minority of protesters had thrown objects of police, and warned that enforcement action ""will be taken where necessary against those who breach Covid regulations"". There have also been pro-Palestinian demonstrations in several other European capitals. In Paris, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse a rally held despite a ban by authorities.

Well be back soon, but in the meantime,read up on how restrictions will ease in large parts of the UK from Monday. Home Secretary Priti Patel joined the 32 million other people in the UK who have had their first vaccine dose In the UK:  Around the world: France has given a
first vaccine dose to more than 20 million people, President Emmanuel
Macron has said. The French
government had set itself a target to give a first injection to 20 million people by mid-May, after a slow start to its campaign. Macron announced
the milestonein a tweet,external- the number represents around 30% of the population. The government is
aiming to have 30 million first doses administered by 15 June, when Macron has
said all adults will be able to sign up for a jab, which is currently reserved for
priority groups and adults over 50. It comes ahead of the government beginning to lift a nationwide lockdown on Wednesday. Museums, theatres, cinemas and concert halls will reopen with limited capacity
after six weeks of closure to halt Covid cases, while non-essential shops will also reopen and outdoor seating at cafes and
restaurants will be allowed for the first time since 30 October. Earlier, we brought youthe UK government's coronavirus figures.,externalLooking at the data in more detail, it shows that the number of Covid patients in hospital has dropped below 1,000 for the first time in eight months. The most recent figures show there are 991 patients in hospital - down from almost 40,000 at the peak in January. Rangers fans celebrate in George Square in Glasgow Rangers football fans have gathered in the centre of Glasgow after their club lifted their first
Scottish Premiership trophy in a decade.
The celebrations come despitewarnings from police against gatherings due to rising Covid-19 cases in Glasgow. Supporters started gathering outside Ibrox Stadium four hours ahead of the final league game of the season. Fans clambered onto the gates outside the stadium after the final whistle. After
the trophy was lifted, large numbers of fans then marched towards Glasgow city centre to continue unofficial celebrations in George Square. Glasgow remains in level 3 of Covid lockdown restrictions, with large gatherings outdoors not permitted. The issue of PPE, in Spring 2020, was a particular flashpoint, according to Dr Banfield Doctors in Wales have faced bullying and disciplinary action for raising concerns over working conditions and safety, a union leader has said. Dr Phil Banfield, of BMA Wales, said doctors who complained about work, both before and during the Covid pandemic, were seen as ""troublemakers"". Doctors who wished to go to tribunal were advised that they would win their case, but would never work in Wales again, he said. And there were concerns bullying among staff will only get worse as as Wales moves out of the pandemic and post-Covid waiting lists are tackled. ""The risk is, as the health service comes under pressure to get through the backlog, that bullying will become more prevalent and we've got some evidence of that already,"" he said. The Welsh government said bullying of NHS staff was ""entirely unacceptable"". Read more. Falling Covid cases have allowed for restrictions to loosen in the Lazio region of Italy. And despite a windy day, many locals spent the morning sunbathing at Ostia beach near Rome. Others played beach tennis and football, soaking up the sun after months spent in lockdown. Travel between Italy and much the rest of the world has been severely restricted for months as the government tried to curb Covid infections. But yesterday Italy scrapped mandatory quarantine for visitors from the European Union, Britain and Israel who have proof of a recent negative test. Italy's currently on the UK's amber list. Find out what that meanshere. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Rehearsals have been taking place at the Rotterdam Ahoy arena A member of the
Polish delegation at the Eurovision Song Contest has tested positive for
Covid-19. It is the first case of the virus to be detected among the teams
competing in Rotterdam, where the final takes place next Saturday. The person who tested positive has gone into isolation,
and the rest of the team will take PCR tests and enter a few days of
precautionary quarantine. Rafal is the artist representing Poland this year. He rehearsed his entry, The Ride, on stage inside the
Rotterdam Ahoy two days ago - that was the last time the Polish delegates set
foot inside the venue, at which point they were all in possession of a negative
test. Every one of the 39 acts competing has a back up recording in case
they're unable to perform on the night. Holding a singing contest in the midst
of a global pandemic was always going to be risky. This first positive test is
a reminder, Eurovision is not immune. A further seven people have died in UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus,according to the latest government figures.,external It brings the total number deaths by this measure to 127,675. Another 2,027 people have tested positive. Meanwhile, a further 379,111 people have had their second dose of a vaccine, bringing the total to almost 20 million - precisely 19,698,121. And 204,912 more people have had their first jab, taking the total to 36,320,867.

Scarborough is one of the most popular resorts in North Yorkshire Hotels, restaurants and visitor attractions are ""raring to go"" as England prepares for the return of indoor socialising on Monday. John Senior, who chairs South Bay Traders' Association in Scarborough, said there was an appetite for the ""familiarity"" of coastal English resorts with their pubs, cafes and family attractions. He said businesses in the popular resorts of Scarborough, Whitby and Filey had worked hard to make sure they were Covid-safe and were looking forward to welcoming back customers. Many businesses have reported high numbers of advance bookings. ""Forward bookings are just phenomenal, absolutely phenomenal, we are holding 68% occupancy for this financial year, which we have never had in eight years of having the business,"" said Simon Boyle, owner of the Number 21 guest house in York. ""I can't put it into words how excited we are, we can't wait for people to come back into the house, make it feel alive again."" Read more. People queuing to get vaccinated at Essa Academy in Bolton today Bolton councillor Andy Morgan has urged locals to take up the opportunity to get vaccinated today. The vaccine bus, currently parked at the Essa Academy in the Great Lever area of Bolton, is carrying 4,000 Pfizer vaccines which ""must be used today"", Mr Morgan tweeted. The vaccine bus is a key component in the accelerated rollout of vaccines in Bolton where cases of the Indian variant have been rising quickly. Other mobile testing units have been set up in the town and vaccination centres are extending their opening hours as part of a push to stop the spread of the variant. A rapid response team of 100 nurses, public health advisers and environmental health officers has also been sent in. Speaking earlier this morning, Dr Helen Wall - who is leading the vaccination effort in Bolton - said 10,000 people eligible for jabs had yet to be vaccinated in the BL4 and BL5 postcode areas.

Oliver Dowden attended a semi-final match of the World Snooker Championships as part of a government pilot on mass events Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has warned the live events industry that the UK is entering a ""period of heightened vigilance"" due to the spread of the Indian coronavirus variant. Hesaid on Twitter,externalthat he understood ""this is an anxious time as we assess the situation over the next couple of weeks"". Organisations would continue to be updated, he said, to allow ""everyone to plan their full reopening"". From Monday, limited audiences will be allowed back into theatres, music venues and sports stadiums in England. And from 21 June, the government's plan says social distancing will end and many venues able to stage shows to a full house for the first time since the start of the pandemic. (But in case you missed it, last nightthe prime minister saidthe Indian variant could pose ""serious disruption"" to that plan.) Runners took part in a reunion 5K at Surrey's Kempton Park on Saturday - the only running event in the government's Events Research Programme. That programme is piloting a series of events to see how mass gatherings might work in the future. The Reunion 5K will help provide scientific data on Covid-19 transmission levels, with both socially-distanced and non-socially-distanced runs being trialled. Approximately 1,000 socially-distanced runners took part in the first race, watched by socially-distanced spectators - but in the second race there was no social distancing among the 1,000 runners, nor were the spectators asked to stand apart. All those in attendance had to provide evidence of a negative lateral flow test and were asked to take a PCR test both on Saturday and five days later. Organiser Hugh Brasher, who took part in the non-socially-distanced 5K, said he was surprised at ""how normal it felt"". ""I thought it would feel different and it didn't - and it was lovely to be able to do it and get inspired to run faster than I've run in quite a number of years."" Sports Minister Nigel Huddlestone was it was ""fantastic"" to see so many people involved, adding that the data would be ""essential"" for the return of events such as the London Marathon.  Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News This video can not be played Star Gemma Arterton excited at theatres reopening If a playwright had written the pandemic, a theatre critic might have struggled to pin down its genre - tragedy, thriller, depressing kitchen sink drama or farce? Just as you think you're finally getting to the happy ending, the suspense, tension and terror begin to build again. In the real-world theatre industry, venue bosses have had to decide whether to open from Monday, when capacities will be restricted to 50%, up to a maximum of 1,000 people. Many have chosen to wait until 21 June, when they will be able to play to packed houses. But new Covid variants have thrown that date - our appointment to get back to ""normal"" in many aspects of life - into doubt. We are on the edges of our seats. So what will the industry do - and which shows will actually open? Keep readinghere. Two-thirds of adults in Scotland have had their first dose of coronavirus vaccine, figures show. More than three million people have now been given their first jab, while nearly 1.6 million are fully vaccinated. Scotland is on course to offer all adults a first vaccine by the end of July, if supplies are maintained. Currently adults aged 40 and over are eligible, with appointments being scheduled for people in their 30s. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said the three million milestone reflected the ""enormous efforts"" of vaccination teams. ""The vaccination programme is one of the main ways - along with restrictions and testing - that we are working to beat this virus and so it is crucial that everyone attends for their appointments when they are offered,"" he said.  Some 21,000 football fans will be in attendance at today's FA Cup final between Leicester and Chelsea at Wembley. The match, which kicks off at 17:15 BST, will see the biggest crowd so far as part of the series of government pilots aimed at safely allowing the return of mass events. Leicester and Chelsea have been allocated 6,250 tickets each - and  the rest of the crowd will be made up of local residents, key workers, stadium guests and FA stakeholders. All fans attending are required to take a lateral flow test. Among those who have managed to secure tickets to the match will be 87-year-old Bernie Henson who witnessed the club's last FA Cup final outing - 52 years ago. Read morehere. There'll be no more soggy chips as restaurants can serve customers indoors in England from Monday Here is a little more from the British Medical Association, which has raised serious concerns about the decision to press ahead with the easing of lockdown restrictions in England on Monday, as the Indian variant of coronavirus continues to spread. The BMA, which represents doctors in the UK, says the relaxation of rules is a ""real worry"" when ""key segments"" of the population still haven't been vaccinated. Dr Richard Jarvis, BMA public health medicine committee co-chairman, says the government must monitor the situation with ""extreme vigilance"" and be willing to ""apply the brakes"" if necessary. Last night,the prime minister saidhe didn't think the ""present evidence"" showed a need to delay the next step of easing lockdown. Dr Jarvis said that while the public and businesses could take precautions it was the government ""which is steering the ship and must stand by its cautious approach"". ""To ensure we do not undo all the hard work and sacrifice of the previous lockdown, the government must continue to monitor the situation with extreme vigilance and have the willingness to act quickly and apply the brakes if needed to prevent the situation getting out of control for a third time."" Home Secretary Priti Patel has had her first dose of the Moderna vaccine this morning at Guy's Hospital in central London. She joins more than 36 million people in the UK who have had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. First jabs are now being offered to people below the age of 50. Those aged 38 and above in England, over 30s in Northern Ireland, those aged 40 and above in Scotland and the over 40s in Wales are all being invited to book appointments. First jabs were offered to everyone over 50, and those in high risk categories, by 15 April - these groups account for 99% of coronavirus deaths so far. Read more:When might I get my first dose? A London Underground line which has been entirely shut since the start of the pandemic is to reopen in June, transport bosses have announced. The Waterloo and City Line, linking Waterloo Station to Bank, stopped running in March last yearas part of efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19. Trains on the popular commuter line will begin running again on 21 June, with services on weekdays during the morning and evening peak hours. The restarting of the line coincides with the day the government had aimed to remove all legal limits on social contact, although the prime minister has warnedeasing could be delayed due to the threat of the Indian virus variant. Transport for London also said bus capacity will increase from Monday, with nearly all seats except those that are rear-facing being made available for use. Read morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

NI Executive urged to rethink new travel rules,"The Common Travel Area consists of the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man Tourism bodies have urged Stormont to rethink guidance on visitors arriving from the Common Travel Area (CTA). People visiting friends and family in Northern Ireland from GB, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands or Isle of Man will be exempt from a requirement to self-isolate from 24 May. New guidance states those exempt from self-isolation must take Covid-19 tests before departure and on later dates. The Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance described this as ""unmanageable"". What you need to know about NI's lockdown easing What are NI's Covid travel rules? Previously, Stormont ministers had only advised that people could travel from Northern Ireland to the CTA for essential reasons. On Thursday, the executive announcedrelaxations to this rule, but introduced certain requirements for travellers arriving into Northern Ireland. The new guidance sets out that anyone exempt from self-isolation will be asked to take lateral flow tests for Covid-19 pre-departure, as well as on days two and eight post-arrival into Northern Ireland. All other visitors will be required to self-isolate on arrival for 10 days. Both the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance and the Travel Association (ABTA) have raised concerns over the new rules. Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance chief executive Joanne Stuart said it ""remained unclear how the controls would be managed and by whom"". She described the testing requirements as ""complicated and confusing"" and said they would have the potential to put off visitors from coming. Previously, Stormont had only advised that people could travel from Northern Ireland to the CTA for ""essential"" reasons ""What people desperately want after months of uncertainty is confidence and clarity and this latest updated guidance does nothing to provide any of that,"" Ms Stuart said. She added that it would also ""shut down plans to promote Northern Ireland as a visitor destination"" for travellers in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Chief executive of ABTA, Mark Tanzer, believes Northern Ireland should follow England, Scotland and Wales inpublishing a green list of destinationswhere holidaymakers can return from without having to self-isolate. Mr Tanzer said the executive must also ""continue to provide financial support through to recovery"". Members of the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance have requested urgent meetings with representatives from the Northern Ireland Executive Office, Department for the Economy and Department of Health to press for change.

Call for debate on how to care for an ageing Wales,"The rules on how much people pay for social care vary around the UK Wales needs a national debate on how to fund the future of social care, according to the head of the country's biggest charity for older people. Victoria Lloyd, chief executive of Age Cymru, said urgent reform of the social care system was essential to prevent people going without support. First Minister Mark Drakeford said there would be announcements on social care in the coming months. Although devolved, he said he intended to work on a four-nation approach. ""If this is a can the UK government continue to kick even further down the road, then the point will come when we will have to make our own decisions,"" he said. Welsh Labour promised in its manifesto for last week's Senedd election it would ""consult on a potential Wales-only solution"" if the UK government did not bring forward proposals within the current parliament. Wales 'ready to go' alone on social care reform Social care needs urgent transformation, PM told Tuesday's Queen's Speech made only passing reference to reforming social care, but the Secretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart, since said plans would be forthcoming ""within months"". Ms Lloyd said the commitment was welcome but action to properly fund the system - and a discussion on how to do so - was needed now. Victoria Lloyd says a debate is needed in Wales ""We know we've got an ageing population, we know there are people that need care out there that currently aren't receiving it,"" she said. ""We need more funding in the system. ""There are many ways of doing that and I think what we need is a big debate in Wales about how we best do that fairly, transparently and to meet the needs of all of us. ""We think it's really important that the Welsh government acts as soon as they are able."" This video can not be played ""It's worse now than in the first wave"" The Welsh government has made a number of reforms to social care in recent years, but has said a more wholesale solution to funding was a priority. The amount somebody can be asked to pay privately for care in Wales is capped at Â£100 a week, while in England there is currently no limit in place Domestic care recipients in Wales with savings or assets worth up to Â£24,000, or those in residential care with up to Â£50,000, are entitled to the maximum amount of local authority funding In England, those with more than Â£14,250 are required to contribute Speaking before the election, Mr Drakeford said his government had its own plan ""ready to go"" on social care, but said the integration of the benefits system was problematic. He told Politics Wales he would not give ""just an arbitrary month"" in terms of how long he was prepared to wait for the UK government to act. Economist SiÃ´n Jones says all options are difficult from a political perspective The Welsh government has also previously pledged to ensure care workers receive at least the real living wage, Â£9.50 per hour, by the end of this Senedd term in 2026. In the 2019-20 financial year, local authorities in Wales spent more than Â£653m on care for people over the age of 65. In the same year, the overall council spending on social services exceeded Â£2bn for the first time. Starmer: Lack of social care plan 'unforgivable' Call for tax increase to fund social care A study carried out in 2017 estimated the amount paid out privately for care in Wales at more than Â£400m. SiÃ´n Jones, an economist who has researched social care funding options for the Welsh government, said wholesale reform was feasible, but costly. ""In the absence of any more money coming via the Barnett Formula to Wales [the mechanism by which UK government spending is allocated to the devolved nations], their main options are to switch expenditure from other parts of the Welsh budget, which is certainly possible, but difficult. ""It might be quite likely that if there was a shift in spending from somewhere else, it may well need to come from the health service,"" he said. This video can not be played The Labour leader says it is 657 days since the PM announced he had a ""clear plan we have prepared"" to ""fix"" social care ""We know there's always pressure for more expenditure in the health sector and there's currently pressure to pay health workers more, as well as care workers. ""Another option could be to raise general tax revenue through an increase in the Welsh income tax, which is possible, but obviously has political difficulties. ""The third option is to introduce some kind of specific tax or levy, that would raise funds specifically for care services. ""They're all feasible in principle, and they're all difficult from a political perspective"".

Santander customers unable to access online accounts,"Santander has said ""key services are recovering"" following customers' problems accessing accounts online and withdrawing cash from its ATMs. The bank, which has 14 million active UK customers, said earlier that the problems affected branch, telephone, online, app and card services. In an updated statement, the bank said it was working on a ""full recovery by the end of the day"". It apologised and insisted: ""No-one will be out of pocket."" From Monday, the bank said it will post details on its website and social media channels about how impacted customers can make a claim. One customer told the BBC he had lost a day's wages because he could not buy petrol to travel to his job as a CCTV operator. ""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" said Marcus Evans, from Aberdare in south Wales. ""Nothing is working. It's ridiculous. ""I get my military pension and my wages paid into a Co-operative savings account and I transfer money on a weekly basis into my Santander account. ""I transferred money this morning. It's left my Co-op account but it hasn't arrived in my Santander account. ""We're left with very little food. It's disgusting. They need to compensate customers for this."" Another customer, Stephen Curtis, 58, from Gloucester, said he was trying to buy a new car when his card was rejected despite having enough funds in his account. ""It was so embarrassing,"" he said. ""This is unforgivable. I work in IT, I know about systems, I know about backups and upgrades. To have this happen, I would get the sack if it happened in my job. ""I'm definitely leaving the bank, and my wife's with the bank as well. We're on a tight schedule anyway, we're going on holiday Monday and we need the car for the holiday."" A third customer, Jason Crossland, from Rotherham, told the BBC he was stuck in an outlet shopping centre with his children, unable to buy enough petrol to get home. ""I'm just trying to keep the kids occupied and my mother's having to drive from Rotherham about 40 miles away, he said. ""I've been online - nothing. I can't get anything. ""I've been having issues as soon as I started trying to use the card about 10.15."" The head of money at consumer magazine Which? said many customers will be stressed, ""with people reporting that they have been unable to make online payments or in some cases purchase food in their local supermarket"". ""Customers can incur fines, penalties and fees when they're not able to access their finances, so the bank must offer compensation to all those who have been impacted in this way,"" added Gareth Shaw. The UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, said it was ""aware of the issue and in contact with the firm to ensure it resolves it as soon as possible"". Earlier, Santanderapologised on Twitter,externalthat a ""technical problem"" was affecting services and told customers they could ""access cash from other banks' ATMs, at the Post Office and can get cashback where that's available"".

Sunday's live coverage was brought to you by a team of journalists in London - Rebecca Seales, Paul Kirby and David Walker. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned anti-Semitism targeting British Jews, after a video emerged of a convoy of cars brandishing Palestinian flags in North London, with anti-Semitic abuse apparently being shouted through a megaphone. London's Metropolitan Police said they were aware of the video, which appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area, which is home to a Jewish community. Allow Twitter content?

Opposition Labour leaderKeir Starmer said the incident was ""utterly disgusting"",external, tweeting that there had to be consequences: ""Antisemitism, misogyny and hate have no place on our streets or in our society."" The Jewish community's Community Security Trust said it was fully aware of ""appalling anti-Semitic intimidation and incitement from [a] âpro-Palestinianâ car convoy from Bradford"". The Mayor of LondonSadiq Khan has said he is deeply concerned,externalby reports of ""hateful, intimidating and racist language used on marches and social media"". ""Behaviour that incites anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim hatred has no place in our city,"" he said. We have more details on this story here. Nine police officers were hurt during big pro-Palestinian protests in central London yesterday. Protesters called for the UK government to ""stop allowing Israel's brutal violence"" against the Palestinians. Police said the demonstrations had been largely peaceful but projectiles had been thrown in ""small pockets of disorder"". Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system. Several homes were reduced to rubble following an air strike early on Sunday. Israel said it had attacked a militant tunnel system which collapsed, bringing residential buildings down with it. It said the deaths were unintentional. Ten children were among the victims. Rescue workers combed through the debris of the buildings on Sunday recovering bodies. ""These are moments of horror that no-one can describe. Like
an earthquake hit the area,"" said Mahmoud Hmaid, who was helping the efforts. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem Is Israelâs military
operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike. This video can not be played Gaza tower containing media offices collapses after Israeli strike The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of war crimes In a statement to the UN Security Council, Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence. He was speaking after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet which went on for several hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More from the UN Security Council meeting currently taking place online. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the violence was a threat to the whole region. ""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres In his opening remarks to the UN Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was ""actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire"". He described the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Mr Guterres also called on all parties ""to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed"". UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, told the online meeting that casualties on both sides were mounting and that the situation in Gaza was ""more dire by the day"". The UN was working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm, he said. Mr Wennesland said Gaza militants should stop firing rockets from civilians areas and Israeli authorities had to abide by international law, maintaining maximum restraint to spare civilians. The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beersheba have been hit by rocket fire from Gaza in the past hour. So far there have been no reports of major injuries but Israel's fire and rescue authority reports substantial damage to homes and cars, and to a synagogue in Ashkelon.  This is the scene of the synagogue, in a picture posted by Israel's fire and rescue services Earlier, Israel's military said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired from the Gaza Strip since the latest conflict began. Cars were hit in Ashdod and reports say a residential building under construction was also struck. This video was posted from the scene in Ashdod.  Allow Twitter content?

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago. In Israel, officials say 10 people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks. Several more rocket attacks have taken place on southern towns and cities today, but there are no details of casualties.

Here families on both sides of the border tell of their fear amid the daily bombardment. Israel has seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza, the military says. Major General Ori Gordin told reporters that since Monday, Hamas had fired about 3,000 rockets towards Israel. He said the rate of rocket launches surpassed previous attacks from Gaza and also from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Â© 2025 BBC.

Santander customers unable to access app,"Santander has said ""key services are recovering"" following customers' problems accessing accounts online and withdrawing cash from its ATMs. The bank, which has 14 million active UK customers, said earlier that the problems affected branch, telephone, online, app and card services. In an updated statement, the bank said it was working on a ""full recovery by the end of the day"". It apologised and insisted: ""No-one will be out of pocket."" From Monday, the bank said it will post details on its website and social media channels about how impacted customers can make a claim. One customer told the BBC he had lost a day's wages because he could not buy petrol to travel to his job as a CCTV operator. ""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" said Marcus Evans, from Aberdare in south Wales. ""Nothing is working. It's ridiculous. ""I get my military pension and my wages paid into a Co-operative savings account and I transfer money on a weekly basis into my Santander account. ""I transferred money this morning. It's left my Co-op account but it hasn't arrived in my Santander account. ""We're left with very little food. It's disgusting. They need to compensate customers for this."" Another customer, Stephen Curtis, 58, from Gloucester, said he was trying to buy a new car when his card was rejected despite having enough funds in his account. ""It was so embarrassing,"" he said. ""This is unforgivable. I work in IT, I know about systems, I know about backups and upgrades. To have this happen, I would get the sack if it happened in my job. ""I'm definitely leaving the bank, and my wife's with the bank as well. We're on a tight schedule anyway, we're going on holiday Monday and we need the car for the holiday."" A third customer, Jason Crossland, from Rotherham, told the BBC he was stuck in an outlet shopping centre with his children, unable to buy enough petrol to get home. ""I'm just trying to keep the kids occupied and my mother's having to drive from Rotherham about 40 miles away, he said. ""I've been online - nothing. I can't get anything. ""I've been having issues as soon as I started trying to use the card about 10.15."" The head of money at consumer magazine Which? said many customers will be stressed, ""with people reporting that they have been unable to make online payments or in some cases purchase food in their local supermarket"". ""Customers can incur fines, penalties and fees when they're not able to access their finances, so the bank must offer compensation to all those who have been impacted in this way,"" added Gareth Shaw.

Israel-Gaza conflict rages as US envoy visitsIsraeli and Palestinian leaders are urged to stop firing as civilian casualties mount.Middle East,"This video can not be played The Gaza tower block housing news outlets destroyed in an Israeli strike A US envoy has arrived in Tel Aviv for de-escalation talks as unrest between Israel and the Palestinians continues. Hady Amr will take part in talks with Israeli, Palestinian and UN officials and reinforce what US diplomats said was the need for a ""sustainable calm"". An Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip killed 10 people on Saturday, while a Palestinian rocket killed a man in Israel. This week's violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. US President Joe Biden made diplomatic phone calls to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday. The international community has urged both sides to end the escalation. At least 139 people have been killed in Gaza and nine in Israel since this fighting began on Monday. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead in Gaza, while Palestinian health officials say nearly half are women and children. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Follow our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza conflict The flare-up of violence over the last six days came after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem, which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. How did the fighting escalate on Saturday? Thirteen people died in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, with 10 killed by an Israeli air strike at a refugee camp west of Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said. A five-month-old baby is said to be the only survivor of that strike, found trapped in the rubble next to his dead mother. A number of people were also reported missing. A baby survived an Israeli air strike on Saturday in the Gaza Strip Akram Farouq, 36, dashed out of his home in Gaza along with his family after a neighbour told him they had received a call from an Israeli officer warning their building would be hit, Reuters news agency reports. ""We haven't slept all night because of the explosions, and now I am out in the street with my wife and children, who are weeping and trembling,"" he said. Mothers fear for their children Why an Israeli mayor is warning of civil war Israel's Iron Dome missile shield An estimated 10,000 Palestinians have left their homes in Gaza since Monday because of the conflict, according to the UN. Saturday also saw an Israeli air strike destroy a tower block in Gaza housing media organisations. No-one is known to have died in this attack. Israeli officials reported about 200 rocket launches from Gaza overnight, with homes hit in the southern cities of Ashdod, Beersheba and Sderot. A house was damaged by a rocket in the Israeli town of Sderot on Saturday In Beersheba,19 people were taken to hospital after getting slightly hurt,externalwhile running to shelters, and three suffered from shock, The Times of Israel reports. In the afternoon, a rocket hit a street in Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv, killing a man. He was reportedly hit by shrapnel in his apartment. About 2,300 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel since Monday, with about 1,000 intercepted by missile defences and 380 falling short and dropping into Gaza itself, Israel's military says. What is Hamas? What makes Jerusalem so holy? There had been concerns of heightened tensions on Saturday as Palestinians were commemorating what they call al-Nakba, the Catastrophe. It marks the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, who were forced or driven from their homes in the Arab-Israeli war, which began the day after Israel's declaration of independence in 1948. On Saturday afternoon, an Israeli air strike destroyed a high-rise building housing media organisations, including The Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, plus a number of offices and apartments. In a statement released shortly afterwards, the Israeli military said the building housed military assets belonging to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza. The building's landlord has denied this. The remains of the multi-storey Al-Jalaa tower, which was home to various media organisations The Associated Press (AP) said the block was hit roughly an hour after Israeli forces ordered people to evacuate. The news organisation's CEO, Gary Pruitt, said: ""This is an incredibly disturbing development. We narrowly avoided a terrible loss of life. A dozen AP journalists and freelancers were inside the building and thankfully we were able to evacuate them in time."" Mr Amr's arrival comes ahead of a UN Security Council meeting on Sunday. The US embassy in Israel said the aim of his trip was to ""reinforce the need to work toward a sustainable calm"". A major foreign policy headache for Biden Mr Biden's administration has had to rapidly step up its game on the diplomatic front without a full team in place: there is not even a nominee yet for ambassador to Israel. Mr Amr is a mid-level diplomat without the kind of rank held by special envoys in previous US administrations,the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher says. The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

PokÃ©mon card sales halted over security concerns,"US retail giant Target is suspending in-store sales of PokÃ©mon and sports trading cards amid safety concerns as customers vie for the collectibles. Target, which has more than 1,900 outlets in the US, made the decision after a man drew a gun in a fight over cards outside a store in Wisconsin. ""The safety of our guests and our team is our top priority,"" the company said in a statement to US media. Sales of trading cards have rocketed amid the pandemic. The suspension of in-store sales is temporary, the company said, adding that online sales are not affected. Walmart, a top competitor to Target, says they have also seen increasing demand, but do not currently have plans to block sales. The 'insane' money in trading collectible cards Monsters, mania and the unstoppable march of PokÃ©mon A fight broke out in a car park outside a Target in Brookfield, Wisconsin, on 7 May, after four men allegedly assaulted another man over sports trading cards,reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,external. The victim, who had a licence to carry a concealed gun, ended the fight by drawing his weapon, police say. No shots were fired, and the four men ranging in age from 23 to 35 fled and were later arrested. PokÃ©mon cards The store, a nearby grocery store and a children's healthcare clinic briefly went on lockdown. Before announcing the ban, Target had previously said they were limiting trading card sales to one package per day per customer. Sales of trading cards, and especially PokÃ©mon with its famous catchphrase, ""gotta catch 'em all"", have surged in value in recent years.

NI Executive urged to rethink new travel rulesTwo tourism bodies are concerned about rules on visitors arriving from the Common Travel Area.Northern Ireland,"The Common Travel Area consists of the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man Tourism bodies have urged Stormont to rethink guidance on visitors arriving from the Common Travel Area (CTA). People visiting friends and family in Northern Ireland from GB, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands or Isle of Man will be exempt from a requirement to self-isolate from 24 May. New guidance states those exempt from self-isolation must take Covid-19 tests before departure and on later dates. The Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance described this as ""unmanageable"". What you need to know about NI's lockdown easing What are NI's Covid travel rules? Previously, Stormont ministers had only advised that people could travel from Northern Ireland to the CTA for essential reasons. On Thursday, the executive announcedrelaxations to this rule, but introduced certain requirements for travellers arriving into Northern Ireland. The new guidance sets out that anyone exempt from self-isolation will be asked to take lateral flow tests for Covid-19 pre-departure, as well as on days two and eight post-arrival into Northern Ireland. All other visitors will be required to self-isolate on arrival for 10 days. Both the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance and the Travel Association (ABTA) have raised concerns over the new rules. Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance chief executive Joanne Stuart said it ""remained unclear how the controls would be managed and by whom"". She described the testing requirements as ""complicated and confusing"" and said they would have the potential to put off visitors from coming. Previously, Stormont had only advised that people could travel from Northern Ireland to the CTA for ""essential"" reasons ""What people desperately want after months of uncertainty is confidence and clarity and this latest updated guidance does nothing to provide any of that,"" Ms Stuart said. She added that it would also ""shut down plans to promote Northern Ireland as a visitor destination"" for travellers in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Chief executive of ABTA, Mark Tanzer, believes Northern Ireland should follow England, Scotland and Wales inpublishing a green list of destinationswhere holidaymakers can return from without having to self-isolate. Mr Tanzer said the executive must also ""continue to provide financial support through to recovery"". Members of the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance have requested urgent meetings with representatives from the Northern Ireland Executive Office, Department for the Economy and Department of Health to press for change.

Doctors 'bullied for raising Covid safety fears',"Doctors in Wales have faced bullying and disciplinary action for raising concerns over working conditions and safety, a union leader has said. Dr Phil Banfield, of BMA Wales, said doctors who complained about work, both before and during the Covid pandemic, were seen as ""troublemakers"". He said there are worries bullying among staff will get worse as longer post-Covid waiting lists are tackled. The Welsh government said bullying of NHS staff was ""entirely unacceptable"". Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists BAME NHS anti-bullying rules 'not fit for purpose' Dr Banfield, who is chairman of the BMA Welsh consultants' committee, said staff have faced the prospect of being victimised by colleagues, or even being forced to leave the Welsh NHS, for raising concerns over bullying or health and safety. He said: ""Staff are quite good at raising concerns, but they don't raise concerns if they're going get in trouble for it, or they sense nothing is going to happen. ""What happens is you think 'I can't be bothered'. ""Decent people develop a kind of learned helplessness and it means that people who keep raising concerns stand out."" Dr Phil Banfield says doctors are often victimised for raising concerns over working conditions He added: ""What happens then is the person that's raised the concerns is often victimised, either by colleagues or the health services themselves. ""They find themselves out on a limb. What happens then is the wrong people leave the health service."" He said doctors who complained about bullying or their working conditions and wished to go to tribunal were advised that they would win their case, but would never work in Wales again. Dr Banfield also said issues relating to both safety and bullying were prevalent in the early stages of the Covid pandemic last spring, particularly around the issue of PPE. ""There were some concerns, and we expressed some alarm very early on, that there was a discrepancy between what the PPE advice was and what our members' concerns were on the shop floor,"" he said. He said some doctors even had issues wearing masks away from the wards, in areas such as coffee rooms and corridors, before it became mandatory to wear them in hospitals. He said doctors in hospitals across Wales were stopped and told to remove their masks while wearing them in public areas away from the wards. Dr Banfield says doctors were across Wales were told to remove face masks in public areas of hospitals He added: ""On more than one occasion, more than one doctor was threatened with disciplinary action for saying 'I don't feel comfortable walking around without a mask on'."" Meanwhile, a survey by BMA Wales conducted in October 2020 found 63% of respondents who needed PPE said they were either not at all confident, or were only partly confident, that they would receive an appropriate fit test for PPE. Furthermore, 30% said they had not reported PPE concerns, as they felt no action would be taken by management. With waiting lists growing through the pandemic, Dr Banfield said there were concerns bullying would only get worse as Wales moved out of the pandemic. He said: ""The risk is, as the health service comes under pressure to get through the backlog, that bullying will become more prevalent and we've got some evidence of that already. Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists ""Staff are already exhausted and it will just result in people leaving the NHS."" BMA Wales is calling for the introduction of independent freedom-to-speak-up guardians to help tackle these issues for NHS staff. Specially appointed to report concerns, guardians are already in place in England and Scotland, offering staff the opportunity to speak in confidence. Dr Banfield said: ""The idea is that they're independent, it's not the BMA as the union harping on about something. It's someone who's independent saying 'this doesn't seem right to us as well'."" The Welsh government said it would consider introducing such guardians and a new policy was to be launched in June for the NHS with the aim of preventing bullying in the workplace. A spokesman added: ""Any form of discrimination, bullying and harassment within the NHS is entirely unacceptable and we take these matters very seriously. ""We continue to work with the NHS to tackle all forms of discrimination and expect all NHS Wales staff to be treated with dignity and respect. ""Policies are in place to ensure NHS organisations take action to address any concerns raised to them and all staff are encouraged to raise any worries.

Last Debenhams stores close their doors,"This video can not be played Former staff reminisce about life at their town's Debenhams branch The last remaining Debenhams are closing their doors on Saturday, more than 240 years after the department store began trading. Shoppers have flocked to the last remaining outlets to pick up bargains in closing-down sales. But the last 28 stores will now be shuttered for good. The Debenhams brand will continue to trade online after it was bought by the fashion retailer Boohoo for Â£55m in January. At its height, there were more than 150 Debenhams stores across the UK, but the chain went into administration in 2019 after several years of falling sales. The pandemic was the final blow. In December, its owners announced the business was being wound down with 12,000 job losses. End of an era as final Debenhams shops to close Debenhams pictured through the years Sad demise of 'Harrods of the North' After lockdown, 97 stores reopened to allow the last stock to be cleared, and they have gradually been closed over the last two weeks. The last outlets have been plastered with sale signs, offering a mish-mash of items, from bikinis to cafetieres, at bargain basement prices. Debenhams was an anchor store, especially in many mid-sized town centres, such as Mansfield, where it opened its shopping centre-based site in 1976. Shelves were empty in the cosmetic department this week, while boxes of left-over coat hangers were free to anyone who wanted them. But as the shop entered its final few days of trading, there were more customers than there had been for some time, said shop staff. They recalled that in its early days, the store sold a huge range of goods, from loft ladders to greenhouses. ""It was so thriving in the 1970s and 80s. On a Friday afternoon, it was really buzzing with the girls from the factory,"" said Glenis Thompson. Its closure would leave ""a big big hole in the town"", said Julie Howe, another former Debenhams worker. ""It isn't all about online and Covid. The company lost its way, which is very sad,"" she added. A postcard showing Debenham & Freebody department store in London, circa 1905 Debenhams traces its roots back to 1778 when William Clark opened a shop in London's West End, selling fabrics, bonnets and parasols. By the 1950s, it was the biggest department store in the UK with 110 sites. However, in recent years, the shift to online shopping ate into sales and the business floundered. It was put up for sale last year, but in the end, the brand will survive online as part of the internet-only fashion firm Boohoo.

Today's live page was brought to you by Katie Wright, Dulcie Lee and Victoria Lindrea. Well be back soon, but in the meantime,read up on how restrictions will ease in large parts of the UK from Monday. Home Secretary Priti Patel joined the 32 million other people in the UK who have had their first vaccine dose In the UK:  Around the world: France has given a
first vaccine dose to more than 20 million people, President Emmanuel
Macron has said. The French
government had set itself a target to give a first injection to 20 million people by mid-May, after a slow start to its campaign. Macron announced
the milestonein a tweet,external- the number represents around 30% of the population. The government is
aiming to have 30 million first doses administered by 15 June, when Macron has
said all adults will be able to sign up for a jab, which is currently reserved for
priority groups and adults over 50. It comes ahead of the government beginning to lift a nationwide lockdown on Wednesday. Museums, theatres, cinemas and concert halls will reopen with limited capacity
after six weeks of closure to halt Covid cases, while non-essential shops will also reopen and outdoor seating at cafes and
restaurants will be allowed for the first time since 30 October. Earlier, we brought youthe UK government's coronavirus figures.,externalLooking at the data in more detail, it shows that the number of Covid patients in hospital has dropped below 1,000 for the first time in eight months. The most recent figures show there are 991 patients in hospital - down from almost 40,000 at the peak in January. Rangers fans celebrate in George Square in Glasgow Rangers football fans have gathered in the centre of Glasgow after their club lifted their first
Scottish Premiership trophy in a decade.
The celebrations come despitewarnings from police against gatherings due to rising Covid-19 cases in Glasgow. Supporters started gathering outside Ibrox Stadium four hours ahead of the final league game of the season. Fans clambered onto the gates outside the stadium after the final whistle. After
the trophy was lifted, large numbers of fans then marched towards Glasgow city centre to continue unofficial celebrations in George Square. Glasgow remains in level 3 of Covid lockdown restrictions, with large gatherings outdoors not permitted. The issue of PPE, in Spring 2020, was a particular flashpoint, according to Dr Banfield Doctors in Wales have faced bullying and disciplinary action for raising concerns over working conditions and safety, a union leader has said. Dr Phil Banfield, of BMA Wales, said doctors who complained about work, both before and during the Covid pandemic, were seen as ""troublemakers"". Doctors who wished to go to tribunal were advised that they would win their case, but would never work in Wales again, he said. And there were concerns bullying among staff will only get worse as as Wales moves out of the pandemic and post-Covid waiting lists are tackled. ""The risk is, as the health service comes under pressure to get through the backlog, that bullying will become more prevalent and we've got some evidence of that already,"" he said. The Welsh government said bullying of NHS staff was ""entirely unacceptable"". Read more. Falling Covid cases have allowed for restrictions to loosen in the Lazio region of Italy. And despite a windy day, many locals spent the morning sunbathing at Ostia beach near Rome. Others played beach tennis and football, soaking up the sun after months spent in lockdown. Travel between Italy and much the rest of the world has been severely restricted for months as the government tried to curb Covid infections. But yesterday Italy scrapped mandatory quarantine for visitors from the European Union, Britain and Israel who have proof of a recent negative test. Italy's currently on the UK's amber list. Find out what that meanshere. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Rehearsals have been taking place at the Rotterdam Ahoy arena A member of the
Polish delegation at the Eurovision Song Contest has tested positive for
Covid-19. It is the first case of the virus to be detected among the teams
competing in Rotterdam, where the final takes place next Saturday. The person who tested positive has gone into isolation,
and the rest of the team will take PCR tests and enter a few days of
precautionary quarantine. Rafal is the artist representing Poland this year. He rehearsed his entry, The Ride, on stage inside the
Rotterdam Ahoy two days ago - that was the last time the Polish delegates set
foot inside the venue, at which point they were all in possession of a negative
test. Every one of the 39 acts competing has a back up recording in case
they're unable to perform on the night. Holding a singing contest in the midst
of a global pandemic was always going to be risky. This first positive test is
a reminder, Eurovision is not immune. A further seven people have died in UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus,according to the latest government figures.,external It brings the total number deaths by this measure to 127,675. Another 2,027 people have tested positive. Meanwhile, a further 379,111 people have had their second dose of a vaccine, bringing the total to almost 20 million - precisely 19,698,121. And 204,912 more people have had their first jab, taking the total to 36,320,867. Lockdown rules are easing in England, Wales and most of Scotland on Monday, with pubs and restaurants able to serve customers indoors, and social distancing guidelines relaxed. Here's how things are changing in England: Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants will be allowed to serve customers indoors Indoor entertainment such as museums, cinemas, aquariums and children's play areas can open Care home residents can have up to five named visitors, and more freedom for visits out of the home Theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums can all reopen Organised adult sports and exercise classes can restart indoors Social distancing guidance is also changing. Contact with close family and friends is described as a matter of personal judgement, but people are asked to remain cautious around close contact, like hugging People will be able to travel abroad to green list countries, like Portugal, without having to quarantine when they return The rules on meeting up are also changing:  Find the full list of changes, as well as those affecting Scotland and Wales,here.  Scarborough is one of the most popular resorts in North Yorkshire Hotels, restaurants and visitor attractions are ""raring to go"" as England prepares for the return of indoor socialising on Monday. John Senior, who chairs South Bay Traders' Association in Scarborough, said there was an appetite for the ""familiarity"" of coastal English resorts with their pubs, cafes and family attractions. He said businesses in the popular resorts of Scarborough, Whitby and Filey had worked hard to make sure they were Covid-safe and were looking forward to welcoming back customers. Many businesses have reported high numbers of advance bookings. ""Forward bookings are just phenomenal, absolutely phenomenal, we are holding 68% occupancy for this financial year, which we have never had in eight years of having the business,"" said Simon Boyle, owner of the Number 21 guest house in York. ""I can't put it into words how excited we are, we can't wait for people to come back into the house, make it feel alive again."" Read more. People queuing to get vaccinated at Essa Academy in Bolton today Bolton councillor Andy Morgan has urged locals to take up the opportunity to get vaccinated today. The vaccine bus, currently parked at the Essa Academy in the Great Lever area of Bolton, is carrying 4,000 Pfizer vaccines which ""must be used today"", Mr Morgan tweeted. The vaccine bus is a key component in the accelerated rollout of vaccines in Bolton where cases of the Indian variant have been rising quickly. Other mobile testing units have been set up in the town and vaccination centres are extending their opening hours as part of a push to stop the spread of the variant. A rapid response team of 100 nurses, public health advisers and environmental health officers has also been sent in. Speaking earlier this morning, Dr Helen Wall - who is leading the vaccination effort in Bolton - said 10,000 people eligible for jabs had yet to be vaccinated in the BL4 and BL5 postcode areas.

Oliver Dowden attended a semi-final match of the World Snooker Championships as part of a government pilot on mass events Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has warned the live events industry that the UK is entering a ""period of heightened vigilance"" due to the spread of the Indian coronavirus variant. Hesaid on Twitter,externalthat he understood ""this is an anxious time as we assess the situation over the next couple of weeks"". Organisations would continue to be updated, he said, to allow ""everyone to plan their full reopening"". From Monday, limited audiences will be allowed back into theatres, music venues and sports stadiums in England. And from 21 June, the government's plan says social distancing will end and many venues able to stage shows to a full house for the first time since the start of the pandemic. (But in case you missed it, last nightthe prime minister saidthe Indian variant could pose ""serious disruption"" to that plan.) Runners took part in a reunion 5K at Surrey's Kempton Park on Saturday - the only running event in the government's Events Research Programme. That programme is piloting a series of events to see how mass gatherings might work in the future. The Reunion 5K will help provide scientific data on Covid-19 transmission levels, with both socially-distanced and non-socially-distanced runs being trialled. Approximately 1,000 socially-distanced runners took part in the first race, watched by socially-distanced spectators - but in the second race there was no social distancing among the 1,000 runners, nor were the spectators asked to stand apart. All those in attendance had to provide evidence of a negative lateral flow test and were asked to take a PCR test both on Saturday and five days later. Organiser Hugh Brasher, who took part in the non-socially-distanced 5K, said he was surprised at ""how normal it felt"". ""I thought it would feel different and it didn't - and it was lovely to be able to do it and get inspired to run faster than I've run in quite a number of years."" Sports Minister Nigel Huddlestone was it was ""fantastic"" to see so many people involved, adding that the data would be ""essential"" for the return of events such as the London Marathon.  Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News This video can not be played Star Gemma Arterton excited at theatres reopening If a playwright had written the pandemic, a theatre critic might have struggled to pin down its genre - tragedy, thriller, depressing kitchen sink drama or farce? Just as you think you're finally getting to the happy ending, the suspense, tension and terror begin to build again. In the real-world theatre industry, venue bosses have had to decide whether to open from Monday, when capacities will be restricted to 50%, up to a maximum of 1,000 people. Many have chosen to wait until 21 June, when they will be able to play to packed houses. But new Covid variants have thrown that date - our appointment to get back to ""normal"" in many aspects of life - into doubt. We are on the edges of our seats. So what will the industry do - and which shows will actually open? Keep readinghere. Two-thirds of adults in Scotland have had their first dose of coronavirus vaccine, figures show. More than three million people have now been given their first jab, while nearly 1.6 million are fully vaccinated. Scotland is on course to offer all adults a first vaccine by the end of July, if supplies are maintained. Currently adults aged 40 and over are eligible, with appointments being scheduled for people in their 30s. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said the three million milestone reflected the ""enormous efforts"" of vaccination teams. ""The vaccination programme is one of the main ways - along with restrictions and testing - that we are working to beat this virus and so it is crucial that everyone attends for their appointments when they are offered,"" he said.  Some 21,000 football fans will be in attendance at today's FA Cup final between Leicester and Chelsea at Wembley. The match, which kicks off at 17:15 BST, will see the biggest crowd so far as part of the series of government pilots aimed at safely allowing the return of mass events. Leicester and Chelsea have been allocated 6,250 tickets each - and  the rest of the crowd will be made up of local residents, key workers, stadium guests and FA stakeholders. All fans attending are required to take a lateral flow test. Among those who have managed to secure tickets to the match will be 87-year-old Bernie Henson who witnessed the club's last FA Cup final outing - 52 years ago. Read morehere. There'll be no more soggy chips as restaurants can serve customers indoors in England from Monday Here is a little more from the British Medical Association, which has raised serious concerns about the decision to press ahead with the easing of lockdown restrictions in England on Monday, as the Indian variant of coronavirus continues to spread. The BMA, which represents doctors in the UK, says the relaxation of rules is a ""real worry"" when ""key segments"" of the population still haven't been vaccinated. Dr Richard Jarvis, BMA public health medicine committee co-chairman, says the government must monitor the situation with ""extreme vigilance"" and be willing to ""apply the brakes"" if necessary. Last night,the prime minister saidhe didn't think the ""present evidence"" showed a need to delay the next step of easing lockdown. Dr Jarvis said that while the public and businesses could take precautions it was the government ""which is steering the ship and must stand by its cautious approach"". ""To ensure we do not undo all the hard work and sacrifice of the previous lockdown, the government must continue to monitor the situation with extreme vigilance and have the willingness to act quickly and apply the brakes if needed to prevent the situation getting out of control for a third time."" Home Secretary Priti Patel has had her first dose of the Moderna vaccine this morning at Guy's Hospital in central London. She joins more than 36 million people in the UK who have had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. First jabs are now being offered to people below the age of 50. Those aged 38 and above in England, over 30s in Northern Ireland, those aged 40 and above in Scotland and the over 40s in Wales are all being invited to book appointments. First jabs were offered to everyone over 50, and those in high risk categories, by 15 April - these groups account for 99% of coronavirus deaths so far. Read more:When might I get my first dose? A London Underground line which has been entirely shut since the start of the pandemic is to reopen in June, transport bosses have announced. The Waterloo and City Line, linking Waterloo Station to Bank, stopped running in March last yearas part of efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19. Trains on the popular commuter line will begin running again on 21 June, with services on weekdays during the morning and evening peak hours. The restarting of the line coincides with the day the government had aimed to remove all legal limits on social contact, although the prime minister has warnedeasing could be delayed due to the threat of the Indian virus variant. Transport for London also said bus capacity will increase from Monday, with nearly all seats except those that are rear-facing being made available for use. Read morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

US envoy arrives in Israel for de-escalation talks,"This video can not be played The Gaza tower block housing news outlets destroyed in an Israeli strike A US envoy has arrived in Tel Aviv for de-escalation talks as unrest between Israel and the Palestinians continues. Hady Amr will take part in talks with Israeli, Palestinian and UN officials and reinforce what US diplomats said was the need for a ""sustainable calm"". An Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip killed 10 people on Saturday, while a Palestinian rocket killed a man in Israel. This week's violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. US President Joe Biden made diplomatic phone calls to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday. The international community has urged both sides to end the escalation. At least 139 people have been killed in Gaza and nine in Israel since this fighting began on Monday. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead in Gaza, while Palestinian health officials say nearly half are women and children. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Follow our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza conflict The flare-up of violence over the last six days came after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem, which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. How did the fighting escalate on Saturday? Thirteen people died in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, with 10 killed by an Israeli air strike at a refugee camp west of Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said. A five-month-old baby is said to be the only survivor of that strike, found trapped in the rubble next to his dead mother. A number of people were also reported missing. A baby survived an Israeli air strike on Saturday in the Gaza Strip Akram Farouq, 36, dashed out of his home in Gaza along with his family after a neighbour told him they had received a call from an Israeli officer warning their building would be hit, Reuters news agency reports. ""We haven't slept all night because of the explosions, and now I am out in the street with my wife and children, who are weeping and trembling,"" he said. Mothers fear for their children Why an Israeli mayor is warning of civil war Israel's Iron Dome missile shield An estimated 10,000 Palestinians have left their homes in Gaza since Monday because of the conflict, according to the UN. Saturday also saw an Israeli air strike destroy a tower block in Gaza housing media organisations. No-one is known to have died in this attack. Israeli officials reported about 200 rocket launches from Gaza overnight, with homes hit in the southern cities of Ashdod, Beersheba and Sderot. A house was damaged by a rocket in the Israeli town of Sderot on Saturday In Beersheba,19 people were taken to hospital after getting slightly hurt,externalwhile running to shelters, and three suffered from shock, The Times of Israel reports. In the afternoon, a rocket hit a street in Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv, killing a man. He was reportedly hit by shrapnel in his apartment. About 2,300 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel since Monday, with about 1,000 intercepted by missile defences and 380 falling short and dropping into Gaza itself, Israel's military says. What is Hamas? What makes Jerusalem so holy? There had been concerns of heightened tensions on Saturday as Palestinians were commemorating what they call al-Nakba, the Catastrophe. It marks the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, who were forced or driven from their homes in the Arab-Israeli war, which began the day after Israel's declaration of independence in 1948. On Saturday afternoon, an Israeli air strike destroyed a high-rise building housing media organisations, including The Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, plus a number of offices and apartments. In a statement released shortly afterwards, the Israeli military said the building housed military assets belonging to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza. The building's landlord has denied this. The remains of the multi-storey Al-Jalaa tower, which was home to various media organisations The Associated Press (AP) said the block was hit roughly an hour after Israeli forces ordered people to evacuate. The news organisation's CEO, Gary Pruitt, said: ""This is an incredibly disturbing development. We narrowly avoided a terrible loss of life. A dozen AP journalists and freelancers were inside the building and thankfully we were able to evacuate them in time."" Mr Amr's arrival comes ahead of a UN Security Council meeting on Sunday. The US embassy in Israel said the aim of his trip was to ""reinforce the need to work toward a sustainable calm"". A major foreign policy headache for Biden Mr Biden's administration has had to rapidly step up its game on the diplomatic front without a full team in place: there is not even a nominee yet for ambassador to Israel. Mr Amr is a mid-level diplomat without the kind of rank held by special envoys in previous US administrations,the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher says. The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

Today's live page was brought to you by Katie Wright, Dulcie Lee and Victoria Lindrea. Well be back soon, but in the meantime,read up on how restrictions will ease in large parts of the UK from Monday. Home Secretary Priti Patel joined the 32 million other people in the UK who have had their first vaccine dose In the UK:  Around the world: France has given a
first vaccine dose to more than 20 million people, President Emmanuel
Macron has said. The French
government had set itself a target to give a first injection to 20 million people by mid-May, after a slow start to its campaign. Macron announced
the milestonein a tweet,external- the number represents around 30% of the population. The government is
aiming to have 30 million first doses administered by 15 June, when Macron has
said all adults will be able to sign up for a jab, which is currently reserved for
priority groups and adults over 50. It comes ahead of the government beginning to lift a nationwide lockdown on Wednesday. Museums, theatres, cinemas and concert halls will reopen with limited capacity
after six weeks of closure to halt Covid cases, while non-essential shops will also reopen and outdoor seating at cafes and
restaurants will be allowed for the first time since 30 October. Earlier, we brought youthe UK government's coronavirus figures.,externalLooking at the data in more detail, it shows that the number of Covid patients in hospital has dropped below 1,000 for the first time in eight months. The most recent figures show there are 991 patients in hospital - down from almost 40,000 at the peak in January. Rangers fans celebrate in George Square in Glasgow Rangers football fans have gathered in the centre of Glasgow after their club lifted their first
Scottish Premiership trophy in a decade.
The celebrations come despitewarnings from police against gatherings due to rising Covid-19 cases in Glasgow. Supporters started gathering outside Ibrox Stadium four hours ahead of the final league game of the season. Fans clambered onto the gates outside the stadium after the final whistle. After
the trophy was lifted, large numbers of fans then marched towards Glasgow city centre to continue unofficial celebrations in George Square. Glasgow remains in level 3 of Covid lockdown restrictions, with large gatherings outdoors not permitted. The issue of PPE, in Spring 2020, was a particular flashpoint, according to Dr Banfield Doctors in Wales have faced bullying and disciplinary action for raising concerns over working conditions and safety, a union leader has said. Dr Phil Banfield, of BMA Wales, said doctors who complained about work, both before and during the Covid pandemic, were seen as ""troublemakers"". Doctors who wished to go to tribunal were advised that they would win their case, but would never work in Wales again, he said. And there were concerns bullying among staff will only get worse as as Wales moves out of the pandemic and post-Covid waiting lists are tackled. ""The risk is, as the health service comes under pressure to get through the backlog, that bullying will become more prevalent and we've got some evidence of that already,"" he said. The Welsh government said bullying of NHS staff was ""entirely unacceptable"". Read more. Falling Covid cases have allowed for restrictions to loosen in the Lazio region of Italy. And despite a windy day, many locals spent the morning sunbathing at Ostia beach near Rome. Others played beach tennis and football, soaking up the sun after months spent in lockdown. Travel between Italy and much the rest of the world has been severely restricted for months as the government tried to curb Covid infections. But yesterday Italy scrapped mandatory quarantine for visitors from the European Union, Britain and Israel who have proof of a recent negative test. Italy's currently on the UK's amber list. Find out what that meanshere. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Rehearsals have been taking place at the Rotterdam Ahoy arena A member of the
Polish delegation at the Eurovision Song Contest has tested positive for
Covid-19. It is the first case of the virus to be detected among the teams
competing in Rotterdam, where the final takes place next Saturday. The person who tested positive has gone into isolation,
and the rest of the team will take PCR tests and enter a few days of
precautionary quarantine. Rafal is the artist representing Poland this year. He rehearsed his entry, The Ride, on stage inside the
Rotterdam Ahoy two days ago - that was the last time the Polish delegates set
foot inside the venue, at which point they were all in possession of a negative
test. Every one of the 39 acts competing has a back up recording in case
they're unable to perform on the night. Holding a singing contest in the midst
of a global pandemic was always going to be risky. This first positive test is
a reminder, Eurovision is not immune. A further seven people have died in UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus,according to the latest government figures.,external It brings the total number deaths by this measure to 127,675. Another 2,027 people have tested positive. Meanwhile, a further 379,111 people have had their second dose of a vaccine, bringing the total to almost 20 million - precisely 19,698,121. And 204,912 more people have had their first jab, taking the total to 36,320,867. Lockdown rules are easing in England, Wales and most of Scotland on Monday, with pubs and restaurants able to serve customers indoors, and social distancing guidelines relaxed. Here's how things are changing in England: Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants will be allowed to serve customers indoors Indoor entertainment such as museums, cinemas, aquariums and children's play areas can open Care home residents can have up to five named visitors, and more freedom for visits out of the home Theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums can all reopen Organised adult sports and exercise classes can restart indoors Social distancing guidance is also changing. Contact with close family and friends is described as a matter of personal judgement, but people are asked to remain cautious around close contact, like hugging People will be able to travel abroad to green list countries, like Portugal, without having to quarantine when they return The rules on meeting up are also changing:  Find the full list of changes, as well as those affecting Scotland and Wales,here.  Scarborough is one of the most popular resorts in North Yorkshire Hotels, restaurants and visitor attractions are ""raring to go"" as England prepares for the return of indoor socialising on Monday. John Senior, who chairs South Bay Traders' Association in Scarborough, said there was an appetite for the ""familiarity"" of coastal English resorts with their pubs, cafes and family attractions. He said businesses in the popular resorts of Scarborough, Whitby and Filey had worked hard to make sure they were Covid-safe and were looking forward to welcoming back customers. Many businesses have reported high numbers of advance bookings. ""Forward bookings are just phenomenal, absolutely phenomenal, we are holding 68% occupancy for this financial year, which we have never had in eight years of having the business,"" said Simon Boyle, owner of the Number 21 guest house in York. ""I can't put it into words how excited we are, we can't wait for people to come back into the house, make it feel alive again."" Read more. People queuing to get vaccinated at Essa Academy in Bolton today Bolton councillor Andy Morgan has urged locals to take up the opportunity to get vaccinated today. The vaccine bus, currently parked at the Essa Academy in the Great Lever area of Bolton, is carrying 4,000 Pfizer vaccines which ""must be used today"", Mr Morgan tweeted. The vaccine bus is a key component in the accelerated rollout of vaccines in Bolton where cases of the Indian variant have been rising quickly. Other mobile testing units have been set up in the town and vaccination centres are extending their opening hours as part of a push to stop the spread of the variant. A rapid response team of 100 nurses, public health advisers and environmental health officers has also been sent in. Speaking earlier this morning, Dr Helen Wall - who is leading the vaccination effort in Bolton - said 10,000 people eligible for jabs had yet to be vaccinated in the BL4 and BL5 postcode areas.

Oliver Dowden attended a semi-final match of the World Snooker Championships as part of a government pilot on mass events Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has warned the live events industry that the UK is entering a ""period of heightened vigilance"" due to the spread of the Indian coronavirus variant. Hesaid on Twitter,externalthat he understood ""this is an anxious time as we assess the situation over the next couple of weeks"". Organisations would continue to be updated, he said, to allow ""everyone to plan their full reopening"". From Monday, limited audiences will be allowed back into theatres, music venues and sports stadiums in England. And from 21 June, the government's plan says social distancing will end and many venues able to stage shows to a full house for the first time since the start of the pandemic. (But in case you missed it, last nightthe prime minister saidthe Indian variant could pose ""serious disruption"" to that plan.) Runners took part in a reunion 5K at Surrey's Kempton Park on Saturday - the only running event in the government's Events Research Programme. That programme is piloting a series of events to see how mass gatherings might work in the future. The Reunion 5K will help provide scientific data on Covid-19 transmission levels, with both socially-distanced and non-socially-distanced runs being trialled. Approximately 1,000 socially-distanced runners took part in the first race, watched by socially-distanced spectators - but in the second race there was no social distancing among the 1,000 runners, nor were the spectators asked to stand apart. All those in attendance had to provide evidence of a negative lateral flow test and were asked to take a PCR test both on Saturday and five days later. Organiser Hugh Brasher, who took part in the non-socially-distanced 5K, said he was surprised at ""how normal it felt"". ""I thought it would feel different and it didn't - and it was lovely to be able to do it and get inspired to run faster than I've run in quite a number of years."" Sports Minister Nigel Huddlestone was it was ""fantastic"" to see so many people involved, adding that the data would be ""essential"" for the return of events such as the London Marathon.  Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News This video can not be played Star Gemma Arterton excited at theatres reopening If a playwright had written the pandemic, a theatre critic might have struggled to pin down its genre - tragedy, thriller, depressing kitchen sink drama or farce? Just as you think you're finally getting to the happy ending, the suspense, tension and terror begin to build again. In the real-world theatre industry, venue bosses have had to decide whether to open from Monday, when capacities will be restricted to 50%, up to a maximum of 1,000 people. Many have chosen to wait until 21 June, when they will be able to play to packed houses. But new Covid variants have thrown that date - our appointment to get back to ""normal"" in many aspects of life - into doubt. We are on the edges of our seats. So what will the industry do - and which shows will actually open? Keep readinghere. Two-thirds of adults in Scotland have had their first dose of coronavirus vaccine, figures show. More than three million people have now been given their first jab, while nearly 1.6 million are fully vaccinated. Scotland is on course to offer all adults a first vaccine by the end of July, if supplies are maintained. Currently adults aged 40 and over are eligible, with appointments being scheduled for people in their 30s. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said the three million milestone reflected the ""enormous efforts"" of vaccination teams. ""The vaccination programme is one of the main ways - along with restrictions and testing - that we are working to beat this virus and so it is crucial that everyone attends for their appointments when they are offered,"" he said.  Some 21,000 football fans will be in attendance at today's FA Cup final between Leicester and Chelsea at Wembley. The match, which kicks off at 17:15 BST, will see the biggest crowd so far as part of the series of government pilots aimed at safely allowing the return of mass events. Leicester and Chelsea have been allocated 6,250 tickets each - and  the rest of the crowd will be made up of local residents, key workers, stadium guests and FA stakeholders. All fans attending are required to take a lateral flow test. Among those who have managed to secure tickets to the match will be 87-year-old Bernie Henson who witnessed the club's last FA Cup final outing - 52 years ago. Read morehere. There'll be no more soggy chips as restaurants can serve customers indoors in England from Monday Here is a little more from the British Medical Association, which has raised serious concerns about the decision to press ahead with the easing of lockdown restrictions in England on Monday, as the Indian variant of coronavirus continues to spread. The BMA, which represents doctors in the UK, says the relaxation of rules is a ""real worry"" when ""key segments"" of the population still haven't been vaccinated. Dr Richard Jarvis, BMA public health medicine committee co-chairman, says the government must monitor the situation with ""extreme vigilance"" and be willing to ""apply the brakes"" if necessary. Last night,the prime minister saidhe didn't think the ""present evidence"" showed a need to delay the next step of easing lockdown. Dr Jarvis said that while the public and businesses could take precautions it was the government ""which is steering the ship and must stand by its cautious approach"". ""To ensure we do not undo all the hard work and sacrifice of the previous lockdown, the government must continue to monitor the situation with extreme vigilance and have the willingness to act quickly and apply the brakes if needed to prevent the situation getting out of control for a third time."" Home Secretary Priti Patel has had her first dose of the Moderna vaccine this morning at Guy's Hospital in central London. She joins more than 36 million people in the UK who have had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. First jabs are now being offered to people below the age of 50. Those aged 38 and above in England, over 30s in Northern Ireland, those aged 40 and above in Scotland and the over 40s in Wales are all being invited to book appointments. First jabs were offered to everyone over 50, and those in high risk categories, by 15 April - these groups account for 99% of coronavirus deaths so far. Read more:When might I get my first dose? A London Underground line which has been entirely shut since the start of the pandemic is to reopen in June, transport bosses have announced. The Waterloo and City Line, linking Waterloo Station to Bank, stopped running in March last yearas part of efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19. Trains on the popular commuter line will begin running again on 21 June, with services on weekdays during the morning and evening peak hours. The restarting of the line coincides with the day the government had aimed to remove all legal limits on social contact, although the prime minister has warnedeasing could be delayed due to the threat of the Indian virus variant. Transport for London also said bus capacity will increase from Monday, with nearly all seats except those that are rear-facing being made available for use. Read morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sunday's live coverage was brought to you by a team of journalists in London - Rebecca Seales, Paul Kirby and David Walker. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned anti-Semitism targeting British Jews, after a video emerged of a convoy of cars brandishing Palestinian flags in North London, with anti-Semitic abuse apparently being shouted through a megaphone. London's Metropolitan Police said they were aware of the video, which appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area, which is home to a Jewish community. Allow Twitter content?

Opposition Labour leaderKeir Starmer said the incident was ""utterly disgusting"",external, tweeting that there had to be consequences: ""Antisemitism, misogyny and hate have no place on our streets or in our society."" The Jewish community's Community Security Trust said it was fully aware of ""appalling anti-Semitic intimidation and incitement from [a] âpro-Palestinianâ car convoy from Bradford"". The Mayor of LondonSadiq Khan has said he is deeply concerned,externalby reports of ""hateful, intimidating and racist language used on marches and social media"". ""Behaviour that incites anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim hatred has no place in our city,"" he said. We have more details on this story here. Nine police officers were hurt during big pro-Palestinian protests in central London yesterday. Protesters called for the UK government to ""stop allowing Israel's brutal violence"" against the Palestinians. Police said the demonstrations had been largely peaceful but projectiles had been thrown in ""small pockets of disorder"". Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system. Several homes were reduced to rubble following an air strike early on Sunday. Israel said it had attacked a militant tunnel system which collapsed, bringing residential buildings down with it. It said the deaths were unintentional. Ten children were among the victims. Rescue workers combed through the debris of the buildings on Sunday recovering bodies. ""These are moments of horror that no-one can describe. Like
an earthquake hit the area,"" said Mahmoud Hmaid, who was helping the efforts. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem Is Israelâs military
operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike. This video can not be played Gaza tower containing media offices collapses after Israeli strike The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of war crimes In a statement to the UN Security Council, Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence. He was speaking after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet which went on for several hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More from the UN Security Council meeting currently taking place online. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the violence was a threat to the whole region. ""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres In his opening remarks to the UN Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was ""actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire"". He described the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Mr Guterres also called on all parties ""to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed"". UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, told the online meeting that casualties on both sides were mounting and that the situation in Gaza was ""more dire by the day"". The UN was working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm, he said. Mr Wennesland said Gaza militants should stop firing rockets from civilians areas and Israeli authorities had to abide by international law, maintaining maximum restraint to spare civilians. The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beersheba have been hit by rocket fire from Gaza in the past hour. So far there have been no reports of major injuries but Israel's fire and rescue authority reports substantial damage to homes and cars, and to a synagogue in Ashkelon.  This is the scene of the synagogue, in a picture posted by Israel's fire and rescue services Earlier, Israel's military said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired from the Gaza Strip since the latest conflict began. Cars were hit in Ashdod and reports say a residential building under construction was also struck. This video was posted from the scene in Ashdod.  Allow Twitter content?

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago. In Israel, officials say 10 people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks. Several more rocket attacks have taken place on southern towns and cities today, but there are no details of casualties. This video can not be played The fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza is taking a brutal toll on people's everyday lives. Here families on both sides of the border tell of their fear amid the daily bombardment. Israel has seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza, the military says. Major General Ori Gordin told reporters that since Monday, Hamas had fired about 3,000 rockets towards Israel. He said the rate of rocket launches surpassed previous attacks from Gaza and also from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Â© 2025 BBC.

Nine police officers were hurt during big pro-Palestinian protests in central London yesterday. Protesters called for the UK government to ""stop allowing Israel's brutal violence"" against the Palestinians. Police said the demonstrations had been largely peaceful but projectiles had been thrown in ""small pockets of disorder"". Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system. Several homes were reduced to rubble following an air strike early on Sunday. Israel said it had attacked a militant tunnel system which collapsed, bringing residential buildings down with it. It said the deaths were unintentional. Ten children were among the victims. Rescue workers combed through the debris of the buildings on Sunday recovering bodies. ""These are moments of horror that no-one can describe. Like
an earthquake hit the area,"" said Mahmoud Hmaid, who was helping the efforts. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem Is Israelâs military
operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike. This video can not be played Gaza tower containing media offices collapses after Israeli strike The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of war crimes In a statement to the UN Security Council, Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence. He was speaking after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet which went on for several hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More from the UN Security Council meeting currently taking place online. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the violence was a threat to the whole region. ""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres In his opening remarks to the UN Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was ""actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire"". He described the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Mr Guterres also called on all parties ""to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed"". UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, told the online meeting that casualties on both sides were mounting and that the situation in Gaza was ""more dire by the day"". The UN was working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm, he said. Mr Wennesland said Gaza militants should stop firing rockets from civilians areas and Israeli authorities had to abide by international law, maintaining maximum restraint to spare civilians. The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beersheba have been hit by rocket fire from Gaza in the past hour. So far there have been no reports of major injuries but Israel's fire and rescue authority reports substantial damage to homes and cars, and to a synagogue in Ashkelon.  This is the scene of the synagogue, in a picture posted by Israel's fire and rescue services Earlier, Israel's military said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired from the Gaza Strip since the latest conflict began. Cars were hit in Ashdod and reports say a residential building under construction was also struck. This video was posted from the scene in Ashdod.  Allow Twitter content?

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago. In Israel, officials say 10 people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks. Several more rocket attacks have taken place on southern towns and cities today, but there are no details of casualties.

Here families on both sides of the border tell of their fear amid the daily bombardment. Israel has seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza, the military says. Major General Ori Gordin told reporters that since Monday, Hamas had fired about 3,000 rockets towards Israel. He said the rate of rocket launches surpassed previous attacks from Gaza and also from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Â© 2025 BBC.

But charity Crisis warned the funding ""will only scratch the surface"". The government said its Rough Sleeping Initiative had reduced rough sleeping by nearly a third compared to areas that have not taken part in the programme.

PokÃ©mon card sales halted over security concernsA major US chain acts after a customer pulled a gun in a fight over the collectible trading cards.US & Canada,"US retail giant Target is suspending in-store sales of PokÃ©mon and sports trading cards amid safety concerns as customers vie for the collectibles. Target, which has more than 1,900 outlets in the US, made the decision after a man drew a gun in a fight over cards outside a store in Wisconsin. ""The safety of our guests and our team is our top priority,"" the company said in a statement to US media. Sales of trading cards have rocketed amid the pandemic. The suspension of in-store sales is temporary, the company said, adding that online sales are not affected. Walmart, a top competitor to Target, says they have also seen increasing demand, but do not currently have plans to block sales. The 'insane' money in trading collectible cards Monsters, mania and the unstoppable march of PokÃ©mon A fight broke out in a car park outside a Target in Brookfield, Wisconsin, on 7 May, after four men allegedly assaulted another man over sports trading cards,reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,external.

No shots were fired, and the four men ranging in age from 23 to 35 fled and were later arrested.

"Doctors 'bullied for raising Covid safety fears'Doctors face action for speaking about work concerns before, during and after Covid, a union says.Wales","Doctors in Wales have faced bullying and disciplinary action for raising concerns over working conditions and safety, a union leader has said. Dr Phil Banfield, of BMA Wales, said doctors who complained about work, both before and during the Covid pandemic, were seen as ""troublemakers"". He said there are worries bullying among staff will get worse as longer post-Covid waiting lists are tackled. The Welsh government said bullying of NHS staff was ""entirely unacceptable"". Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists BAME NHS anti-bullying rules 'not fit for purpose' Dr Banfield, who is chairman of the BMA Welsh consultants' committee, said staff have faced the prospect of being victimised by colleagues, or even being forced to leave the Welsh NHS, for raising concerns over bullying or health and safety. He said: ""Staff are quite good at raising concerns, but they don't raise concerns if they're going get in trouble for it, or they sense nothing is going to happen. ""What happens is you think 'I can't be bothered'. ""Decent people develop a kind of learned helplessness and it means that people who keep raising concerns stand out."" Dr Phil Banfield says doctors are often victimised for raising concerns over working conditions He added: ""What happens then is the person that's raised the concerns is often victimised, either by colleagues or the health services themselves. ""They find themselves out on a limb. What happens then is the wrong people leave the health service."" He said doctors who complained about bullying or their working conditions and wished to go to tribunal were advised that they would win their case, but would never work in Wales again. Dr Banfield also said issues relating to both safety and bullying were prevalent in the early stages of the Covid pandemic last spring, particularly around the issue of PPE. ""There were some concerns, and we expressed some alarm very early on, that there was a discrepancy between what the PPE advice was and what our members' concerns were on the shop floor,"" he said. He said some doctors even had issues wearing masks away from the wards, in areas such as coffee rooms and corridors, before it became mandatory to wear them in hospitals. He said doctors in hospitals across Wales were stopped and told to remove their masks while wearing them in public areas away from the wards. Dr Banfield says doctors were across Wales were told to remove face masks in public areas of hospitals He added: ""On more than one occasion, more than one doctor was threatened with disciplinary action for saying 'I don't feel comfortable walking around without a mask on'."" Meanwhile, a survey by BMA Wales conducted in October 2020 found 63% of respondents who needed PPE said they were either not at all confident, or were only partly confident, that they would receive an appropriate fit test for PPE. Furthermore, 30% said they had not reported PPE concerns, as they felt no action would be taken by management. With waiting lists growing through the pandemic, Dr Banfield said there were concerns bullying would only get worse as Wales moved out of the pandemic. He said: ""The risk is, as the health service comes under pressure to get through the backlog, that bullying will become more prevalent and we've got some evidence of that already. Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists ""Staff are already exhausted and it will just result in people leaving the NHS."" BMA Wales is calling for the introduction of independent freedom-to-speak-up guardians to help tackle these issues for NHS staff. Specially appointed to report concerns, guardians are already in place in England and Scotland, offering staff the opportunity to speak in confidence. Dr Banfield said: ""The idea is that they're independent, it's not the BMA as the union harping on about something. It's someone who's independent saying 'this doesn't seem right to us as well'."" The Welsh government said it would consider introducing such guardians and a new policy was to be launched in June for the NHS with the aim of preventing bullying in the workplace. A spokesman added: ""Any form of discrimination, bullying and harassment within the NHS is entirely unacceptable and we take these matters very seriously. ""We continue to work with the NHS to tackle all forms of discrimination and expect all NHS Wales staff to be treated with dignity and respect. ""Policies are in place to ensure NHS organisations take action to address any concerns raised to them and all staff are encouraged to raise any worries. ""We are working with NHS employers and trade unions to explore how staff and patients can better raise any concerns about working practices or care, including considering the freedom to speak up model.""
