Spice Girls confirm 2019 UK stadium tour,"This video can not be played What do people really think of the announcement that the Spice Girls are going on tour? The Spice Girls have announced their first tour for a decade, with six UK stadium dates in June next year. Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Melanie Chisholm revealed details of the reunion tour in a video on social media on Monday. Victoria Beckham, however, will not be taking part. The girl group will kick off the tour at Manchester's Etihad Stadium on 1 June 2019, with tickets for all dates going on sale on Saturday at 10.30 GMT. The foursome will also perform in Coventry, Sunderland, Edinburgh and Bristol, finishing at London's Wembley Stadium. They will be supported by Jess Glynne. Girl Power: the Spice Girls are back as a foursome The video is in the style of a news bulletin, and sees the girls bickering over Geri's outfit before breaking into song - with a voiceover declaring the Spice Girls tour ""a shock announcement"". The press release said Victoria, who runs a multi-million pound fashion label, would not join the girls on tour due to ""business commitments"". In a statement, she said: ""Being in the Spice Girls was a hugely important part of my life and I wish my girls so much love and fun as they go back on tour, I know they will put on an amazing show and the fantastic fans past and present are going to have a wonderful time!"" Spice Girls reunion: Will it be the same without Posh? Earlier on Monday, Mel B announced there would also be a world tour to follow, adding that she still hoped Victoria would feature in some of the shows. ""It's just the four of us that are fully confirmed, but Vic might join us at some point,"" the star said on ITV's Loose Women. ""It'd be a shame if she didn't."" Scary Spice made a dig at Beckham with her attendance at Heidi Klum's Halloween party Last week, Mel B took a swipe at her bandmate by dressing up as Victoria for Halloween and holding a sign that read: ""No I am not going on tour."" Scary was joined by a friend dressed as David Beckham, who held a sign saying: ""Please, please, please do it for the Spice Girls fans."" Does sex addiction really exist? Brown ballet shoes made for first time HBO unimpressed by Trump's 'Thrones' meme Asked what Victoria made of the costume, Mel B said she thought she would find it funny, but also acknowledged the pair's rocky relationship. ""I think she found it a bit funny, but at the same time [there's a] bit of a love-hate relationship,"" she said. Following the announcement, Geri said: ""I am so excited, together we celebrate girl power with our fans and the next generation and everyone is welcome."" Jess Glynne tweeted her excitement at joining the iconic girl group on tour, saying it was going to ""kick off"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winner of final Big Brother series crowned,"The winner of the final series of reality TV show Big Brother has been named as Cameron Cole. The housemate beat Akeem Griffiths to win the Channel 5 programme, which has ended after its 19th series. Host Emma Willis struggled to hold back her tears as she opened the final, saying it had ""brought real people from all walks of life into our homes"". The final episode of the reality TV show drew in just over 670,000 viewers. In contrast, the final of the previous series in 2017 was watched by 1.11 million. Willis said that the programme had ""created a whole new genre of TV that changed popular culture forever"". Some of the highlights and best-known housemates since the programme began in 2000 featured in a montage to open the show, including first winner Craig Philips and the late Jade Goody. Former host Davina McCall had wished Willis and fellow presenter Rylan Clark-Neal a good send-off ahead of the final, saying: ""I know it is going to be hard tonight but I'm sending you so much love"". It was announced in September that the long-running reality programmes's 19th series would be its last. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US elections: Mid-term matters,"The political noise never quite stops in Washington DC - but this morning - one day before Americans head to the polls - it is at fever pitch. The heavens have opened and rush hour cars are gridlocked, which is good news for Conservative talk show hosts Mary and Vince who we're with for their Morning Call in. They're quoting Republican Senator Lindsay Graham who has begun the day with the words 'if you're Republican and you're not coming out to vote then you're legally dead'. For a Brit like me,  a sticker with a yellow Lib Dem bird or a green oak tree feels wildly partisan. Here the temperature starts off a lot hotter. Mary's first call is from Katie, a Republican woman who is complaining that her neighbour has asked her to take down her yard signs because they're making her cry. Katie sounds incensed. Mary is delighted. I ask Mary if she thinks the language people use is important. As a chat show host she says she's careful what she says - they work inside regulations like our Ofcom - but broadly she says, if someone incites violence then no, the person who acts upon it is the idiot. Not the guy who might have been joking around. Neither of us have mentioned Donald Trump. Why do so many Americans not vote? A really simple guide to the US mid-term elections The big election issue that's not Trump The president is not on the ballot this time around but he's acting as if he is. At a rally in Mississippi he told the crowds: ""Pretend I'm on the ballot - this whole thing is a referendum on me."" And in a way, he's right of course. If the Democrats win the house on Tuesday - by increasing their number of seats by more than 23 - then they gain control of the lower chamber. That means they could start impeachment proceedings against the president if they chose. The president's response to this threat is to try and get his base out to vote in what is normally an uninspiring moment of the electoral cycle. He's talking non stop about the migrant Caravan, he name-checks immigrants as ""illegals"" and he is reinventing the constitution with threats to take away birthright citizenship. He has to motivate people that got excited in 2016 but can't generally be bothered with the stuff in between. If he reminds people they should still be angry and scared, they will come back to the booth. Democratic candidate for California's 10th Congressional District Josh Harder talks with a supporter Across town I speak to Pat Thornton - a liberal talk show host this time who's show serves a predominantly black audience. She's studied Trump's language and says the key is in the repetition. I ask if she thinks Trump is clever, thoughtful with his language. Her answer surprises me. ""Absolutely"", she says. ""He's not only clever and thoughtful, but he actually strategizes based on language. I bet you that Trump will look up on the internet what are the most popular words associated with fear - he's a true strategist - and what he does is distract."" Trump is spawning a new breed of Republicans all trying to sound like him. A campaign ad by the Republican candidate for governor in Florida, Ron Desantis, shows his toddler daughter learning how to build Trump's wall. Then they snuggle up together to read a bed time story - which happens to be Trump's 'Art of the Deal'. In Virginia, I interview Republican Strategist Peter Wehner. He's worked for both Bush administrations and for Reagan too. But for the first time in his life, he's going to vote Democrat. He wants the Republicans to lose this time so that the party comes to its sense, and so that Trump loosens his grip on a party he says is turning nativist, nationalist in a way it wasn't a decade ago. Huge crowds have gathered to see Trump at rallies across the country The one thing you wont hear Trump mention at the rallies is healthcare. It's a number one priority for many Americans- but it is a problem he's readily admitted he finds too hard to solve. The Democrats, by contrast, want to talk of little else. A tangible reminder of what Obama achieved in his time in office. Curiously, you don't hear much Trump talk about the economy either- even though senior Republicans are pleading with him to do so. He thinks the economy is ""going great.. but sometimes its not that interesting to talk about"". Fear, in other words, is more engaging. And here's the problem for the Democrats. They don't know quite how to respond. In the face of rhetoric that is often false, inflammatory, but always memorable, what should they do? Michelle Obama petitioned her party to ""GO HIGH when they go low"". It's a lofty ideal. But increasingly there are Democrats who  - after two years of frustration - are more willing to play dirty. Former Attorney General Eric Holder was heard telling a crowd ""when they go low, we KICK em"". Republicans turned on him as if it was the crudest thing they'd ever heard. In 2018, the sound bites are getting punchier, the concentration span is getting shorter and the issues are in a dysmorphic meltdown- no one can see them for what they are. So - on election eve - its over to you, America. Which conversation do you want to have? The big US election issue that's not Trump Why do so many Americans not vote?

"Invincible, but for how much longer?","Though his name is not on the ballot anywhere across the US, make no mistake - these elections are ALL about Donald Trump. He has put himself right bang in the centre of the campaign, and has been hurtling round the country energetically in these final days, Air Force One the taxpayer-funded backdrop to these highly partisan occasions. He's been doing this in support of Republican candidates, yes - but ultimately making this a referendum on his presidency. Wherever possible, he has dictated the terms of debate. And no one dictates the terms of debate like he does. Presidents have always commanded attention. Theodore Roosevelt called the White House his ""bully pulpit"" - the place from which he could demand attention and advance his agenda. But Donald Trump has his own bully pulpit, 55 million Twitter followers and a penchant for saying the outrageous. You feel that everything in American life is a reaction to what Donald Trump has said, his followers adoring it, his opponents deploring it and the candidates actually on the ballot trying to get a word in edgeways. And this has generated real excitement in these elections - both for and against him. So far the number of people who've voted early is something like twice the number it was four years ago. That is staggering. Roosevelt used the platform that came with the presidency to push his agenda In some states, the number of ballots that have already been cast is nearing the total number of ballots cast in 2014, including on Election Day. And of course what the pollsters, what the analysts, what we in the media are trying to figure out is the biggest question - what does this augur? We don't know, but here are some pointers. What will the vote among minorities be? Will they turn out to vote in greater numbers than they did in 2016; and will they vote Democrat? Among women - 52% of white, college-educated women backed Trump in 2016 - latest polls suggest a massive lead for Democrats. That could make a huge difference in a lot of suburban House races. More women are running for office in these elections than ever before, partly in response to a president they perceive as misogynistic. This video can not be played The ""Pink Wave"": How women are shaping the 2018 US elections What about young people? They seem to be fired up; many seem hostile towards the president - but will they have the energy to get out of bed and go to the polling station? And will the president's supporters be as energised to vote as they were two years ago? Donald Trump does politics with one crucial psychological insight. Rage is an emotion that sticks around a lot longer than hope. So although he has a very good story to tell on the economy - growth is up, unemployment is down, consumer confidence is on the rise, taxes have been cut, the stock market has risen impressively - that is not what gees up his base. Feel-good politics only gets you so far. This video can not be played How Americans think Trump affects their life Much more potent (and much more toxic, according to his critics) is to stir fear over the caravan - the straggling group of people from Central America, who are winding their way up through Mexico - to ""invade"" America, according to the president. They are still hundreds of miles away, and are moving on foot - but Donald Trump has deployed thousands of troops to the border. His message is that only he will keep America safe from the foreign, disease-ridden, criminal, Isis-infiltrated hordes at the gate. He has also indicated that he will sweep away the 14th Amendment, that allows anyone born in the US to be entitled to an American passport. This he has promised to do by executive order, even though the overwhelming view of legal experts is you can't do that. Again, this looks as though it was said to fire up the base, rather than being a sober assessment of what the president is able to do and deliver. The Trump economy v the Obama economy A really simple guide to the US mid-term elections Trump's birthright plan: What we know These messages have left many - including several high-profile Republicans - distinctly queasy, deeply uneasy. He is accused of engaging in demagoguery and crude populism. TheWashington Post is trying to keep a record,externalof what it considers to be presidential untruths - and the machine counting those fibs/falsehoods/lies is overheating at having to work so hard. Democratic candidates have largely tried to ignore the issue of immigration, not always successfully, preferring to talk about healthcare, which ranks as a top issue among voters. But what if the president's tactics are vindicated? What if the Republicans hold onto the House and the Senate, and defy the laws of US politics, that the party of the sitting president always gets a kicking in the mid-term elections? It is no exaggeration to say that the direction America takes will hinge on these results. This video can not be played Confused by all the election talk? Our guide breaks down what you need to know If the Republicans hold onto both houses of Congress, against the odds, it will be total vindication for Donald Trump. He will be the political master of all he surveys. Who will try to stop him if he sacks Robert Mueller and disbands the Russia investigation? Who will stand in his way if he demands an escalation of his trade wars? Who will push back if he threatens to pull the US out of Nato? Who will stop him if he demands billions for the wall between the US and Mexico? What Republican is going to dare tell him he's wrong? But if the Democrats do well - and polls are coalescing round the proposition they could take control of the House of Representatives - then it's a very different story. The big US election issue that's not Trump Follow the US election on the BBC His fired-up opponents will wrap the White House up in red tape, subpoena-ing documents, demanding emails on the Brett Kavanaugh appointment, transcripts of what he said to Vladimir Putin, details of the president's tax returns that have never seen the light of day, increasing funding for the Mueller investigation, blocking funding for the president's pet projects - in essence, shackling him. And the aura of invincibility that has wrapped its arms around the New York billionaire since he took to that gold escalator in the summer of 2015 will have developed its first cracks. Suddenly he will appear beatable. But, but, but... I apologise that the dominant item of punctuation in this blog is the question mark. But as Jimmy Cliff first noted in the 1960s, andJohnny Nash reiterated in the 1970s,external, There Are More Questions Than Answers. And as for predictions of the outcome? You think I'm going to stick my neck out after what happened two years ago?! There. A question mark and an exclamation mark.

The big issue that's not about Trump,"Staff say some patients travel over six hours across the state to receive free treatment at WVHR Healthcare tops most lists of voters' concerns in the US mid-term elections, but it gets precious little coverage in the national media. At a clinic in West Virginia, patients and staff explain why they think the system is broken. Nearly all the streets in Charleston are quiet on this weekday afternoon, despite it being the state capital. The road to the clinic is lined with old gas stations and older houses in varying states of disrepair. In a nondescript brick building, 61-year-old Chevone Daly sits on an exam table in a white-walled room. She first came here in 2010, after an emergency appendectomy became infected. Without her own doctor to see, she was told: Go to the emergency room or go to the free clinic. Ms Daly tells me ""nobody"" she knows can afford healthcare anymore. Most patients at this clinic are like Ms Daly - America's working poor, who find themselves with nowhere to go and no money to spend when they fall ill. At West Virginia Health Right, providers and patients echo the same admonition - the system is broken. And changes introduced by President Barack Obama that were meant to serve as a safety net have left many still slipping through the cracks. As patients enter the clinic, a glass window plastered with flyers - reminders about wellness classes and prescriptions - greets them. And in the centre, a note reads: No matter what happens with the Affordable Care Act, we will remain open for business. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, was a Democratic answer to America's ever-increasing healthcare spending - still the highest in the world. Using state-run marketplaces, President Barack Obama's signature policy expanded insurance coverage to those unable to access programmes for the poor (Medicaid) and elderly (Medicare). Its most popular provision by far is the rule that insurers cannot deny coverage over pre-existing conditions like cancer, diabetes and pregnancy. Its least popular consequence has been steadily rising insurance costs. Thelatest ACA government report says,external2019 premiums are stabilising, more insurers are participating and average premiums have decreased by 1.5% for the first time since 2014. But, premiums for the second-lowest cost plan still increased 37% between 2017 and 2018. The Trump administration has taken credit for the drop, but some experts say it was due to higher insurance company profits from increasing premiums this year, and that Republican efforts to destabilise the ACA have ultimately made it costlier. Currently, 11.8m Americans have insurance through the ACA, but around 15.5% are still uninsured - up 2.8% from 2016. According to a new Pew Research Center study,external, more than half of Republicans and three-quarters of Democrats say the affordability of healthcare is a ""very big"" problem. Along with mobile dental and medical units, WVHR sees over 26,000 patients a year Founded in 1982, West Virginia Health Right (WVHR) is the state's largest free clinic, offering no-cost, holistic healthcare for the under-insured and uninsured. With a budget of around $3m (Â£2.2m) from grants and donations, the clinic provides over $15m of care annually. As one of the unhealthiest states in the nation, with the highest rate of drug overdoses, obesity and smoking, West Virginia has acutely felt the impacts of national healthcare policies. WVHR saw 21,000 patients before the ACA. After the law, that number dipped to 15,500, suggesting that fewer patients were in dire need - but that welcome news only lasted so long. ""Now we have 26,211 patients,"" says Mrs Angie Settle, 47, nurse practitioner and CEO of WVHR.  ""We've far exceeded where we were."" And they expect to keep growing as ACA costs rise. Mrs Settle says the ACA has been ""a horrible failure"". Angie Settle has worked at WVHR since 1997 - she became CEO four years ago, eager to continue the clinic's mission of accessible care At WVHR, 83% of patients have a job. Many purchased insurance through the marketplace at first, but were forced to drop it. The nurse practitioner says many of the insurance plans required patients to cover the first $5,000 to $10,000 of their costs. ""It might as well have been $5 million because these people are living paycheck to paycheck. It was totally beyond their reach,"" Mrs Settle says. ""You have people making $1500 a month, with rent, childcare and whatever else they have to do. And it's nothing to have one patient on six to eight medications."" Mrs Settle also notes that co-pays - the fixed amount insured patients pay - in these plans could be around $50 per service or medication. She shakes her head. ""When you multiply that, it's ridiculous."" At WVHR, no patient is expected to pay anything for their treatment or medications The ACA's high cost has been at the heart of the Republican attack on Democrats for years. Repealing the act was a cornerstone of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. With a Republican-controlled Washington, the last two years have seen a slow but steady dismantling of the ACA: the individual mandate was repealed, enrolment periods shortened, ad budgets slashed, reimbursement payments ended. The ACA has been hobbling along, but with high premium, prescription and deductible costs, fixing it is a key midterm issue. But the difference now is that Democrats are embracing it as their number one issue. According to a recent report by the Wesleyan Media Project,external, 50% of all Democratic ads in federal-level campaigns tackled healthcare - a stark contrast to Republicans' 21%. Last week, President Trump published an opinion piece warning voters that government-run healthcare would bring the country""dangerously closer to socialism"", and in June, his administration backed a lawsuit against the pre-existing conditions clause. But many Republicans up for re-election have scrubbed harsher critiques of the ACA from their campaign pages. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a congresswoman of Washington state, swapped her nearly 300-word statement on repealing the ""radical health care bill"" for two paragraphs on local policies. Rhonda Francis manages the 400 physician volunteers at the free clinic as well as all pharmacy orders Rhonda Francis, 49, WVHR's clinical and pharmacy coordinator, joined 19 years ago when she says turning patients away at retail pharmacies when they couldn't afford their co-pays took its toll. She described how some newly-insured clinic patients ended up self-regulating medications like insulin to avoid out-of-pocket payments - and ended up in the ER as a result. ""If the patient is going to go without and can't afford it, what's the point? They're just going to jack up hospital costs. Somebody's going to have to pay for it, eventually."" ""Healthcare should be universal across the line,"" she adds. ""How are you to know who's going to be able to pay what?"" In West Virginia, a precarious job climate has seen some residents making six-figures one day and being unemployed and uninsured the next. ""We have patients who've worked all their life and they're really sad when they come in here,"" Ms Francis says. ""They're like, 'I would never have thought I'd be in this situation.'"" The twists and turns of the US healthcare battle Bullets and bills: the cost of getting shot in America Toothless and uninsured in Virginia Prescription and out-of-pocket payment costs have made ACA insurance unaffordable for many As tensions rise, health policy analyst Paul Keckley believes America is near a tipping point. ""Going into 2020, presidential candidates will have to address specifically their plans to transform the system,"" he says. ""It'll basically boil down to one of two theories - healthcare is a fundamental right, or, healthcare is a marketplace."" Mr Keckley, who served as a mitigator between industry and lawmakers at the White House during the early stages of the ACA, adds that without a fix, the country will ""absolutely"" see debilitating cost increases for patients. Capping spending, like European systems do, will be key, he says. So will linking social services and healthcare - most comparable nations spend far more on preventive and primary services than the US. ""We call a lot of those 'welfare programmes', so they have a stigma, and yet we're finding out if people live in areas of food insecurity or have unclean air and water or high crime rates, guess what? Their care is going to be more costly and they're not going to be as healthy."" But fleshed out solutions from politicians are still few and far-between. When I ask WVHR patient Ms Daly what could fix healthcare for people like her, she looks down and quietly offers: ""Maybe more like what Canada's is?"" Progressive Democrats have been pushing a system like Canada's and Britain's- so-calledMedicare for All, as proposed by former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Funded by higher-taxes, the universal plan would expand America's pension programme to everyone, taking the burden of paying premiums, co-pays and deductibles out of the equation. It would cause US spending on healthcare to increase by more than $3tn according to one analysis - but if nothing changes with the present system, the US could spend over $5tn by 2026. Ricci Shannon, a cocktail server at the local casino, says she is uninsured, like many West Virginians her age A March Kaiser Health poll,externalfound 59% of Americans do favour a Medicare for All plan, including about a third of Republicans polled. One in 10 voters said a candidate's views on a national health plan will be the most important factor they consider. But keeping protections for those with pre-existing conditions could become the most important issue for any candidate. Last month,Kaiser polls,externalshowed 75% of the public were in favour of the policy. In West Virginia, Democrat Joe Manchin, up for re-election next month, has emphasised this in his campaign against Republican challenger Patrick Morrisey. His state will certainly feel the loss of the pre-existing conditions clause if Republicans end it. Indeed, there is a sense of ""panic"" among patients and staff at the clinic about losing that provision from the ACA. Many told me about the staggering rates of obesity, diabetes, substance abuse and mental health issues in West Virginia. As she sits in a dentist's chair on the second-floor of the clinic, 21-year-old Ricci Shannon, says West Virginians rarely think about their own health in terms of risk. ""It's such a financial issue for people and they live not-healthy lifestyles,"" she says. ""No one my age even thinks about it."" Margaret Grassie now works as a driver, taking patients to medical appointments ""I'm a person who fell through the cracks,"" says Margaret Grassie, 57, by way of introduction. ""And this clinic saved my life."" ""I woke up and my prescriptions were $1200 a month,"" she says. ""With the medications I take and the pre-existing conditions I have, there was no way. I couldn't afford it."" Despite working full-time, Ms Grassie could only afford catastrophic coverage from the ACA marketplace. That meant her policy applied just in drastic cases - ""I literally had to get hit by a bus,"" she explains. ""Donald Trump doesn't give a crap about me. Hillary Clinton didn't give a crap about me,"" Ms Grassie adds. ""We get written off."" She tells me West Virginians are scared of healthcare. She tells me of a friend, employed for 33 years, who cannot afford to see a doctor for even preventative care. ""[If] she quits her job, drops her income and ends up here, she gets the help she needs,"" Ms Grassie says, gesturing at the free clinic behind her. ""[People] are doing their jobs, showing up everyday for 33 years - and walk out with no insurance."" As the midterms approach, poll numbers show addressing the cracks and crevices of this health system remains the number one issue for voters, regardless of party. ""It's gonna take a miracle,"" Ms Grassie says with a laugh. ""But I think the ACA is a good place to start - fixing it."" Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins .

London violence 'to take 10 years to solve',"Jay Hughes was stabbed to death in a premeditated attack at a chicken shop in south-east London It could take a generation to solve London's violent crime problem, the city's mayor has warned. Two teenage boys and two men have been stabbed to death in the city in the last five days, including 15-year-old Jay Hughes. Mayor Sadiq Khan told theBBC's Today programmeto ""really make significant progress can take up to 10 years"". Home Office minister Victoria Atkins said combating violent crime ""isn't just about police numbers"". There have been 118 homicides in the capital this year, including 73 stabbings and 12 shootings, compared to 116  for the whole of last year. Jay Hughes, 15, was stabbed to death in a chicken shop on Thursday and Malcolm Mide-Madariola, 17, was killed outside a Tube station on Friday. Met Police commander Stuart Cundy said there were ""hundreds of additional duty officers on the streets"". This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? In September, a London Violence Reduction Unit was set up mirroring the approach taken in Glasgow, where violence is treated as a public health issue and ""a disease infecting communities"". According to City Hall figures police coverage in London is at its lowest rate in 20 years with 3.3 police officers for every thousand Londoners - the lowest rate since 1998 and 19% below 2010. Local leaders need to be more successful in lobbying the government for extra money for policing, Mr Khan said. Boy held over stab death at Tube station Boy, 15, fatally stabbed in chicken shop The mayor said children as young as primary school age are now carrying knives and warned it could take ""a generation"" to solve the problem. He added: ""They saw in Scotland what we're seeing in London which is children in primary school thinking not only is it OK to carry a knife, but it gives them a sense of belonging, joining a criminal gang, it makes them feel safer. ""We need to use all resources at our disposal to address this horror."" Mrs Atkins said the Home Office was taking a ""wrap around approach"" to tackling violent crime. ""Drugs is a major player in this rise, we know that serious organised crime is a major factor as well,"" she added. ""Which is why we are not just focusing on serious violence strategy, but also serious organised crime strategy to hit both ends of the violent crime cycle.""

1982 Hyde Park bomb suspect arrested,"John Downey has been arrested over the murder of two soldiers in Northern Ireland in 1972 A man who was accused of the murders of four soldiers in the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bombing has been arrested. John Downey, 66, is to be charged with the murder of two other soldiers in Northern Ireland in 1972. UDR members Alfred Johnston and James Eames were killed in a bomb attack in Enniskillen. Mr Downey was due to stand trial in 2014 over the Hyde Park attack, but the trial collapsed because he was wrongly told he was not wanted by police. Four soldiers and seven horses were killed in the Hyde Park attack The 1972 double murder investigation was re-opened by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) four years ago, shortly after the Hyde Park bomb trial collapsed. A judgement by Mr Justice Sweeney in the Hyde Park case revealed that police had uncovered evidence linking Mr Downey to the Enniskillen attack. But in 1985, prosecutors decided not to seek his extradition from the Republic of Ireland, after evidence alleged to have linked him to the bombing went missing. A fresh file on the killings was submitted to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in September 2014, and a decision was taken to charge Mr Downey. He was arrested at his home in County Donegal by Irish police on Monday, using a European Arrest Warrant. The PSNI confirmed detectives from An Garda Siochana (in a joint operation with the PSNI) had arrested a 66-year-old man in Donegal on suspicion of the murder of two UDR soldiers in 1972 and on suspicion of aiding and abetting an explosion. Mr Downey is due to appear at Dublin High Court on Tuesday for an extradition hearing. The PSNI is seeking to have him extradited to Northern Ireland. If their request is granted, he will be charged with murders of Alfred Johnston and James Eames when he is in PSNI custody. The PPS said the families of the two UDR soldiers are being kept informed of developments. The Hyde Park attack on 20 July 1982 killed Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. Mr Downey's trial collapsed after it emerged he had been sent a so-called ""on the runs"" letterwhich said he was not wanted for arrest, questioning or charge by the police. This video can not be played David Cameron: Downey ""should never have received the letter"" The news that he would not face trial prompted an immediate outcry, with then-prime minister David Cameron telling the Commons that the letter he received in error had been a ""dreadful mistake"". The Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement of 1998meant anyone convicted of paramilitary crimes was eligible for early release. However, this did not cover those suspected of such crimes, nor did it cover people who had been charged or convicted but who had escaped from prison. Negotiations continued after the signing of the agreement between Sinn FÃ©in and the government over how to deal with those known as On the Runs. Sinn FÃ©in sought a scheme that would allow escaped prisoners and those who were concerned they might be arrested to return to the UK, but a formal legal solution proved difficult to establish in the face of strong unionist opposition. Against this backdrop, the IRA had still not put its weapons beyond use and Sinn FÃ©in needed grassroots republicans to continue supporting the peace process. Families of the four victims of the Hyde Park bombing are currently suing Mr Downey. They are taking a civil action, seeking financial compensation and a finding that he was liable for what happened. In 1974, Mr Downey was convicted by an Irish court of IRA membership and served time in Portlaoise prison.

US warns of 'relentless' pressure on Iran,"This video can not be played Iranians are already feeling the effects of the sanctions Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned that the US will exert ""relentless"" pressure on Iran unless it changes its ""revolutionary course"". His comments came hours after the Trump administration restored all sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, targeting core parts of Iran's economy. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani earlier struck a defiant tone, saying the country will ""continue selling oil"". ""We will proudly break the sanctions,"" he told economic officials. Mr Pompeo told reporters: ""The Iranian regime has a choice: it can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble."" How Iranians are feeling the impact of sanctions Trump re-imposes Iran sanctions: Now what? What nappies tell us about Iran's economic woes Iran nuclear deal: Key details He said more than 20 nations had already cut their oil intake from the Islamic Republic, and its exports had fallen by a million barrels a day. European countries which are still party to the 2015 accord have said they will help businesses bypass the sanctions. But there are doubts about how successful this will be. US President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the nuclear accord earlier this year, calling it the ""worst deal ever negotiated"". The agreement offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for reducing its nuclear development. The global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, says Iran has complied with it. President Trump has said he wants to get Iran back to the negotiating table. His administration also wants to stop what it calls Tehran's ""malign"" activities - including cyber attacks, ballistic missile tests, and support for terror groups and militias in the Middle East. Mr Trump has taken a more aggressive approach to Iran than his predecessor, Barack Obama The president believes his ""maximum pressure"" strategy is working, but said on Monday that he wants to impose sanctions gradually to prevent a spike in energy prices. ""I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately,"" he told journalists, ""but it would cause a shock to the market. I don't want to lift oil prices."" The US state department said that three civil nuclear projects set up in Iran through the 2015 deal would be allowed to continue, ""under the strictest scrutiny"". It said ""temporary"" waivers had been granted, without giving a timeframe. The US and Iran have been arch-foes since the Islamic revolution in 1979. Since then, Iran has provided arms and financial support to militant groups active in the Middle East and further afield. Some of these groups, such as Lebanon's Hezbollah, have carried out devastating attacks, including on a military barracks in Beirut in 1983, which killed 241 US service personnel and 58 French paratroopers. Iran denied being behind that attack. Profile: Lebanon's Hezbollah The US has also accused Iran of direct involvement in plotting or carrying out attacks - from bombings to assassinations. According to a report by the US State Department, since 2012, Iran has spent $16bn on proxy groups in the region as well as support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Iran accepts neither the US allegations, nor its designation as an exporter of terror. The US reinstated a raft of sanctions in August, but analysts say this latest round is by far the most significant. More than 700 individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft are now on the sanctions list, including major banks, oil exporters and shipping companies. This video can not be played Iran gripped by despair as country faces economic turmoil, drought The Brussels-based Swift network for making international payments has confirmed it will cut off links with some Iranian banks, isolating Iran from the international financial system. However, the Trump administration has granted temporary exemptions to eight countries to continue importing Iranian oil - China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. This is significant as China and India are among Iran's largest trading partners. Even before the US sanctions were reimposed, Iran's economy had had a difficult year, with its currency, the rial, plummeting against the dollar, driving up the price of basic goods. Mr Trump's national security adviser John Bolton announced on Monday that even more measures could follow soon. By Kasra Naji, Special Correspondent, BBC Persian The sweeping US sanctions will be debilitating to the government's day-to-day running of the country. They will also be disastrous for ordinary people who are already reeling under the weight of rising prices, shortages, and the rapidly falling value of the rial. All this will put President Rouhani under considerable strain. Iran's hardliners see a chance to force a change of government, arguing extraordinary conditions require extraordinary solutions. But the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is not so sure. Taking on the running of the country under these conditions could be a poisoned chalice for him and for the hardliners he supports. The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts Can Iran survive sanctions? The UK, Germany and France - which are among the five countries still committed to the nuclear pact - have all promised to support European firms that do ""legitimate business"" with Iran. They have set up an alternative payment mechanism - or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - that will help companies trade without facing US penalties. However, analysts doubt this will lessen the impact of sanctions on Iran, given the importance of the US to global trade. Mr Pompeo said more than 100 international companies had withdrawn from Iran because of the looming sanctions. And even if firms can use the SPV, any US company it does business with could face punishment. Another signatory to the nuclear deal, China, has said it regrets the re-imposition of sanctions and that its lawful trade with Iran should be respected.

Race rows mire US elections homestretch,"Media mogul Oprah Winfrey travelled to Georgia to campaign with Stacey Abrams ahead of the mid-term election Race-baiting allegations have mired the home stretch of the US mid-term elections, turning it into one of the ugliest campaigns in recent times. US networks have withdrawn President Donald Trump's ad about a cop-killing illegal immigrant. Meanwhile, racist automated calls targeted prominent African-American candidates in Florida and Georgia. Control of Congress is up for grabs in Tuesday's poll, which is being seen as a referendum on Mr Trump. His ability to govern in the final two years of his term will hinge upon the outcome of votes for all 435 seats in the House, and 35 of the 100 Senate seats. All you need to know ahead of mid-terms Your simple guide to the US mid-terms The Republican president - who has been holding barnstorming rallies nationwide, even though he is not up for re-election this year - campaigns in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri on Monday. In the weeks leading up to the polls, Mr Trump has escalated his rhetoric about his opponents and divisive issues such as immigration, warning voters against Democratic ""socialism"" and ""an invasion"" of criminals from the Central American migrant caravan. His sharp language has appeared to energise conservative voters, but critics have condemned Mr Trump's tactics as fear-mongering. Mr Trump has held rallies across the country to ramp up his base ahead of the elections. On Monday, Facebook, NBC and even the president's favourite network, Fox News, announced they would stop broadcasting a 30-second ad paid for by his campaign. The clip falsely claimed Democrats let into the US an undocumented Mexican immigrant who murdered two California sheriff's deputies in 2014. The president last week tweeted the clip, but CNN refused to air it at the weekend, calling it ""racist"". Asked about the ad on Monday, Mr Trump told a journalist: ""A lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of times."" The A-Z of US mid-terms Can we tell yet if the Democrats will win? What's it all about? Why US mid-term elections matter Automated phone calls in Florida and Georgia have dragged an already toxic political campaign to new lows, targeting two candidates who could become the first African-American governors of those states. One message falsely claiming to be from US celebrity Oprah Winfrey called Stacey Abrams in Georgia ""a poor man's Aunt Jemima"" among other racial slurs, referencing a controversial image of a black woman depicted as a slavery-era ""mammy"" figure. Calls in Florida targeting Andrew Gillum featured a background of jungle and chimpanzee noises. They came days after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, speaking in Florida, described the election as ""cotton-pickin' important"" - a term with overtones of slavery. According to the Wesleyan Media Project,external, no other US general election in the last decade has seen close to so many attack ads as this one. Mr Obama urged Floridians to put a check on angry rhetoric President Trump is galvanising supporters by arguing that a Democratic takeover of Congress would trigger an influx of illegal immigrants and a crime wave. The president has also been warning the Democrats will destroy a healthy US economy if they win the keys to power. Most Democratic candidates have tended to avoid directly confronting the president, focusing instead on ""kitchen table"" issues such as healthcare and economic inequality. The party hopes the president's hard-line rhetoric will help them win over younger voters, suburban moderates and minorities to the polls. The Democrats have rolled out their biggest gun: former President Barack Obama, who travelled to Virginia on Monday to get out the vote for its candidates. ""The character of this country is on the ballot,"" he said. Turnout is traditionally low in the US mid-terms, with the 2014 election seeing a post-war record low of just 37%. But analysts say a sharp rise is likely this year. Some 34.3 million people have already voted and the real number is probably higher, according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source. The figure in 2014 was just 27.5 million. People can vote early both in person and by post In Texas, early voting has exceeded the entire turnout in 2014. However, thunderstorms are forecast for Tuesday along the eastern coast and snowstorms in the Midwest, which could dampen turnout. Pollsters say Democrats may win the 23 seats they need to take over the House of Representatives, and possibly 15 or so extra seats. However, the Democrats are expected to fall short of the two seats they need to wrest control of the Senate from Republican hands. Governors are also being chosen in 36 out of 50 states. The first polls close at 23:00 GMT (18:00 EST) on Tuesday.

Now what for Iran?,"Donald Trump has signed a document that reinstates sanctions against Iran The re-imposition of the full panoply of sanctions against Iran that were waived under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear agreement marks a high-point for President Donald Trump's foreign policy. He had long objected to the agreement, which was seen by most analysts as one of the more significant foreign policy achievements of his predecessor Barack Obama. Now the Trump administration's goal is to apply maximum pressure against the Iranian regime to compel it to think again and change what the Americans see as its malign behaviour in the region. So what measures exactly are being re-imposed and what will their likely impact be? Will this mark the final demise of the JCPOA? And what is the real US strategy behind the sanctions effort? Not all of these questions have clear or definitive answers. Who does business with Iran? Does US 'Plan B' on Iran risk war? The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts The sanctions that are being re-imposed are the most damaging to the Iranian economy - targeting its oil sales, its wider energy industry, shipping, banking, insurance and so on.  In large part these are what is known in the trade as ""secondary sanctions"", in that they are intended to apply pressure on other countries to prevent them trading with Tehran. The idea is to dissuade them from purchasing Iranian oil, which brings in a huge proportion of Iran's revenue. In addition, sanctions will be imposed upon hundreds of named entities and individuals. UN inspectors say Iran, under Hassan Rouhani, has abided by the 2015 agreement There will not be a sudden collapse in Iranian revenues. Indeed much of the damage has already been done. The pressure has been building since President Trump's original announcement last May. US officials assert that since then, Iran's daily oil exports have dropped significantly - by more than one third. Foreign companies have had to decide in effect what is more important to them: business with Iran or business with the United States. Many major players have already announced the termination of projects in Iran. Knowing the sanctions were coming, many business have already made their decisions. Several of Iran's customers may continue to purchase oil and look set to be granted waivers by the United States to do so. In the past - under the Obama administration - these were known as ""significant reduction exemptions"" and meant, in effect, that if countries promised to reduce their oil purchases from Iran significantly, then the administration did not seek to punish them for conducting some trade. This made good sense as it helped US allies like Taiwan, South Korea and Japan manage their energy problems while falling into line with the broad thrust of US policy. India also got exemptions, and China reduced its purchases under a slightly different arrangement. The Trump administration has already signalled that it too is willing to grant countries like India and several others such waivers. National Security Adviser John Bolton noted this week that: ""We want to achieve maximum pressure (on Iran), but we don't want to harm friends and allies either."" Previously, the Trump administration had insisted that oil imports from Iran had to be reduced to zero. Mr Trump (photographed at 2015 event) has been a vocal opponent to the JCPOA since its signing China's behaviour - Beijing is a major trading partner for Tehran - is going to be key. It too is likely to continue buying Iranian oil without facing sanctions. There is a logic here. Is the US really going to hit Beijing with damaging secondary sanctions which would effectively mean risking an economic war, given the difficult state of the wider trade relationship between the two countries? Probably not. The US must also be concerned about the broader stability of the international oil market, not least given the political uncertainties in Saudi Arabia. Indeed, it is the Saudis who may be expected to pump more oil to make up for cut-backs in Iranian crude. A further uncertainty comes from the European Union's efforts to bolster the Iran nuclear agreement by seeking to protect its own companies from US sanctions.There is also talk about establishing an alternative payments systemthat would not involve either the dollar or US banks. But experts in Washington - even those critical of the Trump administration's approach - remain highly sceptical that EU efforts, in the short-term, will make much economic difference. National Security Adviser John Bolton has been particularly strong in his rhetoric toward Iran The general view is that the EU's pronouncements have largely been intended to send a powerful political signal to Tehran of their opposition to President Trump's approach. That is not to say that they would not like to see constraints on Iran's missile programmes or a change in Tehran's regional behaviour. But they believe that the JCPOA (remember France, Germany, the UK and the EU are all signatories) remains a useful constraint on Iran's nuclear activities and should not be overthrown lightly. Is the Iran nuclear deal about to collapse? Iran nuclear deal: Key details John Bolton warns Iran of 'hell to pay' if crossed So is the JCPOA now doomed? Not necessarily. Some experts believe that if China and other customers like India continue to buy a reasonable level of Iranian oil and if the EU maintains its political support for the deal, then Iran may possibly stick with it for the time being. However, once sanctions begin to bite - perhaps causing further economic unrest - then the fate of the JCPOA will depend upon the complex political battles between moderates and hardliners in Tehran. All this begs the question: what really is the Trump administration's goal in all of this? Ostensibly it is to bring Iran back to the negotiating table to get a better and more comprehensive deal. But many analysts feel that such a move from Tehran is highly unlikely and the scope of US demands suggests that the Trump administration's real goal is somehow to produce regime change in Tehran. This video can not be played Mohammad Javad Zarif praises European efforts to preserve the nuclear deal As one expert critic of the Trump policy told me: ""At the end of the day, the problem is the administration has no real plan. They know how to make use of one tool, i.e. sanctions, but they lack any semblance of a broader strategy."" Jarrett Blanc, a former Obama era official who handled the implementation of the JCPOA, argues that by reneging on the deal, ""the US has blown its ability to make credible promises"". So for the immediate future there will be a messy situation where Iran tries to weather the sanctions pressure: its oil sales will be reduced significantly but it will still retain some of its customers. The US will persevere with its current approach seeking to isolate Tehran - but without the broad international backing that the sanctions regime garnered prior to the negotiation of the JCPOA. Few analysts believe that Iran's foreign policy in the region will change much. They say it is based on strategic and ideological concerns, rather than simply economic ones, and in any case its activities in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza are probably not expensive enough to trump these other priorities. Iran is a major backer of Syria and its leader, President Bashar al-Assad Nonetheless the Trump administration is clearly determined to up the pressure on Tehran. It especially wants to choke off funding for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps responsible for conducting many of Iran's operations abroad. This is part of a broader policy of containment if you like, in which Israel (through its actions in Syria) and Saudi Arabia (through its campaign in Yemen) are also involved. But Israel is already running up against problems with Russia, and there is a huge question mark over the future of the Saudi war in Yemen. So much remains uncertain about the Trump approach. Can he win over allies, might he actually apply sanctions to those countries trading with Iran, and how long will the waivers on oil purchases actually last? Just what will be the impact upon Iranian society and its politics? And amidst this maelstrom can the JCPOA survive in any meaningful form? But there is also a wider long-term question here about US policy which relates to Washington's growing recourse to the tool of economic sanctions. Many believe that they are being over-used and that the threat of secondary sanctions is counter-productive to other US goals. It is not just the Europeans: Russia and China are also talking about developing alternative international payment systems. We could look back - perhaps a decade from now - and say that this was the moment when the utility of US economic sanctions as a diplomatic weapon began to erode.

Can we tell yet who has the edge?,"This is it. After primaries, debates, countless polls, months of campaigning and endless speculation, the US mid-term elections are almost here. In some states, early voting has been going on for weeks and turnout has surpassed previous records for non-presidential years. At this point Democrats are cautiously optimistic of their chances to take back some legislative power. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi has gone so far as to flat-out state that her party will win control of the House of Representatives. Such an outcome would have immediate and drastic implications for the president's ability to advance his political agenda and Democratic oversight of his administration. The ""mid-term wave"" - a sweeping electoral triumph that reshapes the national political map - is a recurring phenomenon in US politics. Is one about to crash on Republicans in Washington? For the purposes of this analysis, a mid-term wave is where one party picks up a combination of more than 20 seats in the US House of Representatives and the Senate. That's happened eight times in the last 70 years, notably in 1994 (a Republican wave against Bill Clinton) and 2010 (one against Barack Obama). Today, the Republican Party is near a modern-day high in seats in the House of Representatives, with a 241-to-194 seat majority, so it could be poised for a tumble. The Senate terrain may be friendlier for Republicans, with Democrats defending 10 seats in states Mr Trump won in 2016, but this year's political atmosphere is such that an electoral storm could be brewing. Democrats have the political wind at their back, but intervening events - like the fight over confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court - have the potential to shake things up. What is the current state of play? Here are the measurements - and the history lessons - that will give us clues. Money makes the (political) world go round. Levels of cash pouring in for candidates, parties and independent groups are an indication of electoral muscle for advertising, organisation and get-out-the-vote efforts. They're also a reflection of the enthusiasm of each side's donor base. This video can not be played Why are US election campaigns never-ending? Ask America has the answer There's one component of campaign fundraising that tracks particularly closely with every wave election in the last 25 years, a period during which the role of money in political campaigns skyrocketed. In the Republican wave of 1994, individual donations to House candidates - which are limited under campaign finance law - tilted toward Republicans. The party then took control of the chamber for the first time since 1955. In 2006, the fundraising advantage flipped to the Democrats, as did control of Congress. Four years later, Republicans were back in the money - and back in charge of the House. In 2014, they built their biggest majority there in 83 years and won control of the Senate, as well. ""In mid-term waves, long-time incumbents can get kind of caught flat-footed when they're faced with a well-funded, competitive race,"" says Geoffrey Skelley of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. 2018 outlook: What was once a remarkable fund-raising advantage for Democratic House of representative candidates has become an astounding one. The latest figures show them more than doubling the Republican amount of contributions from individual donors. As of 2 November, they have brought in $649m (Â£500m), against ""only"" $312m for Republicans. Democratic enthusiasm is translating into open pocketbooks - and a rising financial tide is lifting all Democratic ships. It's not all gloom and doom for Republicans, however. They have plenty of deep-pocketed donors pouring their own money into independent expenditures, and the Republican Party itself is flooding money into key races across the US. When it comes to grass-roots enthusiasm and small-money donors, however, all the energy and excitement is clearly coming from the left. In the past month alone, Democrats have hit the accelerator and left the Republicans behind in a cloud of dust. Mid-term elections are said to be a referendum on the incumbent president. When presidents are unpopular, voters take out their frustration on their party in Congress. If the chief executive is riding high, the party is rewarded (or, at least, not excessively punished). A look at the Gallup presidential approval poll over the last 60 years tends to bear this out. Every time a president faced a net-negative rating in the month before the mid-terms - Ronald Reagan in 1982, Bill Clinton in 1994, George Bush in 2006 and Barack Obama in 2010 and 2014 - it meant lights-out for his party at the ballot box in November. The exceptions are also enlightening. Gerald Ford was plus-24 in October 1974, but his numbers - following his controversial pardoning of Richard Nixon the month before - were poised to take a nosedive, declining 15 points over the next three months. Democrats gained 48 seats in the House and five in the Senate - what would be known as the ""Watergate Class"" of Congress. Lyndon Johnson was around the break-even point in 1966, but unease about the Vietnam War and civil rights unrest, combined with his party's inflated congressional numbers after a big victory two years earlier, set Democrats up for a tumble. 2018 outlook: Donald Trump's approval ratings have been remarkably stable, given the tumult of his first year-and-a-half in office. He didn't have much of a ""honeymoon"" period following his election, so there haven't been many sharp changes. At the end of August, the president stood at 40% approval. On the eve of the mid-term elections his approval isâ¦ 40% That's not a good sign for Republicans. The president has defied political gravity in the past, but his unpopularity could be a weight that sinks his party on Tuesday. This involves asking people simply which party's House candidate they would support in the election. There are 435 individual House of Representatives races in every mid-term election, meaning at least 870 candidates from the two major parties plus a handful of prominent independents and third-party politicians. Each race is unique, every constituency has its own particular interests, and each congressional district has a demographic identity as unique as a fingerprint. It therefore seems implausible that the collective outcome of all those races could be boiled down to a simple poll asking whether a voter would prefer a nameless Democrat or a faceless Republican. The generic ballot question, however, has proven to be a remarkably accurate predictor of mid-term election prospects for the two major parties. ""The national generic ballot picks up the national political climate,"" says Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University who has crafted an election prediction model based largely on the generic ballot polling numbers. ""I view it as a measure of the political mood of the electorate."" In 1958, 1982 and 2006, the Democratic generic ballot advantage ballooned before the party's wave-election victories. When the Republican waves of 1994, 2010 and 2014 swept through, the Democratic advantage narrowed to low single digits (or even, at times during the election run-up, disappeared entirely). This year, Abramowitz says, the tipping point for Democratic control of the House sits around a seven-point generic ballot advantage. A lead bigger than that, and a wave could be on the horizon. 2018 outlook: The Democratic generic ballot lead has shifted over the course of the past year. In the late spring it narrowed to the point that it appeared Republicans were in excellent shape for November. By mid-September, however, the Democratic lead approached double-digits. That trend tailed off a bit, but the current eight-point margin is on the lower edge of where it has to be for a blue wave, even if it falls short of a tsunami. A simple guide to what these elections are The evangelical women who reject Trump Democrats dazzled by rising star in Texas Four ways US mid-terms are undemocratic Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing positive economic numbers as a reason why they deserve another two years of unified control in Washington. Historically, however, a growing economy is no guarantee of success for the president's party. In 1994, when the governing Democrats ceded Congress, the economy was expanding at more than 4%, although unemployment was a bit higher than the current mark, at 5.8%. In other wave years, 2006 and 2014, the economy wasn't in bad shape either. A struggling economy, on the other hand, can be a death sentence for the incumbent party's mid-term prospects. In 1958, Republicans in Congress faced a bloodbath largely due to that year's recession, which included a modern-record -10% first-quarter GDP contraction. Negative growth in 1974 and 1982 also probably contributed to Republican losses those years. ""You'd rather have a strong economy than a bad economy, but it doesn't mean you're going to escape the wrath of voters,"" says Abramowitz. 2018 outlook: Third-quarter gross domestic product growth is down a bit, after the second quarter hit 4.2%. Combined with unemployment at a 49-year low and signs of wage growth, however, the economic numbers are undoubtedly good. Mr Trump has decided to make immigration control his closing argument to mid-term voters - to the dismay of some Republicans who would prefer he focus laser-like on the robust economy. If history is a guide, however, the president may be right to look for a different issue, as a growing economy is no guarantee of electoral success. Set aside all the poll numbers, economic figures and expert analyses. Who has their finger on the pulse of the political climate better than anyone? Probably the politicians themselves. They're the ones whose names are on the ballots, and they're the ones who could be out of a job if a wave hits. Facing the prospect of embarrassing electoral defeat, some politicians may opt to ease into early retirement or get a head-start on colleagues searching for post-public-service gainful employment. ""We know historically that open seats are more difficult to defend,"" says Skelley. ""And because they're more difficult to defend, that gives the party that doesn't control them a better shot."" A look at modern retirement trends shows a mixed picture. The retirement figures in 2010 gave little hint of the carnage in store for Mr Obama's party. In 1994, however, a surge of Democratic retirements may have foreshadowed big Republican gains that autumn. 2018 outlook: If 1994's retirements were a harbinger of doom for Democrats, 2018's numbers could spell trouble for Republicans. Several key committee chairs and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan have already joined what's become a modern record for retirements from a majority party - a telling sign that they think Republicans may not be a majority much longer. Several incumbents - on the left and right - also were forcibly retired, as they lost primary races to grass-roots challengers. That could be another indication of an anti-incumbent mood in the electorate that, because there are more Republicans running for re-election than Democrats, could help fuel a Washington power shift.

Race rows mire US mid-terms homestretch,"Media mogul Oprah Winfrey travelled to Georgia to campaign with Stacey Abrams ahead of the mid-term election Race-baiting allegations have mired the home stretch of the US mid-term elections, turning it into one of the ugliest campaigns in recent times. US networks have withdrawn President Donald Trump's ad about a cop-killing illegal immigrant. Meanwhile, racist automated calls targeted prominent African-American candidates in Florida and Georgia. Control of Congress is up for grabs in Tuesday's poll, which is being seen as a referendum on Mr Trump. His ability to govern in the final two years of his term will hinge upon the outcome of votes for all 435 seats in the House, and 35 of the 100 Senate seats. All you need to know ahead of mid-terms Your simple guide to the US mid-terms The Republican president - who has been holding barnstorming rallies nationwide, even though he is not up for re-election this year - campaigns in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri on Monday. In the weeks leading up to the polls, Mr Trump has escalated his rhetoric about his opponents and divisive issues such as immigration, warning voters against Democratic ""socialism"" and ""an invasion"" of criminals from the Central American migrant caravan. His sharp language has appeared to energise conservative voters, but critics have condemned Mr Trump's tactics as fear-mongering. Mr Trump has held rallies across the country to ramp up his base ahead of the elections. On Monday, Facebook, NBC and even the president's favourite network, Fox News, announced they would stop broadcasting a 30-second ad paid for by his campaign. The clip falsely claimed Democrats let into the US an undocumented Mexican immigrant who murdered two California sheriff's deputies in 2014. The president last week tweeted the clip, but CNN refused to air it at the weekend, calling it ""racist"". Asked about the ad on Monday, Mr Trump told a journalist: ""A lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of times."" The A-Z of US mid-terms Can we tell yet if the Democrats will win? What's it all about? Why US mid-term elections matter Automated phone calls in Florida and Georgia have dragged an already toxic political campaign to new lows, targeting two candidates who could become the first African-American governors of those states. One message falsely claiming to be from US celebrity Oprah Winfrey called Stacey Abrams in Georgia ""a poor man's Aunt Jemima"" among other racial slurs, referencing a controversial image of a black woman depicted as a slavery-era ""mammy"" figure. Calls in Florida targeting Andrew Gillum featured a background of jungle and chimpanzee noises. They came days after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, speaking in Florida, described the election as ""cotton-pickin' important"" - a term with overtones of slavery. According to the Wesleyan Media Project,external, no other US general election in the last decade has seen close to so many attack ads as this one. Mr Obama urged Floridians to put a check on angry rhetoric President Trump is galvanising supporters by arguing that a Democratic takeover of Congress would trigger an influx of illegal immigrants and a crime wave. The president has also been warning the Democrats will destroy a healthy US economy if they win the keys to power. Most Democratic candidates have tended to avoid directly confronting the president, focusing instead on ""kitchen table"" issues such as healthcare and economic inequality. The party hopes the president's hard-line rhetoric will help them win over younger voters, suburban moderates and minorities to the polls. The Democrats have rolled out their biggest gun: former President Barack Obama, who travelled to Virginia on Monday to get out the vote for its candidates. ""The character of this country is on the ballot,"" he said. Turnout is traditionally low in the US mid-terms, with the 2014 election seeing a post-war record low of just 37%. But analysts say a sharp rise is likely this year. Some 34.3 million people have already voted and the real number is probably higher, according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source. The figure in 2014 was just 27.5 million. People can vote early both in person and by post In Texas, early voting has exceeded the entire turnout in 2014. However, thunderstorms are forecast for Tuesday along the eastern coast and snowstorms in the Midwest, which could dampen turnout. Pollsters say Democrats may win the 23 seats they need to take over the House of Representatives, and possibly 15 or so extra seats. However, the Democrats are expected to fall short of the two seats they need to wrest control of the Senate from Republican hands. Governors are also being chosen in 36 out of 50 states. The first polls close at 23:00 GMT (18:00 EST) on Tuesday.

Michelin factory to close with loss of 850 jobs,"About 850 workers are employed at Michelin's Dundee factory Michelin is to close its tyre factory in Dundee, with the loss of about 850 jobs, confirming that it will leave the city by 2020. The company said the factory was ""unsuitable"" given current market conditions and it would not be financially viable to invest further. Workers were informed of the decision during a short meeting at the plant at about 08:00 on Tuesday. They were sent home and told that production will resume on Thursday. Some employees told BBC Scotland they were angry that they first learned about the decision to close the factory from the media. The union Unite has said the closure would be a ""hammer-blow"" to the city. Michelin said the Dundee site, which opened in 1971 and specialised in smaller tyres, has suffered because of a shift in the market towards low-cost products from Asia. The company praised its Dundee employees' dedication but said that, in spite of that and its own ""continuous efforts"" the plant could not be saved. Scottish government Economy Secretary Derek Mackay will visit Dundee later while the UK government said it ""stands ready"" to do everything it can. Analysis by Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland business and economy editor The range of tyres available has increased rapidly in recent years If you've needed new tyres recently, you probably found that they had to be ordered and trucked from a distant warehouse. It used to be that you could go into a garage, you might get a choice of three manufacturers, and there and then, the mechanics could haul any of the three off a storage rail. What used to take 20 minutes now takes days, and often a lot more money. The change is partly down to the business practice of limiting stock to reduce costs, and having car parts delivered to order. But it has more to do with the growth in the range of tyres. That seems to be the reason why Michelin has not only punctured hopes for continued employment at its Dundee manufacturing plant, but on Tuesday it is telling its 845 workers that it will have the whole operation up on bricks within two years. READ MORE It said its priority now was to provide support for the workers who faced being put out of work. Michelin said enhanced redundancy packages would be available, with early retirement measures for those at the end of their career. It also promised ""intensive support"" for those seeking new jobs, relocation assistance, and skills retraining. In a statement it said: ""In accordance with UK legislation, Michelin will begin a consultation process with employees, employee representatives and the trade union on the closure project, and on social support measures in the next two weeks."" The company has been making tyres in Dundee since 1971 Factory manager John Reid added: ""I understand that these proposals will come as a huge blow to our employees and to the city of Dundee as a whole. ""It's also a very personal blow for me. I have been part of Michelin Dundee for 26 years and I am very proud of the hard work and dedication shown by the team here. ""This factory has faced incredibly tough challenges before and we have come through thanks to the hard work and flexibility of our people and the union, and the backing of the Michelin Group. ""However, the market for the smaller tyres we make has changed dramatically and permanently, and the company has to address these structural changes. The trade union representing many of the Dundee workers said it had not given up the fight to keep the factory open. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: ""Unite has been aware of the challenging market situation facing the Michelin Group. ""This has been primarily due to the cheap foreign imports from Asia and as a result falling demand for premium tyres in smaller dimensions, which the Dundee factory specialises in producing. ""This will be hammer-blow for Dundee."" He added: ""The workforce can be assured Unite will fight tooth and nail to save our factory, we will leave no stone unturned to keep this factory open. ""Unite will work day and night to ensure that all options remain on the table."" Nicola Sturgeon met manager John Reid on a tour of the Michelin factory in June 2017 Michelin is Dundee's largest industrial employer, and was boosted three years ago when the firm announceda Â£50m investment in new machinery. Last year First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the factory as Scottish Enterprise confirmed it was investing Â£4.5m in the plant. At the same time Michelin said it was committing Â£12m to a project which would help the site meet demand for larger tyres. In September the firmwarned that jobs could be lostat the plant in the face of ""extremely challenging trading conditions"" but it did not raise the prospect of its closure. A UK government spokeswoman said: ""This is a hugely difficult time for the Michelin workers and their families. The UK government is in touch with the Scottish government and other local partners, and stands ready to do everything it can to help. ""In particular we are reviewing how we invest the Â£150 million we are putting to the Tay Cities Deal, to make sure that the Deal can respond to this challenge."" The Scottish economy secretary is planning a series of meetings in Dundee For the Scottish government, Mr Mackay said he would be in Dundee on Tuesday, where he hoped to meet representatives of the workforce, the city council and the management team. He said: ""My immediate priority is on trying to find a sustainable future for the site, that will protect jobs and I will leave no stone unturned. ""I was informed at the end of last week of the possibility of closure and immediately sought discussions with the senior management team at Michelin. ""I know the workforce and unions have gone to immense lengths to make the plant as competitive as possible to secure its future, and we will leave no stone unturned in trying to protect the future of the Dundee site."" The leader of Dundee City Council, John Alexander, said: ""Michelin is part of the fabric of this city. ""I'll be working with colleagues and officials to clarify the situation and will work with whoever is necessary in the best interests of the entire workforce and their families. ""Dundee always rallies behind its own and we will again.""

Twitter accounts hacked in Elon Musk scam,"This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Several popular verified Twitter accounts have been hacked by scammers to promote an ad using Tesla boss Elon Musk's name and likeness. British fashion retailer Matalan, film distributor Pathe UK and US publisher Pantheon Books were among those whose accounts were taken over by scam artists. The scam used promoted tweets - whereTwitter is paid by advertisers,externalto make a tweet appear to a wider audience. The tweets have since been deleted with many accounts recovered, though some were left blank while waiting for their owners to re-enter their name and profile picture. The Matalan page looked empty after the hackers' posts were deleted - though retweeted posts from Musk's SpaceX company remained Scammers targeted several ""verified"" accounts (denoted with a blue tick) and changed the name and image to that of Mr Musk. The tweet then urged users to part with a small amount of Bitcoin - a digital currency - to supposedly receive more. Several other verified accounts, which were also taken under the scam artists' control, appear in the tweet's comments to claim that they have received Bitcoin from Mr Musk. A Twitter spokesperson told the BBC it ""doesn't comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons"". This is how the scam appeared in Twitter feeds before it was removed - the scam details have been blurred By using accounts with Twitter's own verification mark (a blue tick), it makes the account appear legitimate at first glance and thus may fool the reader into thinking it is official. But many of the posts still bear the hallmarks of classic scams - including frequent spelling errors (see ""Bitcoic"" and ""suppoot"" in the above tweet) and a request for money. The account handle itself is also incorrect - a legitimate tweet from Elon Musk would read @elonmusk beside the blue tick. In this case, it reads @patheuk - as the account originally belonged to film distributor Pathe UK. Clicking on any of the links in the scam sends users to a page where they are urged to send anywhere from 0.1-one Bitcoin (Â£491-Â£4,491) to the scammers - with the promise that they would receive one-10 Bitcoin as a reward. Victims do not receive any Bitcoin after sending money to the scam artists. The scam is made to seem more trustworthy as various other compromised accounts reply to the tweet claiming that it works. For example, the above tweet would appear to have been praised by verified accounts likeboxer Rayton Okwiri,external,blogger Sarah Scoop,external, andSwansea City AFC Ladies,external. The blue tick of verification makes the accounts seem legitimate, even though they are under the scammers' control The scam tweet has been posted by several verified accounts on Twitter. British fashion retailer Matalan, film distributor Pathe UK and US publisher Pantheon Books were among those whose accounts were reset after the hack. Pathe UK have since issued a statement to confirm that their account was ""hacked by an unknown third party"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An early form of the scamwas first spotted in Marchwhen accounts appeared simply using Mr Musk's name and likeness to ask for Bitcoin.

More time to switch to universal credit,"Universal credit claimants will be given more time to switch to the new benefit, the government has said. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said claimants would not have to wait as long for their money and debt repayments would be reduced. She was setting how the extra money for the new benefit system announced in last week's Budget would be spent. Labour dismissed the new package and called for the roll-out of the ""failed"" system to be halted. The plan is for almost seven million people to be on universal credit - which replaces six working age benefits - by the end of 2023. Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Charity head 'gagged' over universal credit Ministers 'in denial' about universal credit But the new system has been hit by delays and claims it is forcing some claimants into destitution. In last week's Budget Chancellor Philip Hammond announced an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year. The changes announced by Ms McVey include: People who claim income support, jobseeker's allowance, employment support allowance will be paid for an extra two weeks when they move on to universal credit, from July 2020 Advance loans, which help people bridge the gap, will only be clawed back at 30% of benefits per month, not 40%, from October 2019 The deadline for claimants told to move on to universal credit will be extended from one month to three months Self-employed people moving on to the benefit will also be given a 12-month ""grace period"" exempting them from the ""minimum income floor"" which limits claimants to getting no more benefits than they would get if they were on minimum wage - even if they are making a loss, from July 2020 Protection for 500,000 people claiming severe disability premium Esther McVey says she is looking at ways to help vulnerable claimants Ms McVey told MPs: ""This is targeted support to help work pay and support the vulnerable. ""While the party opposite may hanker for the dark old days, trapping people on benefits, excluding them from opportunity of work and getting on in life, and at the same time delivering a big bill to the taxpayer, we do not."" Ms McVey also said she was looking at ways to reach the most vulnerable ""whether it's in isolated parts of the country or whether it's people with learning difficulties or maybe difficulties with transport"" during the rollout of the new system. She said ""new ideas"" - such as a mobile centre or bus, as suggested by Tory MP John Howell - might be used to ""connect"" with claimants. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""The Budget last week did little to address the very long wait for payments which is causing significant hardship. ""Despite this the government is now planning to start the next phase of introduction of universal credit which it calls 'managed mitigation', which will involve the transfer of 2.87m on to it. ""Universal Credit is failing. The opposition has consistently called on the government to stop the rollout but this government is pressing ahead despite the terrible hardship it is causing."" Jess Phillips raised the case of a constituent who is worse off Birkenhead MP Frank Field, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, welcomed the extra cash Ms McVey had ""managed to claw back from the Treasury"". But SNP deputy Westminster leader Kirsty Blackman said people were ""still worse off"" as the benefit freeze and sanctions regime were still in place. And Labour MP Jess Phillips raised concerns over a Birmingham Yardley constituent who had to move after being raped and was ""forced"" on to universal credit as a result. ""She works, she has always worked, she is Â£200 worse off - she is a single mother,"" said Ms Phillips. ""What is being offered to her today, and which is why we're not supporting it, is still going to be Â£160 a month worse for her. ""A rape victim, single mother, in work - what will she do for her?"" Ms McVey said she would like to meet Ms Phillips to discuss the woman's case.

Man admits wife and stepdaughter murders,"Christopher Boon, 28, initially pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder A man has admitted murdering his wife, then turning his rage on his 11-year-old stepdaughter who had rushed from her bedroom to save her mum. The bodies of wedding planner Laura Mortimer, 31, and Ella Dalby were found in Dexter Way, Gloucester, on 28 May. They had been stabbed with a kitchen knife and were left lying side by side on the kitchen floor. Christopher Boon, 28, of Dexter Way, pleaded guilty to the murders and was handed a minimum jail term of 29 years. Initially Boon, who received a mandatory life sentence, denied murder, but during a hearing at Bristol Crown Court on Monday he finally admitted the killings. Sentencing, Mrs Justice May told him: ""You murdered your wife Laura Boon and your 11-year-old stepdaughter Ella Dalby in an act of selfish rage and cruelty. ""Your wanton savagery has blighted the lives of many forever."" Ella Dalby (r) attempted to protect her mum from Boon's attack Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, told the court: ""It is clear that it was a sustained and brutal episode of violence in which Laura and Ella suffered multiple stab wounds about their faces and necks."" Mr Smith said it appeared Ella went to help her mother after hearing her downstairs with Boon. ""Having heard matters dramatically unfold in the kitchen, Ella got out of her bed and bravely came to the help of her mother,"" he said. ""Eleven-year-old Ella must have witnessed, in part at least, the murderous attack on her mother before Boon also attacked his stepdaughter."" The judge paid tribute to Ella, telling Boon: ""She would have witnessed some part of your murderous attack on her mother and tried to stop you before you turned on her. ""What a brave girl. She and her mother were found lying together, side by side."" After the attack, Boon left the property and phoned his mother to tell her what he had done. Mr Smith said police officers who attended 10 minutes after the phone call described the scene as ""horrendous"". Ms Mortimer and Ella were found dead in the kitchen of their home Police said Boon had a history of violence and in 2010 he was handed a suspended sentence for attacking a former partner and her mother. Four years later he was accused of attacking Ms Mortimer but she did not want to press charges. Witnesses said he also threatened his partner's best friend and was verbally abusive to Ella at times. On 17 May this year, Ms Mortimer told a friend he ""went for her"" so she asked him for a divorce. He then punched a wall saying, ""that was meant for your face"". The night before the attack, Laura had been out with friends and told them she had asked Boon to leave within two weeks. Friends heard that he was not happy at being told he had to go. Ms Mortimer ran her own business, Sweet Beginnings, offering bespoke bridal gowns and wedding planning services. Ella was a student at Barnwood Park Arts College, where she had a passion for dance. In a victim impact statement, Ms Mortimer's mother Hilary Bartholomew said: ""Laura was friendly to everyone and a happy person who loved to make others happy. ""She had done brilliantly in setting up her own wedding planning business [and] was a wonderful, devoted mother."" Mrs Bartholomew added: ""Ella was my adored first grandchild and we were extremely close. ""She was such a beautiful, loving, happy little girl. She was also very talented at dancing. Ella adored her mother. ""My husband and I had to identify Laura and Ella, and seeing them will stay in my head for the rest of my life."" Ella's biological father, Tom Dalby, said in statement to the court that his daughter ""brought great joy to my life"". He added: ""I feel guilty that I was unable to protect her. I loved her with all my heart, she was my world and I can't see my future without her.""

Celtic Boys Club founder guilty of abuse,"Jim Torbett denied the charges Celtic Boys Club founder Jim Torbett has been jailed for six years after being convicted of sexually abusing three boys over an eight-year period. Torbett, 71, was found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. He had denied the charges. Two victims had been in his under-14s football teams, while the third was abused by Torbett at the age of five. Lord Beckett told Torbett: ""You groomed boys and contrived situations when you could abuse them ""Yours is some of the most corrupting behaviour I have ever heard of in these courts."" He added: ""Your depraved conduct towards innocent children has blighted their lives."" How Torbett used football as cover for his crimes Thejudge told Torbett,externalthat Celtic Boys Club had given opportunities to hundreds of aspiring young footballers. But he added: ""You used the club as a front for child sexual abuse."" There were tears in the public gallery as the verdict was announced, and emotional scenes in the foyer of the court as those affected by the case embraced each other. Kenny Campbell waived his right to anonymity Torbett, of Kelvindale, Glasgow, was found guilty of five abuse charges between August 1986 and August 1994. Torbett had previously been jailed for two years in 1998 for abusing three young Celtic Boys Club players between 1967 and 1974. He had been living in California when the further allegations of abuse came to light. Victim, Kenny Campbell, broke his silence in a BBC documentary,Football Abuse: The Ugly Side of the Beautiful Game. A month after the documentary was broadcast,the BBC tracked Torbett down to California and put the claims to him in a dramatic confrontation. The BBC confronted Jim Torbett in California Within hours of that footage being broadcast, Torbett was escorted to the airport by US Homeland Security and he was arrested on his return to Scotland. During the trial, Mr Campbell told jurors how he played for Celtic Boys Club when he was 14. He said Torbett - who was also the manager - had been his ""hero"" and that he would have ""run through walls for him"". However, he said Torbett then went on to abuse him, including one attack while on a Celtic Boys Club trip to Noyon in France. A second victim, Andrew Gray, died last year following a swimming pool accident in Australia. Andrew Gray with his sister Michelle However, statements he gave to police before his death were read out during the trial. The 41-year-old had told officers he was first abused by Torbett after training, and that he had not known what was happening. He told police: ""I can still remember lying in bed that night thinking: 'Is that how adults act?'."" Mr Gray said he was also attacked in Torbett's Glasgow flat, and that he would be dropped from the team if he did not agree to his demands. The final victim, now aged 35, told the trial how he was abused at the Trophy Centre business which Torbett ran in the Pollokshaws area of Glasgow. He said he was attacked while on his own with Torbett. Torbett had branded the victims ""liars"" and said allegations were like ""something out of fairytales"". This video can not be played Kenny Campbell says speaking up about the abuse was worth it: ""He can't hurt anybody else for a long time"" Outside the High Court, Mr Campbell described the verdict as ""unbelievable"". Asked how he felt, he said: ""Ecstatic. Relieved. Vindicated."" Mr Campbell said he was grateful to BBC journalists Mark Daly and Calum McKay for investigating Torbett. He added: ""The worst thing about being an abuse victim, a survivor, or whatever you want to call them, is the fear of not being believed. ""Even right up to the verdict was announced I had the fear that I would not be believed."" Mr Campbell, who has four grandsons, added: ""I'll walk away a proud man. ""I'll know I've made a difference and I'll know it has been worthwhile. ""If I can save one person, or one child, from what I went through then it is worthwhile."" This video can not be played Michelle Gray says her family will be haunted by what they heard during the trial Mr Gray's sister, Michelle, described the moment the verdict was announced as ""extremely emotional"". She added: ""The last two weeks have been sheer hell and myself, my mum, my brother and Andrew's friends will be haunted by what we learned that Andrew suffered at the hands of Mr Torbett."" She added: ""The man that was convicted today destroyed his life. There is no doubt about that."" Ms Gray recalled a conversation with her brother before he died. She said: ""Andrew asked me in Australia, if he didn't make it, would I do all I could to get justice, not just for him but for all the other boys. ""And that has been the reason why we have fought through the last 13 months."" She added: ""Now our beloved Andrew can finally rest in peace."" Det Ch Insp Sarah Taylor, of the National Child Abuse Investigation Unit, said: ""Torbett was a predator who used football to allow him access to young boys. ""These were boys who had a dream, they wanted to play professional football. Torbett was a man in a position of trust but he betrayed that trust. ""He preyed on these boys, he exploited their dreams and he subjected them to callous and depraved abuse. ""I have no doubt that he exerted control over the boys in his care and coerced them with promises and lies."" Det Chief Insp Taylor praised the courage of the victims who helped bring Torbett to justice. She added: ""Reporting these offences and reliving the experience can be traumatic. ""We understand this and we will do everything in our power to bring investigations to the appropriate outcome.""

Jewish nurse 'didn't see evil' in gunman,"Robert Bowers, the suspected gunman who killed 11 Jewish worshippers, pleads not guilty A Jewish nurse who treated Robert Bowers, the man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, says he ""didn't see evil"". Ari Mahler said he was motivated by love and treated Mr Bowers with as much empathy and care as he would anyone. ""I'm sure he had no idea I was Jewish,"" the emergency room trauma nurse wrote in a Facebook post that has gone viral. Mr Bowers, 46, was wounded in a gun battle by police and has been in custody since the attack on 27 October. He has pleaded not guiltyto charges arising from the Tree of Life synagogue mass shooting, which is considered to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. The truck driver faces 44 counts of murder, hate crimes, obstructing religious practices and other offences. The threat of rising anti-Semitism Pittsburgh shooting: Who were the victims? US synagogue shooting: Who is Robert Bowers? Initially wary of sharing his experience, Mr Mahler said he wanted to speak for himself, after US media repeatedly called him the ""Jewish nurse that cared for Robert Bowers"". ""The fact that I did my job, a job which requires compassion and empathy over everything, is newsworthy to people because I'm Jewish,"" Mr Mahler said, adding, ""even more so because my dad's a rabbi.""

Ireland warns UK over post-Brexit border,"The UK government has been told by Ireland to ""stand by its commitments"" on avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said an arrangement with a time limit would not be ""worth the paper it's written on"". The border issue is the main barrier to progress between the two sides. With time running out, Theresa May, who briefs her cabinet on Tuesday, has to get both the EU and her MPs on side. Kuenssberg: 10 pointers on where we are with Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop How will Parliament vote on a final deal? All you need to know about Brexit The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said divorce negotiations with the UK are not driven by a sense of revenge and that a no-deal, or a ""hard"" Brexit, would be a leap into the unknown for Britons living in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. Speaking at an event in Brussels, Mr Barnier also said any Brexit deal had to maintain an open Irish border to protect peace on the island that has seen decades of sectarian violence. The UK is due to leave the EU in March, and although 95% of the deal is said to be complete, the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland. It is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states. There have been warnings that a hard border would undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland. But unless negotiators can make decisive progress on how to guarantee no new visible checks, a special summit to finalise the UK's withdrawal will not take place. There is disagreement on whether the ""backstop"" they have agreed to put in place should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it can be time-limited or revoked by the UK. Please upgrade your browser Tory Brexiteers are concerned the UK could end up locked in a customs union with the EU without a fixed end point. Writing inThe Sun,external, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said this would be an ""absolute stinker"" of a deal and warned of a ""surrender to Brussels"" with the UK staying tied to EU rules in years to come. Mrs May has insisted that any arrangement would be ""strictly time limited"". This, however, is not the view of the EU. On Twitter, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a time-limited arrangement - or one that could be unilaterally ended by the UK - would never get EU backing. Allow Twitter content?

""Still necessary to repeat this, it seems,"" added the EU's deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand. And Mr Varadkar said the UK had agreed to a legally-binding ""backstop"" to apply ""unless and until"" it is superseded by a new agreement. ""I think it's reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK government to stand by its commitments,"" he said. Mr Varadkar described the UK as a ""divided kingdom"" over Brexit, saying this made it ""very difficult to come to an agreement"". While the EU has objected to a time-limited UK-wide arrangement, its suggestion of a backstop that is specific to Northern Ireland has been ruled out by Mrs May who says it would undermine the integrity of the UK by creating a new border down the Irish Sea. The prime minister says she does not think a ""backstop"" arrangement will be necessary as she wants to solve the border problem through the UK's long-term trade relationship with the EU, which has yet to be agreed. Mrs May spoke to Mr Varadkar by phone on Monday morning ""to take stock of the progress being made"", Downing Street said, adding that: ""In order to ensure that the backstop, if ever needed, would be temporary, the prime minister said that there would need to be a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end."" The Irish government said Mrs May had ""raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop"", and that Mr Varadkar had ""indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop"". Baroness Kennedy is among the legal figures supporting another Brexit referendum Meanwhile, 1,400 lawyers have signed a letter calling for another EU referendum to be held. Among the signatories of the letter are Labour peer Baroness Kennedy QC, former Court of Appeal judge Konrad Schiemann and David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice. They say questions over the validity of the 2016 vote mean it should not be the public's final word, any more than the 1975 referendum on membership of what was then the European Economic Community. In the earlier referendum, voters faced a clear choice between alternatives once negotiations had been completed, the lawyers said. By contrast, during the 2016 vote, ""the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown"", said the letter. ""Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative. In the campaign, un-testable claims took the place of facts and reality."" The UK government has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust after the result of the referendum in 2016. A spokeswoman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said that the government was confident of a ""mutually advantageous"" deal with the EU. ""The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum,"" she said.

Frantic final day for US mid-term campaign,"Media mogul Oprah Winfrey travelled to Georgia to campaign with Stacey Abrams ahead of the mid-term election Race-baiting allegations have mired the home stretch of the US mid-term elections, turning it into one of the ugliest campaigns in recent times. US networks have withdrawn President Donald Trump's ad about a cop-killing illegal immigrant. Meanwhile, racist automated calls targeted prominent African-American candidates in Florida and Georgia. Control of Congress is up for grabs in Tuesday's poll, which is being seen as a referendum on Mr Trump. His ability to govern in the final two years of his term will hinge upon the outcome of votes for all 435 seats in the House, and 35 of the 100 Senate seats. All you need to know ahead of mid-terms Your simple guide to the US mid-terms The Republican president - who has been holding barnstorming rallies nationwide, even though he is not up for re-election this year - campaigns in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri on Monday. In the weeks leading up to the polls, Mr Trump has escalated his rhetoric about his opponents and divisive issues such as immigration, warning voters against Democratic ""socialism"" and ""an invasion"" of criminals from the Central American migrant caravan. His sharp language has appeared to energise conservative voters, but critics have condemned Mr Trump's tactics as fear-mongering. Mr Trump has held rallies across the country to ramp up his base ahead of the elections. On Monday, Facebook, NBC and even the president's favourite network, Fox News, announced they would stop broadcasting a 30-second ad paid for by his campaign. The clip falsely claimed Democrats let into the US an undocumented Mexican immigrant who murdered two California sheriff's deputies in 2014. The president last week tweeted the clip, but CNN refused to air it at the weekend, calling it ""racist"". Asked about the ad on Monday, Mr Trump told a journalist: ""A lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of times."" The A-Z of US mid-terms Can we tell yet if the Democrats will win? What's it all about? Why US mid-term elections matter Automated phone calls in Florida and Georgia have dragged an already toxic political campaign to new lows, targeting two candidates who could become the first African-American governors of those states. One message falsely claiming to be from US celebrity Oprah Winfrey called Stacey Abrams in Georgia ""a poor man's Aunt Jemima"" among other racial slurs, referencing a controversial image of a black woman depicted as a slavery-era ""mammy"" figure. Calls in Florida targeting Andrew Gillum featured a background of jungle and chimpanzee noises. They came days after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, speaking in Florida, described the election as ""cotton-pickin' important"" - a term with overtones of slavery. According to the Wesleyan Media Project,external, no other US general election in the last decade has seen close to so many attack ads as this one. Mr Obama urged Floridians to put a check on angry rhetoric President Trump is galvanising supporters by arguing that a Democratic takeover of Congress would trigger an influx of illegal immigrants and a crime wave. The president has also been warning the Democrats will destroy a healthy US economy if they win the keys to power. Most Democratic candidates have tended to avoid directly confronting the president, focusing instead on ""kitchen table"" issues such as healthcare and economic inequality. The party hopes the president's hard-line rhetoric will help them win over younger voters, suburban moderates and minorities to the polls. The Democrats have rolled out their biggest gun: former President Barack Obama, who travelled to Virginia on Monday to get out the vote for its candidates. ""The character of this country is on the ballot,"" he said. Turnout is traditionally low in the US mid-terms, with the 2014 election seeing a post-war record low of just 37%. But analysts say a sharp rise is likely this year. Some 34.3 million people have already voted and the real number is probably higher, according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source. The figure in 2014 was just 27.5 million. People can vote early both in person and by post In Texas, early voting has exceeded the entire turnout in 2014. However, thunderstorms are forecast for Tuesday along the eastern coast and snowstorms in the Midwest, which could dampen turnout. Pollsters say Democrats may win the 23 seats they need to take over the House of Representatives, and possibly 15 or so extra seats. However, the Democrats are expected to fall short of the two seats they need to wrest control of the Senate from Republican hands. Governors are also being chosen in 36 out of 50 states. The first polls close at 23:00 GMT (18:00 EST) on Tuesday.

"Man admits wife and stepdaughter murdersElla Dalby, 11, died trying to save her mum from a fatal knife attack in the kitchen of their home.Gloucestershire","Christopher Boon, 28, initially pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder A man has admitted murdering his wife, then turning his rage on his 11-year-old stepdaughter who had rushed from her bedroom to save her mum. The bodies of wedding planner Laura Mortimer, 31, and Ella Dalby were found in Dexter Way, Gloucester, on 28 May. They had been stabbed with a kitchen knife and were left lying side by side on the kitchen floor. Christopher Boon, 28, of Dexter Way, pleaded guilty to the murders and was handed a minimum jail term of 29 years. Initially Boon, who received a mandatory life sentence, denied murder, but during a hearing at Bristol Crown Court on Monday he finally admitted the killings. Sentencing, Mrs Justice May told him: ""You murdered your wife Laura Boon and your 11-year-old stepdaughter Ella Dalby in an act of selfish rage and cruelty. ""Your wanton savagery has blighted the lives of many forever."" Ella Dalby (r) attempted to protect her mum from Boon's attack Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, told the court: ""It is clear that it was a sustained and brutal episode of violence in which Laura and Ella suffered multiple stab wounds about their faces and necks."" Mr Smith said it appeared Ella went to help her mother after hearing her downstairs with Boon. ""Having heard matters dramatically unfold in the kitchen, Ella got out of her bed and bravely came to the help of her mother,"" he said. ""Eleven-year-old Ella must have witnessed, in part at least, the murderous attack on her mother before Boon also attacked his stepdaughter."" The judge paid tribute to Ella, telling Boon: ""She would have witnessed some part of your murderous attack on her mother and tried to stop you before you turned on her. ""What a brave girl. She and her mother were found lying together, side by side."" After the attack, Boon left the property and phoned his mother to tell her what he had done. Mr Smith said police officers who attended 10 minutes after the phone call described the scene as ""horrendous"". Ms Mortimer and Ella were found dead in the kitchen of their home Police said Boon had a history of violence and in 2010 he was handed a suspended sentence for attacking a former partner and her mother. Four years later he was accused of attacking Ms Mortimer but she did not want to press charges. Witnesses said he also threatened his partner's best friend and was verbally abusive to Ella at times. On 17 May this year, Ms Mortimer told a friend he ""went for her"" so she asked him for a divorce. He then punched a wall saying, ""that was meant for your face"". The night before the attack, Laura had been out with friends and told them she had asked Boon to leave within two weeks. Friends heard that he was not happy at being told he had to go. Ms Mortimer ran her own business, Sweet Beginnings, offering bespoke bridal gowns and wedding planning services. Ella was a student at Barnwood Park Arts College, where she had a passion for dance. In a victim impact statement, Ms Mortimer's mother Hilary Bartholomew said: ""Laura was friendly to everyone and a happy person who loved to make others happy. ""She had done brilliantly in setting up her own wedding planning business [and] was a wonderful, devoted mother."" Mrs Bartholomew added: ""Ella was my adored first grandchild and we were extremely close. ""She was such a beautiful, loving, happy little girl. She was also very talented at dancing. Ella adored her mother. ""My husband and I had to identify Laura and Ella, and seeing them will stay in my head for the rest of my life."" Ella's biological father, Tom Dalby, said in statement to the court that his daughter ""brought great joy to my life"". He added: ""I feel guilty that I was unable to protect her. I loved her with all my heart, she was my world and I can't see my future without her.""

NZ fisherman rescues baby from ocean,"Gus Hutt (pictured with his wife Sue) was fishing when he spotted the infant in the water A New Zealand fisherman has rescued an 18-month-old boy from the ocean, in an incident described as a ""freakish miracle"". Gus Hutt, a holiday camper staying on Matata Beach on North Island, was fishing when he spotted a small figure floating in the water. He first thought it was a doll and only realised it was a child after he ""let out a little squeak"". The boy had escaped from his parents' tent and ended up in the ocean. ""I thought he was a doll.,external[Even as] I reached out and grabbed him by the arm, I still thought it was a doll,"" Mr Hutt told local outlet the Whakatane Beacon. ""His face looked just like porcelain with his short hair wetted down, but then he let out a little squeak and I thought, 'oh God, this is a baby and it's alive'."" Mr Hutt, who was staying at Murphy's Holiday Camp, located in the coastal town of Matata, was out on a nearby beach on 26 October at about 06:15 New Zealand time (17:15GMT). According to the Herald, Mr Hutt would usually head straight from the camp to fish on the beach, but decided on that day to fish at a different spot - 100m to the left. After checking his fishing lines, he spotted the boy floating in the water. ""He was floating at a steady pace... if I had been just a minute later, I wouldn't have seen him,"" Mr Hutt said. ""He was bloody lucky, but he just wasn't meant to go, it wasn't his time.""

Emergency services were also alerted. ""Apparently the baby had been very excited to be on the beach. It was the couple's first night staying here. It's the first time they've been here,"" Rebecca Salter, the co-owner of Murphy's Holiday Camp, told the BBC. ""Hutt, who is a fisherman and one of our regulars, spotted the baby. [They brought the baby to us], we wrapped him up in towels and Sue went to inform the baby's parents."" The baby had escaped from his parents' tent by undoing the zipper, and then made his way into the ocean. The baby's mother ""screamed"" when she was informed that her baby was found in the water - the couple later thanked the Hutts before returning home. ""It came as a shock to everyone. It was a very, very lucky result... it could have been a very tragic incident,"" said Mrs Salter. ""It's a freakish miracle.""

Jewish nurse 'didn't see evil' in shooter,"Robert Bowers, the suspected gunman who killed 11 Jewish worshippers, pleads not guilty A Jewish nurse who treated Robert Bowers, the man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, says he ""didn't see evil"". Ari Mahler said he was motivated by love and treated Mr Bowers with as much empathy and care as he would anyone. ""I'm sure he had no idea I was Jewish,"" the emergency room trauma nurse wrote in a Facebook post that has gone viral. Mr Bowers, 46, was wounded in a gun battle by police and has been in custody since the attack on 27 October. He has pleaded not guiltyto charges arising from the Tree of Life synagogue mass shooting, which is considered to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. The truck driver faces 44 counts of murder, hate crimes, obstructing religious practices and other offences. The threat of rising anti-Semitism Pittsburgh shooting: Who were the victims? US synagogue shooting: Who is Robert Bowers? Initially wary of sharing his experience, Mr Mahler said he wanted to speak for himself, after US media repeatedly called him the ""Jewish nurse that cared for Robert Bowers"". ""The fact that I did my job, a job which requires compassion and empathy over everything, is newsworthy to people because I'm Jewish,"" Mr Mahler said, adding, ""even more so because my dad's a rabbi.""

Mr Mahler explained that Mr Bowers had ""instilled panic in my heart, worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival"". Mr Bowers was treated for his wounds by multiple Jewish doctors and nurses, hospital authorities said The suspect is alleged to have been rolled into the hospital yelling ""death to all Jews"", Mr Mahler noted. Mr Bowers later thanked the nurse for helping to save his life. ""My care is given through kindness; my actions are measured with empathy, regardless of the person you may be when you're not in my care,"" he explained. ""I wanted him to feel compassion.""

Can Iran survive sanctions?,"New tough sanctions targeting Iran's oil sector, imposed by the United States, come into force on Monday. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, has responded robustly. ""There is no doubt that the United States will not achieve success with this new plot against Iran as they are retreating step by step."" Iran is heavily dependent on its exports of oil, and renewed sanctions, if effective, would hit the economy hard. The EU has proposed supporting companies trading with Iran despite these new sanctions. But will these companies risk being hit by secondary sanctions which would limit their own ability to trade with the US? Angered at what he describes as a terrible deal, President Donald Trump earlier this year pulled the US out of a multilateral agreement reached with Iran in 2015, under which strict controls were placed on Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of a wide range of sanctions. As a result, sanctions lifted by the US and others in 2016 are now being unilaterally re-imposed by the United States. Iran nuclear deal - Key details The impact of Iran sanctions Iran has the fourth largest crude oil reserves in the world But other countries, including those of the European Union, believe Iran is holding to its part of the bargain on the nuclear deal and have made clear their intention not to follow America's lead. Such is the dominance of the US in global trade, that even the announcement of the renewed sanctions has been enough to triggera wave of international companiespulling their investments out of Iran, and its crude oil exports have been falling. The latest US measures exclude any company that trades with Iran from doing business in the United States. In addition, under far-reaching secondary sanctions, any US company faces punishment if it does business with a company that does business with Iran. Sanctions on the banking sector will also be introduced on Monday. In Augustmeasures were imposedon a number of industries including trade in gold, precious metals and the automotive sector. The US has made it clear it wants eventually to cut off Iran's oil trade entirely, but has allowed eight countries to maintain imports asa temporary concessionto give them time to reduce imports. US allies such as Italy, India, Japan and South Korea are among the eight, theAssociated Press reports,external. The IMF has predicted that Iran's economy will shrink by 1.5% this year In order to allow companies to trade with Iran and not face stiff US penalties, the EU plans to implement a payment mechanism - a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - that will enable these companies to avoid the US financial system. Like a bank, the SPV, would handle transactions between Iran and companies trading with it, avoiding direct payments into and out of Iran. So when Iran exports oil to a country in the EU, the company from the receiving country would pay into the SPV. Iran can then use the payment as credit to buy goods from other countries in the EU through the SPV. The EU has also updated a statute - calleda blocking statue- that allows EU firms to recover damages from US sanctions. Even with the EU plan in place, the costs of doing any Iran-related business could still be too high for many companies. For example, even if the shipping operator were to purchase oil through the SPV mechanism, the company insuring the cargo may still face the threat of secondary sanctions and the potential loss of all its business in the United States. Iran's economy isn't directly reliant on the US financial system, says Richard Nephew, a sanctions expert and senior researcher at Columbia University. ""But the issue is that most of Iran's biggest trading partners do and that affects their readiness to put at risk their access to the United States to do business with Iran."" He says small or medium-sized companies are more likely than large companies to use the SPV. Another problem is that the product used in the SPV to trade with Iran may also violate secondary sanctions, says Leigh Hansson, head of international trade and national security at Reed Smith. ""The transaction itself will be problematic."" The US had insisted on cutting exports to zero but that seems unlikely as it would increase the price of oil, says Scott Lucas, a professor of international politics at Birmingham University. In addition to the countries allowed to continue buying Iranian oil, the backing of China, Iran's largest trading partner, may also prove critical. The last time international sanctions were imposed on its oil industry between 2010 and 2016, Iran's exports fell by almost a half. There's no doubt exports will be affected this time around too, but it's also clear that Iran and its remaining business partners will be working hard to maintain trading links. ""Don't be disillusioned about how painful this will be,"" says Ellie Geranmayeh, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. But ""Iran has weathered multiple rounds of sanctions before."" Iranians will be forced into finding creative ways to sell oil, relying on their years of experience of life under previous sanctions. And to fill the gap left by lost European investment, Iran will be looking east to forge new links with Russia and China.

Iranians describe impact of US sanctions,"Iranians say the sanctions are pushing up prices of everyday items Tough sanctions imposed on Iran by the US are designed to target core parts of the Islamic Republic's economy, with the aim of pressuring Tehran into altering its direction and ceasing its ""malign"" activities. Earlier this year President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a multilateral agreement that places strict controls on Iran's nuclear programme. The US has now re-imposed tough sanctions on Iran's oil and finance sectors. But what effect are the sanctions having on the Iranian people? Some of those suffering from the economic impact of the US measures have shared their concerns with the BBC's Persian Service. Can Iran survive sanctions? Impact of Iran sanctions - in charts Ayeh says that while the sanctions have had a detrimental impact on many professions, especially civil servants, they are worth the pain if they bring about change in the way the country is governed. ""I admit that sanctions influenced our living, especially us,"" Ayeh says. ""If these sanctions could help in collapsing the Islamic Republic, I'm ready to tolerate them - even longer term whilst my purchasing power gets even more limited. All for the fall of the Islamic Republic, to be replaced by a democratic government."" A major issue for Iranians studying abroad is the country's banking system, says Mahdis, who adds that the imposed sanctions have made the situation worse. ""Our biggest problem due to the sanctions would be banking. When I started at the university here, it was too hard for me and others to open an account as an Iranian student. Now and because of the sanctions, we are not able to receive money from Iran. ""If a transaction is related to any Iranian outside Iran, it would be blocked or needed to be clarified by documents about the source. It's our biggest issue after providing the money and the exchange rate."" Mohammad is worried about the impact on retailers and manufacturers as the cost of imported materials increases. Mohammad worries that shops, like this one in Tehran, will struggle to survive ""Sanctions are hitting us to the bone and the officials are talking cheap. ""We can't produce a piece of cloth ourselves. It is a bad time. Every shop puts up their prices and our purchasing power is null now; zero, absolute null."" Business owners like Rouzbeh, who imports electrical parts from the European Union, are equally worried about their supply chains. ""When the exchange rate goes up, our end-user price would be several times higher. Our European source is not supplying us anymore and we have to get the goods from another route, which increases the costs. Iran sanctions: Now what? Who does business with Iran? ""With such high prices, customers will reject us... so our business is in danger. Our only way to survive is to downsize. But this will [have an] impact on several families [supported by] my employees."" Vahid echoes the concerns of inflated prices of electrical goods and appliances and says the property market is another area affected by the sanctions, which are making it more difficult to purchase a home. ""As a young man, I worked for years to save some money to apply for a mortgage. But after all this, house prices went up high so with a same amount of money you may find a considerable smaller houses. ""My income is very low, I have no hope. I don't know what to do. Everybody is unhappy but no one complains. People just mutter about the prices and swear. ""I don't know what the plans are for the future."" Can Iran survive sanctions?

The impact of sanctions in charts,"Uncertainty is hanging over the future of the Iran nuclear deal following the US decision to withdraw. Under the 2015 agreement, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions imposed by the UN, US and EU. President Donald Trump's announcement that the US will leave the deal means that Washington will begin reinstating sanctions. But what will the economic impact be on Iran and its trading partners? Iran nuclear deal: Key details The US Treasury has said that there will be wind-down periods of 90 and 180 days before sanctions are implemented. The first deadline, on 6 August, will affect the purchase of US dollars, trade in gold and certain other metals, as well as aviation and the car industry. The next wind-down period will end on 4 November and will target Iran's financial and oil institutions. At the end of the 180 days, sanctions will also be reinstated against individuals who were previously on the US Treasury sanctions list. Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, and the export of oil and gas is worth billions of dollars each year. But both the country's oil output and its GDP fell noticeably under international sanctions. And while the US itself is not a major customer, foreign companies and other countries that continue to deal with Iran after the wind-down periods will face US sanctions if they fail to reduce or end their trade. European oil companies could be particularly hit - French company Total signed a $5bn deal with Iran after the agreement, while BP has a joint venture to operate the Rhum gas field with Iran's state oil company. The sanctions will have an impact on other industries too. Under the announcement, companies selling commercial aeroplanes to Iran will be particularly hit. Companies such as Airbus and Boeing - which had agreed deals with Iran to sell 100 and 80 aircraft respectively after the 2015 deal - stand to lose billions of dollars because of the use of US-made parts in construction. Tourism in Iran had also benefited from the nuclear deal, with visitor numbers increasing from 3.8 million visitors in 2012 to over 5 million in 2015, and this could also be affected by renewed sanctions. There is still some hope for Iran's trading partners, as the other parties to the 2015 nuclear agreement - the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - have pledged their continuing support for the deal. The US government has said that exemptions for those dealing with Iran are possible, although it has not yet given any details about which companies could benefit. If that fails, the EU could also use a blocking statute to protect companies conducting business with Iran from US sanctions, as it did when it lifted its own sanctions on Cuba.

Police are continuing their investigation into the shooting ""I jumped up, ran over and grabbed the only other thing that I could find - which is a broomstick - and I hit him over the head with that. ""Again, he pushed me off, but some people were able to run out of the room."" The shooter then killed himself, police say. He was discovered with a self-inflicted gunshot wound around 17:40 local time (21:40 GMT).

Ryanair to shut website for upgrade,"Online bookings and check-in with Ryanair will close for 12 hours after the airline said it needed to shut down its website and mobile phone app. It said the shutdown from 17:00 UK time on Wednesday to 05:00 on Thursday was needed for a computer systems upgrade. Ryanair ""sincerely apologised"" to customers for any inconvenience, and urged anyone needing to check in to do so before the closure. The Irish carrier says it operates Europe's largest travel website. There are about 1.5 million visits to the website every day, with 22,700 boarding passes downloaded each day. Ryanair's policy is to charge passengers an extra Â£55 if they need to check in at an airport, and the airline says all fees will stay in force. The carrier's online check-in facility is only open between 48 hours and two hours before a flight for passengers who have not paid extra to select a seat. Robin Kiely, the Irish carrier's head of communications, said in a statement: ""As part of our continued digital development, a web closure and system upgrade will take place for 12 hours, from 17:00hrs (UK time) on Wednesday 7th November, until 05:00hrs (UK time) on Thursday 8th November, during which time our online check-in service will not be available. ""Flight bookings and changes will also be unavailable during this period. Customers travelling on Wednesday or Thursday should check in for their flight on Tuesday 6th November. ""We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by this upgrade, which will further improve Ryanair.com, Europe's largest travel website."" Also on Monday, Ryanair reported an 11% rise in traffic in October, as it carried 13.1 million passengers. That total includes 500,000 passengers from Lauda, the airline founded by former Formula One champion Niki Lauda and recently bought by Ryanair. During October, the airline had to cancel about 300 flights due to a combination of an airport handler strike at Brussels Zaventem, bad weather, and continuing air traffic control staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France. Monday's news comes as Germany's VC pilots union says it cannot rule out more strikes at Ryanair. Last month, the union called the airline's decision to close its base in Bremen, Germany, a ""declaration of war"" on unions and said the move must be reversed to make progress on talks. Ryanair has faced a series of industrial actions across Europe this year. The airline has also faced criticism after introduction of new baggage rules last week.

Iran vows to 'break' US sanctions,"The decision to re-impose sanctions met fury in Iran Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has vowed to ""break"" swingeing sanctions re-imposed by the US targeting core parts of the economy. The Trump administration is restoring all sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal in a bid to pressure Iran. They will hit oil exports, shipping and banks, and make it difficult to do business with the oil-rich nation. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Iran must ""act like a normal country, or see its economy crumble"". He told a press conference on Monday that more than 20 nations have already cut their oil intake from the Islamic Republic, and that exports have fallen by a million barrels a day. Mr Rouhani earlier struck a defiant tone, saying Iran would ""continue selling oil"". What's Trump's goal? next for Iran? What nappies tell us about Iran's economic woes Iran nuclear deal: Key details ""We will proudly break the sanctions,"" he told a meeting of economic officials. European countries which are still party to the accord designed to curb Iran's nuclear activity say they will help businesses bypass the sanctions. But there are doubts about how successful this will be. Even before the US sanctions were re-imposed, Iran's economy had had a difficult year, with Iran's currency, the rial, plummeting against the dollar, driving up the price of basic goods. US President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the nuclear accord earlier this year, an agreement he called the ""worst deal ever negotiated"". It offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for reducing its nuclear development. The global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, says that Iran has complied with the agreement. President Trump says that he wants to get Iran back to the negotiating table. Mr Trump has taken a more aggressive approach to Iran than under Barack Obama His administration also says it wants to stop what it calls Tehran's ""malign"" activities - including cyber attacks, ballistic missile tests, and support for terror groups and militias in the Middle East. The president says his ""maximum pressure"" strategy is working. ""[Iran] wanted to take over the whole Middle East. Right now they just want to survive,"" he told a rally in Tennessee, Reuters reported. The US reinstated a raft of sanctions in August, but analysts say this latest round is by far the most significant. More than 700 individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft are now on the sanctions list, including major banks, oil exporters and shipping companies. This video can not be played Iran gripped by despair as country faces economic turmoil, drought In addition, the Brussels-based Swift network for making international payments has confirmed it will cut off links with some Iranian banks, isolating Iran from the international financial system. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US aimed to reduce Iranian oil sales to zero. He confirmed on Monday that the Trump administration has granted temporary exemptions to eight countries to continue importing Iranian oil - China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. By Kasra Naji, Special Correspondent, BBC Persian The sweeping US sanctions will be debilitating to the government's day-to-day running of the country. They will also be disastrous for ordinary people who are already reeling under the weight of rising prices, shortages, and the rapidly falling value of the rial. All this will put President Rouhani under considerable strain. He wanted to steer the country toward a more moderate disposition. The hardliners are smelling blood. They see a chance to force a change of government, arguing extraordinary conditions in the country require extraordinary solutions. They have been pressing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to dismiss Mr Rouhani for incompetence and hand over the administration of the country to them. But the Iranian leader is not so sure. Taking on the running of the country under these conditions could be a poisoned chalice for him and for the hardliners he supports. The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts Can Iran survive sanctions? The UK, Germany and France - which are among the five countries still committed to the nuclear pact - have all objected to the sanctions. They have promised to support European firms that do ""legitimate business"" with Iran and have set up an alternative payment mechanism - or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - that will help companies trade without facing US penalties. However, analysts doubt this will materially lessen the impact of sanctions on Iran, given the importance of the US to global trade. Mr Pompeo said more than 100 big international companies had withdrawn from Iran because of the looming sanctions. Even if firms can use the SPV, any US company it does business with could face punishment. Another signatory to the nuclear deal, China, has said it regrets the re-imposition of sanctions and that its lawful trade with Iran should be respected. Israel - Iran's long-time foe in the Middle East - called the move a ""courageous, determined and important decision"". ""I think this contributes to stability and security and peace,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. What nappies tell us about Iran's economic woes Now what for Iran?

Nappies and Iran's economic woes,"Nappy price rises are forcing some parents to change their plans for families Babies' nappies have become the latest casualty of Iran's faltering economy, with huge price rises and shortages across the country. Fears over their availability have whipped up a storm of angry messages on social media blaming the authorities. The issue made national headlines days ago, when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet went to meet the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In the course of their conversation, Ayatollah Khamenei mentioned the shortage of nappies, blaming it on ""the enemy"" who ""wants people to make angry with the government"". He had, maybe unintentionally, touched a nerve and, soon after, nappies started trending on Iranian social media, with everyone pitching into the debate. Hardliners blamed government mismanagement, the government blamed US sanctions and businesses profiteering and those in favour of regime change blamed the Islamic Republic. Since March, the Iranian currency has lost almost two-thirds of its value against the US dollar, hitting record lows amid concerns about the adverse effects of the Trump administration pulling out of the nuclear deal and re-imposing sanctions on Iran. This has resulted in a big rise in the price of imported goods. The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts Could the Iran deal collapse? While a large chunk of the nappies sold in Iran are made domestically, manufacturers rely on imported raw material. This has resulted in the price of nappies soaring in the past few months. In one case, for example, the price of a pack of Iranian-made nappies rose from 380,000 rials ($9; Â£7) in late April to 850,000 rials in late August - a 137% increase in just four months. Iran's currency has plummeted These rises are not just putting pressure on family finances. In some cases they are beginning to impact on peoples lives and plans. Ali lives in the north-eastern city of Mashhad with his wife and their one-year old child. He told BBC Persian they had been planning to have a second child. But due to the soaring cost of nappies and other recent price rises they have given up on the idea. ""Raising just one child will be an achievement in itself,"" he says. Apart from nappies, the prices of adult incontinence pads and sanitary towels have also increased, and they are also in short supply. Moslem's elderly father suffers from both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and he relies on incontinence pads. ""They were 200,000 rials a pack back in March,"" Moslem told the BBC. ""Now they are over 500,000 rials, if I manage to find any at all."" Has Iran's economy benefitted from the nuclear deal? He says he may be forced to use cloths instead, ""like we used to the old days"". Sanitary towels are also getting more difficult to find. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei (L) has blamed nappy shortages on ""the enemy"" ""They're not like expensive cars that you can live without,"" says Sama, from Tehran. ""Every woman, rich or poor, needs them every month."" And just as they did with the nappies, some Iranians on social media say they have recently bought pads in bulk, fearing price rises and shortages. While the price increases are largely due to the devaluation of currency, the shortages are also being caused by customs delays and businesses hoarding supplies. On Sunday local authorities in Savojbolagh, 80km (50 miles) west of Tehran, said they had raided a warehouse and discovered a million packs of nappies. They were imported several months ago when the price of the dollar was a third what it is now, the authorities said, and were kept with the intention of selling them at a much higher price, But there is also another reason why supplies of both imported nappies and the raw materials needed to manufacture them are not reaching end customers. When exchange rates started to rise, the government said it would allocate subsidised foreign currency to importers to keep prices down. But that decision had an unintended consequence. The US says it wants to cut Iran's oil exports to zero Instead of using the currency to import goods, some businesses simply sold it on the black market to make a quick profit. In response, the Iranian central bank reversed the policy, and announced that businesses would now have to pay back the difference between the subsidised and actual exchange rates before they were allowed to import the goods. This has led to nappies and raw materials being stuck at customs, exacerbating the shortages. A trade body representing manufacturers said recently that 10 nappy factories had stopped production for lack of raw materials. A second wave of US sanctions affecting Iran's oil exports and the central bank is due to take effect on 4 November. The Trump administration says it wants to cut Iran's oil exports to zero - which would deprive the Iranian government of its biggest source of hard currency. If that happens, the Iranian currency may continue to fall, and the nappy crisis could be just the beginning.

Charges over World Cup ambulance damageThree men and a woman are charged with criminal damage after England's World Cup quarter-final win.London,"A fundraising page set up to pay for repairs raised Â£10,000 after photos of the damaged car were shared online Three men and a woman have been charged with criminal damage after an ambulance was smashed up while football fans celebrated England's quarter-final win over Sweden at the World Cup. The car was taken out of service when it was damaged after the match on 7 July in Borough High Street, London. More than Â£10,000 was raised through a crowdfunding page to pay for repairs. The four defendants are due to appear at Camberwell Magistrates' Court on 22 November. A JustGiving page set up by Millwall Supporters' Club raised twice its target of Â£5,000 after photos of the damaged car were shared across social media. However, a Skoda dealership offered to fix the car for free, so the donations were instead put towards restoring an old ambulance, London Ambulance Service (LAS) said.

"Ireland warns UK over post-Brexit borderIreland's prime minister says the UK should ""stand by its commitments"" on avoiding a hard border.UK PoliticsComments","The UK government has been told by Ireland to ""stand by its commitments"" on avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said an arrangement with a time limit would not be ""worth the paper it's written on"". The border issue is the main barrier to progress between the two sides. With time running out, Theresa May, who briefs her cabinet on Tuesday, has to get both the EU and her MPs on side. Kuenssberg: 10 pointers on where we are with Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop How will Parliament vote on a final deal? All you need to know about Brexit The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said divorce negotiations with the UK are not driven by a sense of revenge and that a no-deal, or a ""hard"" Brexit, would be a leap into the unknown for Britons living in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. Speaking at an event in Brussels, Mr Barnier also said any Brexit deal had to maintain an open Irish border to protect peace on the island that has seen decades of sectarian violence. The UK is due to leave the EU in March, and although 95% of the deal is said to be complete, the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland. It is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states. There have been warnings that a hard border would undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland. But unless negotiators can make decisive progress on how to guarantee no new visible checks, a special summit to finalise the UK's withdrawal will not take place. There is disagreement on whether the ""backstop"" they have agreed to put in place should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it can be time-limited or revoked by the UK. Please upgrade your browser Tory Brexiteers are concerned the UK could end up locked in a customs union with the EU without a fixed end point. Writing inThe Sun,external, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said this would be an ""absolute stinker"" of a deal and warned of a ""surrender to Brussels"" with the UK staying tied to EU rules in years to come. Mrs May has insisted that any arrangement would be ""strictly time limited"". This, however, is not the view of the EU. On Twitter, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a time-limited arrangement - or one that could be unilaterally ended by the UK - would never get EU backing. Allow Twitter content?

""Still necessary to repeat this, it seems,"" added the EU's deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand. And Mr Varadkar said the UK had agreed to a legally-binding ""backstop"" to apply ""unless and until"" it is superseded by a new agreement. ""I think it's reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK government to stand by its commitments,"" he said. Mr Varadkar described the UK as a ""divided kingdom"" over Brexit, saying this made it ""very difficult to come to an agreement"". While the EU has objected to a time-limited UK-wide arrangement, its suggestion of a backstop that is specific to Northern Ireland has been ruled out by Mrs May who says it would undermine the integrity of the UK by creating a new border down the Irish Sea. The prime minister says she does not think a ""backstop"" arrangement will be necessary as she wants to solve the border problem through the UK's long-term trade relationship with the EU, which has yet to be agreed. Mrs May spoke to Mr Varadkar by phone on Monday morning ""to take stock of the progress being made"", Downing Street said, adding that: ""In order to ensure that the backstop, if ever needed, would be temporary, the prime minister said that there would need to be a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end."" The Irish government said Mrs May had ""raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop"", and that Mr Varadkar had ""indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop"". Baroness Kennedy is among the legal figures supporting another Brexit referendum Meanwhile, 1,400 lawyers have signed a letter calling for another EU referendum to be held. Among the signatories of the letter are Labour peer Baroness Kennedy QC, former Court of Appeal judge Konrad Schiemann and David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice. They say questions over the validity of the 2016 vote mean it should not be the public's final word, any more than the 1975 referendum on membership of what was then the European Economic Community. In the earlier referendum, voters faced a clear choice between alternatives once negotiations had been completed, the lawyers said. By contrast, during the 2016 vote, ""the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown"", said the letter. ""Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative. In the campaign, un-testable claims took the place of facts and reality."" The UK government has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust after the result of the referendum in 2016. A spokeswoman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said that the government was confident of a ""mutually advantageous"" deal with the EU. ""The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum,"" she said.

'Make drivers pay for fuel in advance',"Service stations should make drivers pay for fuel in advance to prevent theft, a top police officer says. Petrol firms had made it too easy to drive off without paying because they wanted to entice motorists into their shops, said Simon Cole of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). But the Petrol Retailers' Association said switching to payment at the pump would be ""prohibitively expensive"". About 25,000 people every year ""bilk"" the system by avoiding payment. Mr Cole, who is chief constable for Leicestershire, said 12% of crimes faced by his force were retail-related. ""The petroleum industry could design out bilking in 30 seconds by making people pay up front, which is what they do in other countries,"" he said,in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper.,external ""They don't, because the walk in their shops is part of their business offer."" However, Gordon Balmer, commercial manager of the Petrol Retailers' Association, said it was ""not quite as simple"" as Mr Cole seemed to think it was. Asda suspends Â£99 petrol station scheme Motorway petrol prices 'exploitative' Fuel price calculator: How much do you pay? Mr Balmer said it would cost at least Â£20,000 to retrofit petrol pumps at an average filling station to take card payments, while some estimates put the cost much higher. He added that 50% of the average forecourt's profits now came from non-fuel sales, especially in rural communities, which had lost amenities such as banks and post offices. ""Many of those services have migrated into the store of a petrol station,"" he said. Mr Balmer said that although many people had the impression that petrol stations were run by big oil companies, 70% of the UK's filling stations were actually independently owned. In the US, virtually all filling stations require customers to pay for fuel at the pump by inserting a credit or debit card. However, this system has been blamed for lower profits, as fewer people bother to visit the convenience stores that are usually found on the forecourts. Mr Cole's call comes as concerns grow that UK police forces are too stretched to be able to deal effectively with the most serious crimes. Last week, the head of the NPCC, Sara Thornton, saidthere needed to be a ""refocus on core policing"", such as burglary and violence, because there were ""too many desirable and deserving issues"" that officers simply could not respond to.

Army recruits don't need to live in Britain,"Soldiers of the Coldstream Guards carry flags of the 53 Commonwealth countries More foreign nationals living abroad will be able to join the armed forces, the government is to announce. Currently, only 200 Commonwealth citizens per year can apply without having lived in the UK for five years. But in a bid to recruit more servicemen and women to the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, the Ministry of Defence is lifting this cap. The armed forces are short of 8,200 soldiers, sailors and air personnel,a report found,externalearlier this year. It is the worst shortage since 2010, said the independent government watchdog, the National Audit Office. Man-eating tigress killed after huge hunt The Indian princess who became a South Korean queen Review: Stormzy's new book Ministers are expected to announce the change to recruitment rules on Monday. It means people from Commonwealth countries - including India, Australia, Kenya, Fiji and Sri Lanka - will be considered for roles, even if they have never lived in Britain. Arule introduced in 2016,externalalready allows 200 Commonwealth citizens who have not met the requirement of living in the UK for five years to apply for a limited number of jobs every year. It is hoped the changes will lead to an extra 1,350 people being recruited every year. The five-year UK residency requirement for Commonwealth recruits was first waived in 1998, before being reintroduced in 2013. Miandad Matthew, who grew up in Saint Lucia, served from 1999-2008 in the Royal Dragoon Guards. He signed up to the British army after going on holiday to London to visit family. ""Ever since I was little boy I wanted to be a solider,"" the 40-year-old, who now lives in Grays, Essex. ""I enjoyed my time in the Army. I travelled to a lot of different countries and saw other cultures. ""Before I joined up I was quite a shy person and the Army changed me completely."" Miandad Matthew grew up in St Lucia and served in the British army for nearly 10 years He joined when there was no requirement to have lived in the UK for five years and he said it was good the rules were being relaxed again. ""It will give quite a few young guys in the Caribbean more career opportunities,"" he said. According tothe Daily Telegraph,,externalwhich first published details of the plan in Monday's paper, the air force and navy will begin recruiting immediately and the Army will open applications early next year. Applications from citizens of countries outside the Commonwealth will not be accepted, the paper adds. Citizens of Ireland and also Gurkhas from Nepal can already join because of special rules. Army ads 'won't appeal to new soldiers' Why the Army needs more women soldiers The 'changing face' of the British army April's National Audit Office report also said there were ""much larger shortfalls"" in the number of military engineers, pilots and intelligence analysts. It said the armed forces were involved in 25 operations worldwide in 2016-17 - and the air force is undertaking more missions than it has for a quarter of a century. Anda Conservative MP's report,externalin July 2017 on the state of Army recruitment warned that the armed forces were ""hollowing out"" due to recruitment issues. Mark Francois, who spent a year meeting with MoD officials as well as military personnel, said there was a ""perfect storm"" of high employment rates and an ageing population with fewer people of military age. An increase in obesity and also a rising proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic people - who he said have until now been less likely to apply for military service - are also factors, he added. He made many recommendations - including attracting more black, Asian and minority ethnic recruits and women. Last month,it was announcedthat women were now allowed to apply for all roles in the British military for the first time in history.

The Spice Girls have announced their first tour for a decade, with six UK stadium dates in June next year. Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Melanie Chisholm revealed details of the reunion tour in a video on social media on Monday. Victoria Beckham, however, will not be taking part.

The press release said Victoria, who runs a multi-million pound fashion label, would not join the girls on tour due to ""business commitments"".

""It's just the four of us that are fully confirmed, but Vic might join us at some point,"" the star said on ITV's Loose Women. ""It'd be a shame if she didn't."" Scary Spice made a dig at Beckham with her attendance at Heidi Klum's Halloween party Last week, Mel B took a swipe at her bandmate by dressing up as Victoria for Halloween and holding a sign that read: ""No I am not going on tour."" Scary was joined by a friend dressed as David Beckham, who held a sign saying: ""Please, please, please do it for the Spice Girls fans."" Does sex addiction really exist? Brown ballet shoes made for first time HBO unimpressed by Trump's 'Thrones' meme Asked what Victoria made of the costume, Mel B said she thought she would find it funny, but also acknowledged the pair's rocky relationship.

Brexit worries 'hit Channel ferry bookings',"UK holidaymakers are delaying booking Channel crossings for next summer amid concerns about the consequences of Brexit, Brittany Ferries has said. Forward bookings were down between 4% and 5% from some of its regular customers, the company said. Nigel Wonnacott from Brittany Ferries said people were worried about the impact on areas such as pet travel, health insurance and driving licences. The decline was ""raising the red flag"", he toldBBC 5 live's Wake Up to Money. Falls in forward bookings was affecting Brittany Ferries' cashflow, Mr Wonnacott said, and raised concerns about whether it would be able to fill its 10 ferries. It will take delivery next year of a new vessel for the Portsmouth to Caen route, which accounts for about 30% of its traffic, that has capacity for up to 1,700 passengers. This video can not be played How Brexit could affect travel to mainland Europe Christophe Mathieu, the company's chief executive, said: ""Two more ships will follow as part of our â¬450m investment in the future. But we need to make sure we have passengers and freight to fill these new ships."" ""We know that uncertainty and instability in the UK will have consequences on both sides of the channel,"" he said. ""A poor [Brexit] deal, or perhaps no deal at all, could impact Brittany, Normandy and the Loire."" Research from Abta, the trade body for tour operators and travel agents, found that 43% of people are confused about how Brexit will affect travel arrangements, up from 36% last year, while almost half (48%) fear it will make it harder to travel to the continent. ""As we head towards the peak holiday booking period, there is still a lack of certainty about what will happen when we leave the EU ... we encourage both sides to take a pragmatic approach to getting a deal done,"" an Abta spokesperson said. Despite the concerns about Brexit, package holiday bookings for European destinations next summer were 14% higher than at the same point last year, the association added. A spokesperson for Eurotunnel, which operates Le Shuttle services between Folkestone and Calais, said ""bookings are strong going forward"". This video can not be played Five ways Brexit could affect your holiday Some holidaymakers have told the BBC that concerns over Brexit are affecting their plans. Graeme Murphy said: ""We normally have the following year's travel and accommodation booked by now as we are independent travellers, but are waiting to see what visas, travel permits etc we will need as we are afraid that we may not have the necessary documentation in time to travel. Seems that our annual holiday to Lindos, Rhodes is not going to happen in 2019."" Mervyn Hill said: ""We're not booking a holiday until the situation becomes absolutely clear... we need specific insurance cover for existing health issues, but we suspect the risk of a no-deal Brexit will have a significant detrimental effect on insurance premiums."" Brittany Ferries was founded by Breton farmers in 1972. It operates services between the UK and Ireland to France and Spain, with Britons visiting France and northern Spain accounting for 85% of passengers. The company reported a 2% rise in passengers to almost 1.1 million for the three months to September compared with the same period last summer. Download Monday's edition of Wake Up to Money here.

Mo Salah statue draws mockery online,"This video can not be played What do the people of Liverpool think of the new statue of football star Mohamed Salah? A sculpture of Liverpool and Egypt football star Mohamed Salah unveiled in his home country is raising eyebrows on social media. The artwork was put on display on Sunday at the World Youth Forum (WYF) being held in Sharm al-Sheikh. It depicts the striker with his arms out wide in the goalscoring celebration he is known for. But people have suggested it looks more like singer Leo Sayer or Marv the burglar from the film Home Alone. The artwork of Salah recreates his famous goal celebration pose The sculpture of Salah joins a long list of other sculptures in the football world that have left fans scratching their heads about likeness. It has drawn comparisons to a bust of Cristiano Ronaldo which was widely mocked after it was unveiled at Madeira airport last year. Allow Twitter content?

Ryanair to shut website for urgent upgrade,"Online bookings and check-in with Ryanair will close for 12 hours after the airline said it needed to shut down its website and mobile phone app. It said the shutdown from 17:00 UK time on Wednesday to 05:00 on Thursday was needed for a computer systems upgrade. Ryanair ""sincerely apologised"" to customers for any inconvenience, and urged anyone needing to check in to do so before the closure. The Irish carrier says it operates Europe's largest travel website. There are about 1.5 million visits to the website every day, with 22,700 boarding passes downloaded each day. Ryanair's policy is to charge passengers an extra Â£55 if they need to check in at an airport, and the airline says all fees will stay in force. The carrier's online check-in facility is only open between 48 hours and two hours before a flight for passengers who have not paid extra to select a seat. Robin Kiely, the Irish carrier's head of communications, said in a statement: ""As part of our continued digital development, a web closure and system upgrade will take place for 12 hours, from 17:00hrs (UK time) on Wednesday 7th November, until 05:00hrs (UK time) on Thursday 8th November, during which time our online check-in service will not be available. ""Flight bookings and changes will also be unavailable during this period. Customers travelling on Wednesday or Thursday should check in for their flight on Tuesday 6th November. ""We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by this upgrade, which will further improve Ryanair.com, Europe's largest travel website."" Also on Monday, Ryanair reported an 11% rise in traffic in October, as it carried 13.1 million passengers. That total includes 500,000 passengers from Lauda, the airline founded by former Formula One champion Niki Lauda and recently bought by Ryanair. During October, the airline had to cancel about 300 flights due to a combination of an airport handler strike at Brussels Zaventem, bad weather, and continuing air traffic control staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France. Monday's news comes as Germany's VC pilots union says it cannot rule out more strikes at Ryanair. Last month, the union called the airline's decision to close its base in Bremen, Germany, a ""declaration of war"" on unions and said the move must be reversed to make progress on talks. Ryanair has faced a series of industrial actions across Europe this year. The airline has also faced criticism after introduction of new baggage rules last week.

Four accused of World Cup ambulance damage,"A fundraising page set up to pay for repairs raised Â£10,000 after photos of the damaged car were shared online Three men and a woman have been charged with criminal damage after an ambulance was smashed up while football fans celebrated England's quarter-final win over Sweden at the World Cup. The car was taken out of service when it was damaged after the match on 7 July in Borough High Street, London. More than Â£10,000 was raised through a crowdfunding page to pay for repairs. The four defendants are due to appear at Camberwell Magistrates' Court on 22 November. A JustGiving page set up by Millwall Supporters' Club raised twice its target of Â£5,000 after photos of the damaged car were shared across social media. However, a Skoda dealership offered to fix the car for free, so the donations were instead put towards restoring an old ambulance, London Ambulance Service (LAS) said. The four people facing charges are: Perry Kangyue Jian, 26, from Poplar, London Larissa Bell, 21, from East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire James Elton, 27, from West Hampstead, London Scott Dennett, 25, from Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire Metropolitan Police All London Underground line and stations closed this weekend listed WATCH: Heartwarming action from King's Guard makes young boy's day Richmond named one of the best places to retire with its 'sense of belonging' Drink driver does dangerous donuts in the snow in shocking CCTV footage Beckenham paedophile and Lewisham public masturbator among latest in court Lewisham residents owe Â£62million in council tax debts Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Too many degrees 'offer too little payback',"The criticism being levelled at many universities is that they are not providing value for money Too many graduates in England are being left with big debts for too little payback, MPs are warning. Nearly half of recent graduates were not working in graduate roles in 2017, the Commons education committee says. Its chairman Robert Halfon also highlights the excessive pay of some university vice-chancellors, saying that is not value for money. The government is reviewing post-18 education and funding to see how it can ensure that value. TheAugar Review,external, which is due to report early next year, is looking at the system under which students take out tuition fee loans to fund courses costing Â£9,000 a year. But the committee warned that the scope of this review, which has been limited by the government, means there is a risk it ""will fail to overhaul the system"" in a way that will benefit graduates and students. The government has said the review's recommendations must be consistent with the government's fiscal policies, must not affect taxation or cover the earlier pre-2012 loans system. The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Which university courses boost graduates' wages the most? Does it matter what degree grade you get? Many earn 'paltry returns' for degrees The report, Value for Money in Higher Education, said the committee was encouraged by an increase in information on the kind of outcomes graduates can expect. But it warned: ""The graduate premium varies greatly depending on where and what a student studies."" Mr Halfon said: ""The blunt reality is that too many universities are not providing value for money, and that students are not getting good outcomes from the degrees for which so many of them rack up debt."" The report quotes a recent National Audit Office report which said bad decisions on courses could ""lead to poor financial outcomes"". The MPs' committee report said: ""There is still a long way to go before students have access to robust data on graduate employment which will inform their choices."" It points to Office for National Statistics data showing 49% of recent graduates were not working in graduate roles across the UK in 2017. The report also highlighted how students from poorer backgrounds are far more likely than their wealthier peers to go to lower-ranking universities. Here, opportunities for better-paid employment tend to be more limited. Hard work... but for what reward? And it recommended: ""Higher education institutions must be more transparent about the labour market returns of their courses. ""This is not simply a measure of graduate earnings but of appropriate professional graduate-level and skilled employment destinations."" It should be obligatory for universities to publish this information, it said. Mr Halfon calls for strict criteria on acceptable levels of vice-chancellor pay to be enforced. A new voluntary code covering senior staff pay was published by universities in the summer. Under this code, institutions must provide meaningful explanations if pay diverges from the code. Mr Halfon said: ""Too many institutions exist where vice-chancellors and senior management earn excessive amounts that does not represent value for either the student or the taxpayer. ""Self-regulation should be out of the question, and the Office for Students must enforce strict criteria on acceptable levels of pay that could be linked to average staff pay, performance and other measures."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said government reforms had seen ""record rates"" of disadvantaged 18-year-olds attending UK universities. ""That's why we are pleased to see universities and further education colleges planning to spend more than Â£860m on measures to improve access and outcomes for disadvantaged students,"" she said. Not everyone is smiling about their student experience ""We know that what you study and where you study really matters and we are introducing and developing digital tools that provide data on graduate outcomes that will begin to revolutionise how students choose the right university for them. ""We are also reviewing post-18 education and funding, which will look at how we can ensure greater value for money for both students and taxpayers."" Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said universities must focus on value for money and supporting disadvantaged students. ""The Tories trebled tuition fees and scrapped maintenance grants, leaving the most disadvantaged students with over Â£57,000 worth of debt when they graduate,"" she said. ""It is no wonder there are concerns that students do not get value for money. ""The number of part-time and mature students plummeted after the Tories trebled fees, yet they are doing nothing to support the many learners who have been shut out by the current system. ""They should start by matching Labour's commitment to bring back maintenance grants, to ensure that everyone, whatever their background, can succeed at university."" Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: ""Our universities have a well deserved international reputation for high quality teaching, learning and research, delivered by talented and dedicated staff. ""Universities have increased investment in teaching and learning and students continue to report record levels of satisfaction with their courses. ""Graduates leaving our universities are also increasingly in demand from employers. ""They are more likely to be in employment and earn on average Â£10,000 each year more than non-graduates.""

Army recruits don't need to live in BritainThere will no longer be limits on Commonwealth citizens joining up without living in the UK first.UK,"Soldiers of the Coldstream Guards carry flags of the 53 Commonwealth countries More foreign nationals living abroad will be able to join the armed forces, the government is to announce. Currently, only 200 Commonwealth citizens per year can apply without having lived in the UK for five years. But in a bid to recruit more servicemen and women to the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, the Ministry of Defence is lifting this cap. The armed forces are short of 8,200 soldiers, sailors and air personnel,a report found,externalearlier this year. It is the worst shortage since 2010, said the independent government watchdog, the National Audit Office. Man-eating tigress killed after huge hunt The Indian princess who became a South Korean queen Review: Stormzy's new book Ministers are expected to announce the change to recruitment rules on Monday. It means people from Commonwealth countries - including India, Australia, Kenya, Fiji and Sri Lanka - will be considered for roles, even if they have never lived in Britain. Arule introduced in 2016,externalalready allows 200 Commonwealth citizens who have not met the requirement of living in the UK for five years to apply for a limited number of jobs every year. It is hoped the changes will lead to an extra 1,350 people being recruited every year. The five-year UK residency requirement for Commonwealth recruits was first waived in 1998, before being reintroduced in 2013. Miandad Matthew, who grew up in Saint Lucia, served from 1999-2008 in the Royal Dragoon Guards. He signed up to the British army after going on holiday to London to visit family. ""Ever since I was little boy I wanted to be a solider,"" the 40-year-old, who now lives in Grays, Essex. ""I enjoyed my time in the Army. I travelled to a lot of different countries and saw other cultures. ""Before I joined up I was quite a shy person and the Army changed me completely."" Miandad Matthew grew up in St Lucia and served in the British army for nearly 10 years He joined when there was no requirement to have lived in the UK for five years and he said it was good the rules were being relaxed again. ""It will give quite a few young guys in the Caribbean more career opportunities,"" he said. According tothe Daily Telegraph,,externalwhich first published details of the plan in Monday's paper, the air force and navy will begin recruiting immediately and the Army will open applications early next year. Applications from citizens of countries outside the Commonwealth will not be accepted, the paper adds. Citizens of Ireland and also Gurkhas from Nepal can already join because of special rules. Army ads 'won't appeal to new soldiers' Why the Army needs more women soldiers The 'changing face' of the British army April's National Audit Office report also said there were ""much larger shortfalls"" in the number of military engineers, pilots and intelligence analysts. It said the armed forces were involved in 25 operations worldwide in 2016-17 - and the air force is undertaking more missions than it has for a quarter of a century. Anda Conservative MP's report,externalin July 2017 on the state of Army recruitment warned that the armed forces were ""hollowing out"" due to recruitment issues. Mark Francois, who spent a year meeting with MoD officials as well as military personnel, said there was a ""perfect storm"" of high employment rates and an ageing population with fewer people of military age. An increase in obesity and also a rising proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic people - who he said have until now been less likely to apply for military service - are also factors, he added. He made many recommendations - including attracting more black, Asian and minority ethnic recruits and women. Last month,it was announcedthat women were now allowed to apply for all roles in the British military for the first time in history.

Mo Salah statue in Egypt raises eyebrows,"This video can not be played What do the people of Liverpool think of the new statue of football star Mohamed Salah?

The artwork was put on display on Sunday at the World Youth Forum (WYF) being held in Sharm al-Sheikh. It depicts the striker with his arms out wide in the goalscoring celebration he is known for.

The artwork of Salah recreates his famous goal celebration pose The sculpture of Salah joins a long list of other sculptures in the football world that have left fans scratching their heads about likeness. It has drawn comparisons to a bust of Cristiano Ronaldo which was widely mocked after it was unveiled at Madeira airport last year. Allow Twitter content?

Gas blast fire destroys six businesses,"This video can not be played An explosion was heard at Nottingham's former cattle market after the fire broke out A major fire which ripped through a former cattle market and led to gas cylinders exploding has destroyed several businesses. The blaze broke out in Nottingham's cattle market at about 18:00 GMT on Sunday, engulfing several buildings. A reptile retailer had to evacuate 200 animals from its premises, while an employee of a bedding outlet said there was ""nothing but ashes"" left. An investigation into the cause of the fire has begun. About 100 firefighters tackled the blaze, which was brought under control in the early hours of the morning. Damping down is ongoing. Several businesses, including a fruit wholesalers and an army surplus store, have been badly affected Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service said tackling the blaze was ""a real challenge"", with densely-packed buildings, gas cylinders and a limited water supply. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Incident commander Bryn Coleman added: ""The buildings are close together and it was a dynamic situation. ""Because of the amount of material involved in the buildings, we had problems with the water pressure from the fire hydrants and had to use a high pressure pump to get water from the canal."" Damage varies from minor blackening to complete destruction Mr Coleman confirmed they ""had a conversation"" with the owners of military surplus store Anchor Supplies to confirm there was no ammunition involved. This video can not be played Drone footage of Nottingham Cattle Market fire Dawn Lear, manager at Anchor, said: ""We are devastated. We got the call and came down but could only stand and watch it burn. ""We have lost the electrical and engineering departments, with First and Second World War items that can't be replaced. ""But clothing, and our museum, seems to have survived. So we will rebuild and restock."" Pockets of fire are still being damped down more than 12 hours after the fire started The fire service said four premises had been destroyed, with another nine damaged to varying extents. The worse affected include Bed City, SB refrigeration, Fresh N Fruity and D&B Carburetters. The only injury reported was one man - who was reportedly bitten by a snake while moving livestock from the exotic pet business. This video can not be played Keyvan Ganji captured the fire as it raged through Nottingham cattle market Richard Wragg, who runs a cold storage unit nearby, described how the reptiles had to be evacuated from the scene. ""So, 200 reptiles to evacuate in the space of about 20 minutes is a bit interesting,"" he said. ""So it was just a mad dash ferrying them from their unit to our unit."" One lizard was so large it had to be moved in a shopping trolley, he added. About 100 firefighters tackled the fire overnight A number of other businesses in the Cattle Market, including Arthur Johnson and Sons Auctioneers and the 4am Cafe, have not been directly affected.

Ireland warns UK over post-Brexit borderThe Irish border is the main sticking point with the PM under pressure from the Tories and the EU.UK PoliticsComments,"The UK government has been told by Ireland to ""stand by its commitments"" on avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said an arrangement with a time limit would not be ""worth the paper it's written on"". The border issue is the main barrier to progress between the two sides. With time running out, Theresa May, who briefs her cabinet on Tuesday, has to get both the EU and her MPs on side. Kuenssberg: 10 pointers on where we are with Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop How will Parliament vote on a final deal? All you need to know about Brexit The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said divorce negotiations with the UK are not driven by a sense of revenge and that a no-deal, or a ""hard"" Brexit, would be a leap into the unknown for Britons living in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. Speaking at an event in Brussels, Mr Barnier also said any Brexit deal had to maintain an open Irish border to protect peace on the island that has seen decades of sectarian violence. The UK is due to leave the EU in March, and although 95% of the deal is said to be complete, the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland. It is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states. There have been warnings that a hard border would undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland. But unless negotiators can make decisive progress on how to guarantee no new visible checks, a special summit to finalise the UK's withdrawal will not take place. There is disagreement on whether the ""backstop"" they have agreed to put in place should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it can be time-limited or revoked by the UK. Please upgrade your browser Tory Brexiteers are concerned the UK could end up locked in a customs union with the EU without a fixed end point. Writing inThe Sun,external, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said this would be an ""absolute stinker"" of a deal and warned of a ""surrender to Brussels"" with the UK staying tied to EU rules in years to come. Mrs May has insisted that any arrangement would be ""strictly time limited"". This, however, is not the view of the EU. On Twitter, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a time-limited arrangement - or one that could be unilaterally ended by the UK - would never get EU backing. Allow Twitter content?

""Still necessary to repeat this, it seems,"" added the EU's deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand. And Mr Varadkar said the UK had agreed to a legally-binding ""backstop"" to apply ""unless and until"" it is superseded by a new agreement. ""I think it's reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK government to stand by its commitments,"" he said. Mr Varadkar described the UK as a ""divided kingdom"" over Brexit, saying this made it ""very difficult to come to an agreement"". While the EU has objected to a time-limited UK-wide arrangement, its suggestion of a backstop that is specific to Northern Ireland has been ruled out by Mrs May who says it would undermine the integrity of the UK by creating a new border down the Irish Sea. The prime minister says she does not think a ""backstop"" arrangement will be necessary as she wants to solve the border problem through the UK's long-term trade relationship with the EU, which has yet to be agreed. Mrs May spoke to Mr Varadkar by phone on Monday morning ""to take stock of the progress being made"", Downing Street said, adding that: ""In order to ensure that the backstop, if ever needed, would be temporary, the prime minister said that there would need to be a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end."" The Irish government said Mrs May had ""raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop"", and that Mr Varadkar had ""indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop"". Baroness Kennedy is among the legal figures supporting another Brexit referendum Meanwhile, 1,400 lawyers have signed a letter calling for another EU referendum to be held. Among the signatories of the letter are Labour peer Baroness Kennedy QC, former Court of Appeal judge Konrad Schiemann and David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice. They say questions over the validity of the 2016 vote mean it should not be the public's final word, any more than the 1975 referendum on membership of what was then the European Economic Community. In the earlier referendum, voters faced a clear choice between alternatives once negotiations had been completed, the lawyers said. By contrast, during the 2016 vote, ""the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown"", said the letter. ""Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative. In the campaign, un-testable claims took the place of facts and reality."" The UK government has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust after the result of the referendum in 2016.

Health plan aims to boost life expectancy,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock outlines new plans for an emphasis on illness prevention People in England are being told to cut back on alcohol, sugar, salt and fat in a bid to boost the nation's healthy life expectancy by five years. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is setting out his long-term vision for the NHS on Monday - and the focus is on preventing illness. He says that 10 times more money is spent on treating disease than prevention - which ""doesn't stack up"". The plan also recommends that bosses should do more to keep staff healthy. Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there needed to be a shift in culture and in the way resources are balanced. ""For too long the NHS has seen itself as essentially the National Hospital Service, with primary care and GPs round the side,"" he said. ""I want to see it as the health service of the nation, helping people to stay healthier."" How long are you going to live? UK among worst for life expectancy Mr Hancock wants people to have five more years of healthy, independent life by 2035.UK life expectancyis currently 82.9 years for women, and 79.2 for men. To achieve this, he is encouraging people to take more responsibility for their own health. Mr Hancock says: ""It's about people choosing to look after themselves better, staying active and stopping smoking. ""Making better choices by limiting alcohol, sugar, salt and fat."" But he says the strategy is ""not about penalising people"". ""It's about helping them make better choices, giving them all the support we can, because we know taking the tough decisions is never easy,"" he will tell the annual meeting of the International Association of National Public Health Institutes. The plan also includes ambitions to: halve childhood obesity by 2030 reduce loneliness by making ""social prescribing"" - when doctors or nurses prescribe community activities - more widespread diagnosing 75% of cancers at stages one and two by 2028 use technologyto predict patients' illnesses and target advice at sections of the population Mr Hancock adds: ""In the UK, we are spending Â£97bn of public money on treating disease and only Â£8bn preventing it across the UK. ""You don't have to be an economist to see those numbers don't stack up."" The announcement, which is being dubbed the government's ""vision"", will be followed up by a Green Paper in 2019 - a first draft of the plans. It comes after last week's Budget, when Chancellor Philip Hammond promised an extra Â£20.5bn for the NHS over the next five years. Mr Hancock would not be drawn on how much of the Â£20bn investment for the NHS would be spent on preventative measures when asked by the Today programme. But said he wanted to see the ""proportion spent on primary care going up"". Mr Hancock would also not reveal whether the budget for Public Health England would be cut or added to next year, saying its funding for national health programmes would be settled in the spending review next spring. 'NHS faces cuts as well as gains' Families 'struggle to afford healthy food' Helen Donovan, from the Royal College of Nursing, welcomed the plans but said they needed to be backed up with serious investments. And Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said the plans followed ""years of cuts and failed privatisation"". ""Unless ministers reverse these cuts and start fully funding public health services, these announcements will be dismissed as a litany of hollow promises,"" he said.

Teen called lesbian for playing football,"This video can not be played Darcie: Bullies ""won't stop me playing football"" A 13-year-old girl who dreams of playing football professionally says she has been criticised and called a lesbian for playing a ""boy's sport"". Darcie, 13, from Cwmbran in Torfaen has played football since she was eight. But she has been told by PE teachers that she cannot play it as a recommended sport at school - instead hockey and netball are for girls. The Children's Commissioner for Wales said gender stereotyping was ""depressing"". Darcie said she has been criticised because of her gender and playing football Darcie said she was determined to challenge the negative attitude. ""I want to play football, and I don't want someone to criticise me,"" she said. Women's football 'needs more support' in Wales 'Telling boys they throw like a girl puts girls off sport' ""They have criticised me a lot by saying I'm a man or a lesbian. They've just called me all different types of names."" Darcie, who is a central midfielder for a local football team, said it was not just boys who were responsible, with some parents shouting ""don't let a girl tackle you"" as well. She said she had asked to play football in school but had met some opposition. 12-year-old girl banned from playing football Is this World Cup still sexist? ""Girls' sport is hockey, netball, dance and all that and the boys' is basketball, rugby or football. ""I ask my PE teachers if I can play football, can I do that as a recommended sport and they say no because it is a boy's sport. ""I think it is wrong that people criticise girls for playing football because it is something they want to do and they love."" Sally Holland said sex-segregation in lessons was surprising Sally Holland, the Children's Commissioner for Wales,  said it was ""depressing"" to hear girls and boys complaining about gender stereotyping in this day and age. ""Girls say that there's often very little opportunity to take part in football and rugby,"" she said. ""Sometimes they have clubs where they can take part but it is not part of their core PE lessons. ""It makes girls and boys think their life has got to be constrained perhaps into one pathway or another and it is just a real harm that they can be turned off sport and exercise."" She described the sex-segregation in lessons as ""surprising"" in 2018 but reflective of wider attitudes in society. Welsh girls' rugby participation 'up by thousands' Swapping the Welsh Valleys for Canadian ice hockey Meet the woman coaching a Welsh men's team Dr Nalda Wainwright, director of the Welsh Institute of Physical Literacy, said the reliance on ""traditional sports"" in school is a hangover from the post-war period with the introduction of the 1944 Education Act. ""It is really down, I suppose, to the training of teachers. We know we have a real lack of expertise, particularly in primary schools,"" she said. ""It is not really a specialist subject and teachers will tend to replicate the experience they had."" The National Education Union said it was ""unacceptable"" that the girl from Torfaen has been treated in this way and it hoped that common sense would prevail and that the decision is reversed. ""We would not expect any pupil to be subject to gender stereotyping in this way and that would be and has been our advice to members,"" said David Evans, Wales secretary of the union. The Welsh Government said it wanted young people taking part in sport to have equality of opportunity so they could enjoy participating in the sport of their choice and lead a healthier and more active lifestyle. ""There is nothing that directs schools to follow particular sports for girls and boys and many are already looking at ways in which they can tackle gender stereotyping,"" said a spokesman. ""We would encourage schools to share this good practice and continue to address gender equity and equality through a whole school approach.""

Call to put shock images on fireworks,"Plastic surgeons want graphic images like this one of an injured hand on fireworks packets Senior doctors are calling for graphic images of injuries to be displayed on firework packaging. Plastic surgeons say the number of life-changing injuries is rising every year despite numerous safety campaigns. They believe shocking images, like the one they have mocked up using a man's severely damaged hand, might deter buyers. Half of those seen in hospital last year were aged 18 or under, and 80% were male. The campaign is being led by the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (Bapras). Bapras president David Ward said: ""We are extremely concerned about the continued misuse of fireworks, particularly by those under the age of 18 away from organised events. ""Although [fireworks are] packaged in a jovial, toy-like fashion, people forget that when using fireworks, they are handling explosives which can cause extremely serious injuries that may require extensive reconstructive surgery. ""Bapras is calling on the government to make a common-sense change by legislating to ensure all firework packaging in the UK includes mandatory graphic warning notices, similar to those found on cigarette packaging."" Almost 4,500 people in England attended A&E with injuries from fireworks last year, double the number in 2009-10, according to figures from NHS Digital. 'I lost my eye after firework exploded' Hotel 'saddened' by fireworks injuries Stray fireworks injure 14 at display The Bapras campaign: people need to remember that fireworks are explosives Surgeons say injuries are typically caused by people throwing rockets which either explode early, or hit someone close by. Surgeons have had to reconstruct this man's fingers The hand used in the campaign belongs to a 25-year-old-man from Wales, who did not wish to be identified. ""My friend threw a firework which landed by my feet. When I picked it up to move it out of the way, it exploded in my hand. I've had five operations, with plastic surgeons reconstructing parts of my fingers, and months later I still have three operations to go. ""The incident has had a huge impact on my life. I can't feed myself or play with my new-born kid. ""A clearer warning label might have made me and my friend think twice about the potential danger,"" he said. Many fireworks are currently packaged in the bold colours of children's toys, and the warnings are often found in small boxes on the back of the packaging. Fireworks are usually packaged in bright toy-like colours Legally you have to be 18 or over to buy fireworks, yet the hospital statistics show that many injuries requiring surgery are in males under the age of 18. Jim Fitzpatrick, MP for Poplar and Limehouse, is also supporting the campaign. ""There is an urgent need for government to introduce graphic warnings on firework packaging. The hope is that a graphic image of the potential dangers of misuse may stop someone in their tracks, preventing a possible life-changing injury."" A YouGov poll of 2,020 adults conducted in October found that 62% supported introducing graphic warnings on fireworks packaging. The campaign is also being supported by the Royal College of Surgeons and the British Society for Surgery of the Hand.

The artwork was put on display on Sunday at the World Youth Forum (WYF) being held in Sharm al-Sheikh. It depicts the striker with his arms out wide in the goalscoring celebration he is known for. But people have suggested it looks more like singer Leo Sayer or Marv the burglar from the film Home Alone. The artwork of Salah recreates his famous goal celebration pose The sculpture of Salah joins a long list of other sculptures in the football world that have left fans scratching their heads about likeness. It has drawn comparisons to a bust of Cristiano Ronaldo which was widely mocked after it was unveiled at Madeira airport last year. Allow Twitter content?

Lawyers group urges another Brexit vote,"The UK government has been told by Ireland to ""stand by its commitments"" on avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said an arrangement with a time limit would not be ""worth the paper it's written on"". The border issue is the main barrier to progress between the two sides. With time running out, Theresa May, who briefs her cabinet on Tuesday, has to get both the EU and her MPs on side. Kuenssberg: 10 pointers on where we are with Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop How will Parliament vote on a final deal? All you need to know about Brexit The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said divorce negotiations with the UK are not driven by a sense of revenge and that a no-deal, or a ""hard"" Brexit, would be a leap into the unknown for Britons living in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. Speaking at an event in Brussels, Mr Barnier also said any Brexit deal had to maintain an open Irish border to protect peace on the island that has seen decades of sectarian violence. The UK is due to leave the EU in March, and although 95% of the deal is said to be complete, the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland. It is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states. There have been warnings that a hard border would undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland. But unless negotiators can make decisive progress on how to guarantee no new visible checks, a special summit to finalise the UK's withdrawal will not take place. There is disagreement on whether the ""backstop"" they have agreed to put in place should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it can be time-limited or revoked by the UK. Please upgrade your browser Tory Brexiteers are concerned the UK could end up locked in a customs union with the EU without a fixed end point. Writing inThe Sun,external, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said this would be an ""absolute stinker"" of a deal and warned of a ""surrender to Brussels"" with the UK staying tied to EU rules in years to come. Mrs May has insisted that any arrangement would be ""strictly time limited"". This, however, is not the view of the EU. On Twitter, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a time-limited arrangement - or one that could be unilaterally ended by the UK - would never get EU backing. Allow Twitter content?

""Still necessary to repeat this, it seems,"" added the EU's deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand. And Mr Varadkar said the UK had agreed to a legally-binding ""backstop"" to apply ""unless and until"" it is superseded by a new agreement. ""I think it's reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK government to stand by its commitments,"" he said. Mr Varadkar described the UK as a ""divided kingdom"" over Brexit, saying this made it ""very difficult to come to an agreement"". While the EU has objected to a time-limited UK-wide arrangement, its suggestion of a backstop that is specific to Northern Ireland has been ruled out by Mrs May who says it would undermine the integrity of the UK by creating a new border down the Irish Sea. The prime minister says she does not think a ""backstop"" arrangement will be necessary as she wants to solve the border problem through the UK's long-term trade relationship with the EU, which has yet to be agreed. Mrs May spoke to Mr Varadkar by phone on Monday morning ""to take stock of the progress being made"", Downing Street said, adding that: ""In order to ensure that the backstop, if ever needed, would be temporary, the prime minister said that there would need to be a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end."" The Irish government said Mrs May had ""raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop"", and that Mr Varadkar had ""indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop"". Baroness Kennedy is among the legal figures supporting another Brexit referendum Meanwhile, 1,400 lawyers have signed a letter calling for another EU referendum to be held. Among the signatories of the letter are Labour peer Baroness Kennedy QC, former Court of Appeal judge Konrad Schiemann and David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice. They say questions over the validity of the 2016 vote mean it should not be the public's final word, any more than the 1975 referendum on membership of what was then the European Economic Community. In the earlier referendum, voters faced a clear choice between alternatives once negotiations had been completed, the lawyers said. By contrast, during the 2016 vote, ""the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown"", said the letter. ""Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative. In the campaign, un-testable claims took the place of facts and reality."" The UK government has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust after the result of the referendum in 2016. A spokeswoman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said that the government was confident of a ""mutually advantageous"" deal with the EU. ""The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum,"" she said.

London violence 'may take years to solve',"Jay Hughes was stabbed to death in a premeditated attack at a chicken shop in south-east London It could take a generation to solve London's violent crime problem, the city's mayor has warned. Two teenage boys and two men have been stabbed to death in the city in the last five days, including 15-year-old Jay Hughes. Mayor Sadiq Khan told theBBC's Today programmeto ""really make significant progress can take up to 10 years"". Home Office minister Victoria Atkins said combating violent crime ""isn't just about police numbers"". There have been 118 homicides in the capital this year, including 73 stabbings and 12 shootings, compared to 116  for the whole of last year. Jay Hughes, 15, was stabbed to death in a chicken shop on Thursday and Malcolm Mide-Madariola, 17, was killed outside a Tube station on Friday. Met Police commander Stuart Cundy said there were ""hundreds of additional duty officers on the streets"". This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? In September, a London Violence Reduction Unit was set up mirroring the approach taken in Glasgow, where violence is treated as a public health issue and ""a disease infecting communities"". According to City Hall figures police coverage in London is at its lowest rate in 20 years with 3.3 police officers for every thousand Londoners - the lowest rate since 1998 and 19% below 2010. Local leaders need to be more successful in lobbying the government for extra money for policing, Mr Khan said.

US sanctions on Iran come into force,"Protesters demonstrated outside the former US embassy in Tehran on Sunday The US unleashed its ""toughest ever"" sanctions against Iran on Monday, a move that has already sparked mass protests in the oil-rich nation. The Trump administration reinstated all sanctions removed under the 2015 nuclear deal, targeting both Iran and states that trade with it. They will hit oil exports, shipping and banks - all core parts of the economy. Thousands of Iranians chanting ""Death to America"" rallied on Sunday, rejecting calls for talks. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has vowed to sell oil and break the sanctions. The military was also quoted as saying it would hold air defence drills on Monday and Tuesday to prove the country's capabilities. What next for Iran? Can Iran survive sanctions? Iran nuclear deal: Key details The demonstrations took place on the 39th anniversary of the occupation of the US embassy in Tehran, which led to four decades of mutual hostility. Before travelling to a campaign rally for the US mid-term elections, President Donald Trump said Iran was already struggling under his administration's policies. He called the sanctions, ""very strong"", saying: ""We'll see what happens with Iran, but they're not doing very well, I can tell you."" Washington re-imposed the sanctions after Mr Trump in May pulled out of a 2015 accord aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions. Washington also says it wants to stop what it calls Tehran's ""malign"" activities including cyber attacks, ballistic missile tests, and support for violent extremist groups and militias in the Middle East. Donald Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal in May ""We are working diligently to make sure we support the Iranian people and that we direct our activity towards ensuring that the Islamic Republic of Iran's malign behaviour is changed,"" US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told Fox News on Sunday. ""That's the goal, that's the mission, and that's what we will achieve on behalf of the president."" The US has been gradually re-imposing sanctions, but analysts say this latest round is by far the most significant. More than 700 individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft are now on the sanctions list, including major banks, oil exporters and shipping companies. Mr Pompeo said more than 100 big international companies had withdrawn from Iran because of the looming sanctions. He also said Iranian oil exports had dropped by nearly one million barrels a day, choking the main source of funding for the country. In addition, the Brussels-based Swift network for making international payments is expected to cut off links with targeted Iranian institutions, isolating Iran from the international financial system. The UK, Germany and France - which are among the five countries still committed to the nuclear pact - have all objected to the sanctions. They have promised to support European firms that do ""legitimate business"" with Iran and have set up an alternative payment mechanism - or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - that will help companies trade without facing US penalties. The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts What nappies tell us about Iran's economic woes However, analysts doubt this will materially lessen the impact of sanctions on Iran. And in recent days US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US would ""aggressively"" target any firm or organisation ""evading our sanctions"". The Trump administration has granted exemptions to eight countries to continue importing Iranian oil, without naming them. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the US would not dominate Iran They are reported to include US allies Italy, India, Japan and South Korea, along with Turkey and China. Mr Pompeo said the countries had already made ""significant reductions in their crude oil exports"" but needed ""a little bit more time to get to zero"". He said two would eventually stop imports and the other six would greatly reduce them. The US sanctions are timed to coincide with the anniversary of the siege of the US embassy on 4 November 1979 , which took place soon after the fall of the US-backed shah. Some 52 Americans were held hostage in the embassy for 444 days. Iran and the US have been enemies ever since. Hardliners hold protests to commemorate the siege every year but on Sunday, protesters also vented their fury about the sanctions. Iranian state media said millions turned out in towns and cities, swearing allegiance to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, although the BBC was unable to independently verify this figure. It followed a fiery speech from Ayatollah Khamenei on Saturday, in which he warned the US would not ""re-establish the domination"" it had over Iran before 1979. However, some Iranians have taken to Twitter to vent their frustration with the regime, with the hashtag #Sorry_US_Embassy_Siege attracting more than 19,000 tweets. One user tweeted in English: ""Over the past 40 years, the Islamic regime of Iran tried to present the US and Israel as Iran's enemies. But Iranian people do not think like mullahs. We love all nations and all people of the world."" Another said: ""America is not our enemy, our enemies have taken us as hostages in our own home [country].""

"Health plan aims to boost life expectancyLook after yourself better, says the health secretary, as he launches a plan to help people live longer.Health","This video can not be played Matt Hancock outlines new plans for an emphasis on illness prevention People in England are being told to cut back on alcohol, sugar, salt and fat in a bid to boost the nation's healthy life expectancy by five years. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is setting out his long-term vision for the NHS on Monday - and the focus is on preventing illness. He says that 10 times more money is spent on treating disease than prevention - which ""doesn't stack up"". The plan also recommends that bosses should do more to keep staff healthy. Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there needed to be a shift in culture and in the way resources are balanced. ""For too long the NHS has seen itself as essentially the National Hospital Service, with primary care and GPs round the side,"" he said. ""I want to see it as the health service of the nation, helping people to stay healthier."" How long are you going to live? UK among worst for life expectancy Mr Hancock wants people to have five more years of healthy, independent life by 2035.UK life expectancyis currently 82.9 years for women, and 79.2 for men. To achieve this, he is encouraging people to take more responsibility for their own health. Mr Hancock says: ""It's about people choosing to look after themselves better, staying active and stopping smoking. ""Making better choices by limiting alcohol, sugar, salt and fat."" But he says the strategy is ""not about penalising people"". ""It's about helping them make better choices, giving them all the support we can, because we know taking the tough decisions is never easy,"" he will tell the annual meeting of the International Association of National Public Health Institutes. The plan also includes ambitions to: halve childhood obesity by 2030 reduce loneliness by making ""social prescribing"" - when doctors or nurses prescribe community activities - more widespread diagnosing 75% of cancers at stages one and two by 2028 use technologyto predict patients' illnesses and target advice at sections of the population Mr Hancock adds: ""In the UK, we are spending Â£97bn of public money on treating disease and only Â£8bn preventing it across the UK. ""You don't have to be an economist to see those numbers don't stack up."" The announcement, which is being dubbed the government's ""vision"", will be followed up by a Green Paper in 2019 - a first draft of the plans. It comes after last week's Budget, when Chancellor Philip Hammond promised an extra Â£20.5bn for the NHS over the next five years. Mr Hancock would not be drawn on how much of the Â£20bn investment for the NHS would be spent on preventative measures when asked by the Today programme. But said he wanted to see the ""proportion spent on primary care going up"". Mr Hancock would also not reveal whether the budget for Public Health England would be cut or added to next year, saying its funding for national health programmes would be settled in the spending review next spring. 'NHS faces cuts as well as gains' Families 'struggle to afford healthy food' Helen Donovan, from the Royal College of Nursing, welcomed the plans but said they needed to be backed up with serious investments. And Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said the plans followed ""years of cuts and failed privatisation"". ""Unless ministers reverse these cuts and start fully funding public health services, these announcements will be dismissed as a litany of hollow promises,"" he said.

"Real Living Wage rises to ÃÂ£9 an hourAt least 180,000 workers are set for a pay rise this week - if their employer is signed up to the real Living WageBusiness","This video can not be played People need to earn more to meet their basic needs, says Living Wage Foundation director Tess Lanning Those lucky enough to work for an employer who has voluntarily signed up to the ""real living wage"" are set for a 2.8% pay rise this week. For the first time they will receive Â£9 an hour. This is not to be confused with the compulsory National Living Wage, which is currently Â£7.83 an hour for anyone over the age of 25. Real living wage employers in London will pay an extra 3.4%, bringing the minimum hourly rate to Â£10.55. The rate is independently calculated, to reflect what people need to spend to feed, clothe and house themselves. National Living Wage 'fails to cover basic needs' Minimum wage: workers underpaid by Â£15m Some 4,700 employers across the UK are signed up to the agreement, including large companies including IKEA, Aviva, Nationwide Building Society and Google. They have to pay the real living wage not just to their staff, but to any sub-contractors as well. About 180,000 employees will qualify for the pay rise. The National Living Wage is the legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over. It was set at Â£7.83 an hour in April 2018 and is reviewed every year just like the National Minimum Wage (for under 25s). The real living wage was devised by charity the Living Wage Foundation. It argues the government's National Living Wage is not high enough to meet workers' needs and encourages employers to adopt to its more generous, independently calculated rate. ""Employers that pay the real living wage enable their workers to live a life of dignity, supporting them to pay off debts and meet the pressures of rising bills,"" said Living Wage Foundation director Tess Lanning. ""We want to see local councils, universities, football clubs, bus companies and the other major public and private sector employers in every city commit to become real living wage employers."" However research published over the weekend suggests the Living Wage Foundation is fighting a losing battle. The accountancy firm KPMG found that 22% of jobs now pay less than the real living wage - up from 21% in 2017. It said 5.75 million workers earned less than the real living wage, up from 4.87 million five years ago.

First caravan migrants reach Mexico CityHundreds of weary people from Central America aiming for the US receive temporary shelter in a stadium.Latin America & Caribbean,"The migrants arrived exhausted and immediately bedded down on the stands of the stadium in Mexico City The first members of a large group of migrants travelling through Mexico towards the United States have arrived in the capital, Mexico City. About 450 people, mostly men and boys, were given temporary shelter at a sports stadium. They are part of a now 5,000-strong group, known as the migrant caravan, which left Honduras on 12 October. US President Donald Trump says troops will be deployedto stop them crossing the US-Mexican border. Critics have accused Mr Trump of using people's fears of illegal immigration to fire up his supporters ahead of Tuesday's mid-term elections. It has taken this group of migrants more than three weeks to get from the crime-ridden Honduran city of San Pedro Sula to Mexico City. Children enjoyed the rest after weeks of walking They say they left Honduras for fear of violence and to escape poverty and unemployment. Migrant caravan: What is it and why does it matter? 'We left because we had to' Many said that reaching Mexico City felt like a major milestone after three weeks of crossing Guatemala and southern Mexico, mainly on foot. Mexico City, the first major metropolis the migrants have reached since leaving Honduras, is expected to be the place where the caravan may divide and some may decide to stay. Mexican officials said legal advisers would be on hand to talk those arriving through their options. Honduran migrant Jackson GarcÃ­a is one of those considering asking for asylum in Mexico. ""If I can find a job so as to support my family [I will stay in Mexico]. My family is very poor and I need to help them,"" he said. But many others, such as Carlos Flores, remain determined to continue to the US: ""The little that you get in US dollars goes a long way in Honduras. But what you earn here [in Mexico] not so much, you have to pay for food, room, things are expensive here."" Mauricio Mancilla, who has travelled from northern Honduras with his six-year-old son, says for him his destination has always been clear: ""Our heads are set at getting to the United States, to fulfil the American dream. We have faith in God that we will do this, whatever the circumstances."" President Trump has put pressure on the Mexican authorities to stop the migrant caravan, which he has called ""an invasion"". He has also said that he will use the military to completely close the US-Mexico border if necessary, to stop the migrants crossing into the US. In Puebla, the migrants took shelter in a church After briefly stopping them at Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, the Mexican authorities have not stood in the way of the migrants. In Pictures: Migrants face border tear gas Watch: Migrants illegally cross into Mexico,external The governor of Veracruz, Miguel Ãngel Yunes, on Friday offered to lay on free buses to take the migrants crossing his state to Mexico City, buthe later withdrew the offer. In the capital, city officials prepared food and shelter as well as medical services to those arriving at the JesÃºs MartÃ­nez ""Palillo"" stadium. ""There are pregnant women, many children, vulnerable people and we have to guarantee the space and the services they require,"" said city leader JosÃ© RamÃ³n Amieva GÃ¡lvez. Many of those arriving were so exhausted they only grabbed a blanket before falling asleep. ""From what I brought from Honduras I have nothing. Even yesterday I walked barefoot,"" Kenia Alvarado, 21, told El Universal newspaper. Residents of Mexico City have donated clothes and shoes for the travellers, local media reported. Apart from the approximately 5,000-strong group approaching Mexico City, there are two more groups of migrants heading north. One has only just crossed the Suchiate river, which marks the border between Mexico and Guatemala, and the other is moving north from Mexico's southern Chiapas state. It is expected all three groups will meet up in Mexico City and that those who remain determined to make it to the US will set off together. Watch: The migrant convoy travels north.

Ukraine activist dies after acid attackProminent anti-corruption campaigner Kateryna Handzyuk suffered severe burns in the July attack.Europe,"A prominent Ukrainian anti-corruption activist has died, three months after she was injured in an acid attack. Kateryna Handzyuk, 33, suffered burns over 40% of her body and severe eye damage as a result of the assault on 31 July in the southern city of Kherson. Ms Handzyuk, who was also a Kherson city council member, had undergone 11 operations in the capital Kiev. President Petro Poroshenko on Sunday called for the killers to be punished. Five suspects are already in custody. Can Ukraine stand its ground in 'war on corruption'? The exact cause of Ms Handzyuk's death was not immediately known, but reports in local media suggested it was a blood clot. In September, the activist - who also campaigned against Russian-backed separatism - posted a video in which she urged Ukrainians to fight rampant corruption. ""I know I look bad now. But at least I'm being treated,"" she said. ""And I definitely know that I look much better than justice in Ukraine. Because nobody is treating it.""

Lamplugh body search enters second week,"Suzy Lamplugh disappeared in 1986 and was declared dead, presumed murdered, in 1994 The fresh search for clues behind the murder of estate agent Suzy Lamplugh has entered a second week. Ms Lamplugh, from London, was 25 when she disappeared in 1986 and declared dead, presumed murdered, in 1994, although a body has never been found. Met Police confirmed it would on Monday resume its search in the back garden of the former home of the prime suspect's mother in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. Suspect John Cannan hopes it will ""end speculation about his involvement"". Cannan, who is serving a life sentence for murdering a different woman, was named as a suspect in Ms Lamplugh's murder in 2002. Latest news and updates from the Midlands Police have been searching the former home of John Cannan's mother since last Monday The Met, which is leading the investigation with support from the West Midlands force and a private forensics company, would not say how long the search would continue. Homeowner Phillip Carey said he has had no discussion with police about when the search would end and, when asked last week about how long the investigation would last, said: ""How long is a piece of string?"" What do we know about Suzy Lamplugh? New police search for Suzy Lamplugh body Officers, who began work at the home last Monday, have been on site throughout the weekend. A garage to the back of the semi-detached property in Shipton Road has been dismantled and paving has been removed. John Cannan and the ""Mr Kipper"" e-fit Cannan, 64, is serving a life sentence for the abduction and murder of Bristol newlywed Shirley Banks, for which he was jailed in 1989. A former Met detective who led a review of the case beginning in 2000 said Cannan bore a strong resemblance to an e-fit of a man to whom Ms Lamplugh was seen talking to on the day she went missing. By Peter Wilson, BBC News This case is 32 years old. Now CCTV cameras, automatic number plate recognition and mobile cell site analysis mean a suspects movements can be traced and overlaid with the victims. None of that existed in the 1980s. Cold case murder investigations are the hardest to crack. Witnesses are often dead or forgetful. When a body has not been found it's almost impossible to find unless the murderer is willing to help the police. In my experience such digging in a localised location like a back garden is often concluded in a matter of days. Forensic teams have ground penetrating radar to reveal depressions or cavities in the soil which may contain a body. But police also use forensic archaeologists to literally scrape away at potentially likely hotspots as the teams not only search for bones but also evidenceâ¦.and that takes time and patience. Suzy Lamplugh went missing in 1986 aged 25 According to reports Cannan was nicknamed Kipper during an earlier prison sentence. His solicitor, Matthew Claughton, said: ""Mr Cannan hopes that the search of his mother's former home will conclude swiftly so as to bring to an end speculation as to his involvement in this matter."" The forensic experts assisting police have previously worked on the search for Madeleine McCann. Lamplugh suspect wants end to speculation What do we know about Suzy Lamplugh?

First caravan migrants reach Mexico City,"The migrants arrived exhausted and immediately bedded down on the stands of the stadium in Mexico City The first members of a large group of migrants travelling through Mexico towards the United States have arrived in the capital, Mexico City. About 450 people, mostly men and boys, were given temporary shelter at a sports stadium. They are part of a now 5,000-strong group, known as the migrant caravan, which left Honduras on 12 October. US President Donald Trump says troops will be deployedto stop them crossing the US-Mexican border. Critics have accused Mr Trump of using people's fears of illegal immigration to fire up his supporters ahead of Tuesday's mid-term elections. It has taken this group of migrants more than three weeks to get from the crime-ridden Honduran city of San Pedro Sula to Mexico City. Children enjoyed the rest after weeks of walking They say they left Honduras for fear of violence and to escape poverty and unemployment. Migrant caravan: What is it and why does it matter? 'We left because we had to' Many said that reaching Mexico City felt like a major milestone after three weeks of crossing Guatemala and southern Mexico, mainly on foot. Mexico City, the first major metropolis the migrants have reached since leaving Honduras, is expected to be the place where the caravan may divide and some may decide to stay. Mexican officials said legal advisers would be on hand to talk those arriving through their options. Honduran migrant Jackson GarcÃ­a is one of those considering asking for asylum in Mexico. ""If I can find a job so as to support my family [I will stay in Mexico]. My family is very poor and I need to help them,"" he said. But many others, such as Carlos Flores, remain determined to continue to the US: ""The little that you get in US dollars goes a long way in Honduras. But what you earn here [in Mexico] not so much, you have to pay for food, room, things are expensive here."" Mauricio Mancilla, who has travelled from northern Honduras with his six-year-old son, says for him his destination has always been clear: ""Our heads are set at getting to the United States, to fulfil the American dream. We have faith in God that we will do this, whatever the circumstances."" President Trump has put pressure on the Mexican authorities to stop the migrant caravan, which he has called ""an invasion"". He has also said that he will use the military to completely close the US-Mexico border if necessary, to stop the migrants crossing into the US. In Puebla, the migrants took shelter in a church After briefly stopping them at Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, the Mexican authorities have not stood in the way of the migrants. In Pictures: Migrants face border tear gas Watch: Migrants illegally cross into Mexico,external The governor of Veracruz, Miguel Ãngel Yunes, on Friday offered to lay on free buses to take the migrants crossing his state to Mexico City, buthe later withdrew the offer. In the capital, city officials prepared food and shelter as well as medical services to those arriving at the JesÃºs MartÃ­nez ""Palillo"" stadium. ""There are pregnant women, many children, vulnerable people and we have to guarantee the space and the services they require,"" said city leader JosÃ© RamÃ³n Amieva GÃ¡lvez. Many of those arriving were so exhausted they only grabbed a blanket before falling asleep. ""From what I brought from Honduras I have nothing. Even yesterday I walked barefoot,"" Kenia Alvarado, 21, told El Universal newspaper. Residents of Mexico City have donated clothes and shoes for the travellers, local media reported. Apart from the approximately 5,000-strong group approaching Mexico City, there are two more groups of migrants heading north. One has only just crossed the Suchiate river, which marks the border between Mexico and Guatemala, and the other is moving north from Mexico's southern Chiapas state. It is expected all three groups will meet up in Mexico City and that those who remain determined to make it to the US will set off together. Watch: The migrant convoy travels north.

Xi pledges to cut Chinese import tariffs,"China has promised to further cut import tariffs and open its economy as it tries to address criticisms that its trade practices are ""unfair"". In a speech at a Shanghai trade expo, President Xi Jinping also made a robust defence of the global free trade system which he said was ""under attack"". The comments are being seen as a reference to the US, with which China is fighting a bitter trade war. The US and China have hit each other with huge import tariffs this year. Neither are showing any sign of backing down, and the US has threatened to escalate it further still. What has happened so far in the trade war? US-China trade war in 300 words Grappling with China's growing power Speaking at the opening of the expo, Mr Xi said that ""in a world of deepening economic globalisation, practices of the law of the jungle and winner takes all only represent a dead end"". ""An inclusive growth for all is surely the right way forward."" Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai The Shanghai International Import Expo is China's big attempt to show the world - and especially the US - that its economy is opening up more. The week-long event aims to give a multi-billion dollar boost to imports. Thousands of foreign firms are here. In his opening speech, Mr Xi pledged lower import tariffs and moves to make it easier for foreign firms to access the economy. But as is often the case it lacked specific timings. He also didn't address the core US complaints about Chinese trade, including the alleged theft of intellectual property from US firms and the special terms China gives to its state run companies. There was definitely no sign that China is about to cave in the escalating trade war. Mr Xi said the Chinese economy was ""a sea"". Storms can overturn a pond, he said, but never a sea. China's reform promises underwhelm The US has imposed taxes on about half of Chinese imports into the US so far this year - making it more expensive for American consumers to buy them - and hasthreatened to target all imports. The White House says the tariffs are a response to China's ""unfair"" trade policies, which Mr Trump blames for helping to create a huge trade deficit, and its alleged intellectual property theft. It also wants China to give American companies better access to its markets. Mr Xi promised to take steps to boost imports, by cutting tariffs, facilitating customs clearance and reducing ""institutional costs"". He did not make clear which countries' imports would benefit from the lower tariffs, and whether the US was on this list. China would also ""continue to broaden market access"", Mr Xi said, adding that openness had become a ""trademark of China"". ""China's door will never be closed, it will only open still wider."" Mr Xi also said China would speed up negotiations on both a China-EU investment agreement and a regional China-Japan-South Korea free trade deal. Among the high-level delegates at the expo is UK Trade Secretary Liam Fox. The UK is courting various Asian countries for trade deals as it prepares to leave the EU next year.

Real Living Wage rises to ÃÂ£9 an hour,"This video can not be played People need to earn more to meet their basic needs, says Living Wage Foundation director Tess Lanning Those lucky enough to work for an employer who has voluntarily signed up to the ""real living wage"" are set for a 2.8% pay rise this week. For the first time they will receive Â£9 an hour. This is not to be confused with the compulsory National Living Wage, which is currently Â£7.83 an hour for anyone over the age of 25. Real living wage employers in London will pay an extra 3.4%, bringing the minimum hourly rate to Â£10.55. The rate is independently calculated, to reflect what people need to spend to feed, clothe and house themselves. National Living Wage 'fails to cover basic needs' Minimum wage: workers underpaid by Â£15m Some 4,700 employers across the UK are signed up to the agreement, including large companies including IKEA, Aviva, Nationwide Building Society and Google. They have to pay the real living wage not just to their staff, but to any sub-contractors as well. About 180,000 employees will qualify for the pay rise. The National Living Wage is the legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over. It was set at Â£7.83 an hour in April 2018 and is reviewed every year just like the National Minimum Wage (for under 25s). The real living wage was devised by charity the Living Wage Foundation. It argues the government's National Living Wage is not high enough to meet workers' needs and encourages employers to adopt to its more generous, independently calculated rate. ""Employers that pay the real living wage enable their workers to live a life of dignity, supporting them to pay off debts and meet the pressures of rising bills,"" said Living Wage Foundation director Tess Lanning. ""We want to see local councils, universities, football clubs, bus companies and the other major public and private sector employers in every city commit to become real living wage employers."" However research published over the weekend suggests the Living Wage Foundation is fighting a losing battle. The accountancy firm KPMG found that 22% of jobs now pay less than the real living wage - up from 21% in 2017. It said 5.75 million workers earned less than the real living wage, up from 4.87 million five years ago.

Graphic warnings urged for fireworks,"Plastic surgeons want graphic images like this one of an injured hand on fireworks packets Senior doctors are calling for graphic images of injuries to be displayed on firework packaging. Plastic surgeons say the number of life-changing injuries is rising every year despite numerous safety campaigns. They believe shocking images, like the one they have mocked up using a man's severely damaged hand, might deter buyers. Half of those seen in hospital last year were aged 18 or under, and 80% were male. The campaign is being led by the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (Bapras). Bapras president David Ward said: ""We are extremely concerned about the continued misuse of fireworks, particularly by those under the age of 18 away from organised events. ""Although [fireworks are] packaged in a jovial, toy-like fashion, people forget that when using fireworks, they are handling explosives which can cause extremely serious injuries that may require extensive reconstructive surgery. ""Bapras is calling on the government to make a common-sense change by legislating to ensure all firework packaging in the UK includes mandatory graphic warning notices, similar to those found on cigarette packaging."" Almost 4,500 people in England attended A&E with injuries from fireworks last year, double the number in 2009-10, according to figures from NHS Digital. 'I lost my eye after firework exploded' Hotel 'saddened' by fireworks injuries Stray fireworks injure 14 at display The Bapras campaign: people need to remember that fireworks are explosives Surgeons say injuries are typically caused by people throwing rockets which either explode early, or hit someone close by. Surgeons have had to reconstruct this man's fingers The hand used in the campaign belongs to a 25-year-old-man from Wales, who did not wish to be identified. ""My friend threw a firework which landed by my feet. When I picked it up to move it out of the way, it exploded in my hand. I've had five operations, with plastic surgeons reconstructing parts of my fingers, and months later I still have three operations to go. ""The incident has had a huge impact on my life. I can't feed myself or play with my new-born kid. ""A clearer warning label might have made me and my friend think twice about the potential danger,"" he said. Many fireworks are currently packaged in the bold colours of children's toys, and the warnings are often found in small boxes on the back of the packaging. Fireworks are usually packaged in bright toy-like colours Legally you have to be 18 or over to buy fireworks, yet the hospital statistics show that many injuries requiring surgery are in males under the age of 18. Jim Fitzpatrick, MP for Poplar and Limehouse, is also supporting the campaign. ""There is an urgent need for government to introduce graphic warnings on firework packaging. The hope is that a graphic image of the potential dangers of misuse may stop someone in their tracks, preventing a possible life-changing injury."" A YouGov poll of 2,020 adults conducted in October found that 62% supported introducing graphic warnings on fireworks packaging. The campaign is also being supported by the Royal College of Surgeons and the British Society for Surgery of the Hand.

Teen called 'lesbian' for playing football,"This video can not be played Darcie: Bullies ""won't stop me playing football"" A 13-year-old girl who dreams of playing football professionally says she has been criticised and called a lesbian for playing a ""boy's sport"". Darcie, 13, from Cwmbran in Torfaen has played football since she was eight. But she has been told by PE teachers that she cannot play it as a recommended sport at school - instead hockey and netball are for girls. The Children's Commissioner for Wales said gender stereotyping was ""depressing"". Darcie said she has been criticised because of her gender and playing football Darcie said she was determined to challenge the negative attitude. ""I want to play football, and I don't want someone to criticise me,"" she said. Women's football 'needs more support' in Wales 'Telling boys they throw like a girl puts girls off sport' ""They have criticised me a lot by saying I'm a man or a lesbian.

""Girls' sport is hockey, netball, dance and all that and the boys' is basketball, rugby or football. ""I ask my PE teachers if I can play football, can I do that as a recommended sport and they say no because it is a boy's sport. ""I think it is wrong that people criticise girls for playing football because it is something they want to do and they love."" Sally Holland said sex-segregation in lessons was surprising Sally Holland, the Children's Commissioner for Wales,  said it was ""depressing"" to hear girls and boys complaining about gender stereotyping in this day and age. ""Girls say that there's often very little opportunity to take part in football and rugby,"" she said. ""Sometimes they have clubs where they can take part but it is not part of their core PE lessons. ""It makes girls and boys think their life has got to be constrained perhaps into one pathway or another and it is just a real harm that they can be turned off sport and exercise."" She described the sex-segregation in lessons as ""surprising"" in 2018 but reflective of wider attitudes in society. Welsh girls' rugby participation 'up by thousands' Swapping the Welsh Valleys for Canadian ice hockey Meet the woman coaching a Welsh men's team Dr Nalda Wainwright, director of the Welsh Institute of Physical Literacy, said the reliance on ""traditional sports"" in school is a hangover from the post-war period with the introduction of the 1944 Education Act. ""It is really down, I suppose, to the training of teachers. We know we have a real lack of expertise, particularly in primary schools,"" she said. ""It is not really a specialist subject and teachers will tend to replicate the experience they had."" The National Education Union said it was ""unacceptable"" that the girl from Torfaen has been treated in this way and it hoped that common sense would prevail and that the decision is reversed. ""We would not expect any pupil to be subject to gender stereotyping in this way and that would be and has been our advice to members,"" said David Evans, Wales secretary of the union. The Welsh Government said it wanted young people taking part in sport to have equality of opportunity so they could enjoy participating in the sport of their choice and lead a healthier and more active lifestyle. ""There is nothing that directs schools to follow particular sports for girls and boys and many are already looking at ways in which they can tackle gender stereotyping,"" said a spokesman. ""We would encourage schools to share this good practice and continue to address gender equity and equality through a whole school approach.""

Baudelaire suicide letter sold at auction,"The letter was written when the budding poet had money problems A letter by the French 19th-Century poet Charles Baudelaire announcing he would kill himself has sold at auction for â¬234,000 (Â£204,000; $267,000). The note, dated 30 June 1845, was addressed to Baudelaire's lover Jeanne Duval. The poet, who was 24 years old at the time, attempted to commit suicide on the same day - but survived. The French auction website Osenat said the letter sold to a private buyer for three times the estimated price. In the letter, Baudelaire informed his mistress of his intention to take his own life. ""By the time you receive this letter, I will be dead,"" it said. ""I am killing myself because I can no longer live, or bear the burden of falling asleep and waking up again."" Baudelaire is regarded as one of the greatest French poets of all time Baudelaire, who had money problems after squandering his inheritance, stabbed himself in the chest but suffered no serious injuries. He lived for another 22 years, writing in that time the volume that established his reputation, Les Fleurs du Mal (The Flowers of Evil). His works influenced generations of French poets. He died racked by syphilis in 1867.

Children with learning disabilities 'let down',"Children with learning disabilities are being let down by society, according to a report by a leading health inequality expert. Prof Sir Michael Marmot said they die 15-20 years earlier than other people due to poor housing, low incomes, social isolation and bullying. He said 40% of people with learning difficulties were not diagnosed in childhood - and this had to change. Learning disabilities affect 2.9% of the population. But a quarter of young people in custody have learning disabilities, the report said. Prof Marmot, from the Institute of Health Equity at University College London, estimates that shorter life expectancy affects 1,200 children and adults in this vulnerable group, who are also at higher risk of mental illness. He said more should be done to improve the lives of all children with learning disabilities. ""We can make sure the voyage through education is as good as it can be, we can make sure people are not falling below the poverty line and we can educate the general population so that there is less discrimination against people with learning disabilities,"" he said. And he said it was everyone's responsibility in society to take action. ""I want the society of which I am a part to do the right thing for the most vulnerable members."" Prof Marmot published a review of health inequalities in 2010, which recommended policies to allow a child to maximise his or her opportunity to lead as long and healthy a life as possible. But he said 18-year-olds with learning disabilities today may not living long enough to draw their pension. He said action should focus on: improving support to parents reducing poverty and improving living environments increasing work programmes for people with learning disabilities improving social integration and reducing bullying Concerns over learning disability deaths 'Oliver's legacy' autism petition debated Theatre calls for learning disability Oscar UCL Institute of Health Equity - UCL Public Policy - UCL - London's Global University Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Foreigners living abroad invited to join Army,"Soldiers of the Coldstream Guards carry flags of the 53 Commonwealth countries More foreign nationals living abroad will be able to join the armed forces, the government is to announce. Currently, only 200 Commonwealth citizens per year can apply without having lived in the UK for five years. But in a bid to recruit more servicemen and women to the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, the Ministry of Defence is lifting this cap. The armed forces are short of 8,200 soldiers, sailors and air personnel,a report found,externalearlier this year. It is the worst shortage since 2010, said the independent government watchdog, the National Audit Office. Man-eating tigress killed after huge hunt The Indian princess who became a South Korean queen Review: Stormzy's new book Ministers are expected to announce the change to recruitment rules on Monday. It means people from Commonwealth countries - including India, Australia, Kenya, Fiji and Sri Lanka - will be considered for roles, even if they have never lived in Britain. Arule introduced in 2016,externalalready allows 200 Commonwealth citizens who have not met the requirement of living in the UK for five years to apply for a limited number of jobs every year. It is hoped the changes will lead to an extra 1,350 people being recruited every year. The five-year UK residency requirement for Commonwealth recruits was first waived in 1998, before being reintroduced in 2013. Miandad Matthew, who grew up in Saint Lucia, served from 1999-2008 in the Royal Dragoon Guards. He signed up to the British army after going on holiday to London to visit family. ""Ever since I was little boy I wanted to be a solider,"" the 40-year-old, who now lives in Grays, Essex. ""I enjoyed my time in the Army. I travelled to a lot of different countries and saw other cultures. ""Before I joined up I was quite a shy person and the Army changed me completely."" Miandad Matthew grew up in St Lucia and served in the British army for nearly 10 years He joined when there was no requirement to have lived in the UK for five years and he said it was good the rules were being relaxed again. ""It will give quite a few young guys in the Caribbean more career opportunities,"" he said. According tothe Daily Telegraph,,externalwhich first published details of the plan in Monday's paper, the air force and navy will begin recruiting immediately and the Army will open applications early next year. Applications from citizens of countries outside the Commonwealth will not be accepted, the paper adds. Citizens of Ireland and also Gurkhas from Nepal can already join because of special rules. Army ads 'won't appeal to new soldiers' Why the Army needs more women soldiers The 'changing face' of the British army April's National Audit Office report also said there were ""much larger shortfalls"" in the number of military engineers, pilots and intelligence analysts. It said the armed forces were involved in 25 operations worldwide in 2016-17 - and the air force is undertaking more missions than it has for a quarter of a century. Anda Conservative MP's report,externalin July 2017 on the state of Army recruitment warned that the armed forces were ""hollowing out"" due to recruitment issues. Mark Francois, who spent a year meeting with MoD officials as well as military personnel, said there was a ""perfect storm"" of high employment rates and an ageing population with fewer people of military age. An increase in obesity and also a rising proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic people - who he said have until now been less likely to apply for military service - are also factors, he added. He made many recommendations - including attracting more black, Asian and minority ethnic recruits and women. Last month,it was announcedthat women were now allowed to apply for all roles in the British military for the first time in history.

US sanctions on Iran to come into force,"Protesters demonstrated outside the former US embassy in Tehran on Sunday The US unleashed its ""toughest ever"" sanctions against Iran on Monday, a move that has already sparked mass protests in the oil-rich nation. The Trump administration reinstated all sanctions removed under the 2015 nuclear deal, targeting both Iran and states that trade with it. They will hit oil exports, shipping and banks - all core parts of the economy. Thousands of Iranians chanting ""Death to America"" rallied on Sunday, rejecting calls for talks. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has vowed to sell oil and break the sanctions. The military was also quoted as saying it would hold air defence drills on Monday and Tuesday to prove the country's capabilities. What next for Iran? Can Iran survive sanctions? Iran nuclear deal: Key details The demonstrations took place on the 39th anniversary of the occupation of the US embassy in Tehran, which led to four decades of mutual hostility. Before travelling to a campaign rally for the US mid-term elections, President Donald Trump said Iran was already struggling under his administration's policies. He called the sanctions, ""very strong"", saying: ""We'll see what happens with Iran, but they're not doing very well, I can tell you."" Washington re-imposed the sanctions after Mr Trump in May pulled out of a 2015 accord aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions. Washington also says it wants to stop what it calls Tehran's ""malign"" activities including cyber attacks, ballistic missile tests, and support for violent extremist groups and militias in the Middle East. Donald Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal in May ""We are working diligently to make sure we support the Iranian people and that we direct our activity towards ensuring that the Islamic Republic of Iran's malign behaviour is changed,"" US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told Fox News on Sunday. ""That's the goal, that's the mission, and that's what we will achieve on behalf of the president."" The US has been gradually re-imposing sanctions, but analysts say this latest round is by far the most significant. More than 700 individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft are now on the sanctions list, including major banks, oil exporters and shipping companies. Mr Pompeo said more than 100 big international companies had withdrawn from Iran because of the looming sanctions. He also said Iranian oil exports had dropped by nearly one million barrels a day, choking the main source of funding for the country. In addition, the Brussels-based Swift network for making international payments is expected to cut off links with targeted Iranian institutions, isolating Iran from the international financial system. The UK, Germany and France - which are among the five countries still committed to the nuclear pact - have all objected to the sanctions. They have promised to support European firms that do ""legitimate business"" with Iran and have set up an alternative payment mechanism - or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - that will help companies trade without facing US penalties. The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts What nappies tell us about Iran's economic woes However, analysts doubt this will materially lessen the impact of sanctions on Iran. And in recent days US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US would ""aggressively"" target any firm or organisation ""evading our sanctions"". The Trump administration has granted exemptions to eight countries to continue importing Iranian oil, without naming them. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the US would not dominate Iran They are reported to include US allies Italy, India, Japan and South Korea, along with Turkey and China. Mr Pompeo said the countries had already made ""significant reductions in their crude oil exports"" but needed ""a little bit more time to get to zero"". He said two would eventually stop imports and the other six would greatly reduce them. The US sanctions are timed to coincide with the anniversary of the siege of the US embassy on 4 November 1979 , which took place soon after the fall of the US-backed shah. Some 52 Americans were held hostage in the embassy for 444 days. Iran and the US have been enemies ever since. Hardliners hold protests to commemorate the siege every year but on Sunday, protesters also vented their fury about the sanctions. Iranian state media said millions turned out in towns and cities, swearing allegiance to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, although the BBC was unable to independently verify this figure. It followed a fiery speech from Ayatollah Khamenei on Saturday, in which he warned the US would not ""re-establish the domination"" it had over Iran before 1979. However, some Iranians have taken to Twitter to vent their frustration with the regime, with the hashtag #Sorry_US_Embassy_Siege attracting more than 19,000 tweets. One user tweeted in English: ""Over the past 40 years, the Islamic regime of Iran tried to present the US and Israel as Iran's enemies. But Iranian people do not think like mullahs. We love all nations and all people of the world."" Another said: ""America is not our enemy, our enemies have taken us as hostages in our own home [country].""

Police investigate Banks' spending,"The National Crime Agency is investigating Arron Banks and his Leave.EU campaign for alleged offences committed at the 2016 EU referendum. Mr Banks and another senior campaign figure, Liz Bilney, were referred to the agency by the Electoral Commission. The watchdog said it suspected Mr Banks was not the ""true source"" of loans to the campaign and the money had come ""from impermissible sources"". Mr Banks denied any wrongdoing and said he welcomed the police investigation. He said he was ""confident that a full and frank investigation will finally put an end to the ludicrous allegations levelled against me and my colleagues"". ""There is no evidence of any wrongdoing from the companies I own. I am a UK taxpayer and I have never received any foreign donations. The Electoral Commission has produced no evidence to the contrary,"" he added in a statement.

Some Remain supporters have suggested Brexit should be put on hold pending the outcome of the inquiry. SNP MP Kirsty Blackman told the BBC's Politics Live programme: ""If people are found to be breaking electoral law, then I think there is an issue that you look at the possible validity of the results."" But Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said public trust in the source of political donations was ""bigger than Brexit"". ""I don't think there is a natural connection to this and calling for a re-run of the referendum. I would rather we focus our resources on holding Mr Banks to account,"" he told BBC News. Under UK law, loans and donations to registered campaigners can only come from permissible sources, which essentially excludes overseas or foreign funding. The law was introduced by the Labour government in 2000 after a series of scandals involving overseas donors accused of trying to influence British laws and elections. Leave.EU's chief executive Liz Bilney said all of the money had come from Mr Banks and he was the ""ultimate beneficial owner"" of the companies that had loaned it. As a UK domiciled taxpayer Mr Banks was ""completely permissible to donate money to campaigns as he sees fit"", she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme. She denied claims the money had come from Russian sources, saying: ""I run the group of companies where the money was from and we don't have any transactions that are from Russia."" And she said the Electoral Commission had ""failed to understand the nature of the loan agreements"" and were seeing them through ""their own biased lens"". ""I am confident that all the matters will be completely resolved and I will be exonerated and so will Arron and everybody else involved,"" she added. This video can not be played Liz Bilney: ""I'm confident I will be exonerated and so will Arron"" The Electoral Commission investigation focused on Â£2m reported to have been loaned to Better for the Country, which ran Leave.EU, by Mr Banks and his group of insurance companies. It also examined a further Â£6m reported to have been given to the organisation, on behalf of Leave.EU, by Mr Banks alone. The commission's legal chief, Bob Posner, said: ""We have reasonable grounds to suspect money given to Better for the Country came from impermissible sources and that Mr Banks and Ms Bilney, the responsible person for Leave.EU, knowingly concealed the true circumstances under which this money was provided. ""This is significant because at least Â£2.9m of this money was used to fund referendum spending and donations during the regulated period of the EU referendum. ""Our investigation has unveiled evidence that suggests criminal offences have been committed which fall beyond the remit of the commission. ""This is why we have handed our evidence to the NCA to allow them to investigate and take any appropriate law enforcement action. This is now a criminal investigation."" He said the financial transactions investigated by the commission included companies incorporated in Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, which were ""beyond the reach"" of the watchdog. The Bristol-based insurance tycoon, who was born in Cheshire, was a Lloyd's underwriter before starting his own firms The twice married father-of-five has been a close friend and supporter of Nigel Farage Mr Banks was a Conservative supporter until 2014 when he defected to UKIP, giving them Â£1m He is said to be one of the biggest political donors in UK history, thought to have given up to Â£9.6m to Leave.EU - which he co-founded - and UKIP Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Mr Farage, lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum His Leave.EU campaign targeted its message at voters angry about EU immigration The National Crime Agency, which is able to investigate across international borders, said electoral law offences would ""not routinely fall"" within its remit. But it added: ""The nature of the necessary inquiries and the potential for offences to have been committed other than under electoral law lead us to consider an NCA investigation appropriate in this instance. ""This is now a live investigation, and we are unable to discuss any operational detail."" Leave.EU was a separate campaign to the official Vote Leave organisation. The UK's referendum in June 2016 was about whether the UK should Remain or Leave the European Union. The result was that the UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU.

Met police probe Leave campaigns,"Vote Leave is one of the groups fined by the Electoral Commission Police are ""carefully"" assessing more than 900 documents to determine whether or not crimes were committed by Leave campaigns during the EU referendum. Met Police chief Cressida Dick said they had received a ""huge amount of material"", which was being considered. It would be wrong to comment on whether a police inquiry would be launched at this early ""scoping"" stage, she said. The Electoral Commission has referred both Vote Leave and Leave.EU to police over potential electoral law breaches. Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage, lost out to Vote Leave, which included Michael Gove and Boris Johnson among supporters, in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum. Both groups have denied wrongdoing and accused the commission of a politically-motivated attack. On Thursday, the National Crime Agencyconfirmed it was investigating Leave.EU and its co-founder Arron Banksand chief executive Liz Bilney over separate allegations that it had breached electoral law by accepting loans from ""impermissible sources"". Mr Banks said he welcomed the investigation and was confident it would ""put an end to the ludicrous allegations"". In May, the Commission fined Leave.EU Â£70,000, saying it had exceeded its spending limit by at least 10% by failing to include at least Â£77,380 in its spending return. It referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police. Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 for breaking electoral law Vote Leave broke electoral law, says watchdog The BBC's EU referendum special report Brexit: All you need to know In July, the elections watchdog fined Vote Leave Â£61,000 and referred the campaign to the Met, saying it had exceeded its Â£7m spending limit by funnelling Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. The Met hasdenied reported claims,externalthat ""political sensitivities"" had delayed the Met's probe. The force says it was not until 7 September that it received ""over 900 documents"" relating to both referrals from the Electoral Commission. On Friday, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have been passed by the Electoral Commission, on two separate occasions, a huge amount of material."" Arron Banks says allegations against his campaign are politically-motivated ""They pass us material when they think it may be a matter for the police, there may have been some crime committed and we are assessing that material and we are doing that carefully. ""It's just at a scoping stage so it would be wrong for me to say, before we know what we have got properly in the material and what it amounts to, whether there is any criminal investigation there or not. At the moment we are just assessing that and we will do that properly."" Vote Leave said the Electoral Commission's report was ""wholly inaccurate"" and politically motivated, accusing it of basing its conclusions on ""unfounded claims and conspiracy theories"". Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks has described the Commission's findings as a ""politically motivated attack"" and said he would challenge them in court. Some Remain supporters have suggested Brexit should be put on hold pending the outcome of the National Crime Agency inquiry.

Nearly all the streets in Charleston are quiet on this weekday afternoon, despite it being the state capital. The road to the clinic is lined with old gas stations and older houses in varying states of disrepair. In a nondescript brick building, 61-year-old Chevone Daly sits on an exam table in a white-walled room. She first came here in 2010, after an emergency appendectomy became infected. Without her own doctor to see, she was told: Go to the emergency room or go to the free clinic. Ms Daly tells me ""nobody"" she knows can afford healthcare anymore. Most patients at this clinic are like Ms Daly - America's working poor, who find themselves with nowhere to go and no money to spend when they fall ill. At West Virginia Health Right, providers and patients echo the same admonition - the system is broken. And changes introduced by President Barack Obama that were meant to serve as a safety net have left many still slipping through the cracks. As patients enter the clinic, a glass window plastered with flyers - reminders about wellness classes and prescriptions - greets them. And in the centre, a note reads: No matter what happens with the Affordable Care Act, we will remain open for business. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, was a Democratic answer to America's ever-increasing healthcare spending - still the highest in the world. Using state-run marketplaces, President Barack Obama's signature policy expanded insurance coverage to those unable to access programmes for the poor (Medicaid) and elderly (Medicare). Its most popular provision by far is the rule that insurers cannot deny coverage over pre-existing conditions like cancer, diabetes and pregnancy. Its least popular consequence has been steadily rising insurance costs. Thelatest ACA government report says,external2019 premiums are stabilising, more insurers are participating and average premiums have decreased by 1.5% for the first time since 2014. But, premiums for the second-lowest cost plan still increased 37% between 2017 and 2018. The Trump administration has taken credit for the drop, but some experts say it was due to higher insurance company profits from increasing premiums this year, and that Republican efforts to destabilise the ACA have ultimately made it costlier. Currently, 11.8m Americans have insurance through the ACA, but around 15.5% are still uninsured - up 2.8% from 2016. According to a new Pew Research Center study,external, more than half of Republicans and three-quarters of Democrats say the affordability of healthcare is a ""very big"" problem. Along with mobile dental and medical units, WVHR sees over 26,000 patients a year Founded in 1982, West Virginia Health Right (WVHR) is the state's largest free clinic, offering no-cost, holistic healthcare for the under-insured and uninsured. With a budget of around $3m (Â£2.2m) from grants and donations, the clinic provides over $15m of care annually. As one of the unhealthiest states in the nation, with the highest rate of drug overdoses, obesity and smoking, West Virginia has acutely felt the impacts of national healthcare policies. WVHR saw 21,000 patients before the ACA. After the law, that number dipped to 15,500, suggesting that fewer patients were in dire need - but that welcome news only lasted so long. ""Now we have 26,211 patients,"" says Mrs Angie Settle, 47, nurse practitioner and CEO of WVHR.  ""We've far exceeded where we were."" And they expect to keep growing as ACA costs rise. Mrs Settle says the ACA has been ""a horrible failure"". Angie Settle has worked at WVHR since 1997 - she became CEO four years ago, eager to continue the clinic's mission of accessible care At WVHR, 83% of patients have a job. Many purchased insurance through the marketplace at first, but were forced to drop it. The nurse practitioner says many of the insurance plans required patients to cover the first $5,000 to $10,000 of their costs. ""It might as well have been $5 million because these people are living paycheck to paycheck. It was totally beyond their reach,"" Mrs Settle says. ""You have people making $1500 a month, with rent, childcare and whatever else they have to do. And it's nothing to have one patient on six to eight medications."" Mrs Settle also notes that co-pays - the fixed amount insured patients pay - in these plans could be around $50 per service or medication. She shakes her head. ""When you multiply that, it's ridiculous."" At WVHR, no patient is expected to pay anything for their treatment or medications The ACA's high cost has been at the heart of the Republican attack on Democrats for years. Repealing the act was a cornerstone of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. With a Republican-controlled Washington, the last two years have seen a slow but steady dismantling of the ACA: the individual mandate was repealed, enrolment periods shortened, ad budgets slashed, reimbursement payments ended. The ACA has been hobbling along, but with high premium, prescription and deductible costs, fixing it is a key midterm issue. But the difference now is that Democrats are embracing it as their number one issue. According to a recent report by the Wesleyan Media Project,external, 50% of all Democratic ads in federal-level campaigns tackled healthcare - a stark contrast to Republicans' 21%. Last week, President Trump published an opinion piece warning voters that government-run healthcare would bring the country""dangerously closer to socialism"", and in June, his administration backed a lawsuit against the pre-existing conditions clause. But many Republicans up for re-election have scrubbed harsher critiques of the ACA from their campaign pages. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a congresswoman of Washington state, swapped her nearly 300-word statement on repealing the ""radical health care bill"" for two paragraphs on local policies. Rhonda Francis manages the 400 physician volunteers at the free clinic as well as all pharmacy orders Rhonda Francis, 49, WVHR's clinical and pharmacy coordinator, joined 19 years ago when she says turning patients away at retail pharmacies when they couldn't afford their co-pays took its toll. She described how some newly-insured clinic patients ended up self-regulating medications like insulin to avoid out-of-pocket payments - and ended up in the ER as a result. ""If the patient is going to go without and can't afford it, what's the point? They're just going to jack up hospital costs. Somebody's going to have to pay for it, eventually."" ""Healthcare should be universal across the line,"" she adds. ""How are you to know who's going to be able to pay what?"" In West Virginia, a precarious job climate has seen some residents making six-figures one day and being unemployed and uninsured the next. ""We have patients who've worked all their life and they're really sad when they come in here,"" Ms Francis says. ""They're like, 'I would never have thought I'd be in this situation.'"" The twists and turns of the US healthcare battle Bullets and bills: the cost of getting shot in America Toothless and uninsured in Virginia Prescription and out-of-pocket payment costs have made ACA insurance unaffordable for many As tensions rise, health policy analyst Paul Keckley believes America is near a tipping point. ""Going into 2020, presidential candidates will have to address specifically their plans to transform the system,"" he says. ""It'll basically boil down to one of two theories - healthcare is a fundamental right, or, healthcare is a marketplace."" Mr Keckley, who served as a mitigator between industry and lawmakers at the White House during the early stages of the ACA, adds that without a fix, the country will ""absolutely"" see debilitating cost increases for patients. Capping spending, like European systems do, will be key, he says. So will linking social services and healthcare - most comparable nations spend far more on preventive and primary services than the US. ""We call a lot of those 'welfare programmes', so they have a stigma, and yet we're finding out if people live in areas of food insecurity or have unclean air and water or high crime rates, guess what? Their care is going to be more costly and they're not going to be as healthy."" But fleshed out solutions from politicians are still few and far-between. When I ask WVHR patient Ms Daly what could fix healthcare for people like her, she looks down and quietly offers: ""Maybe more like what Canada's is?"" Progressive Democrats have been pushing a system like Canada's and Britain's- so-calledMedicare for All, as proposed by former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Funded by higher-taxes, the universal plan would expand America's pension programme to everyone, taking the burden of paying premiums, co-pays and deductibles out of the equation. It would cause US spending on healthcare to increase by more than $3tn according to one analysis - but if nothing changes with the present system, the US could spend over $5tn by 2026. Ricci Shannon, a cocktail server at the local casino, says she is uninsured, like many West Virginians her age A March Kaiser Health poll,externalfound 59% of Americans do favour a Medicare for All plan, including about a third of Republicans polled. One in 10 voters said a candidate's views on a national health plan will be the most important factor they consider. But keeping protections for those with pre-existing conditions could become the most important issue for any candidate. Last month,Kaiser polls,externalshowed 75% of the public were in favour of the policy. In West Virginia, Democrat Joe Manchin, up for re-election next month, has emphasised this in his campaign against Republican challenger Patrick Morrisey. His state will certainly feel the loss of the pre-existing conditions clause if Republicans end it. Indeed, there is a sense of ""panic"" among patients and staff at the clinic about losing that provision from the ACA. Many told me about the staggering rates of obesity, diabetes, substance abuse and mental health issues in West Virginia. As she sits in a dentist's chair on the second-floor of the clinic, 21-year-old Ricci Shannon, says West Virginians rarely think about their own health in terms of risk. ""It's such a financial issue for people and they live not-healthy lifestyles,"" she says. ""No one my age even thinks about it."" Margaret Grassie now works as a driver, taking patients to medical appointments ""I'm a person who fell through the cracks,"" says Margaret Grassie, 57, by way of introduction. ""And this clinic saved my life."" ""I woke up and my prescriptions were $1200 a month,"" she says. ""With the medications I take and the pre-existing conditions I have, there was no way. I couldn't afford it."" Despite working full-time, Ms Grassie could only afford catastrophic coverage from the ACA marketplace. That meant her policy applied just in drastic cases - ""I literally had to get hit by a bus,"" she explains. ""Donald Trump doesn't give a crap about me. Hillary Clinton didn't give a crap about me,"" Ms Grassie adds. ""We get written off."" She tells me West Virginians are scared of healthcare. She tells me of a friend, employed for 33 years, who cannot afford to see a doctor for even preventative care. ""[If] she quits her job, drops her income and ends up here, she gets the help she needs,"" Ms Grassie says, gesturing at the free clinic behind her. ""[People] are doing their jobs, showing up everyday for 33 years - and walk out with no insurance."" As the midterms approach, poll numbers show addressing the cracks and crevices of this health system remains the number one issue for voters, regardless of party. ""It's gonna take a miracle,"" Ms Grassie says with a laugh. ""But I think the ACA is a good place to start - fixing it."" Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins .
