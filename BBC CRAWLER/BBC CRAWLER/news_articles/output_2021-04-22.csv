Delhi hospitals run out of oxygen amid Covid spike,"This video can not be played Scenes outside a hospital in Delhi, where people are dying without getting the treatment they need At least two hospitals in the Indian capital of Delhi are running out of oxygen, amid a healthcare crisis gripping several states. A number of people have died while waiting for oxygen supplies, and the majority of intensive care beds in Delhi hospitals are full. India is in the grips of a second wave of Covid infections. It has close to 16 million confirmed infections and registered a record number of cases on Thursday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to hold meetings with the chief ministers of affected states and oxygen manufacturers on Friday. In a tweet labelled ""SOS"" sent out on Friday morning, Max Healthcare said it had been waiting for expected fresh supplies for more than seven hours at two hospitals. It has 700 patients admitted at the two facilities. In recent days, several other hospitals in Delhi had said they had either run out of oxygen or their supplies were dwindling rapidly.

Three other states - Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana - are also facing a critical shortage of oxygen, while other states like Maharashtra are seeing depleting supplies. On Thursday India recorded the highest one-day tally of new cases anywhere in the world. There were 314,835 new coronavirus cases during the previous 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,104. Why second Covid wave is devastating India How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave 'It feels like we're back to square one in India' There have been reports of state authorities stopping oxygen tankers from travelling to other states, according to Delhi television station NDTV. Some facilities have been accused of hoarding their supplies. Indian politician, Saurabh Bharadwaj, who is being treated in a Delhi hospital for Covid, posted a plea for help in Hindi on Twitter,saying there were just three hours of oxygen left where he was.,external ""A lot of people are dependent on oxygen and without oxygen, these people will die just like fish die in the absence of water,"" he said. ""This is a time for all to come together to work."" Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the latest surge in cases, says BBC India correspondent Yogita Limaye. Families are also waiting hours to perform funeral rites, Reuters news agency reports, with at least one Delhi crematorium resorting to building pyres in its car park in order to cope with the numbers arriving. Crematoriums are holding mass cremations, and working day and night in several cities. ""During the first phase of coronavirus, the average here was eight to 10. One day it reached 18. But today the situation is very bad. Last night we cremated 78 bodies,"" Jitender Singh Shunty, who runs a crematorium in northeast Delhi, told Reuters. ""It is four times more frightful, this coronavirus... Many bodies are around, waiting. We have no place left in the crematorium to cremate them. Very bad times, very bad times,"" he added. A doctor working in a government hospital in the south of India, who wished to remain anonymous, said tensions were running high. ""Patients are trying to hit doctors,"" they told the BBC. ""They are blaming doctors for everything and even the [hospital] management is also blaming the doctors. It's a stressful environment."" ""We have presently almost used 99% of oxygen ports - only 1% is left. It's a very pathetic situation."" Delhi has among the best healthcare facilities in India, but it has been overwhelmed and more than 99% of all its intensive care beds are full A travel ban has taken effect in the UK for visitors from India. British and Irish citizens will still be allowed to enter the UK but will have to stay in a government-appointed quarantine hotel for ten days. Canada and United Arab Emirates (UAE) have temporarily suspended passenger flights, while Singapore has tightened restrictions on travellers from India. Sukhbinder Singh, who lives in Leicester in the UK, told the BBC that his mother, 90-year-old Harbans Kaur, died on Wednesday in Delhi after she and seven members of his family tested positive for Covid-19. A nursing home refused to admit Ms Kaur without a family member to care for her, but no-one was well enough to do so and she had to stay at home. ""After several phone calls and pleading,  I managed to organised the cremation through a charity for my mother, which was carried out with some usual rituals,"" he added. ""But there were no final farewells by family and the memory of her death is very difficult to deal with mentally."" Mr Singh's brother and sister-in-law were admitted to hospital in Delhi, and using his contacts in India, he was finally able to secure the medicine and oxygen they needed - although he said he struggled in part because of rising medicine costs due to the black market. ""My lower-middle-class family is not rich to afford big private hospital fees and treatment costs. What about poor daily wagers who can't even afford paracetamol?"" In January, the pandemic was comparatively controlled, but since then the situation has gone from bad to worse. India has seen a rapid rise in case numbers over the past month driven by lax safety protocols,a Hindu festival attended by millionsandvariants of the virus, including a ""double mutant"" strain. What is the India Covid variant? Political parties have come under criticism for holding huge state election rallies - including one by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - in West Bengal. The government has defended the decision to continue with polling, which is taking place in phases, but India's election body has now banned campaign rallies. Prime Minister Modi chaired a high-level meeting on Thursday to discuss the oxygen supply issue. According toa government statement,external, he was told that an ""elaborate exercise"" is under way, with state governments to identify their needs so they can be supplied with oxygen. To transport oxygen around the country faster, the canisters are being airlifted and put on direct trains, the statement says. Election rallies have been banned due to the outbreak, but in West Bengal, voting for the Legislative Assembly is still taking place There is no national lockdown currently in place, and regions are implementing their own rules. Delhi announced a week-long lockdown at the weekend,leaving just government offices and essential services like hospitals, pharmacies and grocers open. Tougher restrictions have been announced in the worst affected state of Maharashtra, which is India's richest region and home to its financial hub, Mumbai. It has also been a Covid hotspot since the start of the pandemic, accounting for a quarter of India's cases. Oxygen leak leaves 22 Covid patients dead in India 'Wherever you look, you see ambulances and bodies' How is India's vaccination drive going? Despite a promising start in January, India's inoculation drive has been lagging. Some 130 million doses have so far been administered, but with a population of more than a billion people, it is a small percentage, and the drive has been restricted to health workers, frontline staff, those above the age of 45 and anyone with co-morbidities. Experts say India is unlikely to meet its target of covering 250 million people by July. From 1 May, people above 18 will also be eligible for the vaccine. Butthere is a shortage of doses, which could slow it down further. Are you affected by Covid-19 in India? Please share your story by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

UK speeds up climate target,"Radical new climate change commitments will set the UK on course to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035, the UK government has announced. Hitting the targets would require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy. For the first time, climate law will be extended to cover international aviation and shipping. But Labour said the government had to match ""rhetoric with reality"". It urged Boris Johnson to treat ""the climate emergency as the emergency it is"" and show ""greater ambition"". The prime minister's commitments, which are to become law, bring forward the current target for reducing carbon emissions by 15 years. This would be a world-leading position. Homes will need to be much better insulated, and people will be encouraged to drive less and walk and cycle more. Aviation is likely to become more expensive for frequent fliers. China and US pledge climate change commitment Have these seven green targets been met? World's wealthiest 'at heart of climate problem' Tax fliers and get rid of SUVs, government told Covid-19 paused climate emissions â but they're rising again The government has accepted the advice of its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) to adopt the emissions cut, which is based on 1990 levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) haspredicted a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic. The UK's new commitments come as US President Joe Biden prepares to stage a climate summit from Washington DC. Environmentalists welcomed the government's move, but warned that ministers had consistently failed to achieve previous CCC-set targets. And they insisted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak must show clearly how the transition is to be funded. Tom Burke, who chairs the environmental think tank E3G, explained what policy changes were needed to achieve the goal: ""The most important thing, I think, is for [the prime minister] to focus his policy around energy efficiency, around wind and solar, and around storage of electricity and the management of the grid,"" he said. However, he told the BBC's Today programme: ""At the moment, it's... a bit of a Boris blunderbuss and is a huge range of marginal things instead of a concentration of effort on those things that will deliver the most emissions reductions in the fastest time."" Leo Murray of the climate charity Possible called the announcement ""fantastic"", but added: ""We're not on track to meet previous climate commitments and in many ways the government is still failing."" Mr Murray said ministers were ""facing both directions at the same time"", as they had scrapped the Green Homes Grant for insulating homes, had not stopped airport expansion and were ""still pushing a Â£27bn roads budget"". The CCC report accepted by the government says low-carbon investment must scale up to Â£50bn a year in the UK. But it adds that in time fuel savings from more efficient equipment will cancel out investment costs. The CCC believes around 1% of GDP - national wealth - would need to be spent on shifting away from fossil fuels over 30 years. Its chairman, Lord Deben, said previously: ""The implication of this path is clear: the utmost focus is required from government over the next 10 years. ""If policy is not scaled up across every sector, if business is not encouraged to invest, if the people of the UK are not engaged in this challenge - the UK will not deliver net zero by 2050. The 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action."" Ed Matthew, campaigns director of E3G, said: ""Setting an ambitious emission reduction target would boost the UK's diplomatic drive to persuade other countries to set out ambitious targets of their own."" He added: ""The UK now has the opportunity to spark a global green industrial revolution, but ultimately its credibility will rest on action."" Net zero means cutting emissions as far as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, tree planting. The government has adopted the new 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut because scientists say this is needed to keep the rise in global temperatures close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""The character of this government on climate change is now clear: targets without delivery. ""So while any strengthening of our targets is the right thing to do, the government can't be trusted to match rhetoric with reality."" He added: ""We need a government that treats the climate emergency as the emergency it is. That means greater ambition than this government matched with much more decisive action."" Green Party MP Caroline Lucas commented: ""The most glaring problem [with the plan] is the government's failure to address what's driving the climate crisis: an outdated and exploitative economic system that treats our planet and natural world as peripheral to our lives and, worse, expendable. ""The Prime Minister needs to accompany stronger climate targets with an economic reset to put the health and well-being of people and planet above short-term profit and growth.""

Why second Covid wave is devastating India,"Indians are waiting for hours to cremate the deceased as cases surge Rajeshwari Devi, 58, died on Sunday after waiting for two days to get uninterrupted oxygen, an ambulance and a bed in a Covid-19 hospital. She kept waiting and gasping but it was too late by the time help arrived. She was taken to a hospital emergency room on 16 April after her oxygen saturation level dropped. Her CT scan showed that she had developed severe pneumonia. But without her Covid report the hospital refused to admit her. She spent around 36 hours in the emergency room on oxygen support in the northern Indian district of Robertsganj. The staff there told her family they were running out of oxygen and she needed to be moved to a bigger hospital but there was no ambulance or any promise of a bed. The desperate family took her in their car to a hospital where a bed had become available after the intervention of a politician. She had no oxygen support in the car - she died minutes before she could be admitted to hospital. This video can not be played What went wrong for India? Ashish Agrahari, her son, says his mother ""would have had a chance at survival if treatment was given in time"". Heartbreaking stories such as this are coming in from across India as a second Covid wave wreaks havoc. Data suggests that this wave is proving to be more infectious and deadlier in some states, although India's death rate from the virus is still relatively low. But the county's healthcare system is crumbling amid the surge in cases - doctors say it's hard for them to""see the light at the end of the tunnel this time"". The rise in case numbers has been exponential in the second wave. On 18 June last year, India recorded 11,000 cases and in the next 60 days, it added 35,000 new cases on average every day. On 10 February, at the start of the second wave, India confirmed 11,000 cases - and in the next 50 days, the daily average was around 22,000 cases. But in the following 10 days, cases rose sharply with the daily average reaching 89,800. Experts say this rapid increase shows that the second wave is spreading much faster across the country. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of Kerala state's Covid taskforce, said the rise was not entirely unexpected given that India let its guard down when daily infections in January fell to fewer than 20,000 from a peak of over 90,000 in September. Big religious gatherings, the reopening of most public places and crowded election ralliesare being blamed for the uptick. Dr Fathahudeen said there were warning signs in February but ""we did not get our act together"". ""I said in February that Covid had not gone anywhere and a tsunami would hit us if urgent actions were not taken. Sadly, a tsunami has indeed hit us now,"" he added. ""A false sense of normalcy crept in and everybody, including people and officials, did not take measures to stop the second wave."" Many Indian cities are reporting a chronic shortage of hospital beds. It's also evident in the desperate cries for help on social media platforms.Disturbing reports of people dying without getting timely treatmentare coming from all over the country. Several state governments say they are creating new facilities but experts say it's going to be hard to keep up with the pace of the rising number of infections. India has been consistently reporting more than 150,000 cases for days now. It reported 273,810 cases on Monday - the biggest daily spike since the pandemic began. Badly-affected cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad have almost run out of hospital beds. The situation is not very different in other cities, such as Lucknow, Bhopal, Kolkata, Allahabad and Surat. Public health expert Anant Bhan says officials did not use the lean period to boost facilities. ""We didn't learn any lesson from the first wave. We had reports of some cities running out of beds even in the first wave and that should have been a good enough reason to be prepared for the second wave,"" he said. He adds that there appears to be a lack of co-ordination between states and the federal government over the supply of oxygen and essential drugs. ""We need a consolidated response and resources should be shared between states."" The situation is much more dire when it comes to ICU beds. Several cities have just a few dozen ICU beds left and they are now frantically trying to build extra capacity in hotels and stadiums. But getting ICU beds up and running quickly is not easy. Dr Fathahudeen says adding beds alone is not enough. ""We need to ensure that most of these beds have oxygen facility. We need more doctors and nurses to manage extra ICU beds,"" he adds. He says it's going to be a ""daunting task"" for the government to get such facilities up and running and ensure good quality of care in a short span of time. The number of daily deaths has risen sharply in the second wave. India reported 1,761 deaths on Monday, taking the toll to over 180,000 since the pandemic began. Crematoriums have been running day and night in several cities, and people have to wait for hours to get the deceased cremated or buried. Experts say this shows that the actual number of deaths could be much higher. Sanjeev Gupta, a photojournalist based in the central Indian city of Bhopal, reached one of the city's crematoriums for what he thought was a usual assignment last week. Bhopal had reported only four Covid-related deaths on that day. But Mr Gupta was surprised to see dozens of funeral pyres burning. Additionally, several bodies were lined up to be cremated in the electric furnace. Mr Gupta says he was moved when a young man asked him to photograph the smoke coming out from the chimney of the electric crematorium. ""He said the smoke represented his mother. It's the most heartbreaking thing I have ever heard."" Another photojournalist in Lucknow, which is the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, told the BBC that he counted nearly 100 funeral pyres burning at one of the city's crematoriums in the city on 14 April. The official death data for the whole state on that day was 85. ""The sky had turned orange near the crematorium. I still get chills thinking about it. We are definitely not getting the right death data from the government,"" he said. This is the picture Mr Gupta took after the young man's request Another photojournalist the BBC spoke to in Varanasi city in Uttar Pradesh state also talked about similar discrepancies in how deaths were being reported. Experts say there are several reasons for this. One of them is that many people are dying at home because they are not getting hospital beds or they are not being able to get tested for Covid. So, they don't find a place as a Covid patient in the database managed by different states. Mr Bhan says testing facilities are still poor in smaller towns and even in some cities and ""it's possible we are missing many Covid-related deaths in these areas"". He adds that there seems to be an issue with recording Covid deaths in some states.There have been reports about administrative oversight as well,externalbut officials deny the allegation. ""We need more transparency in numbers as it helps in managing the situation and also clearly tells you how severe the situation is,"" Mr Bhan adds. India on 25 March announced that a new variant of the coronavirus had been detected from samples collected from different states. Virologist Shahid Jameel explained that a ""double mutation in key areas of the virus's spike protein may make the virus more infectious and allow it to escape the immune system"". He says the change in the virus is the only ""logical explanation"" behind the surge.Health officials in the UK are now investigatingwhether a double mutant spreads more easily and evades vaccines. As things stand there is still not enough evidence to determine any causal relationship with India's deadly second wave, and the variant is not currently listed by Public Health England as a ""variant of concern"" - a term used to describe the UK, Brazilian and South African variants. Crematoriums have been running day and night Dr Jameel adds that India started looking at mutations ""fairly late"". ""By December, India had done genome sequencing of only 5,000 samples. It wasn't a concentrated effort."" In January, India put together a group of labs to speed up sequencing and these labs started functioning in February. ""But unfortunately, the second wave started and the vision of sequencing roughly 5% of the total samples did not come through."" Sequencing becomes important in a pandemic as it allows scientists to monitor changes in the virus. ""If you can catch a more infectious variant early on in a region, you can quickly put in public health measures to stop it from spreading wider in the community,"" he explains. But it's ""never too late"" to take measures. ""We need to strengthen safety protocols and rapidly vaccinate people, and also keep an eye on mutations. If we do all this, we could reduce numbers significantly.""

Final India flight before travel ban arrives in UK,"India has joined the UK's travel red list - effectively banning travel - as a deadly second wave of infections sweeps the country. British and Irish nationals can travel to the UK from India, but they must now isolate in a government-approved hotel. India has seen soaring infection rates, a rapidly rising death toll and the discovery of a new virus variant. The spike hasoverwhelmed hospitals, creating a critical shortage of oxygen, intensive care beds and ventilators. What are the travel quarantine rules? Why was India not already on the red list? Why India is running out of oxygen again On Friday, India recorded 332,730 coronavirus cases, the highest one-day tally anywhere in the world for the second day in a row. Daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by a record 2,263 in the previous 24 hours. At least two hospitals in the Indian capital Delhi arerunning out of oxygen, and at least 13 patients have died aftera fire broke out in the intensive care unitof a hospital set up to treat Covid patients near Mumbai. The rising number of cases has resulted in a deepening healthcare crisis that has gripped several states, and India's top court has asked the central government for a national plan by Friday on bolstering supply, oxygen, medicine, treatment and vaccines. Nayan Gangyan is facing a 10-day hotel quarantine when he flies back to London from northern India on Saturday. He travelled to Chandigarh a few weeks ago, when his parents both contracted coronavirus. He told BBC Breakfast he was left feeling ""helpless"" in the UK when his father's oxygen levels dropped, there were no beds available in hospital and his mother started to panic. ""It was at that point that I decided 'my family needs help and I need to go back come what may',"" he says. He says the situation in India is ""really bad"", with the government healthcare system ""completely overrun"". But they eventually managed to get his father admitted to a hospital where he had previously undergone a liver transplant, and he is doing ""much better now"". Now Nayan is preparing to return home to London. ""The flight as of now, it's running. I really hope that it does take off,"" he says. ""I've already booked my quarantine hotel so I'll be going straight there. I'll be landing [then] straight to the hotel and 10 days in the room."" His wife Vani, who has been watching from a distance from their London home, says it has been difficult ""not to be able to control or influence"" events. On India's red list status, she says: ""We got just over three days' notice so very little time for us to actually affect the outcome or do anything. ""We're just in the position where we have to be okay. After Nayan's ordeal in India he has to go through another ordeal."" Tina Patel and her husband arrived back in the UK on Thursday from Pune, Maharashtra, after travelling to India in March to visit her father-in-law, who was ill due to old age and later died. She told the BBC people in the city were ""desperate"" - trying to find hospital beds or a slot in the crematoriums. ""We left a city with ambulances wailing away day and night,"" she said. ""I left broken-hearted as there was nothing we could do but catch the BA flight last night and all we could do was to be thankful that we finally got home."" Friday's travel rule change means direct flights from India are still permitted, but UK and Irish nationals, as well as those with residency rights, must isolate in government-approved hotels - at their own cost - for 10 days. Travel to the UK is banned for all others who have been in red-list countries in the past 10 days. There are 40 countries on thegovernment's red list,externalacross the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice. There are specific rules for people arriving in each UK nation, includingEngland,external,Scotland,external,Northern Ireland,externalandWales,external. 'It feels like we're back to square one in India' What is the India Covid variant? Public Health England (PHE) confirmed on Thursday thata further 55 cases,externalof the virus variant first identified in India - known as B.1.617 - were found in the UK in the latest week to 14 April. PHE experts are currently unsure whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity. The final scheduled commercial flight ahead of the rule change - Vistara flight VTI017 - landed at London's Heathrow Airport at 18:48 on Thursday, according to FlightRadar24. Four airlines asked for a total of eight extra flights to arrive at the west London airport before the 04:00 deadlinebut were refused permission by airport authorities. Heathrow bosses are believed to have declined the requests to ensure pressures at the border, reported in recent weeks, were not exacerbated. Later scheduled arrivals from Delhi and Mumbai to Heathrow, and Delhi to Gatwick Airport, were cancelled on Thursday, airport data showed. This video can not be played Travellers returning from India: ""Oh my goodness, feeling so relieved"" Some of those who arrived before the red list change told the BBC they""couldn't afford to stay away"" and ""had to get back to work"". ""Eventually, yesterday, a friend in the UK managed to book me a ticket from Mumbai to Manchester,"" Biju Mathew, a social services manager from Walsall, said. Demand for flights from India to the UK quickly became overwhelming after the government's red list announcement, according to Suresh Kumar, chairman of specialist travel agents Indra Travel. ""A lot of people were hoping that the [UK] government would have made arrangements for people trying to get back,"" he said. ""They were disappointed."" This video can not be played Scenes outside a hospital in Delhi, where people are dying without getting the treatment they need Speaking on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who cancelled an official visit to India due to take place next Monday - said the addition to the red list was a ""purely precautionary"" step over a new coronavirus variant. He said: ""What we're seeing in India is a result of a variant under investigation, it hasn't yet been deemed a variant of concern - I think that was why there has been the delay."" The B.1.617 variant was first noted internationally in October and first identified in the UK on 22 February. Have you been affected by the issues in this story?

Welsh pubs and restaurants to open indoors in May,"Having an alcoholic drink inside pubs and restaurants in Wales has been banned since 4 December People in Wales will be able to have a drink inside a pub or restaurant for the first time in more than than five months from 17 May. All tourist accommodation, indoor entertainment and attractions in Wales are also set to reopen that day, in time for the Spring bank holiday. Indoor children's activities and groups of up to 15 adults, like gym classes, have been brought forward to 3 May. First Minister Mark Drakeford described it as a ""major reopening of Wales"". He said the relaxation of a number of lockdown rules had been moved forward because of falling Covid rates. Lockdown rules are changing again - what's happening? 'Let pubs reopen to control drinking' Opening pubs too soon 'may undo all the good' It is the first time a proposed date has been given for the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors in Wales. It comes after the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for the industry to be allowed to resume indoor trade on that date - the same as that proposed in England. Opposition parties accused Mr Drakeford, the leader of Welsh Labour, of electioneering by changing Covid rules during the Welsh Parliament election campaign. Mr Drakeford disagreed, saying the move was only because Wales' Covid case rate had fallen to the UK's lowest. ""The virus doesn't know there is an election on, and I don't think it would have been right not to have given those indications,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. The latest restriction easing comes after previous announcements thatany six people can meet outdoors in Walesfrom Saturday, and dates for gyms and swimming pools being moved forward by two weeks to 3 May. This video can not be played It is the first time a proposed date has been given for the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors in Wales Mr Drakeford has also confirmed outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants, will be allowed to reopen on Monday - alongside outdoor attractions, organised outdoor activities and wedding receptions or funeral services for up to 30 people outdoors. Two people will also be allowed to visit their loved ones in care homes from Monday. Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can also reopen,externalfrom 3 May, while people can once again form extended households, allowing two households to bubble up and have contact indoors. By the time indoor hospitality reopens on 17 May, Mr Drakeford anticipates being able to increase the number of people who can attend organised activities, such as wedding receptions, to 30 indoors and 50 outdoors, from the same date. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage People in Wales haven't been allowed to buy an alcoholic drink inside a pub or restaurant in Wales since 4 December. So allowing people to do so from 17 May would be similar to the plan in England and Scotland - with up to four people from up to four different households in Wales allowed to meet. Although, Scotland will be thefirst in the UK to open its cafes, pubs and restaurants indoorsfrom Monday - but no alcohol can be served. People in England can already visit the pub or have a meal in a restaurant outside - thatcould extend to inside from 17 May. Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants can welcome customers outdoors in Northern Ireland from 30 April, with restrictions, while people may be allowed to socialise inside from 24 May at the earliest, depending on Covid case rates. Happier times for cafÃ© owner Sara Bailey - when customers could order inside It has been a long time coming for Treorchy cafe owner Sara Bailey. Hot Gossip, like so many other catering businesses in Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been shut for four months. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many have had a Covid vaccine in Wales? ""It seems that things are going well at the moment with Covid cases, so it is time to give us a date to reopen,"" she said. Without any outdoor seating, Sara Bailey is desperate to open inside her Treorchy cafÃ© For restaurateur Nataniel Martinez, who runs Le Monde in Cardiff and Penarth's Old Customs House, reopening is a large-scale operation. ""The opening of indoor hospitality for us means we can bring back about 120 staff into work,"" he said. ""The demand for indoor dining is massive, so we are really looking forward now to getting back to it and reopening all the restaurants."" Restaurateur Nataniel Martinez says opening indoors is vital to his businesses Rhian Davies, owner of the Crown and Sceptre pubÂ in Cadoxton in Neath Port Talbot, said there was a ""lot of preparation to do"" before reopening - but added the industry was used to it after months of safety measures last year. She said she accepted closures had been needed: ""I wanted to help the hard working staff of our hospitals and health service... and was happy to do my bit to stop Covid spreading."" The announcement has been warmly welcomed by UKHospitality, the trade body representing the hospitality sector in Wales. ""We have led the calls for earlier reopening and have been advising, consulting and negotiating on the need to help protect jobs and businesses - and the public,"" said Dave Chapman, its director for Wales. He said the announcement ""offers clarity and commercial hope, and reflects positively the medical evidence"". Wales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK when the Welsh governmentbanned sale of alcohol on the premisesof pubs and restaurants on 4 December. Then came the pre-Christmas lockdown, shutting all restaurants, pubs and shops, as Wales reported more than 3,000 Covid cases in a day and that theWelsh NHS was struggling to cope. Now, Wales has thelowest Covid case rate in the UK- around 15 cases per 100,000 people - with, compared to other UK nations, thehighest percentage of its populationvaccinated. The number of Covid patients in hospitals in Wales has also dropped to its lowest level. While there now appears to be a broad consensus on hospitality restrictions, both the Tories and Plaid Cymru have said Mr Drakeford should not be using the televised address for announcements easing restrictions. The Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh Labour leader of ""naked electioneering"" while Plaid Cymru said it was ""completely inappropriate"" for the press conference to be used like this. Plaid leader Adam Price, said: ""A Plaid Cymru government would plan for the reopening of indoor hospitality, tourist accommodation, cinemas and other entertainment venues on 17 May. ""To put businesses on the best possible footing our first steps in office include providing start up grants for hospitality businesses. ""Additional financial support would also be backdated to 26 April for those businesses that cannot viably trade on the basis of outdoor opening alone."" BASICS:Simple guide to the Senedd election POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for? FIRST TIME:Will 16-year-olds vote? Welcoming the announcement Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said it was ""great news"". She said: ""As a nation we must all work together to ensure the vaccination programme continues and that the lockdowns and closures we've been through never need to return."" Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said:  ""Labour had ample opportunity to bring forward a roadmap out of lockdown, but refused to do so. ""Thanks to the UK's great vaccination story much more detail could have been announced prior to the election period... but Labour chose to play politics instead of adopting the Welsh Conservative roadmap."" Mark Reckless, from the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, said: ""This is getting to the point of testing election rules to breaking point. ""The Labour leader is using his platform as first minister to make political announcements during an election campaign.""

Former Bay City Rollers frontman Les McKeown dies,"Former Bay City Rollers frontman Les McKeown has died aged 65, his family has told the BBC. The Scottish pop singer fronted the Edinburgh band during their most successful period in the 1970s. They had hits with tracks like I Only Wanna Be With You, Bye Bye Baby, Shang-a-Lang and Give a Little Love. His family announced online on Thursday that he had died suddenly at his home on Tuesday.

Bay City Rollers became tartan-clad sensations in the UK and US in the 1970s. They were hugely successful, selling more than 120 million records. The boy band that turned the world tartan ""They were adorable. Five cute guys at once. That's the story of rock n roll,"" US journalist Danny Fields told the BBC. ""The invention of boy bands became an industry thanks to the Bay City Rollers."" The group got together in the early 70s and found their name by throwing a dart at a map - it landed on Bay City near Michigan, according to theOfficial Charts Company,external. Their first single was Keep On Dancing in 1971, and they had two number one hits in 1975 with Bye Bye Baby and Give A Little Love, plus chart-topping albums with Rollin' in 1974 and 1975's Once Upon A Star. McKeown said the band's first pair of tartan trousers were inspired by a picture on a birthday card and were made by his father, who was a tailor. The vocalist, who left school aged 15 and joined a band called Threshold, went on to join the Bay City Rollers aged 18 in 1973. He left in 1978, as the band decided to go in a more new-wave direction under the new name The Rollers, but he later rejoined for several comeback tours and live recordings. (Left to right) Stuart Wood, Alan Longmuir, Derek Longmuir, Les McKeown and Eric Faulkner of The Bay City Rollers at Heathrow Airport, London in 1975 Recalling the 1975 tour 40 years later, McKeown said it was ""crazy"". ""We would go on and the police would make us stop because they just could not control the crowd,"" he said. When he was on a rare visit home to Edinburgh, McKeown - just 20 at the time - ran over and killed a 76-year-old woman. The day after the accident McKeown rejoined the tour. He said: ""I can remember just being in complete shock. I don't know how long it took me to come out of that shock. ""In retrospect I should have dealt with the issue in a much more comprehensive way."" Despite some witnesses claiming McKeown was driving too fast, a court cleared him of the more serious charge and instead found him of guilty of reckless driving. He was fined Â£100 and banned from driving for a year. McKeown claimed in numerous interviews that the guilt over the incident never left him, and was a big part of his alcoholism, as the Rollers' popularity waned dramatically in the late 1970s. He was also open in interviews about his trips to rehab. Les McKeown and the Bay City Rollers provided part of the soundtrack to a particular chapter in Scotland's modern history. At the height of their success in the mid 1970s, the Bay City Rollers were the biggest pop sensation Scotland had ever seen. Their brand of bubblegum pop won fans across the world and they were unashamedly Scottish. This was a time when few Scottish musicians became international stars other than traditional favourites like Andy Stewart or the Alexander Brothers. The pop music Scottish children and teenagers loved was often from England or America. Outside Scotland, the Rollers were what we would now call brand ambassadors for their country. It can seem preposterous to draw parallels between bubblegum pop, national identity or politics but perhaps there are some. The Rollers loved their tartan at a time when many younger Scots associated it with an older generation or the sentimental, ""kailyard"" image of the country. The peak of their success in the mid 70s coincided with a time when there was intense debate over Scotland's political future - a debate, at times, emboldened by a new self-confidence. Many assumed devolution in the form of a Scottish Assembly in Edinburgh was inevitable. But like so many teen sensations, their success did not last. The decline of the Rollers came around the same time as Scotland's humiliation in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. A year later the plan for a Scottish Assembly failed to win sufficient support in a referendum. Music can be the soundtrack to history. The Bay City Rollers unintentionally provided part of the playlist. The band had two UK number one albums and singles After heleft the band,external, McKeown formed the pop group Egotrip, and released a solo album All Washed Up in 1979. He toured more recently under the name Les McKeown's Bay City Rollers. They had been mid-way through a tour in Toronto as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, and had to return home quickly. The tour had been rebooked for November 2021. McKeowntold the Edinburgh Evening News,externallast August that during lockdown he had ""never had so much time off"", and was usually always on the road for half of the year. Celebrities shared their shock at the news and their own memories of the frontman on social media. Judy Murray, mother of tennis champtions Andy and Jamie Murray, posted two pictures: one of her hugging Les McKeown at a concert, and one of her holding a tartan scarf. She captioned them with ""Bye bye baby"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave,"Family members of a person who died of Covid-19 react during a cremation In early March, India's health minister Harsh Vardhan declared the country was ""in the endgame"" of the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Vardhan also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership as an ""example to the world in international co-operation"". From January onwards, India had begun shipping doses to foreign countries as part of its much-vaunted ""vaccine diplomacy"". Mr Vardhan's unbridled optimism was based on a sharp drop in reported infections. Since a peak of more than 93,000 cases per day on average in mid-September, infections had steadily declined. By mid-February, India was counting an average of 11,000 cases a day. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from the disease had slid to below 100. The euphoria at beating the virus had been building since late last year. Politicians, policy makers and parts of the media believed that India was truly out of the woods. In December, central bank officials announced that India was ""bending the Covid infection curve"". There was evidence, they said, in poetic terms, that the economy was ""breaking out amidst winter's lengthening shadows towards a place in sunlight"". Mr Modi was called a ""vaccine guru"". Hospitals are overflowing with patients, often two to a bed At the end of February, India's election authorities announced key elections in five states where 186 million people were eligible to vote for 824 seats. Beginning 27 March, the polls would stretch over a month, and in the case of the state of West Bengal, be held in eight phases. Campaigning had begun in full swing, with no safety protocols and social distancing. In mid-March, the cricket board allowed more than 130,000 fans, mostly unmasked, to watch two international cricket games between India and England at the Narendra Modi stadium in Gujarat. In less than a month, things began to unravel. India was in the grips of a devastating second wave of the virus and cities were facing fresh lockdowns. By mid-April, the country was averaging more than 100,000 cases a day. On Sunday, India recorded more than 270,000 cases and over 1,600 deaths, both new single-day records. If the runway infection was not checked, India could be recording more than 2,300 deaths every day by first week of June, according to areport by The Lancet Covid-19 Commission,external. India is in now in the grips of a public health emergency. Social media feeds are full with videos of Covid funerals at crowded cemeteries, wailing relatives of the dead outside hospitals, long queues of ambulances carrying gasping patients, mortuaries overflowing with the dead, and patients, sometimes two to a bed, in corridors and lobbies of hospitals. There are frantic calls for help for beds, medicines, oxygen, essential drugs and tests. Drugs are being sold on the black market, and test results are taking days. ""They didn't tell me for three hours that my child is dead,"" a dazed mother says in one video, sitting outside an ICU. Wails of another person outside the intensive care punctuate the silences. India is facing a shortage of vaccines even as it ramps up its inoculation drive Even India's mammoth vaccination effort was now struggling. In the beginning, the rollout had been embroiled in a controversy over the efficacy over a home-grown candidate. Even as the country ramped up the drive andadministered more than 100 million dosesby last week,vaccine shortages were being reported. Serum Institute of India, the country's - and the world's - biggest vaccine maker said it would not be able to ramp up supplies before June because it didn't have enough money to expand capacity. India placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, because the doses were needed urgently at home, and allowed imports of foreign vaccines. Even oxygen was likely to be imported now to meet the surge in demand. Meanwhile, almost in a parallel universe, away from the death and despair, the world's richest cricket tournament was beingplayed behind closed doorsevery evening, and tens of thousands of people were following their leaders to election rallies andattending the Hindu festival of Kumbh Mela. ""It is beyond surreal, what is happening,"" Shiv Visvanathan, a sociology professor, told me. Experts believe the government appears to have completely dropped the ball on the second wave of infections that was about to hit India. Relatives performing funerals of Covid victims in the city of Bhopal In mid-February, Tabassum Barnagarwala, a journalist with the Indian Express newspaper, flagged a seven-fold rise in new cases in parts of Maharashtra and reported that samples from the infected had been sent for genome sequencing to look for imported variants. By the end of the month, theBBC reported the surgeand asked whether India was facing a new Covid wave. ""We really don't know what the cause of the surge is. What is worrying is that entire families are getting infected. This is a completely new trend,"" Dr Shyamsunder Nikam, civil surgeon of an affected district in Maharashtra, said at the time. Experts now say that crowing about India's exceptionalism in ""beating"" the epidemic - younger population, native immunity, a largely rural population - and declaring victory on the virus turned out to be cruelly premature. ""As is typical in India, official arrogance, hyper-nationalism, populism and an ample dose of bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis,"" said Mihir Sharma, a columnist for Bloomberg. India's second wave was fuelled by people letting their guard down, attending weddings and social gatherings, and by mixed messaging from the government, allowing political rallies and religious gatherings. With infections declining, fewer people were taking the jabs, slowing down the vaccination drive, which had aimed to inoculate 250 million people by the end of July. In mid-February, Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan, tweeted that India needed to ""accelerate the vaccination drive while the case counts are low"". Nobody quite took notice. Devotees at the Kumbh Mela festival on 14 April, when India recorded more than 184,000 new infections ""There was a feeling of triumphalism,"" said K Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India. ""Some felt we had achieved herd immunity. Everyone wanted to get back to work. This narrative fell on many receptive ears, and the few voices of caution were not heeded to,"" he said. A second wave may have been inevitable, but India could have ""postponed or delayed it and lessened its impact,"" said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology. Like many other countries, India should have begun careful genomic surveillance in January to detect variants, Mr Menon said. Some of thesevariants could be driving the surge. ""We learnt of new variants in February from reports from Maharashtra. This was initially denied by authorities,"" Mr Menon added. ""This was a significant turning point."" What are the lessons of this public health crisis? For one, India should learn not to declare victory over the virus prematurely, and it should put a lid on triumphalism. People should also learn to adapt to short, local lockdowns in the event of the inevitable future spikes of infection. Most epidemiologists predict more waves, given that India is evidently still far away from reaching herd immunity and its vaccination rate remains slow. ""We cant freeze human life,"" Professor Reddy said. ""If we can't physically distance in the crowded cities, we can at least make sure everyone wears a proper mask. And wear it properly. That's not a big ask.""

Birthday snap of Prince Louis as he starts nursery,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released a new picture of Prince Louis to celebrate his third birthday and mark his first day at nursery school. The photograph was taken at Kensington Palace by the duchess, shortly before Louis set off for Willcocks Nursery School for the first time on Wednesday. Smartly dressed in shorts, a shirt and a jumper, he sits on a red Frog bicycle with a rucksack on his back. Prince William and Catherine were said to be ""delighted"" to share the update. The Willcocks Nursery School was also attendedby Louis' sister Princess Charlotte- and charges up to Â£3,400 per term, depending on a child's age and which sessions they attend. The nursery, which is situated in the shadow of the Royal Albert Hall, has received positive praise from Ofsted when it was inspected in January 2020 and is rated outstanding. Where is Prince Louis in the royal line of succession? Royal purse hit by Â£35m pandemic shortfall Why does Prince George always wear shorts? His older brother Prince George attended the Â£33-a-day Westacre Montessori School Nursery in Norfolk, close to the Cambridges' country home at Anmer Hall, Sandringham. Prince George on his first day at nursery in January 2016 Charlotte, pictured on her first day at nursery, went to Willcocks like Louis Louis, who is fifth in line to the throne, is the latest member of the Royal Family to attend a private nursery school in a tradition that began with his father. Prince William went to the Minors Nursery School, minutes from Kensington Palace in Notting Hill Gate, west London, in 1985. He was the first prospective heir to the throne to attend a private nursery, in a move reported at the time to have been influenced by his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who worked at a nursery school before her marriage to the Prince of Wales. The Queenwas educated at homeand relied on her nanny, Crawfie, to take her on educational trips - including a journey on the London tube. Prince Charles did not go to nursery, instead he was taught by a governess in a palace room containing a blackboard and a desk. Prince William ""couldn't wait"" to start nursery when he was dropped off by his parents in September 1985, BBC News reported at the time Royal mourning in memory of the Duke of Edinburgh will end for the monarchy and its households on Friday. Sincethe death of the Queen's husband on 9 April, the Royal Family have only carried out official duties where appropriate and have dressed in black when in public.

Postmasters await ruling over convictions,"Seema Misra, Jo Hamilton, and Janet Skinner (left to right) are fighting to clear their names A group of 42 sub-postmasters and postmistresses will learn later whether convictions for stealing money will be quashed amid a Post Office IT scandal. They were convicted, with some imprisoned, after the Post Office installed the Horizon computer system in branches. The system was flawed and postmasters and postmistresses have spent years trying to clear their names. Judges at the Court of Appeal will deliver their ruling later. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Following the convictions - including theft, fraud and false accounting - some former postmasters went to prison, were shunned by their communities and struggled to secure work. Some lost their homes, and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions. Some have since died. They always said the fault was in the computer system, which had been used to manage post office finances since 1999. Janet Skinner says she is nervous about the result Among them was Janet Skinner, who ran a post office in Hull. She was imprisoned in 2007 for nine months over a shortfall of Â£59,000 - a case which she said ""destroyed everything"". Like others, she said she had no idea other sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were being prosecuted and convicted. She was taken away from her two children to go to prison, and - after her release - had a job offer taken away owing to her criminal conviction. Now she is waiting for the Appeal Court's verdict. ""I'm so nervous, because I know my life is in the hands of three judges,"" she said. Karen has been fighting to clear her late husband Julian's name Julian Wilson owned and ran the Astwood Bank village post office branch in Worcestershire. He was convicted following a Post Office prosecution in 2008. He died of cancer in 2016, but his widow Karen has been fighting to clear his name. ""He couldn't get a job, so I had three jobs. I sold everything he'd ever bought me - my engagement ring, all my jewellery. I didn't tell him,"" she said. ""He used to say: 'I feel I have a ball and chain with an anchor around my leg and I'm dragging it over a stormy sea, and I want somebody to cut it free because I am not a criminal.'"" In an earlier ruling, a High Court judge found the Fujitsu-developedÂ HorizonÂ accounting system contained ""bugs, errors and defects"" and that there was a ""material risk"" shortfalls in branch accounts were caused by the system. In December 2019, the Post Office agreed to pay almost Â£58m to settle the long-running dispute with more than 500 sub-postmasters and postmistresses affected by the scandal. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred 51 cases back to the courts.Six people's convictions were overturnedlast year. Later on Friday, following a hearing at the Court of Appeal in March, judges will give a ruling in 42 more cases. In 39 cases, the Post Office did not contest that those involved ""did not or could not have a fair trial"", but in 35 of these cases it did challenge a second element that their convictions were ""an affront to the public conscience"". The Horizon system is designed to record the transactions carried out in a post office branch The Horizon system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. But from an early stage it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. Horizon-based evidence was used by the Post Office to successfully prosecute 736 people. But campaigners fought a long and series of legal battles for compensation in the civil courts, which have been followed by referrals by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Listen to the background of the saga -The Great Post Office Trial on BBC Sounds Watch the latest BBC Panorama -Scandal at the Post Office Seema Misra was sent to prison while pregnant Others hoping to have their names cleared include Seema Misra, who was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. ""Prison was my worst nightmare,"" she said. Also waiting for the decision is Jo Hamilton, who was accused by the Post Office of taking Â£36,000 from the village shop she ran in Hampshire. She had to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. Declaring the criminal record also affected everyday life, such as failing to get car insurance. She made ends meet by doing cleaning jobs for people in her village who did not believe she was guilty. Many of them, including the local vicar, came to support her at her sentencing hearing. ""It's just gone on for so long. It's been a massive part of my life,"" she said. A Post Office spokesman said: ""We sincerely apologise to the postmasters affected by our historical failures. ""Throughout this appeals process we have supported the quashing of the overwhelming majority of these convictions and the judgment will be an important milestone in addressing the past.""

Treasury publishes Greensill emails amid lobby row,"David Cameron resigned as prime minister in 2016, following the Brexit referendum The Treasury has published 40 pages of messages relating to its contact with David Cameron and Greensill Capital. The former PM is embroiled in a row over attempts to lobby top officials on behalf of the financial firm. It had already come to light thatMr Cameron contacted the chancellor and two other ministers about Greensill. But the emails also revealed former Cabinet SecretarySir Mark Sedwill""connected"" Lex Greensill with the Treasury in March 2020. Other emails and texts - released as a result of a Freedom of Information request - showed contact between senior civil servants in the department and the former PM and financier. They also showed the rejection letters for Greensill's appeal for access to government-backed loans during the pandemic. Earlier, the Bank of England said Mr Cameron had contacted it multiple times last year as the finance firm sought access to a Covid loan scheme. The Treasury's top civil servant, Sir Tom Scholar, also told MPs Mr Cameron had called and texted him on his official phone. But he added that Greensill's proposals were ultimately rejected. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about? Lobbying probe invites Cameron to give evidence Fears for 5,000 steel jobs as lender collapses Three MP-led inquiries and a lawyer-led government review are looking at Mr Cameron's work for the company, which collapsed in March. The former Conservative leader, who began working for Greensill as an adviser two years after leaving Downing Street, has insisted he broke no lobbying rules but accepted he should have contacted ministers using more formal channels. But Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the correspondence showed the firm ""was carrying the begging bowl from the Bank of England to the Treasury and back"". ""We need to understand why Greensill Capital was given so much time and access to the Treasury, and why so much public money was put at risk."" On Wednesday, the Bank of England released details of contacts between Mr Cameron and its officials, in response to Freedom of Information requests. They show the ex-PM contacted Bank officials before and after the firm applied to join a government scheme to support lending to businesses. Alongside the Treasury, the Bank had been running the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), set up in the early stages of the pandemic. Greensill had wanted the terms of the CCFF changed so it could take part - a request the Treasury went on to reject, after concluding the firm's proposals were not suitable. Thepublished correspondence,externalfrom the Bank of England includes email exchanges with Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy governor. In one email from early April, Mr Cameron told Sir Jon that Greensill had ""failed to get anywhere"" with its proposals, despite ""numerous conversations"" with the Treasury. In another email to him later in the month, the ex-PM said Greensill's inability to access the scheme had proved ""incredibly frustrating"". Records show a phone call later took place between Sir Jon and Lex Greensill, the firm's Australian founder, to discuss the firm's ideas further. They show Sir Jon telling Mr Greensill his firm fell outside the ""boundaries of the scheme"" - and changing these would be a decision for the Treasury. The Bank of England was involved in the government's CCFF loans scheme Earlier on Wednesday, Sir Tom - the Treasury's permanent secretary - said Greensill Capital had ""persistently"" approached his department about being involved. Giving evidence to MPs on the the Public Accounts Committee, he added: ""We listened to what they said. We analysed it, we tested it and in the end, despite them submitting a series of successive proposals, we decided to reject them all."" Sir Tom, who previously worked for the former PM as a Europe adviser, told them Mr Cameron had rung him directly in April 2020, although the call did not include ""substantive discussion"" of Greensill's proposals. ""It was simply a call to draw it to my attention,"" he said, adding that Mr Cameron had his work phone number ""because I used to work with him"". Asked if he would have taken a call from a lobbyist if they hadn't been a former prime minister, Sir Tom said: ""I've also from time-to-time had calls from other senior people, maybe private sector people who I've previously worked with in another capacity."" He added: ""I think it's natural when somebody that you know asks to speak to you... it's quite natural to take that."" The second most senior official at the Treasury, Charles Roxburgh, told the committee he had met Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill at nine meetings spread out over four months from March to June 2020. Mr Roxburgh told the committee civil servants would not have consulted on their proposals ""if we didn't think there was some potential - turns out there wasn't"".

Mike Ashley told to reinstate Jenners signs,"Edinburgh Rope Access was employed to remove all three signs on the Jenners building over two days last week Sports Direct billionaire Mike Ashley has been told by council officials to reinstate the signs on the historic Jenners building in Edinburgh. Mr Ashley, the current tenant, has three months from when an enforcement notice comes into effect on 14 May. A spokesman for Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, who owns the building, said the signs were removed without his authorisation last week. Mike Ashley's spokeswoman has been asked for comment. Anders Krogh Vogdrup - the director of AAA United, that owns the listed Jenners building - told BBC Scotland that although it was technically liable, the removal of the signs had nothing to do with AAA United. He said: ""We are very relieved that the signs will be reinstated."" 'No mystery' over removal of Jenners sign Probe after 'Jenners' signs removed from store Jenners store 'will remain' despite Frasers move There were three Jenners signs on each side of the Princes Street/South St David Street corner building until they were removed. BBC Scotland understands one sign might be as old as the building with the other two almost 20 years old. Nicky Erskine, owner of Edinburgh Rope Access, said his team was asked to take down the gold-coloured lettering and worked for two days to remove it last week. He said it was now being stored on the sixth floor of the department store. Neil Gardiner, City of Edinburgh Council's planning convener, said: ""We can confirm thata listed building enforcement notice,externalhas been sent to the owner and the tenant of the building. ""It requires the lettering to be reinstated in its original positions on the Jenners building."" The three Jenners signs are being stored on the sixth floor of the Jenners building in Edinburgh The Jenners building has occupied a prime location on Princes Street for 183 years. It was bought by Mr Povlsen - who is one of Scotland's biggest landowners - in 2017, reportedly for Â£53m. The store is currently operated by the Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, which owns the commercial rights to the Jenners trading name. Frasers Group includes Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Evans Cycles. It said it would be quitting the site in May after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement. Despite that, the building owners said they would keep it as a department store as well as turning  unused parts of the six-storey building into a hotel. The building owner is currently in advanced talks with a new tenant to move into the department store.

Club ownership considered in fan-led football review,"Fans protested at Chelsea on Tuesday before it was announced the six English clubs would not join a European Super League New ownership structures at clubs will be assessed as part of a fan-led review into English football. The review, brought forward by the UK government due to controversies over the proposed European Super League, will consider ownership, finance and supporter involvement in the game. It will also assess if an independent regulator may have beneficial impact. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said the fan-led review ""must be a watershed moment in our national game"". Tracey Crouch MP will chair the review and report its recommendations back to the government and Football Association. She said it will ""take the necessary steps to retain the game's integrity, competitiveness and, most importantly, the bond that clubs have with its supporters and the local community"". Recent events - which saw six Premier League clubs sign up and later withdraw from a new European Super League - prompted fans to air frustrations over the power owners have in taking big decisions at clubs. The review will consider ownership models including those used in Germany, where the 50+1 rule means clubs cannot play in the Bundesliga if one commercial investor owns more than a 49% stake. The Bundesliga says the rule""protects against reckless owners and safeguards the democratic customs of German clubs"".,external ""While foreign ownership has undoubtedly benefited the development of the game, the review will seek to test whether existing oversight is sufficient to protect the interests of the game,"" the UK government said. Fans protested at Manchester United's training ground on Thursday and held a '51%' banner In addition, the review hopes to scrutinise the Owners' and Directors' Tests currently in place, assess the flow of money through the English football pyramid, and consider if club finances could be scrutinised on a more regular basis. In the wake of news breaking on the decision by Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham and Arsenal to join a European Super League, former England defender Gary Neville said he felt the game needed an independent regulator. The fan-led review will assess how this could work and what relationship it could have with bodies - such as the Football Association - in the game. Time will also be spent considering possible interventions that could protect club identity, such as historical features like club badges. This video can not be played ""We will do whatever it takes to protect our national game"" â Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden All six clubs intent on a breakaway reversed their decision on Tuesday but many in the game have been left frustrated by their actions. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said there was anger among the 14 other Premier League clubs when they met this week and he expects ""more government intervention"" as a result of the controversy. ""First, we have asked the PL and FA to make sure they conduct a full investigation,"" Barber told BT Sport. ""The second step must be to ensure it can't happen again. ""Clearly the one thing we are very clear on is when we work in football, we work within the regulatory framework. We know there are rules we have to abide by and if these rules are breached there will be sanctions. In this situation, where the game has been damaged - this has been a PR catastrophe for the whole game - there have to be some consequences for that. ""The actions of the last 72 hours proves our framework has not been strong enough. There are so many people concerned by what could happen, we need more stringent control and clear sanctions for what would happen if anyone tried it again. The consequences could have been catastrophic.""

Charities sound alarm over buy-now-pay-later debt,"A group of charities has sounded the alarm over the growing use of buy-now-pay-later to buy goods. Citizens Advice, a network of legal, money and consumer groups, said many users were getting into debt and struggling to pay for food and bills. Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) is increasingly popular among young people buying online, and at some High Street outlets. However, Citizens Advice said many consumers regretted using it. The charity network did not want to name BNPL firms, but called for tougher regulation. It found that 45% of 18-to-34 year olds have used the payment option in the last 12 months. The repayment option is often advertised at online checkouts as an easy way of splitting or delaying payments on items such as clothing or electronics, with incentives such as it being ""interest-free"". However, the charity network said it can be a ""slippery slope into debt"". The charity network said that, overall, 27% of UK adults have used these firms in the last 12 months, rising to 37% of disabled people and 45% of people with a mental health problem. The average person was repaying Â£63 a month, but CA found almost two-in-five (5.7 million) who have used BNPL in the last year didn't think it was ""proper borrowing"" and six million didn't fully understand what they were signing up for. One consumer who signed up for more than she expected is Sharonjit, whose story was cited  by Citizen's Advice as an example of the trouble people can get into. Aged 32, she bought Â£600 worth of clothes and used a BNPL firm to pay in instalments. She didn't receive the goods and cancelled her payment to the firm while she waited for the issue to be resolved by the retailer. She said: ""The whole thing has been so stressful. I'm constantly on edge. I've just been barraged with calls, emails and letters from a debt collector - all for buying some clothes online. ""The firm said they were referring me on to someone and I had no idea it was a debt collector. I had no idea buy-now-pay-later could [hit] my credit score. ""I've never had issues shopping this way before. But this time it's like as soon as something went wrong they've washed their hands of me."" And the charity warned that four-in-10 of those who've used BNPL in the last 12 months are struggling to repay. It found a quarter of consumers regretted paying using these platforms, with consumers frequently saying they cannot afford repayments or are spending more than they expected. Citizens Advice said firms must overhaul their checkout processes and improve affordability checks. Both the Financial Ombudsman Service and Financial Conduct Authority had a greater role to play in the protection of consumers and regulation of the industry, it said. Alistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""Buy Now Pay Later borrowing can be like quicksand - easy to unwittingly slip into and much more difficult to get out of. ""It shouldn't be possible for people to sign up for credit without realising, and the fact this is happening so often signals that a drastic overhaul is needed. ""This industry more than trebled in 2020, and while these products work for many shoppers, the regulator has rightly recognised the potential for harm. It must ensure robust consumer protection keeps pace with changes in how we shop,"" Mr Cromwell said. Several big - and smaller - names now operate in the fast-growing BNPL market, including Klarna, Clearpay, and Laybuy. PayPal launched a BNPL service last year. However, firms stress that not all operate to the same standards. Alex Marsh, UK head of the one of the most popular BNPL firms, Klarna, said: ""There is now a variety of buy now pay later providers in the market and the findings in this report do not represent the experiences of the more than 12 million consumers who choose to use Klarna's interest free, fee-free services each year. ""We make it crystal clear for our consumers at check out that this is a credit product, we perform a credit check each time they use our service, and we are available 24/7 to support the small number of customers who unfortunately find themselves in difficulty."" Another firm, Openpay, said it had strict rules to protect consumers. Andy Harding, the firm's UK managing director of payments said: ""Openpay has never run a marketing campaign specifically targeting young people and Openpay is never the default payment option at checkout - a practice that can lead to people using BNPL services unwittingly."" He added that Openpay has a financial hardship policy in place for any customers experiencing financial difficulty, including as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

VIP fast-track for PPE contracts back in court,"More details about a controversial ""VIP"" fast-track route for PPE firms with connections to government have emerged in the High Court. One official complained the procurement team was ""drowning"" in high priority requests without the correct certification or due diligence. Campaigners are challenging the government over directly awarding contracts during the pandemic. The government said it worked tirelessly on PPE to protect NHS staff. During the Covid crisis, the government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply personal protective equipment, which would usually be opened to competing bids. Campaign groups The Good Law Project and EveryDoctor have joined together to challenge the government in the courts over the decisions it made in signing several of these deals, which were handled as part of a so-called VIP lane, reserved for leads endorsed by Whitehall officials or politicians. WATCH: How healthcare workers put on PPE During an urgent hearing before the High Court, the campaigners' lawyers presented an email from an official working in the PPE sourcing team, which reveal concerns about this ""high priority"" route. ""We are currently drowning in VIP requests and 'high priority' contacts that despite all of our work and best efforts do not either hold the correct certification or do not pass due diligence,"" the unnamed official wrote. The email says that an offer that jumped ""to the front of the queue"" had a ""knock on effect to the remaining offers of help"". The BBC has been investigating problems with PPE purchased for NHS staff since last summer. One of the deals being challenged concerns50 million FFP2 face masks supplied by the firm Ayanda Capital, which now cannot be used in the NHS because of concerns over their fit. The court heard the company was routed through the VIP lane because its representative, Andrew Mills, who had been chasing senior officials for a decision, was an advisor to the government's Board of Trade. Ayanda Capital told the BBC the firm was not aware of the high priority lane and the allegations of ""cronyism"" around Mr Mills were ""unsustainable"". The BBC has been told that his position played no part in the award of the contract. The Good Law Project and EveryDoctor are also challenging the government over its decision to award contracts to a small Sussex-based pest control firm, Pestfix. In February, the BBC revealed that 17 million high grade FFP3 face masks the company had supplied would not be used as intended because they failed testing. Lawyers for the campaigners argued that information about the company's links with government was being kept from them because important details in emails had been blacked out by officials. The government's spending watchdog has previously reported that the firm was put on the VIP lane by mistake. But emails disclosed in court show the company was ""known"" to a senior official in the Department of Health and Social Care via a relative. Pestfix has previously told the BBC it is proud of its role sourcing PPE to meet the shortages in the NHS during the pandemic. A government spokesperson said: ""All PPE procurement went through the same eight-step assurance process and, in conjunction with those checks, due diligence is carried out on every contract and ministers have no involvement in deciding who is awarded them."" Update 4 May 2021: Tim Horlick, chief executive of Ayanda Capital, insisted the masks were ""not unusable or unsafe"" and had met all required standards.

Stranded sailor leaves ship after four years,"Mr Aisha is finally on his way home Mohammed Aisha joined his ""cursed"" ship, the MV Aman, on 5 May 2017. Today, after spending almost four years on board stranded off the Egyptian coast, he was freed and flown home to Syria. So how does he feel? His text, from the aircraft on the tarmac at Cairo airport, was brief. ""Relief. Joy."" And then came a voice message. ""How do I feel? Like I finally got out of prison. I'm finally going to be rejoined with my family. I'm going to see them again."" It marks the end of an ordeal which has taken its toll on Mohammed's physical and mental health. He was, after all, condemned to a life without power, sanitation or company. This video can not be played Mohammed Aisha had been living on an abandoned cargo ship for four years, part of that time completely on his own It began in July 2017, when the MV Aman was detained at the Egyptian port of Adabiya. The cargo ship was held because it had expired safety equipment and classification certificates. It should have been easy enough to resolve, but the ship's Lebanese contractors failed to pay for fuel and the MV Aman's owners in Bahrain were in financial difficulty. With the ship's Egyptian captain ashore, a local court declared Mohammed, the ship's chief officer, the MV Aman's legal guardian. Mohammed, who was born in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartus, says he wasn't told what the order meant and only found out months later, as the ship's other crew members started to leave. The dust-covered bridge of the Aman, a 4,000-tonne container vessel For four years, life - and death - passed Mohammed by. He watched as ships sailed past, in and out of the nearby Suez Canal. During the recent blockage caused by the giant container ship Ever Given, he counted dozens of ships waiting for the traffic jam to ease. He has even seen his brother, a fellow seafarer, sail past more than once. The brothers spoke on the phone but were too far apart even to wave. 'I was blamed for blocking the Suez Canal' How was the Suez Canal ship freed? In August 2018, he learned that his mother, a teacher responsible for his excellent English, had died. That was Mohammed's low point. ""I seriously considered ending my life,"" he told me. By August 2019, Mohammed was alone but for the occasional guard and trapped on a vessel with no diesel and, consequently, no power. He was legally obliged to stay aboard and was unpaid, demoralised and feeling increasingly unwell. He said the ship was like a grave at night. ""You can't see anything. You can't hear anything,"" he said. ""It's like you're in a coffin."" In March 2020, a storm blew the Aman off its anchorage. The ship drifted five miles (8km), eventually running aground a few hundred metres from the shoreline. It was terrifying at the time, but Mohammed thought it was an act of God. Now he was able to swim ashore every few days, buy food and recharge his phone. Astonishing as Mohammed's story is, his experience is not unique. In fact, seafarer abandonment is on the rise. Mohammed had to swim ashore if he needed to get drinking water or buy food According to the International Labour Organization, there are more than 250 active cases around the world where crews are simply left to fend for themselves. It says 85 new cases were reported in 2020, which is twice as many as in the previous year. Meanwhile, at the Iranian port of Assaluyeh, 19 mostly Indian crew members of the bulk carrier Ula are on hunger strike after their vessel was abandoned by its owners in July 2019. A crew member recently told the shipping journal Lloyd's List that the situation on board was ""very critical"", with depression rife and seafarers' families running out of money. ""The first time I came across one of these cases, I was in total shock,"" said Andy Bowerman, Middle East and South Asia director for the Mission to Seafarers. From his base in Dubai, he has seen this happen time and again, usually for the same combination of reasons. ""We're currently working with a case here, where the company have a huge mortgage on the vessel, but their debts are way beyond that. So sometimes it is just easier to tell the crew to drop anchor and to almost literally walk away."" An Egyptian court made Mohammed the Aman's legal custodian The Aman's owners, Tylos Shipping and Marine Services, told the BBC they had tried to help Mohammed but that their hands were tied. ""I can't force a judge to remove the legal guardianship,"" a representative told us. ""And I can't find a single person on this planet - and I've tried - to replace him."" Mohammed, they said, should never have signed the order in the first place. Mohamed Arrachedi of the International Transport Workers Federation, who took up Mohammed's case in December, said this should be a moment for everyone in the shipping industry to reflect. ""The case of Mohammed has to serve to open a serious debate to prevent these abuses to seafarers on ships,"" he told me. The debate, he said, had to involve ship owners, port and maritime authorities and flag states. ""This drama and suffering of Mohammed Aisha could have been avoided if the owners and the parties with responsibilities and obligations to the ship had assumed their responsibilities and arranged his repatriation earlier."" For his part, Mohammed said he felt trapped in a situation not of his making, cornered by Egyptian law and ignored by the ship's owners . He said months would go by without communication - leaving him feeling let down and isolated. It's enough, you might imagine, to make him think twice about going back to sea. But he is determined. He says he is good at his job and wants nothing more than to pick up where he left off. After he's caught up with his family, that is.

Treasury publishes Greensill emails amid lobby rowMore details emerge about the former PM's work for now-failed failed finance firm Greensill Capital.UK Politics,"David Cameron resigned as prime minister in 2016, following the Brexit referendum The Treasury has published 40 pages of messages relating to its contact with David Cameron and Greensill Capital. The former PM is embroiled in a row over attempts to lobby top officials on behalf of the financial firm. It had already come to light thatMr Cameron contacted the chancellor and two other ministers about Greensill. But the emails also revealed former Cabinet SecretarySir Mark Sedwill""connected"" Lex Greensill with the Treasury in March 2020. Other emails and texts - released as a result of a Freedom of Information request - showed contact between senior civil servants in the department and the former PM and financier. They also showed the rejection letters for Greensill's appeal for access to government-backed loans during the pandemic. Earlier, the Bank of England said Mr Cameron had contacted it multiple times last year as the finance firm sought access to a Covid loan scheme. The Treasury's top civil servant, Sir Tom Scholar, also told MPs Mr Cameron had called and texted him on his official phone. But he added that Greensill's proposals were ultimately rejected. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about? Lobbying probe invites Cameron to give evidence Fears for 5,000 steel jobs as lender collapses Three MP-led inquiries and a lawyer-led government review are looking at Mr Cameron's work for the company, which collapsed in March. The former Conservative leader, who began working for Greensill as an adviser two years after leaving Downing Street, has insisted he broke no lobbying rules but accepted he should have contacted ministers using more formal channels. But Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the correspondence showed the firm ""was carrying the begging bowl from the Bank of England to the Treasury and back"". ""We need to understand why Greensill Capital was given so much time and access to the Treasury, and why so much public money was put at risk."" On Wednesday, the Bank of England released details of contacts between Mr Cameron and its officials, in response to Freedom of Information requests. They show the ex-PM contacted Bank officials before and after the firm applied to join a government scheme to support lending to businesses. Alongside the Treasury, the Bank had been running the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), set up in the early stages of the pandemic. Greensill had wanted the terms of the CCFF changed so it could take part - a request the Treasury went on to reject, after concluding the firm's proposals were not suitable. Thepublished correspondence,externalfrom the Bank of England includes email exchanges with Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy governor. In one email from early April, Mr Cameron told Sir Jon that Greensill had ""failed to get anywhere"" with its proposals, despite ""numerous conversations"" with the Treasury. In another email to him later in the month, the ex-PM said Greensill's inability to access the scheme had proved ""incredibly frustrating"". Records show a phone call later took place between Sir Jon and Lex Greensill, the firm's Australian founder, to discuss the firm's ideas further. They show Sir Jon telling Mr Greensill his firm fell outside the ""boundaries of the scheme"" - and changing these would be a decision for the Treasury. The Bank of England was involved in the government's CCFF loans scheme Earlier on Wednesday, Sir Tom - the Treasury's permanent secretary - said Greensill Capital had ""persistently"" approached his department about being involved. Giving evidence to MPs on the the Public Accounts Committee, he added: ""We listened to what they said. We analysed it, we tested it and in the end, despite them submitting a series of successive proposals, we decided to reject them all."" Sir Tom, who previously worked for the former PM as a Europe adviser, told them Mr Cameron had rung him directly in April 2020, although the call did not include ""substantive discussion"" of Greensill's proposals. ""It was simply a call to draw it to my attention,"" he said, adding that Mr Cameron had his work phone number ""because I used to work with him"". Asked if he would have taken a call from a lobbyist if they hadn't been a former prime minister, Sir Tom said: ""I've also from time-to-time had calls from other senior people, maybe private sector people who I've previously worked with in another capacity."" He added: ""I think it's natural when somebody that you know asks to speak to you... it's quite natural to take that."" The second most senior official at the Treasury, Charles Roxburgh, told the committee he had met Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill at nine meetings spread out over four months from March to June 2020. Mr Roxburgh told the committee civil servants would not have consulted on their proposals ""if we didn't think there was some potential - turns out there wasn't"".

Stranded sailor leaves ship after four yearsMohammed Aisha had been living on a ship marooned off Egypt's Red Sea coast for four years.,"Mr Aisha is finally on his way home Mohammed Aisha joined his ""cursed"" ship, the MV Aman, on 5 May 2017. Today, after spending almost four years on board stranded off the Egyptian coast, he was freed and flown home to Syria. So how does he feel? His text, from the aircraft on the tarmac at Cairo airport, was brief. ""Relief. Joy."" And then came a voice message. ""How do I feel? Like I finally got out of prison. I'm finally going to be rejoined with my family. I'm going to see them again."" It marks the end of an ordeal which has taken its toll on Mohammed's physical and mental health. He was, after all, condemned to a life without power, sanitation or company. This video can not be played Mohammed Aisha had been living on an abandoned cargo ship for four years, part of that time completely on his own It began in July 2017, when the MV Aman was detained at the Egyptian port of Adabiya. The cargo ship was held because it had expired safety equipment and classification certificates. It should have been easy enough to resolve, but the ship's Lebanese contractors failed to pay for fuel and the MV Aman's owners in Bahrain were in financial difficulty. With the ship's Egyptian captain ashore, a local court declared Mohammed, the ship's chief officer, the MV Aman's legal guardian. Mohammed, who was born in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartus, says he wasn't told what the order meant and only found out months later, as the ship's other crew members started to leave. The dust-covered bridge of the Aman, a 4,000-tonne container vessel For four years, life - and death - passed Mohammed by. He watched as ships sailed past, in and out of the nearby Suez Canal. During the recent blockage caused by the giant container ship Ever Given, he counted dozens of ships waiting for the traffic jam to ease. He has even seen his brother, a fellow seafarer, sail past more than once. The brothers spoke on the phone but were too far apart even to wave. 'I was blamed for blocking the Suez Canal' How was the Suez Canal ship freed? In August 2018, he learned that his mother, a teacher responsible for his excellent English, had died. That was Mohammed's low point. ""I seriously considered ending my life,"" he told me. By August 2019, Mohammed was alone but for the occasional guard and trapped on a vessel with no diesel and, consequently, no power. He was legally obliged to stay aboard and was unpaid, demoralised and feeling increasingly unwell. He said the ship was like a grave at night. ""You can't see anything. You can't hear anything,"" he said. ""It's like you're in a coffin."" In March 2020, a storm blew the Aman off its anchorage. The ship drifted five miles (8km), eventually running aground a few hundred metres from the shoreline. It was terrifying at the time, but Mohammed thought it was an act of God. Now he was able to swim ashore every few days, buy food and recharge his phone. Astonishing as Mohammed's story is, his experience is not unique. In fact, seafarer abandonment is on the rise. Mohammed had to swim ashore if he needed to get drinking water or buy food According to the International Labour Organization, there are more than 250 active cases around the world where crews are simply left to fend for themselves.

"Welsh pubs and restaurants to open indoors in MayPubs will be able open indoors for the first time since Christmas, under plans to ease lockdown.Wales","Having an alcoholic drink inside pubs and restaurants in Wales has been banned since 4 December People in Wales will be able to have a drink inside a pub or restaurant for the first time in more than than five months from 17 May. All tourist accommodation, indoor entertainment and attractions in Wales are also set to reopen that day, in time for the Spring bank holiday. Indoor children's activities and groups of up to 15 adults, like gym classes, have been brought forward to 3 May. First Minister Mark Drakeford described it as a ""major reopening of Wales"". He said the relaxation of a number of lockdown rules had been moved forward because of falling Covid rates. Lockdown rules are changing again - what's happening? 'Let pubs reopen to control drinking' Opening pubs too soon 'may undo all the good' It is the first time a proposed date has been given for the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors in Wales. It comes after the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for the industry to be allowed to resume indoor trade on that date - the same as that proposed in England. Opposition parties accused Mr Drakeford, the leader of Welsh Labour, of electioneering by changing Covid rules during the Welsh Parliament election campaign. Mr Drakeford disagreed, saying the move was only because Wales' Covid case rate had fallen to the UK's lowest. ""The virus doesn't know there is an election on, and I don't think it would have been right not to have given those indications,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. The latest restriction easing comes after previous announcements thatany six people can meet outdoors in Walesfrom Saturday, and dates for gyms and swimming pools being moved forward by two weeks to 3 May. This video can not be played It is the first time a proposed date has been given for the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors in Wales Mr Drakeford has also confirmed outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants, will be allowed to reopen on Monday - alongside outdoor attractions, organised outdoor activities and wedding receptions or funeral services for up to 30 people outdoors. Two people will also be allowed to visit their loved ones in care homes from Monday. Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can also reopen,externalfrom 3 May, while people can once again form extended households, allowing two households to bubble up and have contact indoors. By the time indoor hospitality reopens on 17 May, Mr Drakeford anticipates being able to increase the number of people who can attend organised activities, such as wedding receptions, to 30 indoors and 50 outdoors, from the same date. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage People in Wales haven't been allowed to buy an alcoholic drink inside a pub or restaurant in Wales since 4 December. So allowing people to do so from 17 May would be similar to the plan in England and Scotland - with up to four people from up to four different households in Wales allowed to meet. Although, Scotland will be thefirst in the UK to open its cafes, pubs and restaurants indoorsfrom Monday - but no alcohol can be served. People in England can already visit the pub or have a meal in a restaurant outside - thatcould extend to inside from 17 May. Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants can welcome customers outdoors in Northern Ireland from 30 April, with restrictions, while people may be allowed to socialise inside from 24 May at the earliest, depending on Covid case rates. Happier times for cafÃ© owner Sara Bailey - when customers could order inside It has been a long time coming for Treorchy cafe owner Sara Bailey. Hot Gossip, like so many other catering businesses in Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been shut for four months. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many have had a Covid vaccine in Wales? ""It seems that things are going well at the moment with Covid cases, so it is time to give us a date to reopen,"" she said. Without any outdoor seating, Sara Bailey is desperate to open inside her Treorchy cafÃ© For restaurateur Nataniel Martinez, who runs Le Monde in Cardiff and Penarth's Old Customs House, reopening is a large-scale operation. ""The opening of indoor hospitality for us means we can bring back about 120 staff into work,"" he said. ""The demand for indoor dining is massive, so we are really looking forward now to getting back to it and reopening all the restaurants."" Restaurateur Nataniel Martinez says opening indoors is vital to his businesses Rhian Davies, owner of the Crown and Sceptre pubÂ in Cadoxton in Neath Port Talbot, said there was a ""lot of preparation to do"" before reopening - but added the industry was used to it after months of safety measures last year. She said she accepted closures had been needed: ""I wanted to help the hard working staff of our hospitals and health service... and was happy to do my bit to stop Covid spreading."" The announcement has been warmly welcomed by UKHospitality, the trade body representing the hospitality sector in Wales. ""We have led the calls for earlier reopening and have been advising, consulting and negotiating on the need to help protect jobs and businesses - and the public,"" said Dave Chapman, its director for Wales. He said the announcement ""offers clarity and commercial hope, and reflects positively the medical evidence"". Wales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK when the Welsh governmentbanned sale of alcohol on the premisesof pubs and restaurants on 4 December. Then came the pre-Christmas lockdown, shutting all restaurants, pubs and shops, as Wales reported more than 3,000 Covid cases in a day and that theWelsh NHS was struggling to cope. Now, Wales has thelowest Covid case rate in the UK- around 15 cases per 100,000 people - with, compared to other UK nations, thehighest percentage of its populationvaccinated. The number of Covid patients in hospitals in Wales has also dropped to its lowest level. While there now appears to be a broad consensus on hospitality restrictions, both the Tories and Plaid Cymru have said Mr Drakeford should not be using the televised address for announcements easing restrictions. The Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh Labour leader of ""naked electioneering"" while Plaid Cymru said it was ""completely inappropriate"" for the press conference to be used like this. Plaid leader Adam Price, said: ""A Plaid Cymru government would plan for the reopening of indoor hospitality, tourist accommodation, cinemas and other entertainment venues on 17 May. ""To put businesses on the best possible footing our first steps in office include providing start up grants for hospitality businesses. ""Additional financial support would also be backdated to 26 April for those businesses that cannot viably trade on the basis of outdoor opening alone."" BASICS:Simple guide to the Senedd election POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for? FIRST TIME:Will 16-year-olds vote? Welcoming the announcement Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said it was ""great news"". She said: ""As a nation we must all work together to ensure the vaccination programme continues and that the lockdowns and closures we've been through never need to return."" Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said:  ""Labour had ample opportunity to bring forward a roadmap out of lockdown, but refused to do so. ""Thanks to the UK's great vaccination story much more detail could have been announced prior to the election period... but Labour chose to play politics instead of adopting the Welsh Conservative roadmap."" Mark Reckless, from the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, said: ""This is getting to the point of testing election rules to breaking point. ""The Labour leader is using his platform as first minister to make political announcements during an election campaign.""

"As it happened: New US emissions target hailed a âgame changerâThe US hosts a meeting with 40 world leaders, aiming to re-assert its leadership on climate change.Science & Environment","The US has unveiled an updated carbon pledge that will see its emissions nearly halved by 2030 President Joe Biden will host 40 leaders at a virtual summit in the White House to raise ambition on tackling climate change The meeting will aim to re-assert US global leadership in the area after President Trump pulled the country out of the Paris agreement President Biden has made the climate a key focus for his administration, re-joining the Paris agreement on his first day in office Ahead of the meeting, officials urged greater ambition, particularly among countries perceived as ""laggards"" on climate The leaders of China, the UK, India, Canada, France, Germany, South Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Russia are all attending Observers have been closely watching China - the world's top emitter - for any commitments it might make at the meeting Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs, Mark Kinver, Marianna Brady, Sam Cabral and Holly Honderich Day One of the White House's Earth Day climate summit has now ended. Over six sessions, we heard from leaders, officials and activists from more than 40 countries, including top officials in the Biden administration. Day Two takes place tomorrow, with two final sessions. Thanks for following our reporting and analysis. Live coverage was brought to you by Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral, and edited by Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs and Mark Kinver. The BBC's Outside Source programme asked three young climate activists about their thoughts on the Leaders Summit. Here's what they said. Daisy Jeffrey in Australia -  part of âFridayâs for Futureâ campaign âI would hope to see significantly more pressure put on Australia by this US presidential administration than the last. âI hope that this summit will see the Australian government bow to political pressure, because at the moment instead of looking to invest in renewables and a renewable future this government is investing in gas and saying that gas is the way forward and that is simply an inaccurate and quite backwards way of thinking. âWeâre tackling climate change abysmally.â Melissa Kowara in Indonesia  - a member of Extinction Rebellion Indonesia âFirst of all they have to declare that we have an emergency to begin with, because the level of awareness and the climate literacy is still so slow and this declaration will work as a mandate to all the ministries, all the private entity and the civil society to actually act together. âWhat I really want to see is that countries around the world start really looking into tackling the climate crisis issue directly at its roots.â Thandile Chinyavanhu in South Africa â part of Greenpeace Africa âItâs very important that our government takes action and deviates away from our fossil fuel addiction. âI donât believe South Africaâs ambitions are ambitious enough.â Critics of climate change proposals often question whether climate advocates are willing to make eco-friendly changes to their personal lives. Will you stop eating meat? Will you stop riding on airplanes? Will you take shorter baths? With an Earth Day climate summit hosted by the White House in full swing, those critics turned their eyes to national climate advisor Gina McCarthy and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, for their choice of transportation to attend an event touting electric vehicles.

There has been plenty of reaction coming in to the announcements at the Leaders Summit. Here's a selection of the comments from environmental campaign groups. Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said:âWe need more ambitious commitments from the big emitters and more binding plans on climate finance, fossil fuel phase outs, and nature restoration which match the urgency of the crisis we face.â Melita Steele, programme director of Greenpeace Africa, commented:âAfrican leaders must do more than just be at the table of biodiversity and climate summits. ""We need them to be serious about tackling emissions at home and unequivocal about protecting their countryâs natural biodiversity in order to tackle a climate crisis which has the continent seeing worse and worse extreme weather impacts every year.â Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said: â[Canadaâs] new target is not aligned with a 1.5C compatible future - that would require a 60% emissions reduction goal. âWe hope to see Canada continue to ramp up ambition, both in future years and as NDC consultations occur in coming months on the road to [the COP26 climate meeting in] Glasgow.â Abby Maxman, chief executive of Oxfam America, described President Bidenâs announcement as a âstep in the right directionâ but added that more action was needed. âThe richest 1% of the worldâs population are responsible for more than twice as much carbon pollution as the 3.1 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity,"" she said. âAs the worldâs richest country and largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the US owes it to the world's most vulnerable to increase its emissions reductions target in order to prevent additional climate change impacts.""  In a separate breakout session, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is leading officials from around the world in a discussion of nature-based solutions to reduce emissions and strengthen climate resilience. Nature-based efforts have been proposed around the world to combat climate change, by reducing deforestation and the loss of wetlands, restoring marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history, has made restorative justice a key aspect of her climate change goals. She is moderating a panel that includes environmental ministers from Canada, Costa Rica, Gabon, Indonesia, Peru and the Seychelles, as well as two indigenous activists. The Biden administration has indicated that climate change will be a key plank of its foreign policy. His director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, and ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield both argue it requires a diplomatic, economic and militaristic effort, what administration officials refer to as ""a whole-of-government effort"". They note the Pentagon has already designated climate change as a national security threat and as a threat multiplier. In the US, the past year has seen wildfires in California, hurricanes in Louisiana and blackouts in Texas, says Thomas-Greenfield, while the world has seen monsoons, droughts and other disasters. ""It doesn't matter where you live. Climate change is a challenge for every person, in every country,"" she says. Only ""a multilateral toolkit"" can ensure that countries and people do not fight over scare resources as the world gets warmer, she says. Thomas-Greenfield says real global cooperation can instead bring ""shared economic opportunity"". Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is now leading a session on how the climate crisis poses a threat to energy, economic and national security. ""Few things deserve to be called existential, but the climate crisis is existential,"" he says, detailing problems caused by coastal erosion, natural disasters and other impacts of global warming. He notes that the US intelligence community under President Biden is undertaking comprehensive climate assessments, which it had not done before. He points out the UK's intelligence assessments of climate security have ""raised the bar"" on how to do these evaluations. Austin is joined by director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and defence officials from six different countries. Nick BeakeEurope Correspondent Pope Francis has just added his voice. In a video
recorded in the Vatican, he warned that the climate crisis will take on an even
greater significance in the post-pandemic world. Leaders must do more to
protect the gift of nature, he stressed. In another message, to mark Earth Day
â an annual event calling for greater protection of the environment â Francis
said Covid-19 had proved the global community could work together to tackle a
catastrophic threat. But the head of the Catholic Church said if leaders were
not courageous and truthful in their efforts to combat climate change, the
result would be self-destruction. When then-President Trump visited Rome in
2017, Francis brought up in conversation the race to save the planet. But
just a week later Trump announced America was to withdraw from the Paris
climate agreement. However, the new incumbent in the White House, a proud
Catholic, appears much more on the Popeâs wavelength. Michael Regan, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is steering an all-female panel of American mayors, global and Indigenous leaders focused on ground-up solutions in their communities. The women gathered today are a ""testament to how women around the world are raising the mantle of climate leadership, developing sustainable solutions"", Regan says. Introducing Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim of the Indigenous Women and Peoples Association of Chad, Regan notes that the world's Indigenous people make up only about 5% of the global population but effectively protect about 80% of global biodiversity. ""How we can lead in harmony with nature?"" Ibrahim says. ""Without Indigenous peoples there is no way."" She says developed countries must now follow the leadership of Indigenous communities in taking climate action. For us, she says, ""protection of nature it is not a policy, it is our way of life"". Asha Karim survived a narrow escape from the 2020California wildfires. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? While of course I wish we'd done more earlier, I think it's never too late to act. Any reduction in harm to the planet is worthwhile. We got here by largely ignoring the problem, so to decide that it's now too late to do anything, that ignorance somehow freed us from responsibility strikes me as selfish and silly. Climate change is a series of positive feedback loops that will keep building upon one another, even more rapidly if we don't change course. Will politics get in the way? It is politicised, in that there is lot of vested financial interest in maintaining the status quo. That financial power is very present in American politics, and we see it reflected in subsidies and lax regulation in many of the industries that heavily contribute to our emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I hope we can lead the way to a much higher standard than we see globally today. I think that committing to the level of action we see elsewhere is a step in the right direction, but far from enough. Being that it is a politicised problem, it may take a while to make change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? What do you hope the US government will do first? I think the American people are onboard with the plan. Climate change has become difficult to ignore. More intense storms, fire seasons, shifts in weather patterns impacting local wildlife - there is some effect of climate change that has touched every person's life in some way. I think most Americans would like to see the US take this problem seriously. As for what we should do first, cutting subsidies for meat and dairy production and reducing our dependence on coal would be impactful places to start. Today's climate summit has a lot of important people making a lot of big promises to combat climate change - carbon caps, finance adaptation, and international cooperation. But let's go back to square one - what even is climate change? The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past. There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. Read more about the basics of climate change. Kim Cobb is a climate scientist. She works at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? This is exactly what we need to get back on track. It is absolutely reflecting a high level of ambition. It's roughly in line with science based targets to keep warming to a minimum this century. We really have an army of amazing folks working on this in DC right now. The winds are at our back in this particular moment. With every American talking about jobs, talking about public health benefits in our low carbon future, this is language that resonates. And I think that there's a way to craft this policy to make sure that there's equity for all and economic benefits for all along the way. I'm just inspired to try to do what I can to go as far as we can, as best as we can. Will politics get in the way? Obviously, getting anything through Congress right now is not a slam dunk, to put it mildly. And I think the devil is going to be in the details as to exactly how this policy is crafted to appeal across the aisle. I have confidence that this administration is bringing people who have worked on policies successfully before. So I think everything we're hearing right now is really aligned towards success. But the next months are going to be absolutely crucial. What do you hope the US government will do first? How are we going to make sure that communities that are deeply invested in fossil fuel infrastructure are not left out of the economic winds in our low carbon future? These kinds of issues are going to be important in terms of building that coalition. At the same time, you have to address the long standing voices who have brought this kind of target forward, such as the youth voices and the people who have focused on environmental justice. Around the world, there are teams of people who are working to track down and destroy hidden sources of greenhouse gases - stopping them from harming the planet. Some of the gases, which are used in refrigeration, have many times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. The BBC's Tom Heap meets some of the people part working to stop these gases causing damage to the planet. Read about the best climate solution you haven't heard of. Victoria Coles is an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? It is never too little too late! As the administrationâs proposed infrastructure plan notes, we already need to spend billions on mitigating climate impacts to build resilience for roads, airports, ports and other infrastructure. That doesn't include the billions from climate and weather-related losses since 1980. Those costs of prior inaction should be front and center when we think about the expense of reducing emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I am a scientist, not a policy expert. However, I think that legislative rather than executive action is required to stabilise US climate policy from changes in administration. I hope that the American Jobs Plan retains its aggressive investment in climate related action and that, at a minimum, some form of climate legislation can make it through congress. In my view, this, coupled with action rather than discussion, will be needed to convince global leaders that America is serious about climate change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? TheYale climate opinion maps,externaldemonstrate clearly that the majority of Americans support climate policies such as carbon taxes and tax rebates for electric vehicles. The only question in their survey that was not over 50% pro-climate was ""the percentage of adults who think global warming will harm them personally"". Americans worry about climate, they view it as harmful to plants, animals, developing countries and other Americans. But until they view it as an existential threat to their own families, they may not vote for candidates that recognise the climate crisis as a threat to global and national interests. Reality Check At the climate summit, leaders sought to outbid each other with their pledges on cutting carbon emissions over the next decade. The numbers can be confusing, so letâs try to make sense of them. The US pledged to cut carbon emissions by around 50% (from 2005 levels) by 2030. The UK announced a ""world-leading"" target to cut emissions by 78% (from 1990 levels) by 2035, having previously committed to 68% by 2030. Other countries such as Canada have also increased their commitments. Different countries use different years as the starting point for comparison, usually from when their emissions peaked â partly to show their pledges in the best light. For example, the US compares their 2030 target to 2005 levels, and the UK uses 1990 levels - about the time when emissions peaked in their respective countries. However, by either comparison point, the UKâs 2030 target is the most ambitious. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joined other world leaders in today's summit as part of a special session of climate finance. Ardern urged other countries to follow New Zealand's lead in pricing carbon, ending subsidies for fossil fuels and finance environmental adaption. And for Ardern - calling in some 14,000 km from the summit's host - the appearance meant a rather inconvenient call time. On Instagram, the prime minister noted she had a 02:00am local call time for the international meeting. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

French President Emmanuel Macron urges world to 'move more quickly' in tackling climate change. John Kerry, US President Joe Biden's Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, has led a roundtable of global financial leaders - all making their own commitments to tackle the climate crisis. David Malpass, President of the World Bank Group, promised record spending ""in the way that gets the most done"". ""The core of the plan is to spend more,"" he said - focused on flattening carbon emissions from the world's biggest emitters. Malpass also acknowledged what he called the ""severity and the inequality of the current environment"" - noting that poverty, inequality and climate change are linked and require a comprehensive, inclusive solution. Chief executive of Citigroup, Jane Fraser, followed shortly after, repeating the corporation's March commitment to be net zero in carbon emissions by 2050. ""Net zero is easy to say, but very hard to do,"" Fraser said. Kerry thanked her for the support but said that reaching net zero - a formidable challenge - will still not be enough. ""Even if we get to net zero, we still have to get carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,"" he said. ""This is a bigger challenge than a lot of people have grabbed on to yet."" Greta Thunberg is now speaking about the emotional toll of the climate fight on young people. She is pressed on the issue by California Democrat Katie Porter, who says her nine-year-old child told her: ""The Earth is burning and we're all going to die."" Thunberg says it's ""understandable"" that younger generations might be saddened or angry by global warming and political inaction. ""It would be strange if we didn't feel that way because then we wouldn't have any empathy."" ""But there is still much hope and, if we choose to take action and act together, there's unlimited things that we can do."" She adds that her experience taught her that ""the best medication against anger and anxiety is to take action yourself"". The hearing on fossil fuel subsidies now comes to an end. Greta Thunberg tells the US House Environment Subcommittee that, in her conversations, she found a lot of readiness for climate action. ""People are actually more open for change than we realise,"" she says. To those who depend on the fossil fuel industry for jobs and livelihoods, she says: ""Who can blame them?"" People working within the industry ""cannot be left behind,"" she adds. Pointing out that climate issues are not the fault of those people, Thunberg notes that climate advocates would prefer to work with the industry than against or without it. ""Climate justice is social justice. We can't achieve climate justice without social justice,"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Emails reveal Cameron's lobbying of Bank of England,"David Cameron resigned as prime minister in 2016, following the Brexit referendum The Treasury has published 40 pages of messages relating to its contact with David Cameron and Greensill Capital. The former PM is embroiled in a row over attempts to lobby top officials on behalf of the financial firm. It had already come to light thatMr Cameron contacted the chancellor and two other ministers about Greensill. But the emails also revealed former Cabinet SecretarySir Mark Sedwill""connected"" Lex Greensill with the Treasury in March 2020. Other emails and texts - released as a result of a Freedom of Information request - showed contact between senior civil servants in the department and the former PM and financier. They also showed the rejection letters for Greensill's appeal for access to government-backed loans during the pandemic. Earlier, the Bank of England said Mr Cameron had contacted it multiple times last year as the finance firm sought access to a Covid loan scheme. The Treasury's top civil servant, Sir Tom Scholar, also told MPs Mr Cameron had called and texted him on his official phone. But he added that Greensill's proposals were ultimately rejected. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about? Lobbying probe invites Cameron to give evidence Fears for 5,000 steel jobs as lender collapses Three MP-led inquiries and a lawyer-led government review are looking at Mr Cameron's work for the company, which collapsed in March. The former Conservative leader, who began working for Greensill as an adviser two years after leaving Downing Street, has insisted he broke no lobbying rules but accepted he should have contacted ministers using more formal channels. But Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the correspondence showed the firm ""was carrying the begging bowl from the Bank of England to the Treasury and back"". ""We need to understand why Greensill Capital was given so much time and access to the Treasury, and why so much public money was put at risk."" On Wednesday, the Bank of England released details of contacts between Mr Cameron and its officials, in response to Freedom of Information requests. They show the ex-PM contacted Bank officials before and after the firm applied to join a government scheme to support lending to businesses. Alongside the Treasury, the Bank had been running the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), set up in the early stages of the pandemic. Greensill had wanted the terms of the CCFF changed so it could take part - a request the Treasury went on to reject, after concluding the firm's proposals were not suitable. Thepublished correspondence,externalfrom the Bank of England includes email exchanges with Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy governor. In one email from early April, Mr Cameron told Sir Jon that Greensill had ""failed to get anywhere"" with its proposals, despite ""numerous conversations"" with the Treasury. In another email to him later in the month, the ex-PM said Greensill's inability to access the scheme had proved ""incredibly frustrating"". Records show a phone call later took place between Sir Jon and Lex Greensill, the firm's Australian founder, to discuss the firm's ideas further. They show Sir Jon telling Mr Greensill his firm fell outside the ""boundaries of the scheme"" - and changing these would be a decision for the Treasury. The Bank of England was involved in the government's CCFF loans scheme Earlier on Wednesday, Sir Tom - the Treasury's permanent secretary - said Greensill Capital had ""persistently"" approached his department about being involved. Giving evidence to MPs on the the Public Accounts Committee, he added: ""We listened to what they said. We analysed it, we tested it and in the end, despite them submitting a series of successive proposals, we decided to reject them all."" Sir Tom, who previously worked for the former PM as a Europe adviser, told them Mr Cameron had rung him directly in April 2020, although the call did not include ""substantive discussion"" of Greensill's proposals. ""It was simply a call to draw it to my attention,"" he said, adding that Mr Cameron had his work phone number ""because I used to work with him"". Asked if he would have taken a call from a lobbyist if they hadn't been a former prime minister, Sir Tom said: ""I've also from time-to-time had calls from other senior people, maybe private sector people who I've previously worked with in another capacity."" He added: ""I think it's natural when somebody that you know asks to speak to you... it's quite natural to take that."" The second most senior official at the Treasury, Charles Roxburgh, told the committee he had met Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill at nine meetings spread out over four months from March to June 2020. Mr Roxburgh told the committee civil servants would not have consulted on their proposals ""if we didn't think there was some potential - turns out there wasn't"".

As it happened: New US emissions target hailed a âgame changerâ,"The US has unveiled an updated carbon pledge that will see its emissions nearly halved by 2030 President Joe Biden will host 40 leaders at a virtual summit in the White House to raise ambition on tackling climate change The meeting will aim to re-assert US global leadership in the area after President Trump pulled the country out of the Paris agreement President Biden has made the climate a key focus for his administration, re-joining the Paris agreement on his first day in office Ahead of the meeting, officials urged greater ambition, particularly among countries perceived as ""laggards"" on climate The leaders of China, the UK, India, Canada, France, Germany, South Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Russia are all attending Observers have been closely watching China - the world's top emitter - for any commitments it might make at the meeting Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs, Mark Kinver, Marianna Brady, Sam Cabral and Holly Honderich Day One of the White House's Earth Day climate summit has now ended. Over six sessions, we heard from leaders, officials and activists from more than 40 countries, including top officials in the Biden administration. Day Two takes place tomorrow, with two final sessions. Thanks for following our reporting and analysis. Live coverage was brought to you by Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral, and edited by Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs and Mark Kinver. The BBC's Outside Source programme asked three young climate activists about their thoughts on the Leaders Summit. Here's what they said. Daisy Jeffrey in Australia -  part of âFridayâs for Futureâ campaign âI would hope to see significantly more pressure put on Australia by this US presidential administration than the last. âI hope that this summit will see the Australian government bow to political pressure, because at the moment instead of looking to invest in renewables and a renewable future this government is investing in gas and saying that gas is the way forward and that is simply an inaccurate and quite backwards way of thinking. âWeâre tackling climate change abysmally.â Melissa Kowara in Indonesia  - a member of Extinction Rebellion Indonesia âFirst of all they have to declare that we have an emergency to begin with, because the level of awareness and the climate literacy is still so slow and this declaration will work as a mandate to all the ministries, all the private entity and the civil society to actually act together. âWhat I really want to see is that countries around the world start really looking into tackling the climate crisis issue directly at its roots.â Thandile Chinyavanhu in South Africa â part of Greenpeace Africa âItâs very important that our government takes action and deviates away from our fossil fuel addiction. âI donât believe South Africaâs ambitions are ambitious enough.â Critics of climate change proposals often question whether climate advocates are willing to make eco-friendly changes to their personal lives. Will you stop eating meat? Will you stop riding on airplanes? Will you take shorter baths? With an Earth Day climate summit hosted by the White House in full swing, those critics turned their eyes to national climate advisor Gina McCarthy and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, for their choice of transportation to attend an event touting electric vehicles. Buttigieg has made a show of riding to his meetings on a bicycle, but was also recently pictured taking that bike off the back of an SUV parked a few blocks away. Allow Twitter content?

And I think that there's a way to craft this policy to make sure that there's equity for all and economic benefits for all along the way. I'm just inspired to try to do what I can to go as far as we can, as best as we can. Will politics get in the way? Obviously, getting anything through Congress right now is not a slam dunk, to put it mildly. And I think the devil is going to be in the details as to exactly how this policy is crafted to appeal across the aisle. I have confidence that this administration is bringing people who have worked on policies successfully before. So I think everything we're hearing right now is really aligned towards success. But the next months are going to be absolutely crucial. What do you hope the US government will do first? How are we going to make sure that communities that are deeply invested in fossil fuel infrastructure are not left out of the economic winds in our low carbon future? These kinds of issues are going to be important in terms of building that coalition. At the same time, you have to address the long standing voices who have brought this kind of target forward, such as the youth voices and the people who have focused on environmental justice. Around the world, there are teams of people who are working to track down and destroy hidden sources of greenhouse gases - stopping them from harming the planet. Some of the gases, which are used in refrigeration, have many times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. The BBC's Tom Heap meets some of the people part working to stop these gases causing damage to the planet. Read about the best climate solution you haven't heard of. Victoria Coles is an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? It is never too little too late! As the administrationâs proposed infrastructure plan notes, we already need to spend billions on mitigating climate impacts to build resilience for roads, airports, ports and other infrastructure. That doesn't include the billions from climate and weather-related losses since 1980. Those costs of prior inaction should be front and center when we think about the expense of reducing emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I am a scientist, not a policy expert. However, I think that legislative rather than executive action is required to stabilise US climate policy from changes in administration. I hope that the American Jobs Plan retains its aggressive investment in climate related action and that, at a minimum, some form of climate legislation can make it through congress. In my view, this, coupled with action rather than discussion, will be needed to convince global leaders that America is serious about climate change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? TheYale climate opinion maps,externaldemonstrate clearly that the majority of Americans support climate policies such as carbon taxes and tax rebates for electric vehicles. The only question in their survey that was not over 50% pro-climate was ""the percentage of adults who think global warming will harm them personally"". Americans worry about climate, they view it as harmful to plants, animals, developing countries and other Americans. But until they view it as an existential threat to their own families, they may not vote for candidates that recognise the climate crisis as a threat to global and national interests. Reality Check At the climate summit, leaders sought to outbid each other with their pledges on cutting carbon emissions over the next decade. The numbers can be confusing, so letâs try to make sense of them. The US pledged to cut carbon emissions by around 50% (from 2005 levels) by 2030. The UK announced a ""world-leading"" target to cut emissions by 78% (from 1990 levels) by 2035, having previously committed to 68% by 2030. Other countries such as Canada have also increased their commitments. Different countries use different years as the starting point for comparison, usually from when their emissions peaked â partly to show their pledges in the best light. For example, the US compares their 2030 target to 2005 levels, and the UK uses 1990 levels - about the time when emissions peaked in their respective countries. However, by either comparison point, the UKâs 2030 target is the most ambitious. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joined other world leaders in today's summit as part of a special session of climate finance. Ardern urged other countries to follow New Zealand's lead in pricing carbon, ending subsidies for fossil fuels and finance environmental adaption. And for Ardern - calling in some 14,000 km from the summit's host - the appearance meant a rather inconvenient call time. On Instagram, the prime minister noted she had a 02:00am local call time for the international meeting. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

French President Emmanuel Macron urges world to 'move more quickly' in tackling climate change. John Kerry, US President Joe Biden's Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, has led a roundtable of global financial leaders - all making their own commitments to tackle the climate crisis. David Malpass, President of the World Bank Group, promised record spending ""in the way that gets the most done"". ""The core of the plan is to spend more,"" he said - focused on flattening carbon emissions from the world's biggest emitters. Malpass also acknowledged what he called the ""severity and the inequality of the current environment"" - noting that poverty, inequality and climate change are linked and require a comprehensive, inclusive solution. Chief executive of Citigroup, Jane Fraser, followed shortly after, repeating the corporation's March commitment to be net zero in carbon emissions by 2050. ""Net zero is easy to say, but very hard to do,"" Fraser said. Kerry thanked her for the support but said that reaching net zero - a formidable challenge - will still not be enough. ""Even if we get to net zero, we still have to get carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,"" he said. ""This is a bigger challenge than a lot of people have grabbed on to yet."" Greta Thunberg is now speaking about the emotional toll of the climate fight on young people. She is pressed on the issue by California Democrat Katie Porter, who says her nine-year-old child told her: ""The Earth is burning and we're all going to die."" Thunberg says it's ""understandable"" that younger generations might be saddened or angry by global warming and political inaction. ""It would be strange if we didn't feel that way because then we wouldn't have any empathy."" ""But there is still much hope and, if we choose to take action and act together, there's unlimited things that we can do."" She adds that her experience taught her that ""the best medication against anger and anxiety is to take action yourself"". The hearing on fossil fuel subsidies now comes to an end. Greta Thunberg tells the US House Environment Subcommittee that, in her conversations, she found a lot of readiness for climate action. ""People are actually more open for change than we realise,"" she says. To those who depend on the fossil fuel industry for jobs and livelihoods, she says: ""Who can blame them?"" People working within the industry ""cannot be left behind,"" she adds. Pointing out that climate issues are not the fault of those people, Thunberg notes that climate advocates would prefer to work with the industry than against or without it. ""Climate justice is social justice. We can't achieve climate justice without social justice,"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

PM 'deeply troubled' over war graves racism,"Boris Johnson said he is ""deeply troubled"" by failures to properly commemorate black and Asian troops who died fighting for the British Empire during World War One. Some troops were commemorated collectively or their names were recorded in registers, while their white counterparts had headstones. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologised in the Commons aftera report,externalblamed ""pervasive racism"". Mr Wallace pledged to ""take action"". The prime minister offered an ""unreserved apology"" over the findings of the review by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. ""Our shared duty is to honour and remember all those, wherever they lived and whatever their background, who laid down their lives for our freedoms at the moment of greatest peril,"" he said. Mr Wallace expressed ""deep regret"" in the House of Commons, as he told MPs there was ""no doubt"" prejudice had played a part in what happened after WWI. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologises: ""There can be no doubt prejudice played a part in some of the commission's decisions"" The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which is tasked with commemorating those who died in the two world wars, has also apologised over its findings. Labour MP David Lammy, who was critical to bringing the matter to light, called it a ""watershed moment"". The African soldiers dragged into Europe's war Marking the memories of a million service personnel Mr Wallace said: ""On behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government both of the time and today, I want to apologise for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation. ""Whilst we can't change the past, we can make amends and take action,"" he said. He said there were cases where the commission ""deliberately overlooked evidence"" that would have allowed it to find the names of the dead. And he said there were examples of officials employing an ""overarching imperial ideology connected to racial and religious differences"" in order to ""divide the dead and treat them unequally in ways that were impossible in Europe"". Outlining the next steps, Mr Wallace said the Commonwealth War Graves Commission will: search in the historical record for inequalities in commemoration and act on what is found renew its commitment to equality in commemoration by building physical or digital commemorative structures use its online presence and wider education activities to reach out to all the communities of the former British Empire touched by the two world wars to make sure their hidden history is brought to life and, over the next six months, assemble a global and diverse community of experts to help make this happen Mr Wallace also announced a public consultation over plans to waive the visa fee for service personnel from the Commonwealth and Nepal who choose to settle in the UK in order to honour their contribution. An inquiry by the commission was set up following a 2019 Channel 4 documentary, calledUnremembered,external, which was presented by Mr Lammy. The report found that at least 116,000 casualties from WW1, most of whom were of African, Indian or Egyptian origin, ""were not commemorated by name or possibly not commemorated at all"". But that figure could be as high as 350,000, it said. It also cited racist comments such as the governor of a British colony saying in 1923 that: ""The average native... would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" This video can not be played David Matthews tells the story of his great-uncle who fought in World War One Shadow justice secretary Mr Lammy told the BBC that while making the documentary in Kenya and Tanzania, he discovered mass graves in which Africans had been ""dumped with no commemoration whatsoever"". He said it was a travesty that men who served the British Empire were not commemorated properly, but welcomed the report. ""I'm just really, really pleased that the dignity that these men deserved - who were dragged from their villages and commandeered to work for the British Empire - that dignity that they deserve in death can be granted to them,"" he said. Mr Lammy added that work must be done to find their names in archives where that is possible, and to establish how local communities would like them to be commemorated. He also said Commonwealth soldiers should not be ""whitewashed"" out of history books, while Mr Wallace said it was a ""deep regret"" that his own WW1 education had included ""very little about the contribution from the Commonwealth countries and the wider at the time British Empire"". This video can not be played David Olusoga: ""It's another organisation that's had to be dragged into admitting its history."" Historian Prof David Olusoga, whose TV company produced Unremembered, told BBC Breakfast that apologies were not enough and resources would need to be committed if the commission was serious about restorative justice. ""If the Commonwealth War Graves Commission had set up a committee and discovered that 100,000 white British soldiers lay in mass graves - unmarked, uncommemorated - and the documentation proved that that had been deliberate, what would they do?"" he said. Six million soldiers from the British Empire served in WW1. Between 45,000 and 54,000 Asian and African personnel who died in the conflict were ""commemorated unequally"", the commission said. World War One was the first truly global war, fought not just in the trenches of France but in the Middle East, Asia and Africa Britain's colonies sent millions of men to fight for the empire during the conflict India, which at that time included Pakistan and Bangladesh, sent the most soldiers - more than 1.4 million The British Army in East Africa was mainly composed of African soldiers by November 1918, according to the Imperial War Museum At least 180,000 Africans served in the Carrier Corps in East Africa and provided logistic support to troops at the front Around 15,000 people from the West Indies enlisted in WW1, including 10,000 from Jamaica, according to the National Army Museum Colonies as far away as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) also sent a similar number between them Britain had soldiers from six different continents: Europe, North America, South America, Australasia, Asia and Africa The report concluded that the failure to properly commemorate the individuals was influenced by a scarcity of information, errors inherited from other organisations and the opinions of colonial administrators. ""Underpinning all these decisions, however, were the entrenched prejudices, preconceptions and pervasive racism of contemporary imperial attitudes,"" it added. The report picked out an example from 1923 when the governor of the Gold Coast colony, now Ghana, argued for collective memorials rather than individual ones. At a meeting in London, it was said that the governor, F G Guggisberg, said: ""The average native of the Gold Coast would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" In response, commission employee Arthur Browne said: ""In perhaps two or three hundred years' time, when the native population had reached a higher stage of civilisation, they might then be glad to see that headstones had been erected on the native graves and that the native soldiers had received precisely the same treatment as their white comrades."" The report said Mr Browne's response showed ""what he may have considered foresight, but one that was explicitly framed by contemporary racial prejudice"". The commission, which was founded in 1917 as the Imperial War Graves Commission, said the events of a century ago were wrong then and were wrong now. Its director general, Claire Horton, said: ""We recognise the wrongs of the past and are deeply sorry and will be acting immediately to correct them."" As part of the commission's work to search for unnamed war dead and those who are potentially not commemorated, it will also look at those who died in World War Two, although it is not thought that inequalities seen in WW1 were as widespread then. Ms Horton said the report was ""sober"" reading but gave the commission the ability - ""now that we know the numbers and the areas to look"" - to start the searches properly to ""right the wrongs of the past"". The war graves commission was founded with a remit to remember every individual who had died in World War One, regardless of rank, class, religion or race. The idea of equal treatment was controversial, but it became a cornerstone of remembrance. Outside Europe, however, the commission enacted a policy of extreme discrimination, categorising the fallen as ""white"", ""Indians"" or what it called ""natives"". In southern Kenya, white soldiers lie beneath named memorials in a well-tended cemetery.  Next door in a scruffy field is where their African comrades are buried - no names, just a general memorial. The consequence of the commission's failings is not only to do a great injustice to the black and Asian soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought alongside their white European comrades in two world wars, it is to misrepresent our history.

Man dead and another hurt in car park fight,"A man in his 40s died at the scene and a second was flown to hospital A man has died and another has been seriously hurt after a car was driven into them in a supermarket car park. Police were called to Church Street in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, at about 14:15 BST following reports of a fight between a group of men. One of the men got into his car and is reported to have driven at two people. A man in his 40s died at the scene and a second was flown to hospital. The owner of the car, a BMW 1 Series, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He is also being held on suspicion of attempted murder.

LiveLiveNew US emissions target hailed a âgame changerâ27 minutes ago,"The US has unveiled an updated carbon pledge that will see its emissions nearly halved by 2030 President Joe Biden will host 40 leaders at a virtual summit in the White House to raise ambition on tackling climate change The meeting will aim to re-assert US global leadership in the area after President Trump pulled the country out of the Paris agreement President Biden has made the climate a key focus for his administration, re-joining the Paris agreement on his first day in office Ahead of the meeting, officials urged greater ambition, particularly among countries perceived as ""laggards"" on climate The leaders of China, the UK, India, Canada, France, Germany, South Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Russia are all attending Observers have been closely watching China - the world's top emitter - for any commitments it might make at the meeting Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs, Mark Kinver, Marianna Brady, Sam Cabral and Holly Honderich Day One of the White House's Earth Day climate summit has now ended. Over six sessions, we heard from leaders, officials and activists from more than 40 countries, including top officials in the Biden administration. Day Two takes place tomorrow, with two final sessions. Thanks for following our reporting and analysis. Live coverage was brought to you by Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral, and edited by Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs and Mark Kinver. The BBC's Outside Source programme asked three young climate activists about their thoughts on the Leaders Summit. Here's what they said. Daisy Jeffrey in Australia -  part of âFridayâs for Futureâ campaign âI would hope to see significantly more pressure put on Australia by this US presidential administration than the last. âI hope that this summit will see the Australian government bow to political pressure, because at the moment instead of looking to invest in renewables and a renewable future this government is investing in gas and saying that gas is the way forward and that is simply an inaccurate and quite backwards way of thinking. âWeâre tackling climate change abysmally.â Melissa Kowara in Indonesia  - a member of Extinction Rebellion Indonesia âFirst of all they have to declare that we have an emergency to begin with, because the level of awareness and the climate literacy is still so slow and this declaration will work as a mandate to all the ministries, all the private entity and the civil society to actually act together. âWhat I really want to see is that countries around the world start really looking into tackling the climate crisis issue directly at its roots.â Thandile Chinyavanhu in South Africa â part of Greenpeace Africa âItâs very important that our government takes action and deviates away from our fossil fuel addiction. âI donât believe South Africaâs ambitions are ambitious enough.â Critics of climate change proposals often question whether climate advocates are willing to make eco-friendly changes to their personal lives. Will you stop eating meat? Will you stop riding on airplanes? Will you take shorter baths? With an Earth Day climate summit hosted by the White House in full swing, those critics turned their eyes to national climate advisor Gina McCarthy and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, for their choice of transportation to attend an event touting electric vehicles. Buttigieg has made a show of riding to his meetings on a bicycle, but was also recently pictured taking that bike off the back of an SUV parked a few blocks away. Allow Twitter content?

There has been plenty of reaction coming in to the announcements at the Leaders Summit. Here's a selection of the comments from environmental campaign groups. Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said:âWe need more ambitious commitments from the big emitters and more binding plans on climate finance, fossil fuel phase outs, and nature restoration which match the urgency of the crisis we face.â Melita Steele, programme director of Greenpeace Africa, commented:âAfrican leaders must do more than just be at the table of biodiversity and climate summits. ""We need them to be serious about tackling emissions at home and unequivocal about protecting their countryâs natural biodiversity in order to tackle a climate crisis which has the continent seeing worse and worse extreme weather impacts every year.â Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said: â[Canadaâs] new target is not aligned with a 1.5C compatible future - that would require a 60% emissions reduction goal. âWe hope to see Canada continue to ramp up ambition, both in future years and as NDC consultations occur in coming months on the road to [the COP26 climate meeting in] Glasgow.â Abby Maxman, chief executive of Oxfam America, described President Bidenâs announcement as a âstep in the right directionâ but added that more action was needed. âThe richest 1% of the worldâs population are responsible for more than twice as much carbon pollution as the 3.1 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity,"" she said. âAs the worldâs richest country and largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the US owes it to the world's most vulnerable to increase its emissions reductions target in order to prevent additional climate change impacts.""  In a separate breakout session, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is leading officials from around the world in a discussion of nature-based solutions to reduce emissions and strengthen climate resilience. Nature-based efforts have been proposed around the world to combat climate change, by reducing deforestation and the loss of wetlands, restoring marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history, has made restorative justice a key aspect of her climate change goals. She is moderating a panel that includes environmental ministers from Canada, Costa Rica, Gabon, Indonesia, Peru and the Seychelles, as well as two indigenous activists. The Biden administration has indicated that climate change will be a key plank of its foreign policy. His director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, and ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield both argue it requires a diplomatic, economic and militaristic effort, what administration officials refer to as ""a whole-of-government effort"". They note the Pentagon has already designated climate change as a national security threat and as a threat multiplier. In the US, the past year has seen wildfires in California, hurricanes in Louisiana and blackouts in Texas, says Thomas-Greenfield, while the world has seen monsoons, droughts and other disasters. ""It doesn't matter where you live. Climate change is a challenge for every person, in every country,"" she says. Only ""a multilateral toolkit"" can ensure that countries and people do not fight over scare resources as the world gets warmer, she says. Thomas-Greenfield says real global cooperation can instead bring ""shared economic opportunity"". Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is now leading a session on how the climate crisis poses a threat to energy, economic and national security. ""Few things deserve to be called existential, but the climate crisis is existential,"" he says, detailing problems caused by coastal erosion, natural disasters and other impacts of global warming. He notes that the US intelligence community under President Biden is undertaking comprehensive climate assessments, which it had not done before. He points out the UK's intelligence assessments of climate security have ""raised the bar"" on how to do these evaluations. Austin is joined by director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and defence officials from six different countries. Nick BeakeEurope Correspondent Pope Francis has just added his voice. In a video
recorded in the Vatican, he warned that the climate crisis will take on an even
greater significance in the post-pandemic world. Leaders must do more to
protect the gift of nature, he stressed. In another message, to mark Earth Day
â an annual event calling for greater protection of the environment â Francis
said Covid-19 had proved the global community could work together to tackle a
catastrophic threat. But the head of the Catholic Church said if leaders were
not courageous and truthful in their efforts to combat climate change, the
result would be self-destruction. When then-President Trump visited Rome in
2017, Francis brought up in conversation the race to save the planet. But
just a week later Trump announced America was to withdraw from the Paris
climate agreement. However, the new incumbent in the White House, a proud
Catholic, appears much more on the Popeâs wavelength. Michael Regan, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is steering an all-female panel of American mayors, global and Indigenous leaders focused on ground-up solutions in their communities. The women gathered today are a ""testament to how women around the world are raising the mantle of climate leadership, developing sustainable solutions"", Regan says. Introducing Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim of the Indigenous Women and Peoples Association of Chad, Regan notes that the world's Indigenous people make up only about 5% of the global population but effectively protect about 80% of global biodiversity. ""How we can lead in harmony with nature?"" Ibrahim says. ""Without Indigenous peoples there is no way."" She says developed countries must now follow the leadership of Indigenous communities in taking climate action. For us, she says, ""protection of nature it is not a policy, it is our way of life"". Asha Karim survived a narrow escape from the 2020California wildfires. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? While of course I wish we'd done more earlier, I think it's never too late to act. Any reduction in harm to the planet is worthwhile. We got here by largely ignoring the problem, so to decide that it's now too late to do anything, that ignorance somehow freed us from responsibility strikes me as selfish and silly. Climate change is a series of positive feedback loops that will keep building upon one another, even more rapidly if we don't change course. Will politics get in the way? It is politicised, in that there is lot of vested financial interest in maintaining the status quo. That financial power is very present in American politics, and we see it reflected in subsidies and lax regulation in many of the industries that heavily contribute to our emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I hope we can lead the way to a much higher standard than we see globally today. I think that committing to the level of action we see elsewhere is a step in the right direction, but far from enough. Being that it is a politicised problem, it may take a while to make change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? What do you hope the US government will do first? I think the American people are onboard with the plan. Climate change has become difficult to ignore. More intense storms, fire seasons, shifts in weather patterns impacting local wildlife - there is some effect of climate change that has touched every person's life in some way. I think most Americans would like to see the US take this problem seriously. As for what we should do first, cutting subsidies for meat and dairy production and reducing our dependence on coal would be impactful places to start. Today's climate summit has a lot of important people making a lot of big promises to combat climate change - carbon caps, finance adaptation, and international cooperation. But let's go back to square one - what even is climate change? The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past. There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. Read more about the basics of climate change. Kim Cobb is a climate scientist. She works at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? This is exactly what we need to get back on track. It is absolutely reflecting a high level of ambition. It's roughly in line with science based targets to keep warming to a minimum this century. We really have an army of amazing folks working on this in DC right now. The winds are at our back in this particular moment. With every American talking about jobs, talking about public health benefits in our low carbon future, this is language that resonates. And I think that there's a way to craft this policy to make sure that there's equity for all and economic benefits for all along the way. I'm just inspired to try to do what I can to go as far as we can, as best as we can. Will politics get in the way? Obviously, getting anything through Congress right now is not a slam dunk, to put it mildly. And I think the devil is going to be in the details as to exactly how this policy is crafted to appeal across the aisle. I have confidence that this administration is bringing people who have worked on policies successfully before. So I think everything we're hearing right now is really aligned towards success. But the next months are going to be absolutely crucial. What do you hope the US government will do first? How are we going to make sure that communities that are deeply invested in fossil fuel infrastructure are not left out of the economic winds in our low carbon future? These kinds of issues are going to be important in terms of building that coalition. At the same time, you have to address the long standing voices who have brought this kind of target forward, such as the youth voices and the people who have focused on environmental justice. Around the world, there are teams of people who are working to track down and destroy hidden sources of greenhouse gases - stopping them from harming the planet. Some of the gases, which are used in refrigeration, have many times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. The BBC's Tom Heap meets some of the people part working to stop these gases causing damage to the planet. Read about the best climate solution you haven't heard of. Victoria Coles is an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? It is never too little too late! As the administrationâs proposed infrastructure plan notes, we already need to spend billions on mitigating climate impacts to build resilience for roads, airports, ports and other infrastructure. That doesn't include the billions from climate and weather-related losses since 1980. Those costs of prior inaction should be front and center when we think about the expense of reducing emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I am a scientist, not a policy expert. However, I think that legislative rather than executive action is required to stabilise US climate policy from changes in administration. I hope that the American Jobs Plan retains its aggressive investment in climate related action and that, at a minimum, some form of climate legislation can make it through congress. In my view, this, coupled with action rather than discussion, will be needed to convince global leaders that America is serious about climate change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? TheYale climate opinion maps,externaldemonstrate clearly that the majority of Americans support climate policies such as carbon taxes and tax rebates for electric vehicles. The only question in their survey that was not over 50% pro-climate was ""the percentage of adults who think global warming will harm them personally"". Americans worry about climate, they view it as harmful to plants, animals, developing countries and other Americans. But until they view it as an existential threat to their own families, they may not vote for candidates that recognise the climate crisis as a threat to global and national interests. Reality Check At the climate summit, leaders sought to outbid each other with their pledges on cutting carbon emissions over the next decade. The numbers can be confusing, so letâs try to make sense of them. The US pledged to cut carbon emissions by around 50% (from 2005 levels) by 2030. The UK announced a ""world-leading"" target to cut emissions by 78% (from 1990 levels) by 2035, having previously committed to 68% by 2030. Other countries such as Canada have also increased their commitments. Different countries use different years as the starting point for comparison, usually from when their emissions peaked â partly to show their pledges in the best light. For example, the US compares their 2030 target to 2005 levels, and the UK uses 1990 levels - about the time when emissions peaked in their respective countries. However, by either comparison point, the UKâs 2030 target is the most ambitious. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joined other world leaders in today's summit as part of a special session of climate finance. Ardern urged other countries to follow New Zealand's lead in pricing carbon, ending subsidies for fossil fuels and finance environmental adaption. And for Ardern - calling in some 14,000 km from the summit's host - the appearance meant a rather inconvenient call time. On Instagram, the prime minister noted she had a 02:00am local call time for the international meeting. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

French President Emmanuel Macron urges world to 'move more quickly' in tackling climate change. John Kerry, US President Joe Biden's Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, has led a roundtable of global financial leaders - all making their own commitments to tackle the climate crisis. David Malpass, President of the World Bank Group, promised record spending ""in the way that gets the most done"". ""The core of the plan is to spend more,"" he said - focused on flattening carbon emissions from the world's biggest emitters. Malpass also acknowledged what he called the ""severity and the inequality of the current environment"" - noting that poverty, inequality and climate change are linked and require a comprehensive, inclusive solution. Chief executive of Citigroup, Jane Fraser, followed shortly after, repeating the corporation's March commitment to be net zero in carbon emissions by 2050. ""Net zero is easy to say, but very hard to do,"" Fraser said. Kerry thanked her for the support but said that reaching net zero - a formidable challenge - will still not be enough. ""Even if we get to net zero, we still have to get carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,"" he said. ""This is a bigger challenge than a lot of people have grabbed on to yet."" Greta Thunberg is now speaking about the emotional toll of the climate fight on young people. She is pressed on the issue by California Democrat Katie Porter, who says her nine-year-old child told her: ""The Earth is burning and we're all going to die."" Thunberg says it's ""understandable"" that younger generations might be saddened or angry by global warming and political inaction. ""It would be strange if we didn't feel that way because then we wouldn't have any empathy."" ""But there is still much hope and, if we choose to take action and act together, there's unlimited things that we can do."" She adds that her experience taught her that ""the best medication against anger and anxiety is to take action yourself"". The hearing on fossil fuel subsidies now comes to an end. Greta Thunberg tells the US House Environment Subcommittee that, in her conversations, she found a lot of readiness for climate action. ""People are actually more open for change than we realise,"" she says. To those who depend on the fossil fuel industry for jobs and livelihoods, she says: ""Who can blame them?"" People working within the industry ""cannot be left behind,"" she adds. Pointing out that climate issues are not the fault of those people, Thunberg notes that climate advocates would prefer to work with the industry than against or without it. ""Climate justice is social justice. We can't achieve climate justice without social justice,"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"As it happened: New US emissions target hailed a âgame changerâThe US hosts a meeting with 40 world leaders, aiming to re-assert its leadership on climate change.","The US has unveiled an updated carbon pledge that will see its emissions nearly halved by 2030 President Joe Biden will host 40 leaders at a virtual summit in the White House to raise ambition on tackling climate change The meeting will aim to re-assert US global leadership in the area after President Trump pulled the country out of the Paris agreement President Biden has made the climate a key focus for his administration, re-joining the Paris agreement on his first day in office Ahead of the meeting, officials urged greater ambition, particularly among countries perceived as ""laggards"" on climate The leaders of China, the UK, India, Canada, France, Germany, South Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Russia are all attending Observers have been closely watching China - the world's top emitter - for any commitments it might make at the meeting Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs, Mark Kinver, Marianna Brady, Sam Cabral and Holly Honderich Day One of the White House's Earth Day climate summit has now ended. Over six sessions, we heard from leaders, officials and activists from more than 40 countries, including top officials in the Biden administration. Day Two takes place tomorrow, with two final sessions. Thanks for following our reporting and analysis. Live coverage was brought to you by Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral, and edited by Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs and Mark Kinver. The BBC's Outside Source programme asked three young climate activists about their thoughts on the Leaders Summit. Here's what they said. Daisy Jeffrey in Australia -  part of âFridayâs for Futureâ campaign âI would hope to see significantly more pressure put on Australia by this US presidential administration than the last. âI hope that this summit will see the Australian government bow to political pressure, because at the moment instead of looking to invest in renewables and a renewable future this government is investing in gas and saying that gas is the way forward and that is simply an inaccurate and quite backwards way of thinking. âWeâre tackling climate change abysmally.â Melissa Kowara in Indonesia  - a member of Extinction Rebellion Indonesia âFirst of all they have to declare that we have an emergency to begin with, because the level of awareness and the climate literacy is still so slow and this declaration will work as a mandate to all the ministries, all the private entity and the civil society to actually act together. âWhat I really want to see is that countries around the world start really looking into tackling the climate crisis issue directly at its roots.â Thandile Chinyavanhu in South Africa â part of Greenpeace Africa âItâs very important that our government takes action and deviates away from our fossil fuel addiction. âI donât believe South Africaâs ambitions are ambitious enough.â Critics of climate change proposals often question whether climate advocates are willing to make eco-friendly changes to their personal lives. Will you stop eating meat? Will you stop riding on airplanes? Will you take shorter baths? With an Earth Day climate summit hosted by the White House in full swing, those critics turned their eyes to national climate advisor Gina McCarthy and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, for their choice of transportation to attend an event touting electric vehicles. Buttigieg has made a show of riding to his meetings on a bicycle, but was also recently pictured taking that bike off the back of an SUV parked a few blocks away. Allow Twitter content?

There has been plenty of reaction coming in to the announcements at the Leaders Summit. Here's a selection of the comments from environmental campaign groups. Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said:âWe need more ambitious commitments from the big emitters and more binding plans on climate finance, fossil fuel phase outs, and nature restoration which match the urgency of the crisis we face.â Melita Steele, programme director of Greenpeace Africa, commented:âAfrican leaders must do more than just be at the table of biodiversity and climate summits. ""We need them to be serious about tackling emissions at home and unequivocal about protecting their countryâs natural biodiversity in order to tackle a climate crisis which has the continent seeing worse and worse extreme weather impacts every year.â Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said: â[Canadaâs] new target is not aligned with a 1.5C compatible future - that would require a 60% emissions reduction goal. âWe hope to see Canada continue to ramp up ambition, both in future years and as NDC consultations occur in coming months on the road to [the COP26 climate meeting in] Glasgow.â Abby Maxman, chief executive of Oxfam America, described President Bidenâs announcement as a âstep in the right directionâ but added that more action was needed. âThe richest 1% of the worldâs population are responsible for more than twice as much carbon pollution as the 3.1 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity,"" she said. âAs the worldâs richest country and largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the US owes it to the world's most vulnerable to increase its emissions reductions target in order to prevent additional climate change impacts.""  In a separate breakout session, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is leading officials from around the world in a discussion of nature-based solutions to reduce emissions and strengthen climate resilience. Nature-based efforts have been proposed around the world to combat climate change, by reducing deforestation and the loss of wetlands, restoring marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history, has made restorative justice a key aspect of her climate change goals. She is moderating a panel that includes environmental ministers from Canada, Costa Rica, Gabon, Indonesia, Peru and the Seychelles, as well as two indigenous activists. The Biden administration has indicated that climate change will be a key plank of its foreign policy. His director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, and ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield both argue it requires a diplomatic, economic and militaristic effort, what administration officials refer to as ""a whole-of-government effort"". They note the Pentagon has already designated climate change as a national security threat and as a threat multiplier. In the US, the past year has seen wildfires in California, hurricanes in Louisiana and blackouts in Texas, says Thomas-Greenfield, while the world has seen monsoons, droughts and other disasters. ""It doesn't matter where you live. Climate change is a challenge for every person, in every country,"" she says. Only ""a multilateral toolkit"" can ensure that countries and people do not fight over scare resources as the world gets warmer, she says. Thomas-Greenfield says real global cooperation can instead bring ""shared economic opportunity"". Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is now leading a session on how the climate crisis poses a threat to energy, economic and national security. ""Few things deserve to be called existential, but the climate crisis is existential,"" he says, detailing problems caused by coastal erosion, natural disasters and other impacts of global warming. He notes that the US intelligence community under President Biden is undertaking comprehensive climate assessments, which it had not done before. He points out the UK's intelligence assessments of climate security have ""raised the bar"" on how to do these evaluations. Austin is joined by director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and defence officials from six different countries. Nick BeakeEurope Correspondent Pope Francis has just added his voice. In a video
recorded in the Vatican, he warned that the climate crisis will take on an even
greater significance in the post-pandemic world. Leaders must do more to
protect the gift of nature, he stressed. In another message, to mark Earth Day
â an annual event calling for greater protection of the environment â Francis
said Covid-19 had proved the global community could work together to tackle a
catastrophic threat. But the head of the Catholic Church said if leaders were
not courageous and truthful in their efforts to combat climate change, the
result would be self-destruction. When then-President Trump visited Rome in
2017, Francis brought up in conversation the race to save the planet. But
just a week later Trump announced America was to withdraw from the Paris
climate agreement. However, the new incumbent in the White House, a proud
Catholic, appears much more on the Popeâs wavelength. Michael Regan, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is steering an all-female panel of American mayors, global and Indigenous leaders focused on ground-up solutions in their communities. The women gathered today are a ""testament to how women around the world are raising the mantle of climate leadership, developing sustainable solutions"", Regan says. Introducing Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim of the Indigenous Women and Peoples Association of Chad, Regan notes that the world's Indigenous people make up only about 5% of the global population but effectively protect about 80% of global biodiversity. ""How we can lead in harmony with nature?"" Ibrahim says. ""Without Indigenous peoples there is no way."" She says developed countries must now follow the leadership of Indigenous communities in taking climate action. For us, she says, ""protection of nature it is not a policy, it is our way of life"". Asha Karim survived a narrow escape from the 2020California wildfires. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? While of course I wish we'd done more earlier, I think it's never too late to act. Any reduction in harm to the planet is worthwhile. We got here by largely ignoring the problem, so to decide that it's now too late to do anything, that ignorance somehow freed us from responsibility strikes me as selfish and silly. Climate change is a series of positive feedback loops that will keep building upon one another, even more rapidly if we don't change course. Will politics get in the way? It is politicised, in that there is lot of vested financial interest in maintaining the status quo. That financial power is very present in American politics, and we see it reflected in subsidies and lax regulation in many of the industries that heavily contribute to our emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I hope we can lead the way to a much higher standard than we see globally today. I think that committing to the level of action we see elsewhere is a step in the right direction, but far from enough. Being that it is a politicised problem, it may take a while to make change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? What do you hope the US government will do first? I think the American people are onboard with the plan. Climate change has become difficult to ignore. More intense storms, fire seasons, shifts in weather patterns impacting local wildlife - there is some effect of climate change that has touched every person's life in some way. I think most Americans would like to see the US take this problem seriously. As for what we should do first, cutting subsidies for meat and dairy production and reducing our dependence on coal would be impactful places to start. Today's climate summit has a lot of important people making a lot of big promises to combat climate change - carbon caps, finance adaptation, and international cooperation. But let's go back to square one - what even is climate change? The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past. There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. Read more about the basics of climate change. Kim Cobb is a climate scientist. She works at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? This is exactly what we need to get back on track. It is absolutely reflecting a high level of ambition. It's roughly in line with science based targets to keep warming to a minimum this century. We really have an army of amazing folks working on this in DC right now. The winds are at our back in this particular moment. With every American talking about jobs, talking about public health benefits in our low carbon future, this is language that resonates. And I think that there's a way to craft this policy to make sure that there's equity for all and economic benefits for all along the way. I'm just inspired to try to do what I can to go as far as we can, as best as we can. Will politics get in the way? Obviously, getting anything through Congress right now is not a slam dunk, to put it mildly. And I think the devil is going to be in the details as to exactly how this policy is crafted to appeal across the aisle. I have confidence that this administration is bringing people who have worked on policies successfully before. So I think everything we're hearing right now is really aligned towards success. But the next months are going to be absolutely crucial. What do you hope the US government will do first? How are we going to make sure that communities that are deeply invested in fossil fuel infrastructure are not left out of the economic winds in our low carbon future? These kinds of issues are going to be important in terms of building that coalition.

India sees world's highest-ever daily Covid cases,"This video can not be played Scenes outside a hospital in Delhi, where people are dying without getting the treatment they need India has recorded the highest one-day tally of new Covid-19 cases anywhere in the world - and the country's highest number of deaths over 24 hours. It has close to 16 million confirmed cases, second only to the US. The country is struggling with a second wave, raising more fears about its overwhelmed health care system. Crowds have formed outside hospitals in major cities which are filled to capacity. A number of people have died while waiting for oxygen. Families are waiting hours to perform funeral rites, Reuters news agency reports, with at least one Delhi crematorium resorting to building pyres in its car park in order to cope with the numbers arriving. What is the India Covid variant? Why second Covid wave is devastating India How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave 'It feels like we're back to square one in India' Meanwhile, some countries are bringing in stricter rules affecting travel to and from India amid fears over the rising cases. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the number of flights between the two countries would be cut, while theUK has added India to a red list, restricting travel and bringing in hotel quarantine for all arrivals from Indiafrom Friday morning. India is struggling to cope with the soaring numbers - it recorded some 314,835 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,104. Oxygen supply has been a particular problem, with a number of hospitals in the capital Delhi running out entirely on Thursday, according to the city's Deputy Chief Minister, Manish Sisodia. Numerous other hospitals are understood to be running dangerously low on supplies, including one treating another Indian politician, Saurabh Bharadwaj. Delhi legislature member Mr Bharadwaj posted a plea for help in Hindi on Twitter from his hospital bed, saying there were just three hours of oxygen left. ""A lot of people are dependent on oxygen and without oxygen,these people will die just like fish die in the absence of water,"" he said, according to a translation by news channel NDTV,external. ""This is a time for all to come together to work."" The crisis worked its way to Delhi's highest court on Wednesday, where judges publicly criticised the central government for its handling of the oxygen crisis in the city. ""This is ridiculous. We want to know what the centre is doing with regard to oxygen supply across India,"" the judges said while reading out the verdict in a petition by the owner of six private hospitals. On Thursday, as hospitals warned stocks were rapidly diminishing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting to attempt to end the crisis. He asked officials to find ways to produce more oxygen, while telling states to come down ""heavily"" on anyone hoarding supplies. By Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi My phone is constantly ringing with desperate friends and family asking for help to arrange beds and medicine.  Some I am able to help, and some I can't. I personally know of many cases where patients died because they couldn't get oxygen in time. It's heart-breaking for families to hear that the hospital where their loved ones are being treated may soon run out of oxygen. Emergency intervention from the government has stopped any big disaster from happening so far, but there is an urgent need to give hospitals enough oxygen so they can sustain the increasing caseload. But experts are asking why the government allowed the situation to become so dire. The pandemic was under control in January but the lean period was not used to augment healthcare facilities. And now people are paying a heavy price for it, and we are left with a sense of helplessness all around. Unlike last year, no national lockdown has been announced. Instead, regions are implementing their own rules. Delhi announced a week-long lockdown at the weekend,leaving just government offices and essential services like hospitals, pharmacies and grocers open. The authorities in the worst affected state of Maharashtra - which was already under a partial lockdown - have announced a series of additional restrictions starting from Thursday evening. Oxygen leak leaves 22 Covid patients dead in India 'Wherever you look, you see ambulances and bodies' How is India's vaccination drive going? Maharashtra is India's richest state and home to its financial hub, Mumbai. It has also been a Covid hotspot since the start of the pandemic, accounting for a quarter of India's cases. Maharashtra accounts for a quarter of India's more than 15 million Covid cases Maharashtra has also reported more deaths from the virus than any other state, with 67,468. India has sufferednearly 185,000 deaths with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University,external. However, while deaths have been rising, the fatality rate remains relatively low. Uttar Pradesh, which is also reporting a high caseload, has adopted a more conservative approach, with its high court on Monday ordering a lockdown in five badly affected districts. However, it was put on hold after the government appealed against the decision in the Supreme Court. India - which has a population of more than a billion people - has so far administered more than 130 million doses but the drive has been restricted to health workers, frontline staff, those above the age of 45 and anyone with co-morbidities. From 1 May, people above 18 will also be eligible for the vaccine. But a supply crunch, which is already affecting the drive, could slow it down further. The crunch has impacted the Covax programme, which was heavily dependent in India's Serum Institute. It told the BBC it had suffered a shortfall of around 90 million doses after India prioritised its own needs, but says talks are now taking place to resume production. The scheme to share vaccines with other countries Pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced it was in ongoing discussions with the Indian government to supply its Covid-19 vaccine to the country at a not-for-profit price, according to Reuters news agency. India has seen a rapid rise in case numbers over the past month driven by lax safety protocols,a Hindu festival attended by millionsandvariants of the virus, including a ""double mutant"" strain. It was detected in 61% of samples tested in Maharashtra, according to the National Institute of Virology. Huge election rallies - including by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - were also not halted in the state of West Bengal which has been holding elections in phases in recent weeks. The government has defended the decision to continue with the polling.

No 10 announces leak inquiry into PM-Dyson texts,"Sir James Dyson texted the prime minister last March when he was involved in efforts to provide ventilators The government has announced an internal inquiry into the leak of private messages between Boris Johnson and businessman Sir James Dyson. Texts published by the BBC showed the prime minister promising Sir James he would ""fix"" an issue on the tax status of Dyson staff working in the UK during the pandemic. Labour has said the messages are part of a pattern of government ""sleaze"". The PM said he made ""no apology"" for trying to get ventilators for the NHS. Asked about the leaks, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""We have instructed the Cabinet Office to look into this."" What is lobbying? A brief guide Welby urges compassion amid political lobbying row What is the David Cameron lobbying row about? Billionaire Dyson moves residency back to the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the issue wasn't about getting hold of ventilators but ""whether those who are well known to the party, the Tory party, friends etc who've got the prime minister's number can access him and ask about tax breaks"". He said people who could access the prime minister directly were in a ""magic circle,"" while others were left ""outside"". He urged the prime minister to ""disclose all of the contacts that he's had"". At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the government asked companies, including Dyson, to help supply ventilators. Sir James sought assurance from the Treasury that his workforce would not be hit with extra taxes if they came to the UK to help with the effort. Having failed to get a response, he contacted the prime minister directly via text. In the messages seen by the BBC, Mr Johnson told Sir James: ""[Chancellor] Rishi [Sunak] says it is fixed!! We need you here."" In a later text Mr Johnson said: ""I am First Lord of the Treasury and you can take it that we are backing you to do what you need."" In a statement, Sir James said he was ""hugely proud"" of  Dyson's actions in the pandemic. He added that Dyson had not ""any benefit from the project"" and that the company had ""voluntarily covered the Â£20m of development costs"". ""Not one penny was claimed from any government, in any jurisdiction, in relation to Covid-19."" When challenged about the texts at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he made ""no apology for moving heaven and earth"" to improve supplies of equipment to treat coronavirus patients. Mr Johnson said there was ""nothing to conceal about this"" and added that he would share details with MPs. The prime minister's official spokesman said No 10 was ""pulling together that information it will be published shortly"". The spokesman did not deny reports that the government's top civil servant Simon Case advised Mr Johnson to change his phone number following concerns that it was too easy for lobbyists and business leaders to contact him Meanwhile, Sir Bernard Jenkin, chair of the Liaison Committee - made up of senior MPs - has said they will consider Labour's request to examine the PM's contacts with Dyson.

Government sorry as report finds war graves racism,"Boris Johnson said he is ""deeply troubled"" by failures to properly commemorate black and Asian troops who died fighting for the British Empire during World War One. Some troops were commemorated collectively or their names were recorded in registers, while their white counterparts had headstones. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologised in the Commons aftera report,externalblamed ""pervasive racism"". Mr Wallace pledged to ""take action"". The prime minister offered an ""unreserved apology"" over the findings of the review by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. ""Our shared duty is to honour and remember all those, wherever they lived and whatever their background, who laid down their lives for our freedoms at the moment of greatest peril,"" he said. Mr Wallace expressed ""deep regret"" in the House of Commons, as he told MPs there was ""no doubt"" prejudice had played a part in what happened after WWI. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologises: ""There can be no doubt prejudice played a part in some of the commission's decisions"" The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which is tasked with commemorating those who died in the two world wars, has also apologised over its findings. Labour MP David Lammy, who was critical to bringing the matter to light, called it a ""watershed moment"". The African soldiers dragged into Europe's war Marking the memories of a million service personnel Mr Wallace said: ""On behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government both of the time and today, I want to apologise for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation. ""Whilst we can't change the past, we can make amends and take action,"" he said. He said there were cases where the commission ""deliberately overlooked evidence"" that would have allowed it to find the names of the dead. And he said there were examples of officials employing an ""overarching imperial ideology connected to racial and religious differences"" in order to ""divide the dead and treat them unequally in ways that were impossible in Europe"". Outlining the next steps, Mr Wallace said the Commonwealth War Graves Commission will: search in the historical record for inequalities in commemoration and act on what is found renew its commitment to equality in commemoration by building physical or digital commemorative structures use its online presence and wider education activities to reach out to all the communities of the former British Empire touched by the two world wars to make sure their hidden history is brought to life and, over the next six months, assemble a global and diverse community of experts to help make this happen Mr Wallace also announced a public consultation over plans to waive the visa fee for service personnel from the Commonwealth and Nepal who choose to settle in the UK in order to honour their contribution. An inquiry by the commission was set up following a 2019 Channel 4 documentary, calledUnremembered,external, which was presented by Mr Lammy. The report found that at least 116,000 casualties from WW1, most of whom were of African, Indian or Egyptian origin, ""were not commemorated by name or possibly not commemorated at all"". But that figure could be as high as 350,000, it said. It also cited racist comments such as the governor of a British colony saying in 1923 that: ""The average native... would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" This video can not be played David Matthews tells the story of his great-uncle who fought in World War One Shadow justice secretary Mr Lammy told the BBC that while making the documentary in Kenya and Tanzania, he discovered mass graves in which Africans had been ""dumped with no commemoration whatsoever"". He said it was a travesty that men who served the British Empire were not commemorated properly, but welcomed the report. ""I'm just really, really pleased that the dignity that these men deserved - who were dragged from their villages and commandeered to work for the British Empire - that dignity that they deserve in death can be granted to them,"" he said. Mr Lammy added that work must be done to find their names in archives where that is possible, and to establish how local communities would like them to be commemorated. He also said Commonwealth soldiers should not be ""whitewashed"" out of history books, while Mr Wallace said it was a ""deep regret"" that his own WW1 education had included ""very little about the contribution from the Commonwealth countries and the wider at the time British Empire"". This video can not be played David Olusoga: ""It's another organisation that's had to be dragged into admitting its history."" Historian Prof David Olusoga, whose TV company produced Unremembered, told BBC Breakfast that apologies were not enough and resources would need to be committed if the commission was serious about restorative justice. ""If the Commonwealth War Graves Commission had set up a committee and discovered that 100,000 white British soldiers lay in mass graves - unmarked, uncommemorated - and the documentation proved that that had been deliberate, what would they do?"" he said. Six million soldiers from the British Empire served in WW1. Between 45,000 and 54,000 Asian and African personnel who died in the conflict were ""commemorated unequally"", the commission said. World War One was the first truly global war, fought not just in the trenches of France but in the Middle East, Asia and Africa Britain's colonies sent millions of men to fight for the empire during the conflict India, which at that time included Pakistan and Bangladesh, sent the most soldiers - more than 1.4 million The British Army in East Africa was mainly composed of African soldiers by November 1918, according to the Imperial War Museum At least 180,000 Africans served in the Carrier Corps in East Africa and provided logistic support to troops at the front Around 15,000 people from the West Indies enlisted in WW1, including 10,000 from Jamaica, according to the National Army Museum Colonies as far away as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) also sent a similar number between them Britain had soldiers from six different continents: Europe, North America, South America, Australasia, Asia and Africa The report concluded that the failure to properly commemorate the individuals was influenced by a scarcity of information, errors inherited from other organisations and the opinions of colonial administrators. ""Underpinning all these decisions, however, were the entrenched prejudices, preconceptions and pervasive racism of contemporary imperial attitudes,"" it added. The report picked out an example from 1923 when the governor of the Gold Coast colony, now Ghana, argued for collective memorials rather than individual ones. At a meeting in London, it was said that the governor, F G Guggisberg, said: ""The average native of the Gold Coast would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" In response, commission employee Arthur Browne said: ""In perhaps two or three hundred years' time, when the native population had reached a higher stage of civilisation, they might then be glad to see that headstones had been erected on the native graves and that the native soldiers had received precisely the same treatment as their white comrades."" The report said Mr Browne's response showed ""what he may have considered foresight, but one that was explicitly framed by contemporary racial prejudice"". The commission, which was founded in 1917 as the Imperial War Graves Commission, said the events of a century ago were wrong then and were wrong now. Its director general, Claire Horton, said: ""We recognise the wrongs of the past and are deeply sorry and will be acting immediately to correct them."" As part of the commission's work to search for unnamed war dead and those who are potentially not commemorated, it will also look at those who died in World War Two, although it is not thought that inequalities seen in WW1 were as widespread then. Ms Horton said the report was ""sober"" reading but gave the commission the ability - ""now that we know the numbers and the areas to look"" - to start the searches properly to ""right the wrongs of the past"". The war graves commission was founded with a remit to remember every individual who had died in World War One, regardless of rank, class, religion or race. The idea of equal treatment was controversial, but it became a cornerstone of remembrance. Outside Europe, however, the commission enacted a policy of extreme discrimination, categorising the fallen as ""white"", ""Indians"" or what it called ""natives"". In southern Kenya, white soldiers lie beneath named memorials in a well-tended cemetery.  Next door in a scruffy field is where their African comrades are buried - no names, just a general memorial. The consequence of the commission's failings is not only to do a great injustice to the black and Asian soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought alongside their white European comrades in two world wars, it is to misrepresent our history.

Prison chaplain 'conned' by 'remorseful' terrorist,"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed by Usman Khan during a conference on rehabilitating offenders A prison chaplain has admitted he may have been ""conned"" by a convicted terrorist who seemingly showed remorse for his actions. Usman Khan was freed in December 2018 after serving a jail term for funding a training camp abroad. Less than a year later, he killed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, at Fishmongers' Hall near London Bridge. The Rev Paul Foster has been giving evidence at the inquests into their deaths at London's Guildhall. Usman Khan had been jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange Mr Foster, who worked with prisoners of all faiths, said Khan had engaged positively with programmes looking at his offending and the impact of his crimes. He added: ""[Khan] had conversations with me about wanting to change and make a fresh start - to pay more attention to the ripple effect of his actions."" Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked: ""Would it have surprised you that, around the time Usman Khan was... engaged in victim awareness, there was intelligence he was trying to radicalise other prisoners?"" Mr Foster said it would. Terror attacker shouted 'I'm going to blow you all up' Hall porter 'stabbed terror attacker with spear' Witness thought terrorist was 'play-fighting' Mr Hough also said that, at the time of his release, there was intelligence that Khan might commit an attack. Mr Foster replied: ""That would be a surprise. ""If that intelligence is correct, he was obviously presenting himself in a way that was likely to deceive the likes of myself and others."" He added: ""I'm open to say I am wrong, and it is possible I have been conned."" Mr Foster also said Khan had spoken ""openly and emotionally"" during a discussion session with a victim of crime. He added: ""We were being presented with a lot of positive things about his behaviour - even some of the prisoners were telling me... in one instance a chap lost his son to a murder and Usman was the person at his door offering his condolences and asking if he could help."" The chaplain described one session with Khan in which he professed ""some shame"" about the impact his crime had on the Muslim community. ""He appeared to show remorse for what he had done,"" Mr Foster said. Nick Armstrong, representing the Merritt family, told the hearing that Khan had been one of about 70 prisoners in the UK categorised as ""high-risk Category A"" - out of a total prison population of 82,000. Dr Amy Ludlow of Cambridge University, who co-founded the Learning Together programme that organised the November 2019 event, told jurors she had not conducted a risk assessment for the Fishmongers' Hall gathering. But if she had, she would have assessed it as being ""low risk"", which would probably have only led to the same measures that were in place on the day, she said. Mr Hough told the witness that prison intelligence in 2017 stated that Khan had been the main inmate for radicalising others and had been involved in ""forced conversations"". Usman Khan sat at the same table as Saskia Jones before the knife attack Dr Ludlow told the inquests that ""people used to call him high-risk Khan"". The jury also heard that Khan completed a Learning Together creative writing course in 2018 and later that year became a mentor to others. In a research paper titled A Study Of Radicalisation In Modern Europe composed while behind bars, Khan said the root of radicalisation and extremism was down to ""personal injustices and grievances found by individuals on a daily basis"". In the paper, Khan also expressed a ""desire to be part of work that moves people away from radicalisation and extremist behaviour"", Dr Ludlow told the hearing. After his release from prison, Dr Ludlow stayed in touch with Khan and invited him to the Fishmongers' Hall event. Jurors saw a text from Khan after she had asked him to ""cheer on"" Learning Together. ""Don't worry you'll hear my cheering all the way from Stafford,"" he had replied, making reference to his hometown. Emails between Dr Ludlow and Khan's probation manager Kenneth Skelton were also read out. In one, on 22 October 2019, Dr Ludlow wrote that Khan would feel more comfortable if someone travelled with him from Stafford to the Fishmongers' Hall event. But a later email, from a Staffordshire police officer, said that sending two officers on the train with Khan could ""not be justified"". In the end, he travelled down alone and was met when his train arrived in London by others attending the event. The inquest hearing continues. Terror attacker shouted 'I'm going to blow you up' Hall porter 'stabbed terror attacker with spear' Terror witness thought killer was 'play-fighting' Office manager begged terrorist not to stab her 'I quickly realised something bad had happened' Terror attack victim's life 'was a triumph' HM Courts & Tribunals Service BREAKING: Richmond Police appeal for help finding two men in connection with missing mother and son You can now use your phone on this tube line on the London Underground 'I love living on London's canals - now I'm being told I am no longer welcome' DLD Students embark on World Challenge Adventure in Morocco Marco Pierre White: New menu helps banish winter blues Bromley brothers accused of revenge porn, having Rambo knife and strangling woman Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction Warning on gas prices as cold snap hits supplies UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

Deal struck to combat Crown Courts backlog,"This video can not be played It took 17 months for Gemma's case to reach court after she was assaulted by her ex-partner A deal has been struck over emergency funding to combat the unprecedented backlog in criminal trials. The Lord Chief Justice will be able to ask the government for unlimited funding to open up more courtrooms in England and Wales wherever judges are available. Currently, there is a record backlog of almost 58,000 Crown Court cases. This was caused by funding-related delays, which were then exacerbated by the pandemic. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""There will be no limit on the number of days Crown Courts can sit for the next financial year. ""As we continue to boost recovery in the courts following the pandemic, this will help them maximise capacity across the justice system and safely hold as many hearings as possible over the coming year."" Cut jury size to clear courts backlog - Labour Courts backlog 'tipping point' for justice system 'Grave concerns' for justice over court backlog The backlog has been growing by about 1,000 cases a month - meaning some suspects and victims are waiting until 2023 for prosecutions to be heard. Barristers are now predicting some of these trials may not be heard until 2024 unless there is a massive increase in court availability. Senior judges fear fewer cases will reach a conclusion - with either a conviction or an acquittal, as evidence is compromised by the passage of time or the loss of confidence from victims and witnesses. If you want to know what it feels like to wait for justice for a serious crime, consider the limbo that ""Jenny"" finds herself in. For legal reasons, the BBC is not revealing any details of the case but, put briefly, she quietly and secretly coped for years with having been the victim of serious sexual violence. When the #MeToo movement took hold, she decided that she too had to speak out. In 2018 detectives video-recorded Jenny's allegations and, after a long and complex investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded last summer that her abuser should be charged with serious offences. Jenny agreed not to begin deep trauma therapy because it may affect her evidence in court. Last autumn, she learned when her abuser would face trial - and she was devastated. ""The first court hearing and second court hearing were really close to each other. And so that gave me some faith, I thought it's taken this long to get to this point. But actually, maybe this next bit isn't going to be as long. ""I was asked... to provide dates of availability for court for the next nine months. So I thought, it's just another nine months. I can do this. And then I got the call - and they gave me the date. It was 2022."" Read more on the long wait for justice. The deal increases the number of ""sitting days"" that will be funded for the next financial year in England and Wales. Sitting days are the number of occasions that each specific courtroom is open and fully-managed by staff and a judge, so that it can hear cases. In 2010, there were 110,000 Crown Court sitting days. The courts budget was then cut, following decisions by the then coalition government. On the eve of the pandemic, sitting days had reached a low of 86,000 meaning that only 45% of available space - about 200 courtrooms - was being used. It's not clear in practice how many extra court sitting days will be achievable because of the challenges of social distancing - meaning the plan may initially struggle to make a dent in the massive backlog. There are now 300 Covid-safe courtrooms open for jury trials, plus 120 extra spaces for hearings and an additional 60 temporary so-called ""Nightingale Courts"" to further ease the pressure. Thirty of those Nightingales can hold jury trials. But tens of courtrooms across England and Wales remain locked and completely unusable because they are too small to accommodate all the people required for a prosecution to progress. Secondly, social distancing guidance restricts the number of defendants who can be safely held in each building. That problem has become so acute that two separate courtrooms in Manchester are being knocked into one to allow major gang trials to progress. The plan is also dependent on the availability of part-time judges. These are experienced lawyers who take time out from their work to sit as a judge instead. These fee-paid judges are a critical part of the criminal justice system. Funding to pay for their work was halved in the two years to the eve of the pandemic - and with backlogs now so high, it is unclear how many eligible lawyers will be able to find the time to pick up the work. Labour has called for a guaranteed 120,000 sitting days - a third higher than at present. Shadow Justice Secretary David Lammy said: ""The government turned its back on victims of crime by allowing the Crown Court backlog to reach more than 57,000 cases for the very first time. ""A decade of Conservative cuts to courts, sitting days and the whole justice system allowed the backlog to grow to a staggering 39,000 cases, even before the pandemic began."" James Mulholland QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association - the body that represents criminal barristers, said the statistics showed that only a doubling of the extra capacity would tackle the backlog. ""It is obvious that there should be no limit to Crown Court sitting days this year in order to maximise the volume of cases travelling through the courts. It would be far more reassuring if a firm commitment was made right into 2023. ""There will be concerns, once again, that Government takes, at best, half measures and refuses to address the problem by opening more courts rather than taking an axe to the fundamentals of the justice system there to protect the public.""

Families' anger over Ravenscraig 'monstrosity',"The former steelworks site was originally earmarked for retail and leisure development Families living in new homes on the former Ravenscraig site in Motherwell have described plans for a major industrial site on their doorstep as a ""monstrosity"". Almost 500 formal objections have been lodged against the proposals, which include a large rail complex for logistics firm Russell Group. The company said the Â£200m development would generate hundreds of jobs. And they said they would take ""every step"" to minimise disruption. The deadlinefor public responses,externalis Friday. The development would be built on derelict land which was once home to the largest hot strip steel mill in Western Europe. Locals have told BBC Scotland the proposed new industrial site would be seven times the size of the local sports complex with 50 lorries passing every hour, frequent freight trains and 12-storey warehouses engulfing the landscape. Residents claim they were mis-sold their properties asthe original masterplan, approved by North Lanarkshire Council in 2019, promised regeneration to including schools, transport links and a new town centre. Network engineer Mohammed Zeeshan Siddique moved to the housing development in 2017. Mohammed Zeeshan Siddique said he would never have moved to the area if he had known it would become an industrial zone The 40-year-old, who is part of the local action group against the plans, said: ""I have a young family with two kids. I decided to live in this area based on the fact we are remote and away from any industrial traffic. Never in a million years would I buy a house in an industrial zone. ""We totally object to the proposals. It is going to turn our neighbourhood in to an industrial hub. This will be a monstrosity next to our doors. ""I am furious and angry about the change of plans for this area,"" he said. Ryan moved to the area in February 2017 to bring up his three-year-old son Caleb. The 35-year-old told BBC Scotland: ""The idea that this site would become a large area for families with retail, schools, sports facilities and recreational areas. All of that sounded great and it was an easy decision to move here."" He continued: ""There have been various regeneration plans over the years but these new plans are a massive deviation. We are now talking about something that is bigger than the biggest warehouses you will find. He said: ""The proposals will see up to 800 HGV movements every day. One every 100 seconds. We are talking about five, six, seven football parks in size. The trains which will enter and leave the site will be three quarters of a kilometre long. ""This is a negative move. They are proposing long term damage to the area."" The site's developer, Ravenscraig Ltd, has been in talks with Russell Group about the plans. Ravenscraig Ltd is a joint venture comprising Scottish Enterprise, Wilson Bowden Developments and Tata Steel. Plans for the Russell Group logistics hub are under consultation Nick Davies, director of Ravenscraig Limited, said: ""Ravenscraig represents one of Europe's largest brownfield sites and we are therefore supportive of proposals which contribute to its regeneration. The proposed scheme from Russell Group would drive real tangible benefits in terms of economic impact and job creation, as well as being a catalyst for other development. ""As such, it deserves to be considered on its merits. At the same time, the ongoing mixed use Ravenscraig redevelopment project is progressing, and we are bringing forward a range of further proposals, including employment opportunities, more affordable housing, small scale retail and community facilities."" Kenneth Russell, director at Russell Group, said the company remained committed to the proposed development. He said: ""The Â£200m investment will create hundreds of high-quality jobs for those living locally at a time of serious economic uncertainty. ""In addition, our planned training academy will help ensure that future generations can build careers in logistics as technology changes how we operate."" He added: ""Of course, we recognise that there is some concern within the local community regarding disruption but can reassure the community that we will take every step to minimise this. For example, we will invest in further traffic signals around the site, while we are already moving towards quieter and more energy efficient operations."" If planning goes ahead, the project will be completed by early 2026. Construction work could begin later this year. A council spokesman said the complex application would take some time to fully assess. When the process is complete, a report will be presented to a meeting of the full council to make a final decision.

Your updates today were written by Alex Therrien, Ella Wills, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. They were edited by James Clarke. Tom Davis passed his driving test after a four-month wait And as we come towards the end of our updates, here's a recap of the day's main pandemic news in the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi Many countries in Africa are getting AstraZeneca vaccines through the Covax scheme The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa Centres for
Disease Control (Africa CDC) are urging African countries not to destroy Covid-19
vaccines that have expired. The WHO is asking countries on the continent to hold on to expired
stock and wait for further guidance. The call comes after Malawi and South Sudan said they would
discard more than 70,000 doses of the AstraZeneca jab that were out of date. The Africa CDC says it has spoken to the manufacturer and has been
reassured the vaccines are still safe. Many vaccines can be used up to 36 months after manufacture but, because
Covid-19 jabs are so new, there is not enough data to prove their effectiveness over
longer periods. Whatever the guidance, the final decision rests with national drug
regulators. However, the issue will further increase the challenges around persuading people
on the continent to get vaccinated. The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in Africa has been slow, partly because of
supply issues and scepticism about the jab. Out of 55 African countries, 41 have benefited from the delivery
of vaccines via the global-sharing scheme Covax. Seven are yet to receive their
first batch. A deal has been struck over emergency funding to combat the record backlog of almost 58,000 Crown Court cases caused by funding delays  and exacerbated by the pandemic. The Lord Chief Justice will be able to ask the government for unlimited funding to open up more courtrooms in England and Wales wherever judges are available. But it's not clear in practice how many extra court sitting days will be achievable because of the challenges of social distancing. This restricts the number of defendants who can be safely held in each building - so much so that two courtrooms in Manchester are being knocked into one to allow major gang trials to progress. Find out more on how Covid has impacted criminal caseshere. Households in various of areas of Birmingham are being asked to take Covid-19 PCR tests after a small number of cases of the South Africa variant were found in the city. The cases are not thought to be connected to each other. People aged over 16 in theAlum Rock, Glebe Farm and Tile Cross wards of Birmingham,externalare the latest to be targeted. Testing has already been introduced for people aged 16 and over who live or work in theLadywood, Soho and Jewellery Quarter wards,external. In addition, everybody aged 11 years and over who lives in, works in, or travels through the London boroughs of Lambeth and Wandsworth is being asked to take a PCR test. Forty-four confirmed cases, and 30 probable cases, of the South Africa varianthave been found,externalin the area. All identified cases are self-isolating, or have completed their isolation. Their contacts have been traced and asked to isolate. People living in certain parts of SE16 in theLondon Borough of Southwark,externalare also being contacted - after a case linked to the Lambeth/Wandsworth cluster was identified. Surge testing linked to the South Africa variant is also taking place in parts of: You can find out about surge testing and the new variantshere. Vientiane, Laos Laos has introduced tough lockdown restrictions in its capital and closed its international borders to most traffic due to a Covid cluster in neighbouring Thailand. People living in the capital Vientiane cannot leave the city and only those with permission can enter. Residents can also leave the house for essential food shopping, hospital visits and other authorised tasks. The restrictions last until 5 May. It comes as 28 new cases were confirmed yesterday and six more today, bringing the overall count to 94 - meaning about a third of the cases recorded in the nation since the pandemic began have been in the past two days. The government-owned Vientiane Times reported 26 of yesterday's 28 new cases had contact with a student who had caught the virus from a Thai man. Annabel RackhamBBC Newsbeat Jack Croucher passed in Torquay with no minor faults We've been catching up with learner drivers on the day tests have restarted in England and Wales. Jack Croucher, 22, managed to get hold of a test at ""really short notice"" - so only had three days to prepare. He passed his test with no minor faults but in part credits his dad, who is a professional driving instructor, for free tuition during lockdown. ""Driving up [to the test centre] I was really nervous but once I got into the flow of it, it went really easy and I enjoyed it,"" he says. Courtney Osborn can't wait to take her son out in the car Courtney Osborn is going to use her new-found freedom to go visit her gran - after passing her test this morning. ""I started [learning to drive] in December 2019 and already had had two tests cancelled because of lockdown,"" says the 22-year-old. To get back up to speed in time for the test, Courtney took part in an intensive course when lessons resumed earlier this month. Courtney, who isn't working at the moment, lives in a village in Norfolk and says it's been frustrating not being able to drive anywhere. ""It's been really hard being stuck and now I can take my son out."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People line up to be tested in Hong Kong Over the past week, there has been concern in Hong Kong after a
couple of locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19 were identified involving a
mutant strain. One of the patients had no history of travel, and the other had
already completed 21 days of quarantine after arriving from Dubai. On Monday, health officials in Hong Kong warned there could
be a potential surge of cases as a result of these new cases, and a compulsory
testing order was issued in part of the city. The authorities announced they were
investigating how these two patients might have been infected. Today, South China Morning Post says the probe has concluded, and that experts determined transmission was âlikely to have taken
place at a quarantine hotel viadoor hooks used by staff to deliver meal boxes,externalto guestsâ. The head of Hong Kongâs Centre for Health Protection says
specialists found no problem with the hotelâs ventilation or drainage system,
so the focus turned to S-shaped hooks for hanging food deliveries on, which
were âhard to cleanâ. Hong Kong government advisor Professor David Hui says
virus particles âcould stay on metal surfaces such as door handles for two to three daysâ. All designated quarantine hotels have now been told to place meals
on chairs, rather than on hooks. However, some specialists question the door
handle theory, with one respiratory specialist telling SCMP they think âitâs
more likely the patients exhaled virus particles into narrow corridorsâ. Hong Kong has been trying to avoid a local outbreak byimplementing compulsory quarantines,externalfor overseas arrivals, and temporarily banning flights from high-risk
countries, like India, Pakistan and the Philippines. A plan to reopen the Isle of Man's border to non-residents has been backed by the Manx parliament. It includes a phased relaxation of the border closure from 1 May to allow family to visit under strict conditions. And the government'srevised exit frameworksets a date of 28 June for the lifting of all Covid-19 restrictions including mandatory isolation on arrival. The island's border was closed to most non-residents in March 2020. Chief Minister Howard Quayle says aspects of the plan ""may need to change"" in response to any ""unexpected challenges"" thrown up by the pandemic. Backing the plan, Treasury Minister Alfred Cannan says the island now needs to move towards releasing border restrictions ""for the health, wealth and sanity of the nation"". Here's the full story. Meanwhile, pregnant women on the Isle of Manare to be offered a coronavirus vaccination, the health minister has confirmed. A Norwegian climber hoping to summit Everest has confirmed he has tested positive for coronavirus. ""My diagnosis is Covid-19,"" Erlend Ness has told the AFP news agency in a Facebook message. ""I'm doing ok now... The hospital is taking care (of me)."" The climber was evacuated from the slopes by helicopter and taken to a hospital in Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, after spending time at Everest base camp. A sherpa in the camp has also tested positive, Norwegian broadcaster NRK reports. ""I really hope that none of the others get infected with corona high up in the mountains. It is impossible to evacuate people with a helicopter when they're above 8,000m,"" Ness tells NRK. The high altitude makes the danger of Covid-19 - which can affect breathing - far worse. The events come as a blow to Nepal's hopes of fully relaunching its mountaineering season. You can read about the risks of catching coronavirus outdoors here. We've been bringing you updates on the number of people who have had been jabbed so far - and more than 400,000 members of England's adult social care workforce have not received a coronavirus vaccine, figures suggest. Some 80.4% of eligible staff working at older adult care homes had received the jab by 18 April, NHS England says. A total of 72.3% of staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. For social care staff working in other settings in England, including non-registered providers, the figure is 69.4%. Overall, about 1.17 million out of 1.58 million social care staff in these settings have received a first dose, according to analysis by the PA news agency. This leaves 417,989 social care staff (26.4% of the total) who have not been vaccinated or whose vaccination has not yet been reported. The figures come as the Government has opened a public consultation on aproposal for staff to be required to get a jab as a condition of employment to protect elderly residents. A total of 44,450,252 coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,government figures show.,external That's 33,257,651 first doses and 11,192,601 second doses. That's an increase of 416,784 second doses and 117,909 first doses since we brought you the equivalent statistics this time yesterday. Find out when you will get your vaccinehere. A further 18 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,today's government data shows.,external It brings the total number of people to die in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 127,345. A total of 2,729 new infections have also been recorded. The number of over 50s vaccinated has now hit 95% in England, NHS data shows. The take-up among those aged 45-49 is at 59% after they started being offered the jab earlier this month. But uptake among care home staff - one of the first groups to be offered the jab - is still at about 80%, despite attempts to get more to come forward. Latest figures show more than 33 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine with more than 10 million having received both doses. Read more on the vaccine figureshere. Scotland is working on a digital system to allow people to prove their Covid vaccination status, public health officials say. This means Scotland will be ""ready to join"" an international vaccination passport programme. But, national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch says compiling the information is complex and ""we're not near yet"". He says paper ""proof"" - similar to that given to people in England - was ""not a satisfactory solution"". Prof Leitch confirms all four UK countries are discussing the joint digital system. Here's more information on vaccine passports. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin told NI business leaders he was in regular contact with Stormont's first and deputy ministers about the pace of reopening The easing of lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will not be perfectly aligned, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin says. Some measureswill be eased in NI on Friday, but the Irish government is not due to announce relaxations until next month. Martin has been telling NI business leaders he is in regular contact with Stormont's first and deputy ministers about the pace of reopening. ""We keep each other informed,"" he says. ""But I don't see perfect alignment or anything in the next number of weeks. There will be some gaps."" He says this is primarily down to the differences in the speed of vaccination programmes in the two jurisdictions. Read more  Hospitals in Tunisia are reported to have run out of intensive care beds as the country struggles to cope with a surge in coronavirus cases. ""The situation is very critical, medical staff are
exhausted, ICUs have reached their maximum capacity and deaths
are on the rise,"" says Amenallah Messadi, a member of a scientific committee that advises the government. He blames the surge in cases on the spread of the Covid variant that was first detected in Britain. The government has closed all schools until 30 April and
banned people from driving cars at night to restrict movement. Tunisia has recorded about 10,000 deaths since the pandemic began. Keith Farrow said he had been left feeling anxious People in an English town say they are ""in limbo"" over when they will get their second Covid jabs, despite waiting longer than the recommended time. Government guidance says everyone should be offered a second vaccine dose within 12 weeks of the first jab to be fully vaccinated against the virus. But Keith Farrow, 75, who lives in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, says his 12-week wait was up on Sunday 18 April and he is still waiting. Another local resident has told the BBC they feel they have been ""left in limbo"", while others say they are concerned that delays could make them more vulnerable to Covid-19. Deputy chief nurse Rebecca Neno, from NHS Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group, said ""immunity doesn't just end at 12 weeks"". She adds: ""The deliveries of vaccines don't always match exactly to the 12-week interval between vaccinations. ""Some people get called a few weeks early - some get called a few weeks later.""

Stephen Donnelly has told the Irish Parliament the case was being pursued due to the firm's ""complete failure"" to meet its contractual agreements. Donnelly says: ""With regards to AstraZeneca, a legal case has been initiated by the Commission. ""Earlier this week, I have joined Ireland as one of the parties to that case, specifically around AstraZeneca's complete failure to meet its delivery contractual agreements for April, May and June.""

Their first single was Keep On Dancing in 1971, and they had two number one hits in 1975 with Bye Bye Baby and Give A Little Love, plus chart-topping albums with Rollin' in 1974 and 1975's Once Upon A Star. McKeown said the band's first pair of tartan trousers were inspired by a picture on a birthday card and were made by his father, who was a tailor. The vocalist, who left school aged 15 and joined a band called Threshold, went on to join the Bay City Rollers aged 18 in 1973. He left in 1978, as the band decided to go in a more new-wave direction under the new name The Rollers, but he later rejoined for several comeback tours and live recordings. (Left to right) Stuart Wood, Alan Longmuir, Derek Longmuir, Les McKeown and Eric Faulkner of The Bay City Rollers at Heathrow Airport, London in 1975 Recalling the 1975 tour 40 years later, McKeown said it was ""crazy"". ""We would go on and the police would make us stop because they just could not control the crowd,"" he said. When he was on a rare visit home to Edinburgh, McKeown - just 20 at the time - ran over and killed a 76-year-old woman. The day after the accident McKeown rejoined the tour. He said: ""I can remember just being in complete shock. I don't know how long it took me to come out of that shock. ""In retrospect I should have dealt with the issue in a much more comprehensive way."" Despite some witnesses claiming McKeown was driving too fast, a court cleared him of the more serious charge and instead found him of guilty of reckless driving. He was fined Â£100 and banned from driving for a year. McKeown claimed in numerous interviews that the guilt over the incident never left him, and was a big part of his alcoholism, as the Rollers' popularity waned dramatically in the late 1970s. He was also open in interviews about his trips to rehab. Les McKeown and the Bay City Rollers provided part of the soundtrack to a particular chapter in Scotland's modern history. At the height of their success in the mid 1970s, the Bay City Rollers were the biggest pop sensation Scotland had ever seen. Their brand of bubblegum pop won fans across the world and they were unashamedly Scottish. This was a time when few Scottish musicians became international stars other than traditional favourites like Andy Stewart or the Alexander Brothers. The pop music Scottish children and teenagers loved was often from England or America. Outside Scotland, the Rollers were what we would now call brand ambassadors for their country. It can seem preposterous to draw parallels between bubblegum pop, national identity or politics but perhaps there are some. The Rollers loved their tartan at a time when many younger Scots associated it with an older generation or the sentimental, ""kailyard"" image of the country. The peak of their success in the mid 70s coincided with a time when there was intense debate over Scotland's political future - a debate, at times, emboldened by a new self-confidence. Many assumed devolution in the form of a Scottish Assembly in Edinburgh was inevitable. But like so many teen sensations, their success did not last. The decline of the Rollers came around the same time as Scotland's humiliation in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. A year later the plan for a Scottish Assembly failed to win sufficient support in a referendum. Music can be the soundtrack to history. The Bay City Rollers unintentionally provided part of the playlist. The band had two UK number one albums and singles After heleft the band,external, McKeown formed the pop group Egotrip, and released a solo album All Washed Up in 1979. He toured more recently under the name Les McKeown's Bay City Rollers. They had been mid-way through a tour in Toronto as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, and had to return home quickly. The tour had been rebooked for November 2021. McKeowntold the Edinburgh Evening News,externallast August that during lockdown he had ""never had so much time off"", and was usually always on the road for half of the year. Celebrities shared their shock at the news and their own memories of the frontman on social media. Judy Murray, mother of tennis champtions Andy and Jamie Murray, posted two pictures: one of her hugging Les McKeown at a concert, and one of her holding a tartan scarf.

"Government sorry as report finds war graves racismThere is ""no doubt"" prejudice played a part in the failure to commemorate WW1 troops, a minister says.UK","Boris Johnson said he is ""deeply troubled"" by failures to properly commemorate black and Asian troops who died fighting for the British Empire during World War One.

This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologises: ""There can be no doubt prejudice played a part in some of the commission's decisions"" The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which is tasked with commemorating those who died in the two world wars, has also apologised over its findings. Labour MP David Lammy, who was critical to bringing the matter to light, called it a ""watershed moment"". The African soldiers dragged into Europe's war Marking the memories of a million service personnel Mr Wallace said: ""On behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government both of the time and today, I want to apologise for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation. ""Whilst we can't change the past, we can make amends and take action,"" he said. He said there were cases where the commission ""deliberately overlooked evidence"" that would have allowed it to find the names of the dead. And he said there were examples of officials employing an ""overarching imperial ideology connected to racial and religious differences"" in order to ""divide the dead and treat them unequally in ways that were impossible in Europe"". Outlining the next steps, Mr Wallace said the Commonwealth War Graves Commission will: search in the historical record for inequalities in commemoration and act on what is found renew its commitment to equality in commemoration by building physical or digital commemorative structures use its online presence and wider education activities to reach out to all the communities of the former British Empire touched by the two world wars to make sure their hidden history is brought to life and, over the next six months, assemble a global and diverse community of experts to help make this happen Mr Wallace also announced a public consultation over plans to waive the visa fee for service personnel from the Commonwealth and Nepal who choose to settle in the UK in order to honour their contribution. An inquiry by the commission was set up following a 2019 Channel 4 documentary, calledUnremembered,external, which was presented by Mr Lammy. The report found that at least 116,000 casualties from WW1, most of whom were of African, Indian or Egyptian origin, ""were not commemorated by name or possibly not commemorated at all"". But that figure could be as high as 350,000, it said. It also cited racist comments such as the governor of a British colony saying in 1923 that: ""The average native... would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" This video can not be played David Matthews tells the story of his great-uncle who fought in World War One Shadow justice secretary Mr Lammy told the BBC that while making the documentary in Kenya and Tanzania, he discovered mass graves in which Africans had been ""dumped with no commemoration whatsoever"". He said it was a travesty that men who served the British Empire were not commemorated properly, but welcomed the report. ""I'm just really, really pleased that the dignity that these men deserved - who were dragged from their villages and commandeered to work for the British Empire - that dignity that they deserve in death can be granted to them,"" he said. Mr Lammy added that work must be done to find their names in archives where that is possible, and to establish how local communities would like them to be commemorated. He also said Commonwealth soldiers should not be ""whitewashed"" out of history books, while Mr Wallace said it was a ""deep regret"" that his own WW1 education had included ""very little about the contribution from the Commonwealth countries and the wider at the time British Empire"". This video can not be played David Olusoga: ""It's another organisation that's had to be dragged into admitting its history."" Historian Prof David Olusoga, whose TV company produced Unremembered, told BBC Breakfast that apologies were not enough and resources would need to be committed if the commission was serious about restorative justice. ""If the Commonwealth War Graves Commission had set up a committee and discovered that 100,000 white British soldiers lay in mass graves - unmarked, uncommemorated - and the documentation proved that that had been deliberate, what would they do?"" he said. Six million soldiers from the British Empire served in WW1. Between 45,000 and 54,000 Asian and African personnel who died in the conflict were ""commemorated unequally"", the commission said. World War One was the first truly global war, fought not just in the trenches of France but in the Middle East, Asia and Africa Britain's colonies sent millions of men to fight for the empire during the conflict India, which at that time included Pakistan and Bangladesh, sent the most soldiers - more than 1.4 million The British Army in East Africa was mainly composed of African soldiers by November 1918, according to the Imperial War Museum At least 180,000 Africans served in the Carrier Corps in East Africa and provided logistic support to troops at the front Around 15,000 people from the West Indies enlisted in WW1, including 10,000 from Jamaica, according to the National Army Museum Colonies as far away as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) also sent a similar number between them Britain had soldiers from six different continents: Europe, North America, South America, Australasia, Asia and Africa The report concluded that the failure to properly commemorate the individuals was influenced by a scarcity of information, errors inherited from other organisations and the opinions of colonial administrators. ""Underpinning all these decisions, however, were the entrenched prejudices, preconceptions and pervasive racism of contemporary imperial attitudes,"" it added. The report picked out an example from 1923 when the governor of the Gold Coast colony, now Ghana, argued for collective memorials rather than individual ones. At a meeting in London, it was said that the governor, F G Guggisberg, said: ""The average native of the Gold Coast would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" In response, commission employee Arthur Browne said: ""In perhaps two or three hundred years' time, when the native population had reached a higher stage of civilisation, they might then be glad to see that headstones had been erected on the native graves and that the native soldiers had received precisely the same treatment as their white comrades."" The report said Mr Browne's response showed ""what he may have considered foresight, but one that was explicitly framed by contemporary racial prejudice"". The commission, which was founded in 1917 as the Imperial War Graves Commission, said the events of a century ago were wrong then and were wrong now. Its director general, Claire Horton, said: ""We recognise the wrongs of the past and are deeply sorry and will be acting immediately to correct them."" As part of the commission's work to search for unnamed war dead and those who are potentially not commemorated, it will also look at those who died in World War Two, although it is not thought that inequalities seen in WW1 were as widespread then. Ms Horton said the report was ""sober"" reading but gave the commission the ability - ""now that we know the numbers and the areas to look"" - to start the searches properly to ""right the wrongs of the past"". The war graves commission was founded with a remit to remember every individual who had died in World War One, regardless of rank, class, religion or race. The idea of equal treatment was controversial, but it became a cornerstone of remembrance. Outside Europe, however, the commission enacted a policy of extreme discrimination, categorising the fallen as ""white"", ""Indians"" or what it called ""natives"". In southern Kenya, white soldiers lie beneath named memorials in a well-tended cemetery.  Next door in a scruffy field is where their African comrades are buried - no names, just a general memorial. The consequence of the commission's failings is not only to do a great injustice to the black and Asian soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought alongside their white European comrades in two world wars, it is to misrepresent our history.

"Prison chaplain 'conned' by 'remorseful' terroristUsman Khan killed two people a year after being released from prison, an inquest hears.London","Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed by Usman Khan during a conference on rehabilitating offenders A prison chaplain has admitted he may have been ""conned"" by a convicted terrorist who seemingly showed remorse for his actions. Usman Khan was freed in December 2018 after serving a jail term for funding a training camp abroad. Less than a year later, he killed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, at Fishmongers' Hall near London Bridge. The Rev Paul Foster has been giving evidence at the inquests into their deaths at London's Guildhall. Usman Khan had been jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange Mr Foster, who worked with prisoners of all faiths, said Khan had engaged positively with programmes looking at his offending and the impact of his crimes. He added: ""[Khan] had conversations with me about wanting to change and make a fresh start - to pay more attention to the ripple effect of his actions."" Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked: ""Would it have surprised you that, around the time Usman Khan was... engaged in victim awareness, there was intelligence he was trying to radicalise other prisoners?"" Mr Foster said it would. Terror attacker shouted 'I'm going to blow you all up' Hall porter 'stabbed terror attacker with spear' Witness thought terrorist was 'play-fighting' Mr Hough also said that, at the time of his release, there was intelligence that Khan might commit an attack. Mr Foster replied: ""That would be a surprise. ""If that intelligence is correct, he was obviously presenting himself in a way that was likely to deceive the likes of myself and others."" He added: ""I'm open to say I am wrong, and it is possible I have been conned."" Mr Foster also said Khan had spoken ""openly and emotionally"" during a discussion session with a victim of crime. He added: ""We were being presented with a lot of positive things about his behaviour - even some of the prisoners were telling me... in one instance a chap lost his son to a murder and Usman was the person at his door offering his condolences and asking if he could help."" The chaplain described one session with Khan in which he professed ""some shame"" about the impact his crime had on the Muslim community. ""He appeared to show remorse for what he had done,"" Mr Foster said. Nick Armstrong, representing the Merritt family, told the hearing that Khan had been one of about 70 prisoners in the UK categorised as ""high-risk Category A"" - out of a total prison population of 82,000. Dr Amy Ludlow of Cambridge University, who co-founded the Learning Together programme that organised the November 2019 event, told jurors she had not conducted a risk assessment for the Fishmongers' Hall gathering. But if she had, she would have assessed it as being ""low risk"", which would probably have only led to the same measures that were in place on the day, she said. Mr Hough told the witness that prison intelligence in 2017 stated that Khan had been the main inmate for radicalising others and had been involved in ""forced conversations"". Usman Khan sat at the same table as Saskia Jones before the knife attack Dr Ludlow told the inquests that ""people used to call him high-risk Khan"". The jury also heard that Khan completed a Learning Together creative writing course in 2018 and later that year became a mentor to others. In a research paper titled A Study Of Radicalisation In Modern Europe composed while behind bars, Khan said the root of radicalisation and extremism was down to ""personal injustices and grievances found by individuals on a daily basis"". In the paper, Khan also expressed a ""desire to be part of work that moves people away from radicalisation and extremist behaviour"", Dr Ludlow told the hearing. After his release from prison, Dr Ludlow stayed in touch with Khan and invited him to the Fishmongers' Hall event. Jurors saw a text from Khan after she had asked him to ""cheer on"" Learning Together. ""Don't worry you'll hear my cheering all the way from Stafford,"" he had replied, making reference to his hometown. Emails between Dr Ludlow and Khan's probation manager Kenneth Skelton were also read out. In one, on 22 October 2019, Dr Ludlow wrote that Khan would feel more comfortable if someone travelled with him from Stafford to the Fishmongers' Hall event. But a later email, from a Staffordshire police officer, said that sending two officers on the train with Khan could ""not be justified"". In the end, he travelled down alone and was met when his train arrived in London by others attending the event. The inquest hearing continues.

Jaguar Land Rover halts output over chip shortage,"The Castle Bromwich site, near Birmingham, is one of two factories to shut temporarily. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is shutting its two main car factories temporarily due to a shortage of computer chips. The difficulties at Britain's biggest carmaker echo similar problems at other manufacturers, including Ford, who have been hit by a global shortage of chips. JLR said there would be a ""limited period"" of closure at its Halewood and Castle Bromwich sites from Monday. A mixture of strong demand and Covid shutdowns at chipmakers has also hit phone, TV and video games companies. Tata-owned JLR said in a statement: ""We have adjusted production schedules for certain vehicles which means that our Castle Bromwich and Halewood manufacturing plants will be operating a limited period of non-production from Monday 26th April. ""We are working closely with affected suppliers to resolve the issues and minimise the impact on customer orders wherever possible."" Production at a third factory, at Solihull, will continue. The Castle Bromwich factory makes the Jaguar XE, XF and F-Type models, and employs about 1,900 people. Halewood makes the Range Rover, Evoque and the Land Rover Discovery Sport, and has about 4,000 workers. Chip shortage: Samsung warns of 'serious imbalance' Taiwanese chip-maker announces $100bn investment How will 'chipageddon' affect you? The Covid-19 pandemic has driven up demand for semiconductor chips for use in electronics such as computers, as people worked from home, and suppliers are struggling to adjust. There has also been a fire at a Japanese company, part of Renesas Electronics, one of the world's biggest makers of semiconductors for the car industry. Also on Thursday, France's Renault warned that the chip shortage was worsening. On Wednesday, carmaker Stellantis, which owns the UK Vauxhall brand, said it would replace digital speedometers with more old-fashioned analogue ones in one of its Peugeot models, as the fallout continues. Daimler, General Motors and Volkswagen have all suspended production lines at various times in recent weeks. Modern cars contain complex electronics and are heavily reliant on semiconductors, which are used in systems ranging from engine management to parking cameras. Today's cars are computers on wheels, festooned with electronics such as engine management systems, driver aids, cameras and entertainment gadgets. All of these need semiconductors, and right now the entire industry is struggling to get enough of them. It's fighting the consumer electronics sector for the supplies that are available. What has made the auto industry particularly vulnerable is its reliance on just-in-time delivery, where parts are brought in when needed, rather than being stockpiled. Normally this is seen as the efficient way to do things - but the semiconductor shortage has shown just what can happen when normally well-oiled supply chains seize up. Further disruption over the coming weeks and months is inevitable, because it takes time to ramp up chip production. The question now is what carmakers can do to ensure they aren't caught out by a similar supply squeeze in future.

"No 10 announces leak inquiry into PM-Dyson textsTexts show the PM promised to ""fix"" a tax issue for Dyson staff working in the UK during the pandemic.UK Politics","Sir James Dyson texted the prime minister last March when he was involved in efforts to provide ventilators The government has announced an internal inquiry into the leak of private messages between Boris Johnson and businessman Sir James Dyson. Texts published by the BBC showed the prime minister promising Sir James he would ""fix"" an issue on the tax status of Dyson staff working in the UK during the pandemic. Labour has said the messages are part of a pattern of government ""sleaze"". The PM said he made ""no apology"" for trying to get ventilators for the NHS. Asked about the leaks, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""We have instructed the Cabinet Office to look into this."" What is lobbying? A brief guide Welby urges compassion amid political lobbying row What is the David Cameron lobbying row about? Billionaire Dyson moves residency back to the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the issue wasn't about getting hold of ventilators but ""whether those who are well known to the party, the Tory party, friends etc who've got the prime minister's number can access him and ask about tax breaks"". He said people who could access the prime minister directly were in a ""magic circle,"" while others were left ""outside"". He urged the prime minister to ""disclose all of the contacts that he's had"". At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the government asked companies, including Dyson, to help supply ventilators. Sir James sought assurance from the Treasury that his workforce would not be hit with extra taxes if they came to the UK to help with the effort. Having failed to get a response, he contacted the prime minister directly via text. In the messages seen by the BBC, Mr Johnson told Sir James: ""[Chancellor] Rishi [Sunak] says it is fixed!! We need you here."" In a later text Mr Johnson said: ""I am First Lord of the Treasury and you can take it that we are backing you to do what you need."" In a statement, Sir James said he was ""hugely proud"" of  Dyson's actions in the pandemic. He added that Dyson had not ""any benefit from the project"" and that the company had ""voluntarily covered the Â£20m of development costs"". ""Not one penny was claimed from any government, in any jurisdiction, in relation to Covid-19."" When challenged about the texts at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he made ""no apology for moving heaven and earth"" to improve supplies of equipment to treat coronavirus patients. Mr Johnson said there was ""nothing to conceal about this"" and added that he would share details with MPs. The prime minister's official spokesman said No 10 was ""pulling together that information it will be published shortly"". The spokesman did not deny reports that the government's top civil servant Simon Case advised Mr Johnson to change his phone number following concerns that it was too easy for lobbyists and business leaders to contact him Meanwhile, Sir Bernard Jenkin, chair of the Liaison Committee - made up of senior MPs - has said they will consider Labour's request to examine the PM's contacts with Dyson.

'Firm given special treatment' over roadworks bids,"A Stormont department took part in a ""clandestine"" process with a firm bidding for deals to resurface NI's roads, a court has ruled. A judge said the Department for Infrastructure's conduct ""entailed an egregious breach of the principle of transparency"". He added that the firm had been ""accorded special treatment"" by the department. The proceedings centred on eight contracts awarded in 2015 The contracts, for work on roads across Northern Ireland, had a total estimated annual value of up to Â£52m. The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the Department for Infrastructure. In a statement to the BBC, the Department for Infrastructure said: ""The department notes the judgment from the Court of Appeal and we are considering it with our legal advisors."" Senior judges upheld findings that the tendering competition breached the principle of transparency and resulted in a manifest error. The procurement exercise sought the most economically advantageous tender for each contract, based on a criteria where price was weighted at 70% and quality 30%. John McQuillan (Contracts) Ltd bid for seven contacts came out on top in six of them. However, the court heard the company duplicated personnel and plant for each competition - but could only provide site engineers for four contracts at most. A meeting involving civil servants from the Department for Regional Development (DRD) - one of the Department for Infrastructure's predecessors - was held in September 2015, but no minutes were provided. Following subsequent discussions with the department, the firm withdrew two of its six successful tenders. A decision was then taken to offer it contracts for the other four resurfacing projects. Lord Justice McCloskey said that giving top ranking to an operator for more contracts than it had the resources to carry out ""defies common sense and commercial reality"". In July 2020 a High Court judge held that the DRD had wrongly given a mark of excellence in tenders where there were not the necessary resources. He also identified a lack of transparency, unequal treatment and breach of the principle of non-discrimination in the circumstances whereby that company was able to select contracts. Rejecting the department's appeal against those findings, Lord Justice McCloskey concluded that the post-tender evaluation and scoring interaction with the operator ranked first for six contract bids, along with resulting award decisions, breached competition and EU legal rules. ""The department engaged in a secret, bilateral and unrecorded process with one of multiple bidders,"" he said ""In short, (the successful firm was) accorded special treatment in a clandestine and purely bilateral process and, in consequence, the level playing field was distorted for other bidders."" Civil engineering company Northstone (NI) Ltd is suing over the handling of the tendering competition. Northstone was ranked first in one of the eight contracts it tendered for, coming second or third in all the rest.

Mouse deer born at zoo is the height of a pencil,"The tiny mouse deer is only 20cm (8ins) tall to its shoulder A tiny mouse deer, born during lockdown at Bristol Zoo, is only 20cm (8ins) tall to its shoulder, the height of a pencil. The lesser Malayan mouse deer was born to first-time mother Brienne and father Jorah almost a month ago. Its sex is not yet known however it is only the second mouse deer to be born at the zoo in the last decade. Mouse deer are native to South East Asia and when fully grown the infant will weigh about 3lb (1.5kg). Senior mammal keeper Paige Bwye said it would be a little while before the zoo was able to determine the gender of the fawn as they are so small and shy. ""It's doing really well though, and has recently started to discover new tastes, such as sweet potato,"" she said. Keeper Paige Bwye said that mouse deer Brienne ""is being a fantastic first-time mother"" ""Brienne is being a fantastic first-time mother and has been very attentive to her infant. ""They are absolutely fascinating to watch. They move around on their pencil-thin legs and munch on flowers and vegetables."" In 2020, a female mouse deer named Missandei was born at the zoo and moved on to Ouwehands Zoo in the Netherlands, as part of a breeding programme for the species. The zoo has also recently welcomed another new arrival; a baby gorilla was born in December whichhas now been named Juni. Bristol Zoo announcedin Novemberit would be leaving its Clifton site after 185 years and moving to a site just outside of the city.

Rashford recipe plan serves fish finger sandwich,"This video can not be played Marcus Rashford talks BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent through his kitchen adventures Marcus Rashford might be a world-class athlete, but he can still see the value in a fish finger sandwich. That's one of the cheap and simple recipe ideas in a project the footballer is launching to help families cook ""pocket friendly"" meals. With chef Tom Kerridge, the England and Manchester United footballer and food poverty campaigner is going to share the basics of making meals. Mr Rashford said he wanted to make sure no-one ""goes to bed hungry"". The free recipes and online video lessons from this Full Time project will be available each week on Instagram and on recipe cards in supermarkets, schools and food banks. They are aimed at families on a tight budget, but also who might have limited time and no expensive kitchen gadgets or little knowledge of cooking. ""This is like learning to ride a bike. This is right at the beginning with stabilisers, this is peeling carrots, peeling potatoes, dicing onions,"" said Mr Kerridge. The celebrity chef, who runs a Michelin-starred restaurant, is ready to raise his game with a recipe for the ""ultimate fish finger sandwich"". Rashford book club for disadvantaged children Food brands work with Rashford on child food poverty Free meal U-turn after Rashford campaign ""It is one of the first things I learned to cook as a 14-year-old. My mum was at a second job and I would cook tea for my brother, who was 11 years old,"" said Mr Kerridge. There will be a recipe for spaghetti bolognese - which Mr Rashford said was one of his favourite meals. Tom Kerridge wants to give people the confidence to learn to cook The other contender for top food experience, the footballer said, was his grandmother's cooking. ""It was the best Caribbean food ever - I've just never tasted it again. I've been to Caribbean shops, but it's just not the same."" There will be 52 budget recipes, with online tutorials, including chicken satay stir fry, chicken pie and broccoli and cauliflower cheese, with Mr Kerridge showing the Manchester United player how to cook. It's about healthy eating, but in a non-preachy and unpretentious way. ""A lot of young people are afraid of mistakes,"" said Mr Rashford - who is volunteering his own lack of culinary skills to show it's fine to learn something completely from scratch. While the footballing worldhas been convulsed this week by accusations of greed,Mr Rashford is still pursuing his campaign against food poverty. ""Is it fair if people go hungry? No, it's not fair. Whether it's a child or an adult, it doesn't change the fact that it's unfair if somebody goes to sleep without eating a meal,"" he said, in a Zoom call. An ""ultimate fish finger sandwich"" is promised from the weekly recipes If people are sceptical about whether families are really going hungry, he says they should ""go and do some research and even meet people that are struggling"". Mr Rashford has been on his own journey with his food campaigns, which he says has shown him the pressures on families. ""There was a mother and two boys - and the mother was ill with Covid,"" he said of a family he had come across in London. ""And so the 12-year-old was going around his community and washing windows and washing cars for a few pounds, until he had enough to go to the shops and get a meal to put in the microwave, so that his mother and little brother could eat."" Mr Rashford said as a child he liked to spend time with his mother when she was cooking, sitting on a stool in the kitchen. ""Anything I learned in the house it was from my mumâ¦ I'd always watch her cooking. I'd sit there and just have a nosy basically."" On a Zoom call, Marcus Rashford talked of spending time with his mum when she was cooking But not being able to afford food was part of the hardship in his own family growing up. ""I remember sometimes at school I'd fall asleep. I just hadn't eaten food and I wasn't awake, so sometimes I'd literally just fall asleep. So I can see how it has an effect on the ability to learn and their ability to concentrate in class."" Free school meals should be extended through the next summer holidays, he said - and he wanted to encourage the take-up of ""healthy start"" vouchers available to low-income families with young children. When he was young, Mr Rashford's own family used food banks and he was on free school meals - and he wanted to challenge any embarrassment. ""I wanted to get rid of that stigma, because it's the most silly thing I've ever heard,"" he said. ""If you're in need of something - the help is there is there to be used.""

Billionaire Dyson moves residency back to the UK,"Sir James faced criticism in 2019 after announcing that he would relocate his firm's global head office High-profile businessman Sir James Dyson has moved his residency back to the UK from Singapore. He now lives primarily in the UK according to filings for his companies, which include his family office. Sir James had faced criticism after he announced that he would relocate his firm's global head office to Singapore in 2019. This week he was also involved in a controversy over texting Prime Minister Boris Johnson about tax issues. Labour calls for probe into PM-Dyson texts Dyson to move head office to Singapore Sir James Dyson: From barrows to billions A Dyson spokesman declined to comment on Sir James' residence and tax status but did say: ""The structure of the group and the business rationale underpinning it are unaltered."" ""Singapore is, and remains, the global headquarters of Dyson, our leadership team is based here and it is the centre of our sales, engineering and manufacturing operations,"" he said. A prominent supporter of Brexit with an estimated fortune of more than $20bn, Sir James was criticised after the announcement in 2019 that Dyson was moving its headquarters to Singapore from Malmesbury in Wiltshire. At the time, the company said just two senior executives would be relocated and no jobs would be lost in the UK as a result of the move. This video can not be played Starmer: Is it right to change tax rules for Dyson? Sir James has this week been at the centre of a political row in Britain after it was revealed that he texted Boris Johnson in March last year to get assurance that his staff would not face a change in their tax situation if they came to the UK to help make ventilators in response to Covid-19. The texts - seen by the BBC - show Mr Johnson saying he could ""fix"" tax issues relating to Dyson staff who came to the UK to work on the pandemic. But the prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson had abided by the ministerial code, governing conduct in office, and had ""informed officials in a timely manner"" after his contact with Sir James. Labour has called for a ""thorough investigation"" into Mr Johnson's contacts with Sir James. This video can not be played Sir James Dyson says leaving the EU has given the UK ""freedom of spirit"" When Sir James announced Dyson would move its global headquarters, he was accused of hypocrisy,after arguing in the run-up to the Brexit referendumthat the UK would gain more from leaving the EU than it would lose. However, in arecent interview with the BBC, he said: ""We're a British company - I've put a lot into this country. ""I can't make things here and bring over all the components from the Far East here, assemble them here and then send them back to the Far East. That just doesn't work."" Earlier this month, Dyson announced plans to create 200 new jobs at its research facilities in Malmesbury and Hullavington, Wiltshire. The plans are part of a Â£2.75bn global investment plan into emerging technologies and products. Sir James said the end of the UK's transition period with the EU had enabled Dyson to hire the engineering talent it was lacking in the UK. Freedom of movement between the UK and EU has ended and the government has introduced a points-based immigration system which it says ""treats all applicants equally, regardless of where they come from"". However, some argue that UK companies who want to hire from outside the EU are in no better position than before Brexit, while attempts to hire EU workers now face significant costs and administration that did not exist before. The text messages between Sir James Dyson and the PM show his concern about the Statutory Residence Test for his company's ability to help make ventilators. This test is designed to ensure that those working abroad and not paying UK income tax, really do work abroad and have few ties to the UK. They are quite complex, but broadly speaking if total or consecutive days are spent in the UK above some threshold, or if they are spent working, than the worker no longer qualifies for non residence. In the case of a Singapore-resident Briton that would mean earnings incurring a tax rate of up to 45% in the UK rather than up to 22% there. Sir James is lobbying the PM, that if, as requested by Mr Johnson in mid-March, help is needed making ventilators, then this barrier to spending more time in the UK needs to be set aside. The Dyson owner clearly felt it was a material barrier to his ability to help. In the end, the project did not proceed. JCB did make housings for Dyson's prototypes. But it proved too challenging for a new design to get rigorous medical safety approvals. The project to supply the UK was paused on 24 April. Manufacturers turned to mass manufacture of an existing design. But the government did change the law, with Section 190 of the Finance Bill disregarding working days between March and June 2020 from residence calculations, for those working on treatment, prevention and medical products to deal with the pandemic. It is unclear how many workers benefitted from this provision, at Dyson or elsewhere. Indeed, it might not become clear, even to tax authorities, until that financial year's returns are filed next January.

E.On compensates customers after Christmas blunder,"E.On will pay more than Â£650,000 in compensation after the energy giant took payments from customers earlier than agreed, leaving some people facing financial difficulties over Christmas. Energy regulator Ofgem said the firm took money from 1.6 million customers on 24 December instead of in January. Consequently, customers may have experienced ""difficulty making payments in the run up to Christmas"". Ofgem said E.On reported the problem on the day it occurred. It added that the company had continued to engage with Ofgem in January and February this year. E.On has paid more than Â£55,000 to customers who said they had ""suffered additional bank charges, out of pocket expenses or other detriment, as a result of the direct debits being taken early"". The company has also agreed to pay Â£627,312 to Ofgem's energy redress fund which, as well as being available for customers who have been affected by this issue, also supports ""energy consumers in vulnerable situations"". Direct debit customers set for energy bill refunds The payments were taken early after E.On had made changes to ""friendly credit hours for pre-payment customers between Christmas and New Year"". The regulator said: ""Ofgem considers that E.On failed to conduct the appropriate checks to ensure that this would not lead to any unintended consequences for customers."" The BBC reported on Christmas Eve thatcustomers faced being overdrawn with their banksover the festive period because of the early payment. Allow Twitter content?

""This failure is a reminder to suppliers that when making changes to their systems, they need to undertake appropriate checks to avoid any unintended consequences for customers."" The energy company said it would continue to make redress and goodwill payments to customers who make legitimate claims in relation to this issue. Ms Rossington said: ""Customers who have been negatively affected and haven't already spoken to E.On about it, should contact E.On if they wish to make a claim for any bank charges or other detriment caused by the early direct debit payments.""

Covid no longer top death cause in England & Wales,"Coronavirus is no longer the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to Office for National Statistics data Covid had been the leading cause of death every month between November and February India has recorded the highest one day tally of cases of any country since the pandemic began - 314,835 in 24 hours The number of over 50s vaccinated has now hit 95% in England, NHS data shows Ireland's health minister says the European Commission has started a legal case against vaccine maker AstraZeneca, over not fulfilling a contract The UK Government says an internal inquiry is being held into the leak of texts between Boris Johnson and businessman Sir James Dyson Labour has called for a ""thorough investigation"" into Johnson's contact with Dyson, whose firm was asked to help make ventilators Driving tests in England and Wales resume after being suspended due to the virus, but there is a large backlog Edited by James Clarke Thank you for joining us for live coronavirus news, we will have more for you tomorrow. Your updates today were written by Alex Therrien, Ella Wills, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. They were edited by James Clarke. Tom Davis passed his driving test after a four-month wait And as we come towards the end of our updates, here's a recap of the day's main pandemic news in the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi Many countries in Africa are getting AstraZeneca vaccines through the Covax scheme The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa Centres for
Disease Control (Africa CDC) are urging African countries not to destroy Covid-19
vaccines that have expired. The WHO is asking countries on the continent to hold on to expired
stock and wait for further guidance. The call comes after Malawi and South Sudan said they would
discard more than 70,000 doses of the AstraZeneca jab that were out of date. The Africa CDC says it has spoken to the manufacturer and has been
reassured the vaccines are still safe. Many vaccines can be used up to 36 months after manufacture but, because
Covid-19 jabs are so new, there is not enough data to prove their effectiveness over
longer periods. Whatever the guidance, the final decision rests with national drug
regulators. However, the issue will further increase the challenges around persuading people
on the continent to get vaccinated. The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in Africa has been slow, partly because of
supply issues and scepticism about the jab. Out of 55 African countries, 41 have benefited from the delivery
of vaccines via the global-sharing scheme Covax. Seven are yet to receive their
first batch. A deal has been struck over emergency funding to combat the record backlog of almost 58,000 Crown Court cases caused by funding delays  and exacerbated by the pandemic. The Lord Chief Justice will be able to ask the government for unlimited funding to open up more courtrooms in England and Wales wherever judges are available. But it's not clear in practice how many extra court sitting days will be achievable because of the challenges of social distancing. This restricts the number of defendants who can be safely held in each building - so much so that two courtrooms in Manchester are being knocked into one to allow major gang trials to progress. Find out more on how Covid has impacted criminal caseshere. Households in various of areas of Birmingham are being asked to take Covid-19 PCR tests after a small number of cases of the South Africa variant were found in the city. The cases are not thought to be connected to each other. People aged over 16 in theAlum Rock, Glebe Farm and Tile Cross wards of Birmingham,externalare the latest to be targeted. Testing has already been introduced for people aged 16 and over who live or work in theLadywood, Soho and Jewellery Quarter wards,external. In addition, everybody aged 11 years and over who lives in, works in, or travels through the London boroughs of Lambeth and Wandsworth is being asked to take a PCR test. Forty-four confirmed cases, and 30 probable cases, of the South Africa varianthave been found,externalin the area. All identified cases are self-isolating, or have completed their isolation. Their contacts have been traced and asked to isolate. People living in certain parts of SE16 in theLondon Borough of Southwark,externalare also being contacted - after a case linked to the Lambeth/Wandsworth cluster was identified. Surge testing linked to the South Africa variant is also taking place in parts of: You can find out about surge testing and the new variantshere. Vientiane, Laos Laos has introduced tough lockdown restrictions in its capital and closed its international borders to most traffic due to a Covid cluster in neighbouring Thailand. People living in the capital Vientiane cannot leave the city and only those with permission can enter. Residents can also leave the house for essential food shopping, hospital visits and other authorised tasks. The restrictions last until 5 May. It comes as 28 new cases were confirmed yesterday and six more today, bringing the overall count to 94 - meaning about a third of the cases recorded in the nation since the pandemic began have been in the past two days. The government-owned Vientiane Times reported 26 of yesterday's 28 new cases had contact with a student who had caught the virus from a Thai man. Annabel RackhamBBC Newsbeat Jack Croucher passed in Torquay with no minor faults We've been catching up with learner drivers on the day tests have restarted in England and Wales. Jack Croucher, 22, managed to get hold of a test at ""really short notice"" - so only had three days to prepare. He passed his test with no minor faults but in part credits his dad, who is a professional driving instructor, for free tuition during lockdown. ""Driving up [to the test centre] I was really nervous but once I got into the flow of it, it went really easy and I enjoyed it,"" he says. Courtney Osborn can't wait to take her son out in the car Courtney Osborn is going to use her new-found freedom to go visit her gran - after passing her test this morning. ""I started [learning to drive] in December 2019 and already had had two tests cancelled because of lockdown,"" says the 22-year-old. To get back up to speed in time for the test, Courtney took part in an intensive course when lessons resumed earlier this month. Courtney, who isn't working at the moment, lives in a village in Norfolk and says it's been frustrating not being able to drive anywhere. ""It's been really hard being stuck and now I can take my son out."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People line up to be tested in Hong Kong Over the past week, there has been concern in Hong Kong after a
couple of locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19 were identified involving a
mutant strain. One of the patients had no history of travel, and the other had
already completed 21 days of quarantine after arriving from Dubai. On Monday, health officials in Hong Kong warned there could
be a potential surge of cases as a result of these new cases, and a compulsory
testing order was issued in part of the city. The authorities announced they were
investigating how these two patients might have been infected. Today, South China Morning Post says the probe has concluded, and that experts determined transmission was âlikely to have taken
place at a quarantine hotel viadoor hooks used by staff to deliver meal boxes,externalto guestsâ. The head of Hong Kongâs Centre for Health Protection says
specialists found no problem with the hotelâs ventilation or drainage system,
so the focus turned to S-shaped hooks for hanging food deliveries on, which
were âhard to cleanâ. Hong Kong government advisor Professor David Hui says
virus particles âcould stay on metal surfaces such as door handles for two to three daysâ. All designated quarantine hotels have now been told to place meals
on chairs, rather than on hooks. However, some specialists question the door
handle theory, with one respiratory specialist telling SCMP they think âitâs
more likely the patients exhaled virus particles into narrow corridorsâ. Hong Kong has been trying to avoid a local outbreak byimplementing compulsory quarantines,externalfor overseas arrivals, and temporarily banning flights from high-risk
countries, like India, Pakistan and the Philippines. A plan to reopen the Isle of Man's border to non-residents has been backed by the Manx parliament. It includes a phased relaxation of the border closure from 1 May to allow family to visit under strict conditions. And the government'srevised exit frameworksets a date of 28 June for the lifting of all Covid-19 restrictions including mandatory isolation on arrival. The island's border was closed to most non-residents in March 2020. Chief Minister Howard Quayle says aspects of the plan ""may need to change"" in response to any ""unexpected challenges"" thrown up by the pandemic. Backing the plan, Treasury Minister Alfred Cannan says the island now needs to move towards releasing border restrictions ""for the health, wealth and sanity of the nation"". Here's the full story. Meanwhile, pregnant women on the Isle of Manare to be offered a coronavirus vaccination, the health minister has confirmed. A Norwegian climber hoping to summit Everest has confirmed he has tested positive for coronavirus. ""My diagnosis is Covid-19,"" Erlend Ness has told the AFP news agency in a Facebook message. ""I'm doing ok now... The hospital is taking care (of me)."" The climber was evacuated from the slopes by helicopter and taken to a hospital in Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, after spending time at Everest base camp. A sherpa in the camp has also tested positive, Norwegian broadcaster NRK reports. ""I really hope that none of the others get infected with corona high up in the mountains. It is impossible to evacuate people with a helicopter when they're above 8,000m,"" Ness tells NRK. The high altitude makes the danger of Covid-19 - which can affect breathing - far worse. The events come as a blow to Nepal's hopes of fully relaunching its mountaineering season. You can read about the risks of catching coronavirus outdoors here. We've been bringing you updates on the number of people who have had been jabbed so far - and more than 400,000 members of England's adult social care workforce have not received a coronavirus vaccine, figures suggest. Some 80.4% of eligible staff working at older adult care homes had received the jab by 18 April, NHS England says. A total of 72.3% of staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. For social care staff working in other settings in England, including non-registered providers, the figure is 69.4%. Overall, about 1.17 million out of 1.58 million social care staff in these settings have received a first dose, according to analysis by the PA news agency. This leaves 417,989 social care staff (26.4% of the total) who have not been vaccinated or whose vaccination has not yet been reported. The figures come as the Government has opened a public consultation on aproposal for staff to be required to get a jab as a condition of employment to protect elderly residents. A total of 44,450,252 coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,government figures show.,external That's 33,257,651 first doses and 11,192,601 second doses. That's an increase of 416,784 second doses and 117,909 first doses since we brought you the equivalent statistics this time yesterday. Find out when you will get your vaccinehere. A further 18 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,today's government data shows.,external It brings the total number of people to die in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 127,345. A total of 2,729 new infections have also been recorded. The number of over 50s vaccinated has now hit 95% in England, NHS data shows. The take-up among those aged 45-49 is at 59% after they started being offered the jab earlier this month. But uptake among care home staff - one of the first groups to be offered the jab - is still at about 80%, despite attempts to get more to come forward. Latest figures show more than 33 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine with more than 10 million having received both doses. Read more on the vaccine figureshere. Scotland is working on a digital system to allow people to prove their Covid vaccination status, public health officials say. This means Scotland will be ""ready to join"" an international vaccination passport programme. But, national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch says compiling the information is complex and ""we're not near yet"". He says paper ""proof"" - similar to that given to people in England - was ""not a satisfactory solution"". Prof Leitch confirms all four UK countries are discussing the joint digital system. Here's more information on vaccine passports. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin told NI business leaders he was in regular contact with Stormont's first and deputy ministers about the pace of reopening The easing of lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will not be perfectly aligned, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin says. Some measureswill be eased in NI on Friday, but the Irish government is not due to announce relaxations until next month. Martin has been telling NI business leaders he is in regular contact with Stormont's first and deputy ministers about the pace of reopening. ""We keep each other informed,"" he says. ""But I don't see perfect alignment or anything in the next number of weeks. There will be some gaps."" He says this is primarily down to the differences in the speed of vaccination programmes in the two jurisdictions. Read more  Hospitals in Tunisia are reported to have run out of intensive care beds as the country struggles to cope with a surge in coronavirus cases. ""The situation is very critical, medical staff are
exhausted, ICUs have reached their maximum capacity and deaths
are on the rise,"" says Amenallah Messadi, a member of a scientific committee that advises the government. He blames the surge in cases on the spread of the Covid variant that was first detected in Britain. The government has closed all schools until 30 April and
banned people from driving cars at night to restrict movement. Tunisia has recorded about 10,000 deaths since the pandemic began. Keith Farrow said he had been left feeling anxious People in an English town say they are ""in limbo"" over when they will get their second Covid jabs, despite waiting longer than the recommended time. Government guidance says everyone should be offered a second vaccine dose within 12 weeks of the first jab to be fully vaccinated against the virus. But Keith Farrow, 75, who lives in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, says his 12-week wait was up on Sunday 18 April and he is still waiting. Another local resident has told the BBC they feel they have been ""left in limbo"", while others say they are concerned that delays could make them more vulnerable to Covid-19. Deputy chief nurse Rebecca Neno, from NHS Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group, said ""immunity doesn't just end at 12 weeks"". She adds: ""The deliveries of vaccines don't always match exactly to the 12-week interval between vaccinations. ""Some people get called a few weeks early - some get called a few weeks later."" Read the full story here. Ireland's Health Minister has said a legal case has now been started by the European Commission against AstraZeneca. Stephen Donnelly has told the Irish Parliament the case was being pursued due to the firm's ""complete failure"" to meet its contractual agreements. Donnelly says: ""With regards to AstraZeneca, a legal case has been initiated by the Commission. ""Earlier this week, I have joined Ireland as one of the parties to that case, specifically around AstraZeneca's complete failure to meet its delivery contractual agreements for April, May and June."" His comments come after Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said a decision was yet to be made over whether to sue the British-Swedish vaccine maker, as we reported within the past hour. Â© 2025 BBC.

Biden announces US will halve emissions by 2030,"The US has unveiled an updated carbon pledge that will see its emissions nearly halved by 2030 President Joe Biden will host 40 leaders at a virtual summit in the White House to raise ambition on tackling climate change The meeting will aim to re-assert US global leadership in the area after President Trump pulled the country out of the Paris agreement President Biden has made the climate a key focus for his administration, re-joining the Paris agreement on his first day in office Ahead of the meeting, officials urged greater ambition, particularly among countries perceived as ""laggards"" on climate The leaders of China, the UK, India, Canada, France, Germany, South Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Russia are all attending Observers have been closely watching China - the world's top emitter - for any commitments it might make at the meeting Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs, Mark Kinver, Marianna Brady, Sam Cabral and Holly Honderich Day One of the White House's Earth Day climate summit has now ended. Over six sessions, we heard from leaders, officials and activists from more than 40 countries, including top officials in the Biden administration. Day Two takes place tomorrow, with two final sessions. Thanks for following our reporting and analysis. Live coverage was brought to you by Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral, and edited by Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs and Mark Kinver. The BBC's Outside Source programme asked three young climate activists about their thoughts on the Leaders Summit. Here's what they said. Daisy Jeffrey in Australia -  part of âFridayâs for Futureâ campaign âI would hope to see significantly more pressure put on Australia by this US presidential administration than the last. âI hope that this summit will see the Australian government bow to political pressure, because at the moment instead of looking to invest in renewables and a renewable future this government is investing in gas and saying that gas is the way forward and that is simply an inaccurate and quite backwards way of thinking. âWeâre tackling climate change abysmally.â Melissa Kowara in Indonesia  - a member of Extinction Rebellion Indonesia âFirst of all they have to declare that we have an emergency to begin with, because the level of awareness and the climate literacy is still so slow and this declaration will work as a mandate to all the ministries, all the private entity and the civil society to actually act together. âWhat I really want to see is that countries around the world start really looking into tackling the climate crisis issue directly at its roots.â Thandile Chinyavanhu in South Africa â part of Greenpeace Africa âItâs very important that our government takes action and deviates away from our fossil fuel addiction. âI donât believe South Africaâs ambitions are ambitious enough.â Critics of climate change proposals often question whether climate advocates are willing to make eco-friendly changes to their personal lives. Will you stop eating meat? Will you stop riding on airplanes? Will you take shorter baths? With an Earth Day climate summit hosted by the White House in full swing, those critics turned their eyes to national climate advisor Gina McCarthy and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, for their choice of transportation to attend an event touting electric vehicles. Buttigieg has made a show of riding to his meetings on a bicycle, but was also recently pictured taking that bike off the back of an SUV parked a few blocks away. Allow Twitter content?

There has been plenty of reaction coming in to the announcements at the Leaders Summit. Here's a selection of the comments from environmental campaign groups. Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said:âWe need more ambitious commitments from the big emitters and more binding plans on climate finance, fossil fuel phase outs, and nature restoration which match the urgency of the crisis we face.â Melita Steele, programme director of Greenpeace Africa, commented:âAfrican leaders must do more than just be at the table of biodiversity and climate summits. ""We need them to be serious about tackling emissions at home and unequivocal about protecting their countryâs natural biodiversity in order to tackle a climate crisis which has the continent seeing worse and worse extreme weather impacts every year.â Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said: â[Canadaâs] new target is not aligned with a 1.5C compatible future - that would require a 60% emissions reduction goal. âWe hope to see Canada continue to ramp up ambition, both in future years and as NDC consultations occur in coming months on the road to [the COP26 climate meeting in] Glasgow.â Abby Maxman, chief executive of Oxfam America, described President Bidenâs announcement as a âstep in the right directionâ but added that more action was needed. âThe richest 1% of the worldâs population are responsible for more than twice as much carbon pollution as the 3.1 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity,"" she said. âAs the worldâs richest country and largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the US owes it to the world's most vulnerable to increase its emissions reductions target in order to prevent additional climate change impacts.""  In a separate breakout session, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is leading officials from around the world in a discussion of nature-based solutions to reduce emissions and strengthen climate resilience. Nature-based efforts have been proposed around the world to combat climate change, by reducing deforestation and the loss of wetlands, restoring marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history, has made restorative justice a key aspect of her climate change goals. She is moderating a panel that includes environmental ministers from Canada, Costa Rica, Gabon, Indonesia, Peru and the Seychelles, as well as two indigenous activists. The Biden administration has indicated that climate change will be a key plank of its foreign policy. His director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, and ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield both argue it requires a diplomatic, economic and militaristic effort, what administration officials refer to as ""a whole-of-government effort"". They note the Pentagon has already designated climate change as a national security threat and as a threat multiplier. In the US, the past year has seen wildfires in California, hurricanes in Louisiana and blackouts in Texas, says Thomas-Greenfield, while the world has seen monsoons, droughts and other disasters. ""It doesn't matter where you live. Climate change is a challenge for every person, in every country,"" she says. Only ""a multilateral toolkit"" can ensure that countries and people do not fight over scare resources as the world gets warmer, she says. Thomas-Greenfield says real global cooperation can instead bring ""shared economic opportunity"". Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is now leading a session on how the climate crisis poses a threat to energy, economic and national security. ""Few things deserve to be called existential, but the climate crisis is existential,"" he says, detailing problems caused by coastal erosion, natural disasters and other impacts of global warming. He notes that the US intelligence community under President Biden is undertaking comprehensive climate assessments, which it had not done before. He points out the UK's intelligence assessments of climate security have ""raised the bar"" on how to do these evaluations. Austin is joined by director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and defence officials from six different countries. Nick BeakeEurope Correspondent Pope Francis has just added his voice. In a video
recorded in the Vatican, he warned that the climate crisis will take on an even
greater significance in the post-pandemic world. Leaders must do more to
protect the gift of nature, he stressed. In another message, to mark Earth Day
â an annual event calling for greater protection of the environment â Francis
said Covid-19 had proved the global community could work together to tackle a
catastrophic threat. But the head of the Catholic Church said if leaders were
not courageous and truthful in their efforts to combat climate change, the
result would be self-destruction. When then-President Trump visited Rome in
2017, Francis brought up in conversation the race to save the planet. But
just a week later Trump announced America was to withdraw from the Paris
climate agreement. However, the new incumbent in the White House, a proud
Catholic, appears much more on the Popeâs wavelength. Michael Regan, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is steering an all-female panel of American mayors, global and Indigenous leaders focused on ground-up solutions in their communities. The women gathered today are a ""testament to how women around the world are raising the mantle of climate leadership, developing sustainable solutions"", Regan says. Introducing Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim of the Indigenous Women and Peoples Association of Chad, Regan notes that the world's Indigenous people make up only about 5% of the global population but effectively protect about 80% of global biodiversity. ""How we can lead in harmony with nature?"" Ibrahim says. ""Without Indigenous peoples there is no way."" She says developed countries must now follow the leadership of Indigenous communities in taking climate action. For us, she says, ""protection of nature it is not a policy, it is our way of life"". Asha Karim survived a narrow escape from the 2020California wildfires. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? While of course I wish we'd done more earlier, I think it's never too late to act. Any reduction in harm to the planet is worthwhile. We got here by largely ignoring the problem, so to decide that it's now too late to do anything, that ignorance somehow freed us from responsibility strikes me as selfish and silly. Climate change is a series of positive feedback loops that will keep building upon one another, even more rapidly if we don't change course. Will politics get in the way? It is politicised, in that there is lot of vested financial interest in maintaining the status quo. That financial power is very present in American politics, and we see it reflected in subsidies and lax regulation in many of the industries that heavily contribute to our emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I hope we can lead the way to a much higher standard than we see globally today. I think that committing to the level of action we see elsewhere is a step in the right direction, but far from enough. Being that it is a politicised problem, it may take a while to make change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? What do you hope the US government will do first? I think the American people are onboard with the plan. Climate change has become difficult to ignore. More intense storms, fire seasons, shifts in weather patterns impacting local wildlife - there is some effect of climate change that has touched every person's life in some way. I think most Americans would like to see the US take this problem seriously. As for what we should do first, cutting subsidies for meat and dairy production and reducing our dependence on coal would be impactful places to start. Today's climate summit has a lot of important people making a lot of big promises to combat climate change - carbon caps, finance adaptation, and international cooperation. But let's go back to square one - what even is climate change? The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past. There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. Read more about the basics of climate change. Kim Cobb is a climate scientist. She works at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? This is exactly what we need to get back on track. It is absolutely reflecting a high level of ambition. It's roughly in line with science based targets to keep warming to a minimum this century. We really have an army of amazing folks working on this in DC right now. The winds are at our back in this particular moment. With every American talking about jobs, talking about public health benefits in our low carbon future, this is language that resonates. And I think that there's a way to craft this policy to make sure that there's equity for all and economic benefits for all along the way. I'm just inspired to try to do what I can to go as far as we can, as best as we can. Will politics get in the way? Obviously, getting anything through Congress right now is not a slam dunk, to put it mildly. And I think the devil is going to be in the details as to exactly how this policy is crafted to appeal across the aisle. I have confidence that this administration is bringing people who have worked on policies successfully before. So I think everything we're hearing right now is really aligned towards success. But the next months are going to be absolutely crucial. What do you hope the US government will do first? How are we going to make sure that communities that are deeply invested in fossil fuel infrastructure are not left out of the economic winds in our low carbon future? These kinds of issues are going to be important in terms of building that coalition. At the same time, you have to address the long standing voices who have brought this kind of target forward, such as the youth voices and the people who have focused on environmental justice. Around the world, there are teams of people who are working to track down and destroy hidden sources of greenhouse gases - stopping them from harming the planet. Some of the gases, which are used in refrigeration, have many times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. The BBC's Tom Heap meets some of the people part working to stop these gases causing damage to the planet. Read about the best climate solution you haven't heard of. Victoria Coles is an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? It is never too little too late! As the administrationâs proposed infrastructure plan notes, we already need to spend billions on mitigating climate impacts to build resilience for roads, airports, ports and other infrastructure. That doesn't include the billions from climate and weather-related losses since 1980. Those costs of prior inaction should be front and center when we think about the expense of reducing emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I am a scientist, not a policy expert. However, I think that legislative rather than executive action is required to stabilise US climate policy from changes in administration. I hope that the American Jobs Plan retains its aggressive investment in climate related action and that, at a minimum, some form of climate legislation can make it through congress. In my view, this, coupled with action rather than discussion, will be needed to convince global leaders that America is serious about climate change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? TheYale climate opinion maps,externaldemonstrate clearly that the majority of Americans support climate policies such as carbon taxes and tax rebates for electric vehicles. The only question in their survey that was not over 50% pro-climate was ""the percentage of adults who think global warming will harm them personally"". Americans worry about climate, they view it as harmful to plants, animals, developing countries and other Americans. But until they view it as an existential threat to their own families, they may not vote for candidates that recognise the climate crisis as a threat to global and national interests. Reality Check At the climate summit, leaders sought to outbid each other with their pledges on cutting carbon emissions over the next decade. The numbers can be confusing, so letâs try to make sense of them. The US pledged to cut carbon emissions by around 50% (from 2005 levels) by 2030. The UK announced a ""world-leading"" target to cut emissions by 78% (from 1990 levels) by 2035, having previously committed to 68% by 2030. Other countries such as Canada have also increased their commitments. Different countries use different years as the starting point for comparison, usually from when their emissions peaked â partly to show their pledges in the best light. For example, the US compares their 2030 target to 2005 levels, and the UK uses 1990 levels - about the time when emissions peaked in their respective countries. However, by either comparison point, the UKâs 2030 target is the most ambitious. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joined other world leaders in today's summit as part of a special session of climate finance. Ardern urged other countries to follow New Zealand's lead in pricing carbon, ending subsidies for fossil fuels and finance environmental adaption. And for Ardern - calling in some 14,000 km from the summit's host - the appearance meant a rather inconvenient call time. On Instagram, the prime minister noted she had a 02:00am local call time for the international meeting. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

French President Emmanuel Macron urges world to 'move more quickly' in tackling climate change. John Kerry, US President Joe Biden's Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, has led a roundtable of global financial leaders - all making their own commitments to tackle the climate crisis. David Malpass, President of the World Bank Group, promised record spending ""in the way that gets the most done"". ""The core of the plan is to spend more,"" he said - focused on flattening carbon emissions from the world's biggest emitters. Malpass also acknowledged what he called the ""severity and the inequality of the current environment"" - noting that poverty, inequality and climate change are linked and require a comprehensive, inclusive solution. Chief executive of Citigroup, Jane Fraser, followed shortly after, repeating the corporation's March commitment to be net zero in carbon emissions by 2050. ""Net zero is easy to say, but very hard to do,"" Fraser said. Kerry thanked her for the support but said that reaching net zero - a formidable challenge - will still not be enough. ""Even if we get to net zero, we still have to get carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,"" he said. ""This is a bigger challenge than a lot of people have grabbed on to yet."" Greta Thunberg is now speaking about the emotional toll of the climate fight on young people. She is pressed on the issue by California Democrat Katie Porter, who says her nine-year-old child told her: ""The Earth is burning and we're all going to die."" Thunberg says it's ""understandable"" that younger generations might be saddened or angry by global warming and political inaction. ""It would be strange if we didn't feel that way because then we wouldn't have any empathy."" ""But there is still much hope and, if we choose to take action and act together, there's unlimited things that we can do."" She adds that her experience taught her that ""the best medication against anger and anxiety is to take action yourself"". The hearing on fossil fuel subsidies now comes to an end. Greta Thunberg tells the US House Environment Subcommittee that, in her conversations, she found a lot of readiness for climate action. ""People are actually more open for change than we realise,"" she says. To those who depend on the fossil fuel industry for jobs and livelihoods, she says: ""Who can blame them?"" People working within the industry ""cannot be left behind,"" she adds. Pointing out that climate issues are not the fault of those people, Thunberg notes that climate advocates would prefer to work with the industry than against or without it. ""Climate justice is social justice. We can't achieve climate justice without social justice,"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"India sees world's highest-ever daily Covid casesThe country records 314,835 new daily cases as Delhi hospitals fear running out of oxygen in hours.India","This video can not be played Scenes outside a hospital in Delhi, where people are dying without getting the treatment they need India has recorded the highest one-day tally of new Covid-19 cases anywhere in the world - and the country's highest number of deaths over 24 hours. It has close to 16 million confirmed cases, second only to the US. The country is struggling with a second wave, raising more fears about its overwhelmed health care system. Crowds have formed outside hospitals in major cities which are filled to capacity. A number of people have died while waiting for oxygen. Families are waiting hours to perform funeral rites, Reuters news agency reports, with at least one Delhi crematorium resorting to building pyres in its car park in order to cope with the numbers arriving. What is the India Covid variant? Why second Covid wave is devastating India How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave 'It feels like we're back to square one in India' Meanwhile, some countries are bringing in stricter rules affecting travel to and from India amid fears over the rising cases. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the number of flights between the two countries would be cut, while theUK has added India to a red list, restricting travel and bringing in hotel quarantine for all arrivals from Indiafrom Friday morning. India is struggling to cope with the soaring numbers - it recorded some 314,835 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,104. Oxygen supply has been a particular problem, with a number of hospitals in the capital Delhi running out entirely on Thursday, according to the city's Deputy Chief Minister, Manish Sisodia. Numerous other hospitals are understood to be running dangerously low on supplies, including one treating another Indian politician, Saurabh Bharadwaj. Delhi legislature member Mr Bharadwaj posted a plea for help in Hindi on Twitter from his hospital bed, saying there were just three hours of oxygen left. ""A lot of people are dependent on oxygen and without oxygen,these people will die just like fish die in the absence of water,"" he said, according to a translation by news channel NDTV,external. ""This is a time for all to come together to work."" The crisis worked its way to Delhi's highest court on Wednesday, where judges publicly criticised the central government for its handling of the oxygen crisis in the city. ""This is ridiculous. We want to know what the centre is doing with regard to oxygen supply across India,"" the judges said while reading out the verdict in a petition by the owner of six private hospitals. On Thursday, as hospitals warned stocks were rapidly diminishing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting to attempt to end the crisis. He asked officials to find ways to produce more oxygen, while telling states to come down ""heavily"" on anyone hoarding supplies. By Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi My phone is constantly ringing with desperate friends and family asking for help to arrange beds and medicine.  Some I am able to help, and some I can't. I personally know of many cases where patients died because they couldn't get oxygen in time. It's heart-breaking for families to hear that the hospital where their loved ones are being treated may soon run out of oxygen. Emergency intervention from the government has stopped any big disaster from happening so far, but there is an urgent need to give hospitals enough oxygen so they can sustain the increasing caseload. But experts are asking why the government allowed the situation to become so dire. The pandemic was under control in January but the lean period was not used to augment healthcare facilities. And now people are paying a heavy price for it, and we are left with a sense of helplessness all around. Unlike last year, no national lockdown has been announced. Instead, regions are implementing their own rules. Delhi announced a week-long lockdown at the weekend,leaving just government offices and essential services like hospitals, pharmacies and grocers open. The authorities in the worst affected state of Maharashtra - which was already under a partial lockdown - have announced a series of additional restrictions starting from Thursday evening. Oxygen leak leaves 22 Covid patients dead in India 'Wherever you look, you see ambulances and bodies' How is India's vaccination drive going? Maharashtra is India's richest state and home to its financial hub, Mumbai. It has also been a Covid hotspot since the start of the pandemic, accounting for a quarter of India's cases. Maharashtra accounts for a quarter of India's more than 15 million Covid cases Maharashtra has also reported more deaths from the virus than any other state, with 67,468. India has sufferednearly 185,000 deaths with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University,external. However, while deaths have been rising, the fatality rate remains relatively low. Uttar Pradesh, which is also reporting a high caseload, has adopted a more conservative approach, with its high court on Monday ordering a lockdown in five badly affected districts. However, it was put on hold after the government appealed against the decision in the Supreme Court. India - which has a population of more than a billion people - has so far administered more than 130 million doses but the drive has been restricted to health workers, frontline staff, those above the age of 45 and anyone with co-morbidities. From 1 May, people above 18 will also be eligible for the vaccine. But a supply crunch, which is already affecting the drive, could slow it down further. The crunch has impacted the Covax programme, which was heavily dependent in India's Serum Institute. It told the BBC it had suffered a shortfall of around 90 million doses after India prioritised its own needs, but says talks are now taking place to resume production. The scheme to share vaccines with other countries Pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced it was in ongoing discussions with the Indian government to supply its Covid-19 vaccine to the country at a not-for-profit price, according to Reuters news agency. India has seen a rapid rise in case numbers over the past month driven by lax safety protocols,a Hindu festival attended by millionsandvariants of the virus, including a ""double mutant"" strain. It was detected in 61% of samples tested in Maharashtra, according to the National Institute of Virology. Huge election rallies - including by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - were also not halted in the state of West Bengal which has been holding elections in phases in recent weeks. The government has defended the decision to continue with the polling.

Billionaire Dyson moves residency back to the UKSir James faced criticism in 2019 over relocating his company's global headquarters to Singapore.Business,"Sir James faced criticism in 2019 after announcing that he would relocate his firm's global head office High-profile businessman Sir James Dyson has moved his residency back to the UK from Singapore. He now lives primarily in the UK according to filings for his companies, which include his family office. Sir James had faced criticism after he announced that he would relocate his firm's global head office to Singapore in 2019. This week he was also involved in a controversy over texting Prime Minister Boris Johnson about tax issues. Labour calls for probe into PM-Dyson texts Dyson to move head office to Singapore Sir James Dyson: From barrows to billions A Dyson spokesman declined to comment on Sir James' residence and tax status but did say: ""The structure of the group and the business rationale underpinning it are unaltered."" ""Singapore is, and remains, the global headquarters of Dyson, our leadership team is based here and it is the centre of our sales, engineering and manufacturing operations,"" he said. A prominent supporter of Brexit with an estimated fortune of more than $20bn, Sir James was criticised after the announcement in 2019 that Dyson was moving its headquarters to Singapore from Malmesbury in Wiltshire. At the time, the company said just two senior executives would be relocated and no jobs would be lost in the UK as a result of the move. This video can not be played Starmer: Is it right to change tax rules for Dyson? Sir James has this week been at the centre of a political row in Britain after it was revealed that he texted Boris Johnson in March last year to get assurance that his staff would not face a change in their tax situation if they came to the UK to help make ventilators in response to Covid-19. The texts - seen by the BBC - show Mr Johnson saying he could ""fix"" tax issues relating to Dyson staff who came to the UK to work on the pandemic. But the prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson had abided by the ministerial code, governing conduct in office, and had ""informed officials in a timely manner"" after his contact with Sir James. Labour has called for a ""thorough investigation"" into Mr Johnson's contacts with Sir James. This video can not be played Sir James Dyson says leaving the EU has given the UK ""freedom of spirit"" When Sir James announced Dyson would move its global headquarters, he was accused of hypocrisy,after arguing in the run-up to the Brexit referendumthat the UK would gain more from leaving the EU than it would lose. However, in arecent interview with the BBC, he said: ""We're a British company - I've put a lot into this country. ""I can't make things here and bring over all the components from the Far East here, assemble them here and then send them back to the Far East. That just doesn't work."" Earlier this month, Dyson announced plans to create 200 new jobs at its research facilities in Malmesbury and Hullavington, Wiltshire. The plans are part of a Â£2.75bn global investment plan into emerging technologies and products. Sir James said the end of the UK's transition period with the EU had enabled Dyson to hire the engineering talent it was lacking in the UK. Freedom of movement between the UK and EU has ended and the government has introduced a points-based immigration system which it says ""treats all applicants equally, regardless of where they come from"". However, some argue that UK companies who want to hire from outside the EU are in no better position than before Brexit, while attempts to hire EU workers now face significant costs and administration that did not exist before. The text messages between Sir James Dyson and the PM show his concern about the Statutory Residence Test for his company's ability to help make ventilators. This test is designed to ensure that those working abroad and not paying UK income tax, really do work abroad and have few ties to the UK. They are quite complex, but broadly speaking if total or consecutive days are spent in the UK above some threshold, or if they are spent working, than the worker no longer qualifies for non residence. In the case of a Singapore-resident Briton that would mean earnings incurring a tax rate of up to 45% in the UK rather than up to 22% there. Sir James is lobbying the PM, that if, as requested by Mr Johnson in mid-March, help is needed making ventilators, then this barrier to spending more time in the UK needs to be set aside. The Dyson owner clearly felt it was a material barrier to his ability to help. In the end, the project did not proceed. JCB did make housings for Dyson's prototypes. But it proved too challenging for a new design to get rigorous medical safety approvals. The project to supply the UK was paused on 24 April. Manufacturers turned to mass manufacture of an existing design. But the government did change the law, with Section 190 of the Finance Bill disregarding working days between March and June 2020 from residence calculations, for those working on treatment, prevention and medical products to deal with the pandemic. It is unclear how many workers benefitted from this provision, at Dyson or elsewhere. Indeed, it might not become clear, even to tax authorities, until that financial year's returns are filed next January.

"Government sorry as report finds war graves racismThere is ""no doubt"" that prejudice played a part in the failure to commemorate troops, a minister says.UK","Boris Johnson said he is ""deeply troubled"" by failures to properly commemorate black and Asian troops who died fighting for the British Empire during World War One. Some troops were commemorated collectively or their names were recorded in registers, while their white counterparts had headstones. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologised in the Commons aftera report,externalblamed ""pervasive racism"". Mr Wallace pledged to ""take action"". The prime minister offered an ""unreserved apology"" over the findings of the review by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. ""Our shared duty is to honour and remember all those, wherever they lived and whatever their background, who laid down their lives for our freedoms at the moment of greatest peril,"" he said. Mr Wallace expressed ""deep regret"" in the House of Commons, as he told MPs there was ""no doubt"" prejudice had played a part in what happened after WWI. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologises: ""There can be no doubt prejudice played a part in some of the commission's decisions"" The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which is tasked with commemorating those who died in the two world wars, has also apologised over its findings. Labour MP David Lammy, who was critical to bringing the matter to light, called it a ""watershed moment"". The African soldiers dragged into Europe's war Marking the memories of a million service personnel Mr Wallace said: ""On behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government both of the time and today, I want to apologise for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation. ""Whilst we can't change the past, we can make amends and take action,"" he said. He said there were cases where the commission ""deliberately overlooked evidence"" that would have allowed it to find the names of the dead. And he said there were examples of officials employing an ""overarching imperial ideology connected to racial and religious differences"" in order to ""divide the dead and treat them unequally in ways that were impossible in Europe"". Outlining the next steps, Mr Wallace said the Commonwealth War Graves Commission will: search in the historical record for inequalities in commemoration and act on what is found renew its commitment to equality in commemoration by building physical or digital commemorative structures use its online presence and wider education activities to reach out to all the communities of the former British Empire touched by the two world wars to make sure their hidden history is brought to life and, over the next six months, assemble a global and diverse community of experts to help make this happen Mr Wallace also announced a public consultation over plans to waive the visa fee for service personnel from the Commonwealth and Nepal who choose to settle in the UK in order to honour their contribution. An inquiry by the commission was set up following a 2019 Channel 4 documentary, calledUnremembered,external, which was presented by Mr Lammy. The report found that at least 116,000 casualties from WW1, most of whom were of African, Indian or Egyptian origin, ""were not commemorated by name or possibly not commemorated at all"". But that figure could be as high as 350,000, it said. It also cited racist comments such as the governor of a British colony saying in 1923 that: ""The average native... would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" This video can not be played David Matthews tells the story of his great-uncle who fought in World War One Shadow justice secretary Mr Lammy told the BBC that while making the documentary in Kenya and Tanzania, he discovered mass graves in which Africans had been ""dumped with no commemoration whatsoever"". He said it was a travesty that men who served the British Empire were not commemorated properly, but welcomed the report. ""I'm just really, really pleased that the dignity that these men deserved - who were dragged from their villages and commandeered to work for the British Empire - that dignity that they deserve in death can be granted to them,"" he said. Mr Lammy added that work must be done to find their names in archives where that is possible, and to establish how local communities would like them to be commemorated. He also said Commonwealth soldiers should not be ""whitewashed"" out of history books, while Mr Wallace said it was a ""deep regret"" that his own WW1 education had included ""very little about the contribution from the Commonwealth countries and the wider at the time British Empire"". This video can not be played David Olusoga: ""It's another organisation that's had to be dragged into admitting its history."" Historian Prof David Olusoga, whose TV company produced Unremembered, told BBC Breakfast that apologies were not enough and resources would need to be committed if the commission was serious about restorative justice. ""If the Commonwealth War Graves Commission had set up a committee and discovered that 100,000 white British soldiers lay in mass graves - unmarked, uncommemorated - and the documentation proved that that had been deliberate, what would they do?"" he said. Six million soldiers from the British Empire served in WW1. Between 45,000 and 54,000 Asian and African personnel who died in the conflict were ""commemorated unequally"", the commission said. World War One was the first truly global war, fought not just in the trenches of France but in the Middle East, Asia and Africa Britain's colonies sent millions of men to fight for the empire during the conflict India, which at that time included Pakistan and Bangladesh, sent the most soldiers - more than 1.4 million The British Army in East Africa was mainly composed of African soldiers by November 1918, according to the Imperial War Museum At least 180,000 Africans served in the Carrier Corps in East Africa and provided logistic support to troops at the front Around 15,000 people from the West Indies enlisted in WW1, including 10,000 from Jamaica, according to the National Army Museum Colonies as far away as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) also sent a similar number between them Britain had soldiers from six different continents: Europe, North America, South America, Australasia, Asia and Africa The report concluded that the failure to properly commemorate the individuals was influenced by a scarcity of information, errors inherited from other organisations and the opinions of colonial administrators. ""Underpinning all these decisions, however, were the entrenched prejudices, preconceptions and pervasive racism of contemporary imperial attitudes,"" it added. The report picked out an example from 1923 when the governor of the Gold Coast colony, now Ghana, argued for collective memorials rather than individual ones. At a meeting in London, it was said that the governor, F G Guggisberg, said: ""The average native of the Gold Coast would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" In response, commission employee Arthur Browne said: ""In perhaps two or three hundred years' time, when the native population had reached a higher stage of civilisation, they might then be glad to see that headstones had been erected on the native graves and that the native soldiers had received precisely the same treatment as their white comrades."" The report said Mr Browne's response showed ""what he may have considered foresight, but one that was explicitly framed by contemporary racial prejudice"". The commission, which was founded in 1917 as the Imperial War Graves Commission, said the events of a century ago were wrong then and were wrong now. Its director general, Claire Horton, said: ""We recognise the wrongs of the past and are deeply sorry and will be acting immediately to correct them."" As part of the commission's work to search for unnamed war dead and those who are potentially not commemorated, it will also look at those who died in World War Two, although it is not thought that inequalities seen in WW1 were as widespread then. Ms Horton said the report was ""sober"" reading but gave the commission the ability - ""now that we know the numbers and the areas to look"" - to start the searches properly to ""right the wrongs of the past"". The war graves commission was founded with a remit to remember every individual who had died in World War One, regardless of rank, class, religion or race. The idea of equal treatment was controversial, but it became a cornerstone of remembrance. Outside Europe, however, the commission enacted a policy of extreme discrimination, categorising the fallen as ""white"", ""Indians"" or what it called ""natives"". In southern Kenya, white soldiers lie beneath named memorials in a well-tended cemetery.  Next door in a scruffy field is where their African comrades are buried - no names, just a general memorial. The consequence of the commission's failings is not only to do a great injustice to the black and Asian soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought alongside their white European comrades in two world wars, it is to misrepresent our history.

Outside Europe, however, the commission enacted a policy of extreme discrimination, categorising the fallen as ""white"", ""Indians"" or what it called ""natives"". In southern Kenya, white soldiers lie beneath named memorials in a well-tended cemetery.  Next door in a scruffy field is where their African comrades are buried - no names, just a general memorial. The consequence of the commission's failings is not only to do a great injustice to the black and Asian soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought alongside their white European comrades in two world wars, it is to misrepresent our history.

"Super League on standby, says Real Madrid president","The power of football supporters was clear on Tuesday as Chelsea fans gathered outside Stamford Bridge to protest against their club signing up to play in the ESL The European Super League is on ""standby"" despite nine of the 12 founding teams withdrawing, says Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. After a furious backlash against the proposed tournament that was announced on Sunday,all six Premier League clubs involved withdrew on Tuesday. Spanish club Atletico Madrid and Italian sides AC Milan and Inter Milan have also formally pulled out. ""We're going to continue working,"" said Perez. ""The project is on standby.""

On Thursday night Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan raised concerns over plans tochange the Champions Leagueby adding more matches, saying it was just the ""lesser of two evils"" compared to the ESL. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus have not withdrawn from the ESL, although Juventus chairmanAndrea Agnelli said the project could not now proceed. Barcelona president Joan Laporta echoed Perez's comments, saying a new competition is required to ensure the financial health of the game. ""We will speak more about it when the time comes but for now we understand there is a need for it, even though our members will have the final say,"" Laporta told Catalan network TV3. ""Big clubs contribute a lot of resources and it's absolutely necessary that we have our say on the distribution of money [in European football]."" Laporta was named Barca president for a second time in March, taking the helm of a clubin heavy debt.,external Javier Tebas, president of Spain's La Liga, said: ""If it [the Super League] was good for football, as Perez has said, they wouldn't have done it behind our backs."" On whether their would be sanctions from La Liga for the Spanish clubs, he added: ""We are not talking about sanctions. ""Everyone wants to cut people's heads off. We have to have a procedure and we have to see how it looks in the end. These clubs have been sanctioned by their own fans."" Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke apologises to manager Mikel Arteta Solskjaer addresses fans' training ground protest Speaking on the El Larguero show on Spanish radio station Cadena Ser, Super League chairman Perez claimed the project was not yet dead as all 12 clubs ""have not left yet"". ""You cannot get out of the contract like this - they are binding contracts,"" he added. When asked what the penalty was for leaving the project, Perez did not answer. Why the ESL failed - and will clubs try again? Perez reiterated his view thatthe ESL was created ""to save football"",having also previously said the move had been made because young people were ""no longer interested in football"" because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". He added he was ""sad and disappointed"" by the reaction to the project, which the clubs have been working on ""for around three years"". He accused Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin and various countries' footballing authorities of ""aggression"" and ""threats"" towards the ESL. ""Maybe we didn't explain it well, but they also didn't give us an opportunity to explain it,"" said the 74-year-old. ""I've been in football for 20 years and I've never seen threats like this. It was like we killed someone. It was like we killed football. But we were trying to work out how to save football."" A revamped 36-team Champions League,starting in 2024, was agreed on Monday, although the ESL teams had said in its announcement of Sunday it did not think Uefa's reforms went far enough. ""The Champions League format is old and only interesting from the quarter-finals onwards,"" said Perez. ""This format clearly doesn't work, so we thought that we could have a format where the most important teams in Europe play against each other from the very beginning of the season. ""We worked out the numbers and felt we could make much more money, more money for all the other teams too."" Laporta said talks with domestic leagues and Uefa remain necessary, and suggested the ESL would not be a closed off competition. ""It must be an attractive competition based on sporting merits,"" he said. ""We also will defend national leagues and we're open to having an open dialogue with Uefa. ""We always want to improve football and have the necessary revenues to ensure football remains a spectacle. If the big clubs don't continue to have large revenues then football will suffer."" Meanwhile, Perez claimed one of English football's 'big six' - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - were reluctant about the ESL from the start. ""There was someone in the English group that didn't have much interest, I won't say who,"" he said. ""That began to infect others, who are also people of an age, and who are perhaps afraid because they did not understand anything of what was happening. ""We all signed a binding agreement, but I think one was never very convinced."" Spanish football expert Guillem Balague on BBC Radio 5 Live Perez has got a vision and apparently the rest of the world is not seeing it and that's dangerous when someone feels like that. He kept saying, in his second appearance in a disastrous PR campaign, that he's there to save football. He's talking about big losses - in the case of Real Madrid, they've gone from expecting to earn 900m euros (Â£779m) to 600m euros (Â£519m) in only one season, and that stops them doing a lot of their projects, like maybe signing Kylian Mbappe from Paris St-Germain. In Spain, we are a completely different type of fan. We don't act against things we think are unfair. In England, it is more like a lifestyle. They are taking something off you and you go out to try to get it back. Perez has been untouchable for many years. But this vision did not really have strong foundations so the media are having a bit of a laugh here. We are all very surprised Joan Laporta and Barcelona have not come out and pushed away from this idea. But, they are so desperate for money that they think whoever comes up with the right idea, they will just join in. We are a little bit disappointed by the leaders of the two biggest clubs in Spain. Senior executives from the Premier League clubs who were part of the ESL are being asked to stand down from various league working groups - or face being voted out by the 14 other clubs, reports BBC sports editor Dan Roan. In a move that suggests the 'big six' influence is set to be curtailed, the Premier League is in the process of writing to; outgoing Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Liverpool chair Tom Werner, who sit on the league's broadcast advisory group; Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, who is on the audit and remuneration committee; and Arsenal chief executive Vinai Venkatesham and Manchester City's chief executive Ferran Soriano, who are on the league's club strategic advisory group.

US hosts 40 leaders at climate summit,"The US has unveiled an updated carbon pledge that will see its emissions nearly halved by 2030 President Joe Biden will host 40 leaders at a virtual summit in the White House to raise ambition on tackling climate change The meeting will aim to re-assert US global leadership in the area after President Trump pulled the country out of the Paris agreement President Biden has made the climate a key focus for his administration, re-joining the Paris agreement on his first day in office Ahead of the meeting, officials urged greater ambition, particularly among countries perceived as ""laggards"" on climate The leaders of China, the UK, India, Canada, France, Germany, South Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Russia are all attending Observers have been closely watching China - the world's top emitter - for any commitments it might make at the meeting Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs, Mark Kinver, Marianna Brady, Sam Cabral and Holly Honderich Day One of the White House's Earth Day climate summit has now ended. Over six sessions, we heard from leaders, officials and activists from more than 40 countries, including top officials in the Biden administration. Day Two takes place tomorrow, with two final sessions. Thanks for following our reporting and analysis. Live coverage was brought to you by Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral, and edited by Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs and Mark Kinver. The BBC's Outside Source programme asked three young climate activists about their thoughts on the Leaders Summit. Here's what they said. Daisy Jeffrey in Australia -  part of âFridayâs for Futureâ campaign âI would hope to see significantly more pressure put on Australia by this US presidential administration than the last. âI hope that this summit will see the Australian government bow to political pressure, because at the moment instead of looking to invest in renewables and a renewable future this government is investing in gas and saying that gas is the way forward and that is simply an inaccurate and quite backwards way of thinking. âWeâre tackling climate change abysmally.â Melissa Kowara in Indonesia  - a member of Extinction Rebellion Indonesia âFirst of all they have to declare that we have an emergency to begin with, because the level of awareness and the climate literacy is still so slow and this declaration will work as a mandate to all the ministries, all the private entity and the civil society to actually act together. âWhat I really want to see is that countries around the world start really looking into tackling the climate crisis issue directly at its roots.â Thandile Chinyavanhu in South Africa â part of Greenpeace Africa âItâs very important that our government takes action and deviates away from our fossil fuel addiction. âI donât believe South Africaâs ambitions are ambitious enough.â Critics of climate change proposals often question whether climate advocates are willing to make eco-friendly changes to their personal lives. Will you stop eating meat? Will you stop riding on airplanes? Will you take shorter baths? With an Earth Day climate summit hosted by the White House in full swing, those critics turned their eyes to national climate advisor Gina McCarthy and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, for their choice of transportation to attend an event touting electric vehicles. Buttigieg has made a show of riding to his meetings on a bicycle, but was also recently pictured taking that bike off the back of an SUV parked a few blocks away. Allow Twitter content?

There has been plenty of reaction coming in to the announcements at the Leaders Summit. Here's a selection of the comments from environmental campaign groups. Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said:âWe need more ambitious commitments from the big emitters and more binding plans on climate finance, fossil fuel phase outs, and nature restoration which match the urgency of the crisis we face.â Melita Steele, programme director of Greenpeace Africa, commented:âAfrican leaders must do more than just be at the table of biodiversity and climate summits. ""We need them to be serious about tackling emissions at home and unequivocal about protecting their countryâs natural biodiversity in order to tackle a climate crisis which has the continent seeing worse and worse extreme weather impacts every year.â Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said: â[Canadaâs] new target is not aligned with a 1.5C compatible future - that would require a 60% emissions reduction goal. âWe hope to see Canada continue to ramp up ambition, both in future years and as NDC consultations occur in coming months on the road to [the COP26 climate meeting in] Glasgow.â Abby Maxman, chief executive of Oxfam America, described President Bidenâs announcement as a âstep in the right directionâ but added that more action was needed. âThe richest 1% of the worldâs population are responsible for more than twice as much carbon pollution as the 3.1 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity,"" she said. âAs the worldâs richest country and largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the US owes it to the world's most vulnerable to increase its emissions reductions target in order to prevent additional climate change impacts.""  In a separate breakout session, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is leading officials from around the world in a discussion of nature-based solutions to reduce emissions and strengthen climate resilience. Nature-based efforts have been proposed around the world to combat climate change, by reducing deforestation and the loss of wetlands, restoring marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history, has made restorative justice a key aspect of her climate change goals. She is moderating a panel that includes environmental ministers from Canada, Costa Rica, Gabon, Indonesia, Peru and the Seychelles, as well as two indigenous activists. The Biden administration has indicated that climate change will be a key plank of its foreign policy. His director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, and ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield both argue it requires a diplomatic, economic and militaristic effort, what administration officials refer to as ""a whole-of-government effort"". They note the Pentagon has already designated climate change as a national security threat and as a threat multiplier. In the US, the past year has seen wildfires in California, hurricanes in Louisiana and blackouts in Texas, says Thomas-Greenfield, while the world has seen monsoons, droughts and other disasters. ""It doesn't matter where you live. Climate change is a challenge for every person, in every country,"" she says. Only ""a multilateral toolkit"" can ensure that countries and people do not fight over scare resources as the world gets warmer, she says. Thomas-Greenfield says real global cooperation can instead bring ""shared economic opportunity"". Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is now leading a session on how the climate crisis poses a threat to energy, economic and national security. ""Few things deserve to be called existential, but the climate crisis is existential,"" he says, detailing problems caused by coastal erosion, natural disasters and other impacts of global warming. He notes that the US intelligence community under President Biden is undertaking comprehensive climate assessments, which it had not done before. He points out the UK's intelligence assessments of climate security have ""raised the bar"" on how to do these evaluations. Austin is joined by director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and defence officials from six different countries. Nick BeakeEurope Correspondent Pope Francis has just added his voice. In a video
recorded in the Vatican, he warned that the climate crisis will take on an even
greater significance in the post-pandemic world. Leaders must do more to
protect the gift of nature, he stressed. In another message, to mark Earth Day
â an annual event calling for greater protection of the environment â Francis
said Covid-19 had proved the global community could work together to tackle a
catastrophic threat. But the head of the Catholic Church said if leaders were
not courageous and truthful in their efforts to combat climate change, the
result would be self-destruction. When then-President Trump visited Rome in
2017, Francis brought up in conversation the race to save the planet. But
just a week later Trump announced America was to withdraw from the Paris
climate agreement. However, the new incumbent in the White House, a proud
Catholic, appears much more on the Popeâs wavelength. Michael Regan, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is steering an all-female panel of American mayors, global and Indigenous leaders focused on ground-up solutions in their communities. The women gathered today are a ""testament to how women around the world are raising the mantle of climate leadership, developing sustainable solutions"", Regan says. Introducing Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim of the Indigenous Women and Peoples Association of Chad, Regan notes that the world's Indigenous people make up only about 5% of the global population but effectively protect about 80% of global biodiversity. ""How we can lead in harmony with nature?"" Ibrahim says. ""Without Indigenous peoples there is no way."" She says developed countries must now follow the leadership of Indigenous communities in taking climate action. For us, she says, ""protection of nature it is not a policy, it is our way of life"". Asha Karim survived a narrow escape from the 2020California wildfires. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? While of course I wish we'd done more earlier, I think it's never too late to act. Any reduction in harm to the planet is worthwhile. We got here by largely ignoring the problem, so to decide that it's now too late to do anything, that ignorance somehow freed us from responsibility strikes me as selfish and silly. Climate change is a series of positive feedback loops that will keep building upon one another, even more rapidly if we don't change course. Will politics get in the way? It is politicised, in that there is lot of vested financial interest in maintaining the status quo. That financial power is very present in American politics, and we see it reflected in subsidies and lax regulation in many of the industries that heavily contribute to our emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I hope we can lead the way to a much higher standard than we see globally today. I think that committing to the level of action we see elsewhere is a step in the right direction, but far from enough. Being that it is a politicised problem, it may take a while to make change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? What do you hope the US government will do first? I think the American people are onboard with the plan. Climate change has become difficult to ignore. More intense storms, fire seasons, shifts in weather patterns impacting local wildlife - there is some effect of climate change that has touched every person's life in some way. I think most Americans would like to see the US take this problem seriously. As for what we should do first, cutting subsidies for meat and dairy production and reducing our dependence on coal would be impactful places to start. Today's climate summit has a lot of important people making a lot of big promises to combat climate change - carbon caps, finance adaptation, and international cooperation. But let's go back to square one - what even is climate change? The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past. There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. Read more about the basics of climate change. Kim Cobb is a climate scientist. She works at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? This is exactly what we need to get back on track. It is absolutely reflecting a high level of ambition. It's roughly in line with science based targets to keep warming to a minimum this century. We really have an army of amazing folks working on this in DC right now. The winds are at our back in this particular moment. With every American talking about jobs, talking about public health benefits in our low carbon future, this is language that resonates. And I think that there's a way to craft this policy to make sure that there's equity for all and economic benefits for all along the way. I'm just inspired to try to do what I can to go as far as we can, as best as we can. Will politics get in the way? Obviously, getting anything through Congress right now is not a slam dunk, to put it mildly. And I think the devil is going to be in the details as to exactly how this policy is crafted to appeal across the aisle. I have confidence that this administration is bringing people who have worked on policies successfully before. So I think everything we're hearing right now is really aligned towards success. But the next months are going to be absolutely crucial. What do you hope the US government will do first? How are we going to make sure that communities that are deeply invested in fossil fuel infrastructure are not left out of the economic winds in our low carbon future? These kinds of issues are going to be important in terms of building that coalition. At the same time, you have to address the long standing voices who have brought this kind of target forward, such as the youth voices and the people who have focused on environmental justice. Around the world, there are teams of people who are working to track down and destroy hidden sources of greenhouse gases - stopping them from harming the planet. Some of the gases, which are used in refrigeration, have many times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. The BBC's Tom Heap meets some of the people part working to stop these gases causing damage to the planet. Read about the best climate solution you haven't heard of. Victoria Coles is an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? It is never too little too late! As the administrationâs proposed infrastructure plan notes, we already need to spend billions on mitigating climate impacts to build resilience for roads, airports, ports and other infrastructure. That doesn't include the billions from climate and weather-related losses since 1980. Those costs of prior inaction should be front and center when we think about the expense of reducing emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I am a scientist, not a policy expert. However, I think that legislative rather than executive action is required to stabilise US climate policy from changes in administration. I hope that the American Jobs Plan retains its aggressive investment in climate related action and that, at a minimum, some form of climate legislation can make it through congress. In my view, this, coupled with action rather than discussion, will be needed to convince global leaders that America is serious about climate change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? TheYale climate opinion maps,externaldemonstrate clearly that the majority of Americans support climate policies such as carbon taxes and tax rebates for electric vehicles. The only question in their survey that was not over 50% pro-climate was ""the percentage of adults who think global warming will harm them personally"". Americans worry about climate, they view it as harmful to plants, animals, developing countries and other Americans. But until they view it as an existential threat to their own families, they may not vote for candidates that recognise the climate crisis as a threat to global and national interests. Reality Check At the climate summit, leaders sought to outbid each other with their pledges on cutting carbon emissions over the next decade. The numbers can be confusing, so letâs try to make sense of them. The US pledged to cut carbon emissions by around 50% (from 2005 levels) by 2030. The UK announced a ""world-leading"" target to cut emissions by 78% (from 1990 levels) by 2035, having previously committed to 68% by 2030. Other countries such as Canada have also increased their commitments. Different countries use different years as the starting point for comparison, usually from when their emissions peaked â partly to show their pledges in the best light. For example, the US compares their 2030 target to 2005 levels, and the UK uses 1990 levels - about the time when emissions peaked in their respective countries. However, by either comparison point, the UKâs 2030 target is the most ambitious. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joined other world leaders in today's summit as part of a special session of climate finance. Ardern urged other countries to follow New Zealand's lead in pricing carbon, ending subsidies for fossil fuels and finance environmental adaption. And for Ardern - calling in some 14,000 km from the summit's host - the appearance meant a rather inconvenient call time. On Instagram, the prime minister noted she had a 02:00am local call time for the international meeting. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

French President Emmanuel Macron urges world to 'move more quickly' in tackling climate change. John Kerry, US President Joe Biden's Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, has led a roundtable of global financial leaders - all making their own commitments to tackle the climate crisis. David Malpass, President of the World Bank Group, promised record spending ""in the way that gets the most done"". ""The core of the plan is to spend more,"" he said - focused on flattening carbon emissions from the world's biggest emitters. Malpass also acknowledged what he called the ""severity and the inequality of the current environment"" - noting that poverty, inequality and climate change are linked and require a comprehensive, inclusive solution. Chief executive of Citigroup, Jane Fraser, followed shortly after, repeating the corporation's March commitment to be net zero in carbon emissions by 2050. ""Net zero is easy to say, but very hard to do,"" Fraser said. Kerry thanked her for the support but said that reaching net zero - a formidable challenge - will still not be enough. ""Even if we get to net zero, we still have to get carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,"" he said. ""This is a bigger challenge than a lot of people have grabbed on to yet."" Greta Thunberg is now speaking about the emotional toll of the climate fight on young people. She is pressed on the issue by California Democrat Katie Porter, who says her nine-year-old child told her: ""The Earth is burning and we're all going to die."" Thunberg says it's ""understandable"" that younger generations might be saddened or angry by global warming and political inaction. ""It would be strange if we didn't feel that way because then we wouldn't have any empathy."" ""But there is still much hope and, if we choose to take action and act together, there's unlimited things that we can do."" She adds that her experience taught her that ""the best medication against anger and anxiety is to take action yourself"". The hearing on fossil fuel subsidies now comes to an end. Greta Thunberg tells the US House Environment Subcommittee that, in her conversations, she found a lot of readiness for climate action. ""People are actually more open for change than we realise,"" she says. To those who depend on the fossil fuel industry for jobs and livelihoods, she says: ""Who can blame them?"" People working within the industry ""cannot be left behind,"" she adds. Pointing out that climate issues are not the fault of those people, Thunberg notes that climate advocates would prefer to work with the industry than against or without it. ""Climate justice is social justice. We can't achieve climate justice without social justice,"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Your updates today were written by Alex Therrien, Ella Wills, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. They were edited by James Clarke. Tom Davis passed his driving test after a four-month wait And as we come towards the end of our updates, here's a recap of the day's main pandemic news in the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi Many countries in Africa are getting AstraZeneca vaccines through the Covax scheme The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa Centres for
Disease Control (Africa CDC) are urging African countries not to destroy Covid-19
vaccines that have expired. The WHO is asking countries on the continent to hold on to expired
stock and wait for further guidance. The call comes after Malawi and South Sudan said they would
discard more than 70,000 doses of the AstraZeneca jab that were out of date. The Africa CDC says it has spoken to the manufacturer and has been
reassured the vaccines are still safe. Many vaccines can be used up to 36 months after manufacture but, because
Covid-19 jabs are so new, there is not enough data to prove their effectiveness over
longer periods. Whatever the guidance, the final decision rests with national drug
regulators. However, the issue will further increase the challenges around persuading people
on the continent to get vaccinated. The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in Africa has been slow, partly because of
supply issues and scepticism about the jab. Out of 55 African countries, 41 have benefited from the delivery

first batch. A deal has been struck over emergency funding to combat the record backlog of almost 58,000 Crown Court cases caused by funding delays  and exacerbated by the pandemic. The Lord Chief Justice will be able to ask the government for unlimited funding to open up more courtrooms in England and Wales wherever judges are available. But it's not clear in practice how many extra court sitting days will be achievable because of the challenges of social distancing. This restricts the number of defendants who can be safely held in each building - so much so that two courtrooms in Manchester are being knocked into one to allow major gang trials to progress.

Vientiane, Laos Laos has introduced tough lockdown restrictions in its capital and closed its international borders to most traffic due to a Covid cluster in neighbouring Thailand. People living in the capital Vientiane cannot leave the city and only those with permission can enter. Residents can also leave the house for essential food shopping, hospital visits and other authorised tasks. The restrictions last until 5 May. It comes as 28 new cases were confirmed yesterday and six more today, bringing the overall count to 94 - meaning about a third of the cases recorded in the nation since the pandemic began have been in the past two days. The government-owned Vientiane Times reported 26 of yesterday's 28 new cases had contact with a student who had caught the virus from a Thai man. Annabel RackhamBBC Newsbeat Jack Croucher passed in Torquay with no minor faults We've been catching up with learner drivers on the day tests have restarted in England and Wales. Jack Croucher, 22, managed to get hold of a test at ""really short notice"" - so only had three days to prepare. He passed his test with no minor faults but in part credits his dad, who is a professional driving instructor, for free tuition during lockdown. ""Driving up [to the test centre] I was really nervous but once I got into the flow of it, it went really easy and I enjoyed it,"" he says. Courtney Osborn can't wait to take her son out in the car Courtney Osborn is going to use her new-found freedom to go visit her gran - after passing her test this morning. ""I started [learning to drive] in December 2019 and already had had two tests cancelled because of lockdown,"" says the 22-year-old. To get back up to speed in time for the test, Courtney took part in an intensive course when lessons resumed earlier this month. Courtney, who isn't working at the moment, lives in a village in Norfolk and says it's been frustrating not being able to drive anywhere.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People line up to be tested in Hong Kong Over the past week, there has been concern in Hong Kong after a
couple of locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19 were identified involving a
mutant strain. One of the patients had no history of travel, and the other had
already completed 21 days of quarantine after arriving from Dubai. On Monday, health officials in Hong Kong warned there could
be a potential surge of cases as a result of these new cases, and a compulsory
testing order was issued in part of the city. The authorities announced they were
investigating how these two patients might have been infected. Today, South China Morning Post says the probe has concluded, and that experts determined transmission was âlikely to have taken
place at a quarantine hotel viadoor hooks used by staff to deliver meal boxes,externalto guestsâ. The head of Hong Kongâs Centre for Health Protection says
specialists found no problem with the hotelâs ventilation or drainage system,
so the focus turned to S-shaped hooks for hanging food deliveries on, which
were âhard to cleanâ. Hong Kong government advisor Professor David Hui says
virus particles âcould stay on metal surfaces such as door handles for two to three daysâ. All designated quarantine hotels have now been told to place meals
on chairs, rather than on hooks. However, some specialists question the door
handle theory, with one respiratory specialist telling SCMP they think âitâs
more likely the patients exhaled virus particles into narrow corridorsâ. Hong Kong has been trying to avoid a local outbreak byimplementing compulsory quarantines,externalfor overseas arrivals, and temporarily banning flights from high-risk
countries, like India, Pakistan and the Philippines. A plan to reopen the Isle of Man's border to non-residents has been backed by the Manx parliament. It includes a phased relaxation of the border closure from 1 May to allow family to visit under strict conditions. And the government'srevised exit frameworksets a date of 28 June for the lifting of all Covid-19 restrictions including mandatory isolation on arrival. The island's border was closed to most non-residents in March 2020. Chief Minister Howard Quayle says aspects of the plan ""may need to change"" in response to any ""unexpected challenges"" thrown up by the pandemic. Backing the plan, Treasury Minister Alfred Cannan says the island now needs to move towards releasing border restrictions ""for the health, wealth and sanity of the nation"". Here's the full story. Meanwhile, pregnant women on the Isle of Manare to be offered a coronavirus vaccination, the health minister has confirmed. A Norwegian climber hoping to summit Everest has confirmed he has tested positive for coronavirus. ""My diagnosis is Covid-19,"" Erlend Ness has told the AFP news agency in a Facebook message. ""I'm doing ok now... The hospital is taking care (of me)."" The climber was evacuated from the slopes by helicopter and taken to a hospital in Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, after spending time at Everest base camp. A sherpa in the camp has also tested positive, Norwegian broadcaster NRK reports. ""I really hope that none of the others get infected with corona high up in the mountains. It is impossible to evacuate people with a helicopter when they're above 8,000m,"" Ness tells NRK. The high altitude makes the danger of Covid-19 - which can affect breathing - far worse. The events come as a blow to Nepal's hopes of fully relaunching its mountaineering season. You can read about the risks of catching coronavirus outdoors here. We've been bringing you updates on the number of people who have had been jabbed so far - and more than 400,000 members of England's adult social care workforce have not received a coronavirus vaccine, figures suggest. Some 80.4% of eligible staff working at older adult care homes had received the jab by 18 April, NHS England says. A total of 72.3% of staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. For social care staff working in other settings in England, including non-registered providers, the figure is 69.4%. Overall, about 1.17 million out of 1.58 million social care staff in these settings have received a first dose, according to analysis by the PA news agency. This leaves 417,989 social care staff (26.4% of the total) who have not been vaccinated or whose vaccination has not yet been reported. The figures come as the Government has opened a public consultation on aproposal for staff to be required to get a jab as a condition of employment to protect elderly residents. A total of 44,450,252 coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,government figures show.,external That's 33,257,651 first doses and 11,192,601 second doses. That's an increase of 416,784 second doses and 117,909 first doses since we brought you the equivalent statistics this time yesterday. Find out when you will get your vaccinehere. A further 18 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,today's government data shows.,external It brings the total number of people to die in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 127,345. A total of 2,729 new infections have also been recorded. The number of over 50s vaccinated has now hit 95% in England, NHS data shows. The take-up among those aged 45-49 is at 59% after they started being offered the jab earlier this month. But uptake among care home staff - one of the first groups to be offered the jab - is still at about 80%, despite attempts to get more to come forward. Latest figures show more than 33 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine with more than 10 million having received both doses.

This means Scotland will be ""ready to join"" an international vaccination passport programme. But, national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch says compiling the information is complex and ""we're not near yet"". He says paper ""proof"" - similar to that given to people in England - was ""not a satisfactory solution"". Prof Leitch confirms all four UK countries are discussing the joint digital system.

""But I don't see perfect alignment or anything in the next number of weeks. There will be some gaps.""

""The situation is very critical, medical staff are
exhausted, ICUs have reached their maximum capacity and deaths
are on the rise,"" says Amenallah Messadi, a member of a scientific committee that advises the government. He blames the surge in cases on the spread of the Covid variant that was first detected in Britain. The government has closed all schools until 30 April and
banned people from driving cars at night to restrict movement. Tunisia has recorded about 10,000 deaths since the pandemic began. Keith Farrow said he had been left feeling anxious People in an English town say they are ""in limbo"" over when they will get their second Covid jabs, despite waiting longer than the recommended time. Government guidance says everyone should be offered a second vaccine dose within 12 weeks of the first jab to be fully vaccinated against the virus. But Keith Farrow, 75, who lives in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, says his 12-week wait was up on Sunday 18 April and he is still waiting. Another local resident has told the BBC they feel they have been ""left in limbo"", while others say they are concerned that delays could make them more vulnerable to Covid-19. Deputy chief nurse Rebecca Neno, from NHS Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group, said ""immunity doesn't just end at 12 weeks"". She adds: ""The deliveries of vaccines don't always match exactly to the 12-week interval between vaccinations. ""Some people get called a few weeks early - some get called a few weeks later.""

Church told it must shortlist ethnic minorities,"All shortlists for senior Church of England posts must include at least one ethnic minority candidate, a report has said. It is one of 47 recommendations made by the Archbishops' Anti-Racism Taskforce, which was established last year after the Black Lives Matter protests. It said the Church has ""an alarmingly retrograde trend"" when it comes to ethnic minority senior bishops. Failing to act would have ""devastating effects"" on the future of the Church. The archbishops of Canterbury and York welcomed the report but did not commit to enforcing the recommendation on shortlists. It comes after the Archbishop of Canterbury,Justin Welby, this week said the Church should not use non-disclosure agreements, following BBC Panorama revelations that they were being used to silence staff complaining of racism. Clergy speak out over 'racism in Church of England' Church is 'deeply institutionally racist' - Welby Ex-bishop rebuked over racial stereotyping The taskforce examined 25 previous reports on racial justice over the past 36 years and said that despite hundreds of recommendations, the Church had overseen ""decades of inaction"" which ""carry consequences"". It called for annual reporting on recruitment, mandatory training in all dioceses to embed anti-racism practice, and for full-time racial justice officers to be employed in every diocese for a five-year term. It wants to see a plan drawn up to increase representation of minority ethnic people to at least 15% at all levels of governance by 2030, reflecting the proportion of minority ethnic worshippers. Currently, there are just five minority ethnic bishops and nine deans, archdeacons, and senior staff. The most recent figures reveal 93.7% of senior staff in the Church - including bishops, archdeacons and cathedral clergy - were white British. All the proposals have a timetable for action and details of which part of the Church is responsible for delivery. ""A failure to act now will be seen as another indication, potentially a last straw for many, that the Church is not serious about racial sin,"" the report said. The taskforce also said statues linked to slavery in churches should be given extra context. ""While history should not be hidden, we also do not want to unconditionally celebrate or commemorate people who contributed to or benefitted from the tragedy that was the slave trade,"" the report said. Augustine Tanner-Ihm believes ""this is a safeguarding issue, not just a 'woke' issue"" Last year, the archbishop of Canterbury said the Church was""still deeply institutionally racist"". He and the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, welcomed the taskforce's report and said they would implement five of the recommendations ""immediately"". These include establishing a racial justice commission and a racial justice directorate to implement the taskforce's recommendations, and encouraging the General Synod to co-opt 10 ethnic minority candidates to serve as members between 2021-26. They said: ""We hope we will be the generation to halt this cycle of inaction."" In an interview with Nick Robinson on the Political Thinking podcast, Mr Welby said he was ""committed to contextualisation"" for controversial statues in churches but said ""99.99% will stay"". Rev Arun Arora, from Durham diocese and taskforce co-chair, said he hoped the report will ""be a watershed moment in the Church's journey towards racial justice"". Co-chair Rev Sonia Barron, from Lincoln diocese, said the current culture in the Church ""tolerates certain kinds of racism, and it's therefore essential that that culture changes"". She added: ""There's now a genuine sense of urgency I think, and a need for action, and we cannot let this moment pass."" But Augustine Tanner-Ihm,who had accused the Church of racism, said he did not think the report would lead to real change. ""More reports isn't going to help anything,"" he told BBC News. ""Actually, this is a safeguarding issue, not just a 'woke' issue."" ""In the Bible it says judge people by their fruits - what do they produce? ""And actually, for over 100 years, the Church hasn't produced any fruit when it comes to race relations, and I don't think it will.""

LiveLiveUS hosts 40 leaders at climate summit8 minutes ago,"The US has unveiled an updated carbon pledge that will see its emissions nearly halved by 2030 President Joe Biden will host 40 leaders at a virtual summit in the White House to raise ambition on tackling climate change The meeting will aim to re-assert US global leadership in the area after President Trump pulled the country out of the Paris agreement President Biden has made the climate a key focus for his administration, re-joining the Paris agreement on his first day in office Ahead of the meeting, officials urged greater ambition, particularly among countries perceived as ""laggards"" on climate The leaders of China, the UK, India, Canada, France, Germany, South Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Russia are all attending Observers have been closely watching China - the world's top emitter - for any commitments it might make at the meeting Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs, Mark Kinver, Marianna Brady, Sam Cabral and Holly Honderich Day One of the White House's Earth Day climate summit has now ended. Over six sessions, we heard from leaders, officials and activists from more than 40 countries, including top officials in the Biden administration. Day Two takes place tomorrow, with two final sessions. Thanks for following our reporting and analysis. Live coverage was brought to you by Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral, and edited by Paul Rincon, Helen Briggs and Mark Kinver. The BBC's Outside Source programme asked three young climate activists about their thoughts on the Leaders Summit. Here's what they said. Daisy Jeffrey in Australia -  part of âFridayâs for Futureâ campaign âI would hope to see significantly more pressure put on Australia by this US presidential administration than the last. âI hope that this summit will see the Australian government bow to political pressure, because at the moment instead of looking to invest in renewables and a renewable future this government is investing in gas and saying that gas is the way forward and that is simply an inaccurate and quite backwards way of thinking. âWeâre tackling climate change abysmally.â Melissa Kowara in Indonesia  - a member of Extinction Rebellion Indonesia âFirst of all they have to declare that we have an emergency to begin with, because the level of awareness and the climate literacy is still so slow and this declaration will work as a mandate to all the ministries, all the private entity and the civil society to actually act together. âWhat I really want to see is that countries around the world start really looking into tackling the climate crisis issue directly at its roots.â Thandile Chinyavanhu in South Africa â part of Greenpeace Africa âItâs very important that our government takes action and deviates away from our fossil fuel addiction. âI donât believe South Africaâs ambitions are ambitious enough.â Critics of climate change proposals often question whether climate advocates are willing to make eco-friendly changes to their personal lives. Will you stop eating meat? Will you stop riding on airplanes? Will you take shorter baths? With an Earth Day climate summit hosted by the White House in full swing, those critics turned their eyes to national climate advisor Gina McCarthy and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, for their choice of transportation to attend an event touting electric vehicles. Buttigieg has made a show of riding to his meetings on a bicycle, but was also recently pictured taking that bike off the back of an SUV parked a few blocks away. Allow Twitter content?

There has been plenty of reaction coming in to the announcements at the Leaders Summit. Here's a selection of the comments from environmental campaign groups. Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said:âWe need more ambitious commitments from the big emitters and more binding plans on climate finance, fossil fuel phase outs, and nature restoration which match the urgency of the crisis we face.â Melita Steele, programme director of Greenpeace Africa, commented:âAfrican leaders must do more than just be at the table of biodiversity and climate summits. ""We need them to be serious about tackling emissions at home and unequivocal about protecting their countryâs natural biodiversity in order to tackle a climate crisis which has the continent seeing worse and worse extreme weather impacts every year.â Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said: â[Canadaâs] new target is not aligned with a 1.5C compatible future - that would require a 60% emissions reduction goal. âWe hope to see Canada continue to ramp up ambition, both in future years and as NDC consultations occur in coming months on the road to [the COP26 climate meeting in] Glasgow.â Abby Maxman, chief executive of Oxfam America, described President Bidenâs announcement as a âstep in the right directionâ but added that more action was needed. âThe richest 1% of the worldâs population are responsible for more than twice as much carbon pollution as the 3.1 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity,"" she said. âAs the worldâs richest country and largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the US owes it to the world's most vulnerable to increase its emissions reductions target in order to prevent additional climate change impacts.""  In a separate breakout session, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is leading officials from around the world in a discussion of nature-based solutions to reduce emissions and strengthen climate resilience. Nature-based efforts have been proposed around the world to combat climate change, by reducing deforestation and the loss of wetlands, restoring marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history, has made restorative justice a key aspect of her climate change goals. She is moderating a panel that includes environmental ministers from Canada, Costa Rica, Gabon, Indonesia, Peru and the Seychelles, as well as two indigenous activists. The Biden administration has indicated that climate change will be a key plank of its foreign policy. His director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, and ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield both argue it requires a diplomatic, economic and militaristic effort, what administration officials refer to as ""a whole-of-government effort"". They note the Pentagon has already designated climate change as a national security threat and as a threat multiplier. In the US, the past year has seen wildfires in California, hurricanes in Louisiana and blackouts in Texas, says Thomas-Greenfield, while the world has seen monsoons, droughts and other disasters. ""It doesn't matter where you live. Climate change is a challenge for every person, in every country,"" she says. Only ""a multilateral toolkit"" can ensure that countries and people do not fight over scare resources as the world gets warmer, she says. Thomas-Greenfield says real global cooperation can instead bring ""shared economic opportunity"". Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is now leading a session on how the climate crisis poses a threat to energy, economic and national security. ""Few things deserve to be called existential, but the climate crisis is existential,"" he says, detailing problems caused by coastal erosion, natural disasters and other impacts of global warming. He notes that the US intelligence community under President Biden is undertaking comprehensive climate assessments, which it had not done before. He points out the UK's intelligence assessments of climate security have ""raised the bar"" on how to do these evaluations. Austin is joined by director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and defence officials from six different countries. Nick BeakeEurope Correspondent Pope Francis has just added his voice. In a video
recorded in the Vatican, he warned that the climate crisis will take on an even
greater significance in the post-pandemic world. Leaders must do more to
protect the gift of nature, he stressed. In another message, to mark Earth Day
â an annual event calling for greater protection of the environment â Francis
said Covid-19 had proved the global community could work together to tackle a
catastrophic threat. But the head of the Catholic Church said if leaders were
not courageous and truthful in their efforts to combat climate change, the
result would be self-destruction. When then-President Trump visited Rome in
2017, Francis brought up in conversation the race to save the planet. But
just a week later Trump announced America was to withdraw from the Paris
climate agreement. However, the new incumbent in the White House, a proud
Catholic, appears much more on the Popeâs wavelength. Michael Regan, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is steering an all-female panel of American mayors, global and Indigenous leaders focused on ground-up solutions in their communities. The women gathered today are a ""testament to how women around the world are raising the mantle of climate leadership, developing sustainable solutions"", Regan says. Introducing Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim of the Indigenous Women and Peoples Association of Chad, Regan notes that the world's Indigenous people make up only about 5% of the global population but effectively protect about 80% of global biodiversity. ""How we can lead in harmony with nature?"" Ibrahim says. ""Without Indigenous peoples there is no way."" She says developed countries must now follow the leadership of Indigenous communities in taking climate action. For us, she says, ""protection of nature it is not a policy, it is our way of life"". Asha Karim survived a narrow escape from the 2020California wildfires. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? While of course I wish we'd done more earlier, I think it's never too late to act. Any reduction in harm to the planet is worthwhile. We got here by largely ignoring the problem, so to decide that it's now too late to do anything, that ignorance somehow freed us from responsibility strikes me as selfish and silly. Climate change is a series of positive feedback loops that will keep building upon one another, even more rapidly if we don't change course. Will politics get in the way? It is politicised, in that there is lot of vested financial interest in maintaining the status quo. That financial power is very present in American politics, and we see it reflected in subsidies and lax regulation in many of the industries that heavily contribute to our emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I hope we can lead the way to a much higher standard than we see globally today. I think that committing to the level of action we see elsewhere is a step in the right direction, but far from enough. Being that it is a politicised problem, it may take a while to make change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? What do you hope the US government will do first? I think the American people are onboard with the plan. Climate change has become difficult to ignore. More intense storms, fire seasons, shifts in weather patterns impacting local wildlife - there is some effect of climate change that has touched every person's life in some way. I think most Americans would like to see the US take this problem seriously. As for what we should do first, cutting subsidies for meat and dairy production and reducing our dependence on coal would be impactful places to start. Today's climate summit has a lot of important people making a lot of big promises to combat climate change - carbon caps, finance adaptation, and international cooperation. But let's go back to square one - what even is climate change? The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past. There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. Read more about the basics of climate change. Kim Cobb is a climate scientist. She works at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? This is exactly what we need to get back on track. It is absolutely reflecting a high level of ambition. It's roughly in line with science based targets to keep warming to a minimum this century. We really have an army of amazing folks working on this in DC right now. The winds are at our back in this particular moment. With every American talking about jobs, talking about public health benefits in our low carbon future, this is language that resonates. And I think that there's a way to craft this policy to make sure that there's equity for all and economic benefits for all along the way. I'm just inspired to try to do what I can to go as far as we can, as best as we can. Will politics get in the way? Obviously, getting anything through Congress right now is not a slam dunk, to put it mildly. And I think the devil is going to be in the details as to exactly how this policy is crafted to appeal across the aisle. I have confidence that this administration is bringing people who have worked on policies successfully before. So I think everything we're hearing right now is really aligned towards success. But the next months are going to be absolutely crucial. What do you hope the US government will do first? How are we going to make sure that communities that are deeply invested in fossil fuel infrastructure are not left out of the economic winds in our low carbon future? These kinds of issues are going to be important in terms of building that coalition. At the same time, you have to address the long standing voices who have brought this kind of target forward, such as the youth voices and the people who have focused on environmental justice. Around the world, there are teams of people who are working to track down and destroy hidden sources of greenhouse gases - stopping them from harming the planet. Some of the gases, which are used in refrigeration, have many times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. The BBC's Tom Heap meets some of the people part working to stop these gases causing damage to the planet. Read about the best climate solution you haven't heard of. Victoria Coles is an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. She gave us her thoughts on Biden's new climate pledge. What are your thoughts on Biden's climate pledge? It is never too little too late! As the administrationâs proposed infrastructure plan notes, we already need to spend billions on mitigating climate impacts to build resilience for roads, airports, ports and other infrastructure. That doesn't include the billions from climate and weather-related losses since 1980. Those costs of prior inaction should be front and center when we think about the expense of reducing emissions. Can the US reclaim climate leadership? I am a scientist, not a policy expert. However, I think that legislative rather than executive action is required to stabilise US climate policy from changes in administration. I hope that the American Jobs Plan retains its aggressive investment in climate related action and that, at a minimum, some form of climate legislation can make it through congress. In my view, this, coupled with action rather than discussion, will be needed to convince global leaders that America is serious about climate change. Will Americans be on board with his plan? TheYale climate opinion maps,externaldemonstrate clearly that the majority of Americans support climate policies such as carbon taxes and tax rebates for electric vehicles. The only question in their survey that was not over 50% pro-climate was ""the percentage of adults who think global warming will harm them personally"". Americans worry about climate, they view it as harmful to plants, animals, developing countries and other Americans. But until they view it as an existential threat to their own families, they may not vote for candidates that recognise the climate crisis as a threat to global and national interests. Reality Check At the climate summit, leaders sought to outbid each other with their pledges on cutting carbon emissions over the next decade. The numbers can be confusing, so letâs try to make sense of them. The US pledged to cut carbon emissions by around 50% (from 2005 levels) by 2030. The UK announced a ""world-leading"" target to cut emissions by 78% (from 1990 levels) by 2035, having previously committed to 68% by 2030. Other countries such as Canada have also increased their commitments. Different countries use different years as the starting point for comparison, usually from when their emissions peaked â partly to show their pledges in the best light. For example, the US compares their 2030 target to 2005 levels, and the UK uses 1990 levels - about the time when emissions peaked in their respective countries. However, by either comparison point, the UKâs 2030 target is the most ambitious. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joined other world leaders in today's summit as part of a special session of climate finance. Ardern urged other countries to follow New Zealand's lead in pricing carbon, ending subsidies for fossil fuels and finance environmental adaption. And for Ardern - calling in some 14,000 km from the summit's host - the appearance meant a rather inconvenient call time. On Instagram, the prime minister noted she had a 02:00am local call time for the international meeting. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

French President Emmanuel Macron urges world to 'move more quickly' in tackling climate change. John Kerry, US President Joe Biden's Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, has led a roundtable of global financial leaders - all making their own commitments to tackle the climate crisis. David Malpass, President of the World Bank Group, promised record spending ""in the way that gets the most done"". ""The core of the plan is to spend more,"" he said - focused on flattening carbon emissions from the world's biggest emitters. Malpass also acknowledged what he called the ""severity and the inequality of the current environment"" - noting that poverty, inequality and climate change are linked and require a comprehensive, inclusive solution. Chief executive of Citigroup, Jane Fraser, followed shortly after, repeating the corporation's March commitment to be net zero in carbon emissions by 2050. ""Net zero is easy to say, but very hard to do,"" Fraser said. Kerry thanked her for the support but said that reaching net zero - a formidable challenge - will still not be enough. ""Even if we get to net zero, we still have to get carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,"" he said. ""This is a bigger challenge than a lot of people have grabbed on to yet."" Greta Thunberg is now speaking about the emotional toll of the climate fight on young people. She is pressed on the issue by California Democrat Katie Porter, who says her nine-year-old child told her: ""The Earth is burning and we're all going to die."" Thunberg says it's ""understandable"" that younger generations might be saddened or angry by global warming and political inaction. ""It would be strange if we didn't feel that way because then we wouldn't have any empathy."" ""But there is still much hope and, if we choose to take action and act together, there's unlimited things that we can do."" She adds that her experience taught her that ""the best medication against anger and anxiety is to take action yourself"". The hearing on fossil fuel subsidies now comes to an end. Greta Thunberg tells the US House Environment Subcommittee that, in her conversations, she found a lot of readiness for climate action. ""People are actually more open for change than we realise,"" she says. To those who depend on the fossil fuel industry for jobs and livelihoods, she says: ""Who can blame them?"" People working within the industry ""cannot be left behind,"" she adds. Pointing out that climate issues are not the fault of those people, Thunberg notes that climate advocates would prefer to work with the industry than against or without it. ""Climate justice is social justice. We can't achieve climate justice without social justice,"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Apology after inquiry finds war graves racism,"Boris Johnson said he is ""deeply troubled"" by failures to properly commemorate black and Asian troops who died fighting for the British Empire during World War One. Some troops were commemorated collectively or their names were recorded in registers, while their white counterparts had headstones. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologised in the Commons aftera report,externalblamed ""pervasive racism"". Mr Wallace pledged to ""take action"". The prime minister offered an ""unreserved apology"" over the findings of the review by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. ""Our shared duty is to honour and remember all those, wherever they lived and whatever their background, who laid down their lives for our freedoms at the moment of greatest peril,"" he said. Mr Wallace expressed ""deep regret"" in the House of Commons, as he told MPs there was ""no doubt"" prejudice had played a part in what happened after WWI. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologises: ""There can be no doubt prejudice played a part in some of the commission's decisions"" The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which is tasked with commemorating those who died in the two world wars, has also apologised over its findings. Labour MP David Lammy, who was critical to bringing the matter to light, called it a ""watershed moment"". The African soldiers dragged into Europe's war Marking the memories of a million service personnel Mr Wallace said: ""On behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government both of the time and today, I want to apologise for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation. ""Whilst we can't change the past, we can make amends and take action,"" he said. He said there were cases where the commission ""deliberately overlooked evidence"" that would have allowed it to find the names of the dead. And he said there were examples of officials employing an ""overarching imperial ideology connected to racial and religious differences"" in order to ""divide the dead and treat them unequally in ways that were impossible in Europe"". Outlining the next steps, Mr Wallace said the Commonwealth War Graves Commission will: search in the historical record for inequalities in commemoration and act on what is found renew its commitment to equality in commemoration by building physical or digital commemorative structures use its online presence and wider education activities to reach out to all the communities of the former British Empire touched by the two world wars to make sure their hidden history is brought to life and, over the next six months, assemble a global and diverse community of experts to help make this happen Mr Wallace also announced a public consultation over plans to waive the visa fee for service personnel from the Commonwealth and Nepal who choose to settle in the UK in order to honour their contribution. An inquiry by the commission was set up following a 2019 Channel 4 documentary, calledUnremembered,external, which was presented by Mr Lammy. The report found that at least 116,000 casualties from WW1, most of whom were of African, Indian or Egyptian origin, ""were not commemorated by name or possibly not commemorated at all"". But that figure could be as high as 350,000, it said. It also cited racist comments such as the governor of a British colony saying in 1923 that: ""The average native... would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" This video can not be played David Matthews tells the story of his great-uncle who fought in World War One Shadow justice secretary Mr Lammy told the BBC that while making the documentary in Kenya and Tanzania, he discovered mass graves in which Africans had been ""dumped with no commemoration whatsoever"". He said it was a travesty that men who served the British Empire were not commemorated properly, but welcomed the report. ""I'm just really, really pleased that the dignity that these men deserved - who were dragged from their villages and commandeered to work for the British Empire - that dignity that they deserve in death can be granted to them,"" he said. Mr Lammy added that work must be done to find their names in archives where that is possible, and to establish how local communities would like them to be commemorated. He also said Commonwealth soldiers should not be ""whitewashed"" out of history books, while Mr Wallace said it was a ""deep regret"" that his own WW1 education had included ""very little about the contribution from the Commonwealth countries and the wider at the time British Empire"". This video can not be played David Olusoga: ""It's another organisation that's had to be dragged into admitting its history."" Historian Prof David Olusoga, whose TV company produced Unremembered, told BBC Breakfast that apologies were not enough and resources would need to be committed if the commission was serious about restorative justice. ""If the Commonwealth War Graves Commission had set up a committee and discovered that 100,000 white British soldiers lay in mass graves - unmarked, uncommemorated - and the documentation proved that that had been deliberate, what would they do?"" he said. Six million soldiers from the British Empire served in WW1. Between 45,000 and 54,000 Asian and African personnel who died in the conflict were ""commemorated unequally"", the commission said. World War One was the first truly global war, fought not just in the trenches of France but in the Middle East, Asia and Africa Britain's colonies sent millions of men to fight for the empire during the conflict India, which at that time included Pakistan and Bangladesh, sent the most soldiers - more than 1.4 million The British Army in East Africa was mainly composed of African soldiers by November 1918, according to the Imperial War Museum At least 180,000 Africans served in the Carrier Corps in East Africa and provided logistic support to troops at the front Around 15,000 people from the West Indies enlisted in WW1, including 10,000 from Jamaica, according to the National Army Museum Colonies as far away as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) also sent a similar number between them Britain had soldiers from six different continents: Europe, North America, South America, Australasia, Asia and Africa The report concluded that the failure to properly commemorate the individuals was influenced by a scarcity of information, errors inherited from other organisations and the opinions of colonial administrators. ""Underpinning all these decisions, however, were the entrenched prejudices, preconceptions and pervasive racism of contemporary imperial attitudes,"" it added. The report picked out an example from 1923 when the governor of the Gold Coast colony, now Ghana, argued for collective memorials rather than individual ones. At a meeting in London, it was said that the governor, F G Guggisberg, said: ""The average native of the Gold Coast would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" In response, commission employee Arthur Browne said: ""In perhaps two or three hundred years' time, when the native population had reached a higher stage of civilisation, they might then be glad to see that headstones had been erected on the native graves and that the native soldiers had received precisely the same treatment as their white comrades."" The report said Mr Browne's response showed ""what he may have considered foresight, but one that was explicitly framed by contemporary racial prejudice"". The commission, which was founded in 1917 as the Imperial War Graves Commission, said the events of a century ago were wrong then and were wrong now. Its director general, Claire Horton, said: ""We recognise the wrongs of the past and are deeply sorry and will be acting immediately to correct them."" As part of the commission's work to search for unnamed war dead and those who are potentially not commemorated, it will also look at those who died in World War Two, although it is not thought that inequalities seen in WW1 were as widespread then. Ms Horton said the report was ""sober"" reading but gave the commission the ability - ""now that we know the numbers and the areas to look"" - to start the searches properly to ""right the wrongs of the past"". The war graves commission was founded with a remit to remember every individual who had died in World War One, regardless of rank, class, religion or race. The idea of equal treatment was controversial, but it became a cornerstone of remembrance. Outside Europe, however, the commission enacted a policy of extreme discrimination, categorising the fallen as ""white"", ""Indians"" or what it called ""natives"". In southern Kenya, white soldiers lie beneath named memorials in a well-tended cemetery.  Next door in a scruffy field is where their African comrades are buried - no names, just a general memorial. The consequence of the commission's failings is not only to do a great injustice to the black and Asian soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought alongside their white European comrades in two world wars, it is to misrepresent our history.

India sets global record for new Covid-19 cases,"This video can not be played Scenes outside a hospital in Delhi, where people are dying without getting the treatment they need India has recorded the highest one-day tally of new Covid-19 cases anywhere in the world - and the country's highest number of deaths over 24 hours. It has close to 16 million confirmed cases, second only to the US. The country is struggling with a second wave, raising more fears about its overwhelmed health care system. Crowds have formed outside hospitals in major cities which are filled to capacity. A number of people have died while waiting for oxygen. Families are waiting hours to perform funeral rites, Reuters news agency reports, with at least one Delhi crematorium resorting to building pyres in its car park in order to cope with the numbers arriving. What is the India Covid variant? Why second Covid wave is devastating India How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave 'It feels like we're back to square one in India' Meanwhile, some countries are bringing in stricter rules affecting travel to and from India amid fears over the rising cases. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the number of flights between the two countries would be cut, while theUK has added India to a red list, restricting travel and bringing in hotel quarantine for all arrivals from Indiafrom Friday morning. India is struggling to cope with the soaring numbers - it recorded some 314,835 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,104. Oxygen supply has been a particular problem, with a number of hospitals in the capital Delhi running out entirely on Thursday, according to the city's Deputy Chief Minister, Manish Sisodia. Numerous other hospitals are understood to be running dangerously low on supplies, including one treating another Indian politician, Saurabh Bharadwaj. Delhi legislature member Mr Bharadwaj posted a plea for help in Hindi on Twitter from his hospital bed, saying there were just three hours of oxygen left. ""A lot of people are dependent on oxygen and without oxygen,these people will die just like fish die in the absence of water,"" he said, according to a translation by news channel NDTV,external. ""This is a time for all to come together to work."" The crisis worked its way to Delhi's highest court on Wednesday, where judges publicly criticised the central government for its handling of the oxygen crisis in the city. ""This is ridiculous. We want to know what the centre is doing with regard to oxygen supply across India,"" the judges said while reading out the verdict in a petition by the owner of six private hospitals. On Thursday, as hospitals warned stocks were rapidly diminishing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting to attempt to end the crisis. He asked officials to find ways to produce more oxygen, while telling states to come down ""heavily"" on anyone hoarding supplies. By Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi My phone is constantly ringing with desperate friends and family asking for help to arrange beds and medicine.  Some I am able to help, and some I can't. I personally know of many cases where patients died because they couldn't get oxygen in time. It's heart-breaking for families to hear that the hospital where their loved ones are being treated may soon run out of oxygen. Emergency intervention from the government has stopped any big disaster from happening so far, but there is an urgent need to give hospitals enough oxygen so they can sustain the increasing caseload. But experts are asking why the government allowed the situation to become so dire. The pandemic was under control in January but the lean period was not used to augment healthcare facilities. And now people are paying a heavy price for it, and we are left with a sense of helplessness all around. Unlike last year, no national lockdown has been announced. Instead, regions are implementing their own rules. Delhi announced a week-long lockdown at the weekend,leaving just government offices and essential services like hospitals, pharmacies and grocers open. The authorities in the worst affected state of Maharashtra - which was already under a partial lockdown - have announced a series of additional restrictions starting from Thursday evening. Oxygen leak leaves 22 Covid patients dead in India 'Wherever you look, you see ambulances and bodies' How is India's vaccination drive going? Maharashtra is India's richest state and home to its financial hub, Mumbai. It has also been a Covid hotspot since the start of the pandemic, accounting for a quarter of India's cases. Maharashtra accounts for a quarter of India's more than 15 million Covid cases Maharashtra has also reported more deaths from the virus than any other state, with 67,468. India has sufferednearly 185,000 deaths with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University,external. However, while deaths have been rising, the fatality rate remains relatively low. Uttar Pradesh, which is also reporting a high caseload, has adopted a more conservative approach, with its high court on Monday ordering a lockdown in five badly affected districts. However, it was put on hold after the government appealed against the decision in the Supreme Court. India - which has a population of more than a billion people - has so far administered more than 130 million doses but the drive has been restricted to health workers, frontline staff, those above the age of 45 and anyone with co-morbidities. From 1 May, people above 18 will also be eligible for the vaccine. But a supply crunch, which is already affecting the drive, could slow it down further. The crunch has impacted the Covax programme, which was heavily dependent in India's Serum Institute. It told the BBC it had suffered a shortfall of around 90 million doses after India prioritised its own needs, but says talks are now taking place to resume production. The scheme to share vaccines with other countries Pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced it was in ongoing discussions with the Indian government to supply its Covid-19 vaccine to the country at a not-for-profit price, according to Reuters news agency. India has seen a rapid rise in case numbers over the past month driven by lax safety protocols,a Hindu festival attended by millionsandvariants of the virus, including a ""double mutant"" strain. It was detected in 61% of samples tested in Maharashtra, according to the National Institute of Virology. Huge election rallies - including by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - were also not halted in the state of West Bengal which has been holding elections in phases in recent weeks. The government has defended the decision to continue with the polling.

Your updates today were written by Alex Therrien, Ella Wills, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. They were edited by James Clarke. Tom Davis passed his driving test after a four-month wait And as we come towards the end of our updates, here's a recap of the day's main pandemic news in the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi Many countries in Africa are getting AstraZeneca vaccines through the Covax scheme The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa Centres for
Disease Control (Africa CDC) are urging African countries not to destroy Covid-19
vaccines that have expired. The WHO is asking countries on the continent to hold on to expired
stock and wait for further guidance. The call comes after Malawi and South Sudan said they would
discard more than 70,000 doses of the AstraZeneca jab that were out of date. The Africa CDC says it has spoken to the manufacturer and has been
reassured the vaccines are still safe. Many vaccines can be used up to 36 months after manufacture but, because
Covid-19 jabs are so new, there is not enough data to prove their effectiveness over
longer periods. Whatever the guidance, the final decision rests with national drug
regulators. However, the issue will further increase the challenges around persuading people
on the continent to get vaccinated. The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in Africa has been slow, partly because of
supply issues and scepticism about the jab. Out of 55 African countries, 41 have benefited from the delivery
of vaccines via the global-sharing scheme Covax. Seven are yet to receive their
first batch. A deal has been struck over emergency funding to combat the record backlog of almost 58,000 Crown Court cases caused by funding delays  and exacerbated by the pandemic. The Lord Chief Justice will be able to ask the government for unlimited funding to open up more courtrooms in England and Wales wherever judges are available. But it's not clear in practice how many extra court sitting days will be achievable because of the challenges of social distancing. This restricts the number of defendants who can be safely held in each building - so much so that two courtrooms in Manchester are being knocked into one to allow major gang trials to progress. Find out more on how Covid has impacted criminal caseshere. Households in various of areas of Birmingham are being asked to take Covid-19 PCR tests after a small number of cases of the South Africa variant were found in the city. The cases are not thought to be connected to each other. People aged over 16 in theAlum Rock, Glebe Farm and Tile Cross wards of Birmingham,externalare the latest to be targeted. Testing has already been introduced for people aged 16 and over who live or work in theLadywood, Soho and Jewellery Quarter wards,external. In addition, everybody aged 11 years and over who lives in, works in, or travels through the London boroughs of Lambeth and Wandsworth is being asked to take a PCR test. Forty-four confirmed cases, and 30 probable cases, of the South Africa varianthave been found,externalin the area. All identified cases are self-isolating, or have completed their isolation. Their contacts have been traced and asked to isolate. People living in certain parts of SE16 in theLondon Borough of Southwark,externalare also being contacted - after a case linked to the Lambeth/Wandsworth cluster was identified. Surge testing linked to the South Africa variant is also taking place in parts of: You can find out about surge testing and the new variantshere. Vientiane, Laos Laos has introduced tough lockdown restrictions in its capital and closed its international borders to most traffic due to a Covid cluster in neighbouring Thailand. People living in the capital Vientiane cannot leave the city and only those with permission can enter. Residents can also leave the house for essential food shopping, hospital visits and other authorised tasks. The restrictions last until 5 May. It comes as 28 new cases were confirmed yesterday and six more today, bringing the overall count to 94 - meaning about a third of the cases recorded in the nation since the pandemic began have been in the past two days. The government-owned Vientiane Times reported 26 of yesterday's 28 new cases had contact with a student who had caught the virus from a Thai man. Annabel RackhamBBC Newsbeat Jack Croucher passed in Torquay with no minor faults We've been catching up with learner drivers on the day tests have restarted in England and Wales. Jack Croucher, 22, managed to get hold of a test at ""really short notice"" - so only had three days to prepare. He passed his test with no minor faults but in part credits his dad, who is a professional driving instructor, for free tuition during lockdown. ""Driving up [to the test centre] I was really nervous but once I got into the flow of it, it went really easy and I enjoyed it,"" he says. Courtney Osborn can't wait to take her son out in the car Courtney Osborn is going to use her new-found freedom to go visit her gran - after passing her test this morning. ""I started [learning to drive] in December 2019 and already had had two tests cancelled because of lockdown,"" says the 22-year-old. To get back up to speed in time for the test, Courtney took part in an intensive course when lessons resumed earlier this month. Courtney, who isn't working at the moment, lives in a village in Norfolk and says it's been frustrating not being able to drive anywhere. ""It's been really hard being stuck and now I can take my son out."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People line up to be tested in Hong Kong Over the past week, there has been concern in Hong Kong after a
couple of locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19 were identified involving a
mutant strain. One of the patients had no history of travel, and the other had
already completed 21 days of quarantine after arriving from Dubai. On Monday, health officials in Hong Kong warned there could
be a potential surge of cases as a result of these new cases, and a compulsory
testing order was issued in part of the city. The authorities announced they were
investigating how these two patients might have been infected. Today, South China Morning Post says the probe has concluded, and that experts determined transmission was âlikely to have taken
place at a quarantine hotel viadoor hooks used by staff to deliver meal boxes,externalto guestsâ. The head of Hong Kongâs Centre for Health Protection says
specialists found no problem with the hotelâs ventilation or drainage system,
so the focus turned to S-shaped hooks for hanging food deliveries on, which
were âhard to cleanâ. Hong Kong government advisor Professor David Hui says
virus particles âcould stay on metal surfaces such as door handles for two to three daysâ. All designated quarantine hotels have now been told to place meals
on chairs, rather than on hooks. However, some specialists question the door
handle theory, with one respiratory specialist telling SCMP they think âitâs
more likely the patients exhaled virus particles into narrow corridorsâ. Hong Kong has been trying to avoid a local outbreak byimplementing compulsory quarantines,externalfor overseas arrivals, and temporarily banning flights from high-risk
countries, like India, Pakistan and the Philippines. A plan to reopen the Isle of Man's border to non-residents has been backed by the Manx parliament. It includes a phased relaxation of the border closure from 1 May to allow family to visit under strict conditions. And the government'srevised exit frameworksets a date of 28 June for the lifting of all Covid-19 restrictions including mandatory isolation on arrival. The island's border was closed to most non-residents in March 2020. Chief Minister Howard Quayle says aspects of the plan ""may need to change"" in response to any ""unexpected challenges"" thrown up by the pandemic. Backing the plan, Treasury Minister Alfred Cannan says the island now needs to move towards releasing border restrictions ""for the health, wealth and sanity of the nation"". Here's the full story. Meanwhile, pregnant women on the Isle of Manare to be offered a coronavirus vaccination, the health minister has confirmed. A Norwegian climber hoping to summit Everest has confirmed he has tested positive for coronavirus. ""My diagnosis is Covid-19,"" Erlend Ness has told the AFP news agency in a Facebook message. ""I'm doing ok now... The hospital is taking care (of me)."" The climber was evacuated from the slopes by helicopter and taken to a hospital in Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, after spending time at Everest base camp. A sherpa in the camp has also tested positive, Norwegian broadcaster NRK reports. ""I really hope that none of the others get infected with corona high up in the mountains. It is impossible to evacuate people with a helicopter when they're above 8,000m,"" Ness tells NRK. The high altitude makes the danger of Covid-19 - which can affect breathing - far worse. The events come as a blow to Nepal's hopes of fully relaunching its mountaineering season. You can read about the risks of catching coronavirus outdoors here. We've been bringing you updates on the number of people who have had been jabbed so far - and more than 400,000 members of England's adult social care workforce have not received a coronavirus vaccine, figures suggest. Some 80.4% of eligible staff working at older adult care homes had received the jab by 18 April, NHS England says. A total of 72.3% of staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. For social care staff working in other settings in England, including non-registered providers, the figure is 69.4%. Overall, about 1.17 million out of 1.58 million social care staff in these settings have received a first dose, according to analysis by the PA news agency. This leaves 417,989 social care staff (26.4% of the total) who have not been vaccinated or whose vaccination has not yet been reported. The figures come as the Government has opened a public consultation on aproposal for staff to be required to get a jab as a condition of employment to protect elderly residents.

Your updates today were written by Alex Therrien, Ella Wills, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. They were edited by James Clarke. Tom Davis passed his driving test after a four-month wait And as we come towards the end of our updates, here's a recap of the day's main pandemic news in the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi Many countries in Africa are getting AstraZeneca vaccines through the Covax scheme The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa Centres for
Disease Control (Africa CDC) are urging African countries not to destroy Covid-19
vaccines that have expired. The WHO is asking countries on the continent to hold on to expired
stock and wait for further guidance. The call comes after Malawi and South Sudan said they would
discard more than 70,000 doses of the AstraZeneca jab that were out of date. The Africa CDC says it has spoken to the manufacturer and has been
reassured the vaccines are still safe. Many vaccines can be used up to 36 months after manufacture but, because
Covid-19 jabs are so new, there is not enough data to prove their effectiveness over
longer periods. Whatever the guidance, the final decision rests with national drug
regulators. However, the issue will further increase the challenges around persuading people
on the continent to get vaccinated. The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in Africa has been slow, partly because of
supply issues and scepticism about the jab. Out of 55 African countries, 41 have benefited from the delivery
of vaccines via the global-sharing scheme Covax. Seven are yet to receive their
first batch. A deal has been struck over emergency funding to combat the record backlog of almost 58,000 Crown Court cases caused by funding delays  and exacerbated by the pandemic. The Lord Chief Justice will be able to ask the government for unlimited funding to open up more courtrooms in England and Wales wherever judges are available. But it's not clear in practice how many extra court sitting days will be achievable because of the challenges of social distancing. This restricts the number of defendants who can be safely held in each building - so much so that two courtrooms in Manchester are being knocked into one to allow major gang trials to progress. Find out more on how Covid has impacted criminal caseshere. Households in various of areas of Birmingham are being asked to take Covid-19 PCR tests after a small number of cases of the South Africa variant were found in the city. The cases are not thought to be connected to each other. People aged over 16 in theAlum Rock, Glebe Farm and Tile Cross wards of Birmingham,externalare the latest to be targeted. Testing has already been introduced for people aged 16 and over who live or work in theLadywood, Soho and Jewellery Quarter wards,external. In addition, everybody aged 11 years and over who lives in, works in, or travels through the London boroughs of Lambeth and Wandsworth is being asked to take a PCR test. Forty-four confirmed cases, and 30 probable cases, of the South Africa varianthave been found,externalin the area. All identified cases are self-isolating, or have completed their isolation. Their contacts have been traced and asked to isolate. People living in certain parts of SE16 in theLondon Borough of Southwark,externalare also being contacted - after a case linked to the Lambeth/Wandsworth cluster was identified. Surge testing linked to the South Africa variant is also taking place in parts of: You can find out about surge testing and the new variantshere. Vientiane, Laos Laos has introduced tough lockdown restrictions in its capital and closed its international borders to most traffic due to a Covid cluster in neighbouring Thailand. People living in the capital Vientiane cannot leave the city and only those with permission can enter. Residents can also leave the house for essential food shopping, hospital visits and other authorised tasks. The restrictions last until 5 May. It comes as 28 new cases were confirmed yesterday and six more today, bringing the overall count to 94 - meaning about a third of the cases recorded in the nation since the pandemic began have been in the past two days. The government-owned Vientiane Times reported 26 of yesterday's 28 new cases had contact with a student who had caught the virus from a Thai man.

""It's been really hard being stuck and now I can take my son out."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People line up to be tested in Hong Kong Over the past week, there has been concern in Hong Kong after a
couple of locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19 were identified involving a
mutant strain. One of the patients had no history of travel, and the other had
already completed 21 days of quarantine after arriving from Dubai. On Monday, health officials in Hong Kong warned there could
be a potential surge of cases as a result of these new cases, and a compulsory
testing order was issued in part of the city. The authorities announced they were
investigating how these two patients might have been infected. Today, South China Morning Post says the probe has concluded, and that experts determined transmission was âlikely to have taken
place at a quarantine hotel viadoor hooks used by staff to deliver meal boxes,externalto guestsâ. The head of Hong Kongâs Centre for Health Protection says
specialists found no problem with the hotelâs ventilation or drainage system,
so the focus turned to S-shaped hooks for hanging food deliveries on, which
were âhard to cleanâ. Hong Kong government advisor Professor David Hui says
virus particles âcould stay on metal surfaces such as door handles for two to three daysâ. All designated quarantine hotels have now been told to place meals
on chairs, rather than on hooks. However, some specialists question the door
handle theory, with one respiratory specialist telling SCMP they think âitâs
more likely the patients exhaled virus particles into narrow corridorsâ. Hong Kong has been trying to avoid a local outbreak byimplementing compulsory quarantines,externalfor overseas arrivals, and temporarily banning flights from high-risk
countries, like India, Pakistan and the Philippines. A plan to reopen the Isle of Man's border to non-residents has been backed by the Manx parliament. It includes a phased relaxation of the border closure from 1 May to allow family to visit under strict conditions. And the government'srevised exit frameworksets a date of 28 June for the lifting of all Covid-19 restrictions including mandatory isolation on arrival. The island's border was closed to most non-residents in March 2020. Chief Minister Howard Quayle says aspects of the plan ""may need to change"" in response to any ""unexpected challenges"" thrown up by the pandemic. Backing the plan, Treasury Minister Alfred Cannan says the island now needs to move towards releasing border restrictions ""for the health, wealth and sanity of the nation"". Here's the full story. Meanwhile, pregnant women on the Isle of Manare to be offered a coronavirus vaccination, the health minister has confirmed. A Norwegian climber hoping to summit Everest has confirmed he has tested positive for coronavirus. ""My diagnosis is Covid-19,"" Erlend Ness has told the AFP news agency in a Facebook message. ""I'm doing ok now... The hospital is taking care (of me)."" The climber was evacuated from the slopes by helicopter and taken to a hospital in Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, after spending time at Everest base camp. A sherpa in the camp has also tested positive, Norwegian broadcaster NRK reports. ""I really hope that none of the others get infected with corona high up in the mountains. It is impossible to evacuate people with a helicopter when they're above 8,000m,"" Ness tells NRK. The high altitude makes the danger of Covid-19 - which can affect breathing - far worse. The events come as a blow to Nepal's hopes of fully relaunching its mountaineering season. You can read about the risks of catching coronavirus outdoors here. We've been bringing you updates on the number of people who have had been jabbed so far - and more than 400,000 members of England's adult social care workforce have not received a coronavirus vaccine, figures suggest. Some 80.4% of eligible staff working at older adult care homes had received the jab by 18 April, NHS England says. A total of 72.3% of staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. For social care staff working in other settings in England, including non-registered providers, the figure is 69.4%. Overall, about 1.17 million out of 1.58 million social care staff in these settings have received a first dose, according to analysis by the PA news agency. This leaves 417,989 social care staff (26.4% of the total) who have not been vaccinated or whose vaccination has not yet been reported. The figures come as the Government has opened a public consultation on aproposal for staff to be required to get a jab as a condition of employment to protect elderly residents.

Charities call UK's Â£500m aid cut a tragic blow,"Charities said countries ""ravaged"" by disease, war and poverty were among those losing aid Cuts to humanitarian aid by the UK are a ""tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people"", 200 charities said in a joint statement. Organisations including Save the Children and Oxfam said humanitarian assistance was being reduced by more than Â£500m. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes reflected a ""strategic shift"" in UK aid spending. He also said the Â£18m aid budget given to China will be reduced to Â£900,000. Following the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis,the chancellor cut the foreign aid budgetfrom 0.7% to 0.5% of total national income - a reduction of around Â£4bn. The Foreign Office controls 80% of aid spending - Â£8bn - and the priorities were set out by Mr Raab in a written statement. More than Â£1bn will be spent on Covid and global health, Â£500m towards tackling climate change and Â£400m on getting girls into education. Charity warns UK aid to see 63% cut in funding UK's foreign aid spending cut by Â£2.9bn Aid cut likely to last for 'foreseeable future' Mr Raab said it was a ""challenging financial climate"" due to Covid-19, but said the government had sought ""maximum strategic coherence, impact and value for taxpayers' money"". But aid charities said even the priority areas were receiving less than before, and Â£500m less was being spent on humanitarian aid. The 200 charities, which also include Christian Aid and Care International, said: ""Today's announcement is a tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people the UK once supported, and for the UK's reputation as a trusted development partner. ""The government has not even spared countries ravaged by humanitarian crisis, disease, war and poverty."" Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, accused the government of ""making cuts with no consideration for the human harm they will cause"" after reducing aid in Yemen, ""the world's biggest humanitarian crisis"". The government announced it was cutting foreign aid last November but it has still to say precisely where the axe will fall. Charities are waiting anxiously to see which programmes will lose funding, and which will survive. But we are getting some indications from government now about its priorities: climate change, Covid and global health, girls' education, supporting open societies, trade and economic development and so on. The numbers announced by the Foreign Office allow charities to calculate how much less will be spent on each area than before. That will help them plan. What these numbers will not do is diminish the controversy. Ministers argue the decision to cut aid has been made, it is time to decide how best to make it happen. But aid charities and many MPs - including a goodly number of Conservatives - still oppose the cuts and are working to stop them. Plans for a legal challenge are being considered. Critics say the government can't ignore a legally binding targetto spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. The FCDO reckons it can make the cuts without holding a vote to change the law. Campaigners might want a judge to decide who is right. For now, the government is pressing ahead with cuts it says are needed to keep the Treasury in funds for other priorities. Of the Â£8bn, the Foreign Office will give more than Â£3bn to multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank. Half of all UK bilateral aid will be spent in Africa, a third in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia. The remaining humanitarian aid budget, focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan, is Â£906m. Mr Raab also announced he would cut Foreign Office aid to China by 95%, to Â£900,000. But other parts of government, such as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, give more aid to China and have yet to say if they will cut their payments too.

""The situation is very critical, medical staff are

"Labour calls for probe into PM-Dyson textsThe party wants a ""thorough investigation"" into Boris Johnson's conduct, amid a row over lobbying.","Sir James Dyson texted the prime minister last March when he was involved in efforts to provide ventilators Labour has called for a ""thorough investigation"" into Boris Johnson's contacts with inventor Sir James Dyson. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the messages between the prime minister and Sir James opened up a ""new urgent corridor of inquiry"". The texts - seen by the BBC - show Mr Johnson saying he could ""fix"" tax issues relating to Dyson staff who came to the UK to work on the pandemic. The PM said he made ""no apology"" for trying to get ventilators for the NHS. Labour has said the text messages are part of a pattern of government ""sleaze"" and has called on the cross-party Liaison Committee of senior MPs to investigate ""as soon as possible"". Ms Reeves claimed there was ""a growing feeling that if someone has access to a telephone number of someone like the prime minister or the chancellor, then they are able to gain special treatment"". Liaison Committee Chair Sir Bernard Jenkin said the MPs would consider Ms Reeves request adding that the prime minster was due to appear in front of the committee before the summer recess. Billionaire Dyson moves residency back to the UK PM: I did right thing over Dyson ventilators What is lobbying? A brief guide In March last year, the Department of Health feared the NHS in England would need as many as 20,000 additional ventilators to deal with Covid patients. It asked companies, including Dyson, which is based in Singapore, to help. The prime minister is understood to have called Sir James on 13 March and asked him to participate. Dyson answered the call - although subsequently the company was not called upon to provide ventilators to the NHS. Sir James contacted the Treasury for assurances there would be no extra tax to pay for employees who came to the UK to help. When he failed to get a response, he texted the prime minister directly. In exchanges seen by the BBC, Mr Johnson messaged Sir James saying: ""[Chancellor] Rishi [Sunak] says it is fixed!! We need you here."" When the businessman sought further reassurance for the tax status of the firm and ""senior individuals"", Mr Johnson replied: ""I am First Lord of the Treasury and you can take it that we are backing you to do what you need."" Two weeks later, Mr Sunak told a group of MPs that the tax status of people who came to the UK to provide specific help during the pandemic would not be affected. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he made ""no apology for moving heaven and earth"" to persuade businesses to help bolster supplies of equipment and ventilators to treat coronavirus patients. He said he had done the ""right thing"" and that ""any prime minister"" would have done the same in the circumstances. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on Mr Johnson to reveal ""how many more Covid contracts he personally fixed"" and publish all personal exchanges on these contracts. But Mr Johnson said there was ""nothing to conceal about this"" and he would share details with MPs. The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson had abided by the ministerial code, governing conduct in office, and had ""informed officials in a timely manner"" after his contact with Sir James. He added that he did not know when the prime minister would publish his exchanges with Sir James. Separately, it is understood some in government have suggested the prime minister should be less willing to share his personal contact details - but officials have denied that he was told to change his mobile phone number. It was also revealed recently that former Prime Minister David Cameron hadcontacted several ministers- including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, whom he texted - on behalf of the failed finance firm Greensill Capital. Several inquiries have been launched looking into the work of lobbyists, whose job it is to influence government policy. Mr Cameron has denied that he broke any codes of conduct or any government rules on lobbying.

Your updates today were written by Alex Therrien, Ella Wills, George Wright and Jennifer Meierhans. They were edited by James Clarke. Tom Davis passed his driving test after a four-month wait And as we come towards the end of our updates, here's a recap of the day's main pandemic news in the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi Many countries in Africa are getting AstraZeneca vaccines through the Covax scheme The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa Centres for
Disease Control (Africa CDC) are urging African countries not to destroy Covid-19
vaccines that have expired. The WHO is asking countries on the continent to hold on to expired
stock and wait for further guidance. The call comes after Malawi and South Sudan said they would
discard more than 70,000 doses of the AstraZeneca jab that were out of date. The Africa CDC says it has spoken to the manufacturer and has been
reassured the vaccines are still safe. Many vaccines can be used up to 36 months after manufacture but, because
Covid-19 jabs are so new, there is not enough data to prove their effectiveness over
longer periods. Whatever the guidance, the final decision rests with national drug
regulators. However, the issue will further increase the challenges around persuading people
on the continent to get vaccinated. The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in Africa has been slow, partly because of
supply issues and scepticism about the jab. Out of 55 African countries, 41 have benefited from the delivery
of vaccines via the global-sharing scheme Covax. Seven are yet to receive their
first batch. A deal has been struck over emergency funding to combat the record backlog of almost 58,000 Crown Court cases caused by funding delays  and exacerbated by the pandemic. The Lord Chief Justice will be able to ask the government for unlimited funding to open up more courtrooms in England and Wales wherever judges are available. But it's not clear in practice how many extra court sitting days will be achievable because of the challenges of social distancing. This restricts the number of defendants who can be safely held in each building - so much so that two courtrooms in Manchester are being knocked into one to allow major gang trials to progress. Find out more on how Covid has impacted criminal caseshere. Households in various of areas of Birmingham are being asked to take Covid-19 PCR tests after a small number of cases of the South Africa variant were found in the city. The cases are not thought to be connected to each other. People aged over 16 in theAlum Rock, Glebe Farm and Tile Cross wards of Birmingham,externalare the latest to be targeted. Testing has already been introduced for people aged 16 and over who live or work in theLadywood, Soho and Jewellery Quarter wards,external. In addition, everybody aged 11 years and over who lives in, works in, or travels through the London boroughs of Lambeth and Wandsworth is being asked to take a PCR test. Forty-four confirmed cases, and 30 probable cases, of the South Africa varianthave been found,externalin the area. All identified cases are self-isolating, or have completed their isolation. Their contacts have been traced and asked to isolate. People living in certain parts of SE16 in theLondon Borough of Southwark,externalare also being contacted - after a case linked to the Lambeth/Wandsworth cluster was identified. Surge testing linked to the South Africa variant is also taking place in parts of: You can find out about surge testing and the new variantshere. Vientiane, Laos Laos has introduced tough lockdown restrictions in its capital and closed its international borders to most traffic due to a Covid cluster in neighbouring Thailand. People living in the capital Vientiane cannot leave the city and only those with permission can enter. Residents can also leave the house for essential food shopping, hospital visits and other authorised tasks. The restrictions last until 5 May. It comes as 28 new cases were confirmed yesterday and six more today, bringing the overall count to 94 - meaning about a third of the cases recorded in the nation since the pandemic began have been in the past two days. The government-owned Vientiane Times reported 26 of yesterday's 28 new cases had contact with a student who had caught the virus from a Thai man. Annabel RackhamBBC Newsbeat Jack Croucher passed in Torquay with no minor faults We've been catching up with learner drivers on the day tests have restarted in England and Wales. Jack Croucher, 22, managed to get hold of a test at ""really short notice"" - so only had three days to prepare. He passed his test with no minor faults but in part credits his dad, who is a professional driving instructor, for free tuition during lockdown. ""Driving up [to the test centre] I was really nervous but once I got into the flow of it, it went really easy and I enjoyed it,"" he says. Courtney Osborn can't wait to take her son out in the car Courtney Osborn is going to use her new-found freedom to go visit her gran - after passing her test this morning. ""I started [learning to drive] in December 2019 and already had had two tests cancelled because of lockdown,"" says the 22-year-old. To get back up to speed in time for the test, Courtney took part in an intensive course when lessons resumed earlier this month. Courtney, who isn't working at the moment, lives in a village in Norfolk and says it's been frustrating not being able to drive anywhere. ""It's been really hard being stuck and now I can take my son out."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People line up to be tested in Hong Kong Over the past week, there has been concern in Hong Kong after a
couple of locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19 were identified involving a
mutant strain. One of the patients had no history of travel, and the other had
already completed 21 days of quarantine after arriving from Dubai. On Monday, health officials in Hong Kong warned there could
be a potential surge of cases as a result of these new cases, and a compulsory
testing order was issued in part of the city. The authorities announced they were
investigating how these two patients might have been infected. Today, South China Morning Post says the probe has concluded, and that experts determined transmission was âlikely to have taken
place at a quarantine hotel viadoor hooks used by staff to deliver meal boxes,externalto guestsâ. The head of Hong Kongâs Centre for Health Protection says
specialists found no problem with the hotelâs ventilation or drainage system,
so the focus turned to S-shaped hooks for hanging food deliveries on, which
were âhard to cleanâ. Hong Kong government advisor Professor David Hui says
virus particles âcould stay on metal surfaces such as door handles for two to three daysâ. All designated quarantine hotels have now been told to place meals
on chairs, rather than on hooks. However, some specialists question the door
handle theory, with one respiratory specialist telling SCMP they think âitâs
more likely the patients exhaled virus particles into narrow corridorsâ. Hong Kong has been trying to avoid a local outbreak byimplementing compulsory quarantines,externalfor overseas arrivals, and temporarily banning flights from high-risk

People living in the capital Vientiane cannot leave the city and only those with permission can enter. Residents can also leave the house for essential food shopping, hospital visits and other authorised tasks. The restrictions last until 5 May. It comes as 28 new cases were confirmed yesterday and six more today, bringing the overall count to 94 - meaning about a third of the cases recorded in the nation since the pandemic began have been in the past two days. The government-owned Vientiane Times reported 26 of yesterday's 28 new cases had contact with a student who had caught the virus from a Thai man.

Jack Croucher, 22, managed to get hold of a test at ""really short notice"" - so only had three days to prepare. He passed his test with no minor faults but in part credits his dad, who is a professional driving instructor, for free tuition during lockdown.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People line up to be tested in Hong Kong Over the past week, there has been concern in Hong Kong after a
couple of locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19 were identified involving a
mutant strain. One of the patients had no history of travel, and the other had
already completed 21 days of quarantine after arriving from Dubai. On Monday, health officials in Hong Kong warned there could
be a potential surge of cases as a result of these new cases, and a compulsory
testing order was issued in part of the city. The authorities announced they were
investigating how these two patients might have been infected. Today, South China Morning Post says the probe has concluded, and that experts determined transmission was âlikely to have taken
place at a quarantine hotel viadoor hooks used by staff to deliver meal boxes,externalto guestsâ. The head of Hong Kongâs Centre for Health Protection says
specialists found no problem with the hotelâs ventilation or drainage system,
so the focus turned to S-shaped hooks for hanging food deliveries on, which
were âhard to cleanâ. Hong Kong government advisor Professor David Hui says
virus particles âcould stay on metal surfaces such as door handles for two to three daysâ. All designated quarantine hotels have now been told to place meals
on chairs, rather than on hooks. However, some specialists question the door
handle theory, with one respiratory specialist telling SCMP they think âitâs
more likely the patients exhaled virus particles into narrow corridorsâ. Hong Kong has been trying to avoid a local outbreak byimplementing compulsory quarantines,externalfor overseas arrivals, and temporarily banning flights from high-risk
countries, like India, Pakistan and the Philippines. A plan to reopen the Isle of Man's border to non-residents has been backed by the Manx parliament. It includes a phased relaxation of the border closure from 1 May to allow family to visit under strict conditions. And the government'srevised exit frameworksets a date of 28 June for the lifting of all Covid-19 restrictions including mandatory isolation on arrival. The island's border was closed to most non-residents in March 2020. Chief Minister Howard Quayle says aspects of the plan ""may need to change"" in response to any ""unexpected challenges"" thrown up by the pandemic. Backing the plan, Treasury Minister Alfred Cannan says the island now needs to move towards releasing border restrictions ""for the health, wealth and sanity of the nation"". Here's the full story.

A Norwegian climber hoping to summit Everest has confirmed he has tested positive for coronavirus. ""My diagnosis is Covid-19,"" Erlend Ness has told the AFP news agency in a Facebook message. ""I'm doing ok now... The hospital is taking care (of me)."" The climber was evacuated from the slopes by helicopter and taken to a hospital in Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, after spending time at Everest base camp. A sherpa in the camp has also tested positive, Norwegian broadcaster NRK reports. ""I really hope that none of the others get infected with corona high up in the mountains. It is impossible to evacuate people with a helicopter when they're above 8,000m,"" Ness tells NRK. The high altitude makes the danger of Covid-19 - which can affect breathing - far worse. The events come as a blow to Nepal's hopes of fully relaunching its mountaineering season. You can read about the risks of catching coronavirus outdoors here. We've been bringing you updates on the number of people who have had been jabbed so far - and more than 400,000 members of England's adult social care workforce have not received a coronavirus vaccine, figures suggest. Some 80.4% of eligible staff working at older adult care homes had received the jab by 18 April, NHS England says. A total of 72.3% of staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. For social care staff working in other settings in England, including non-registered providers, the figure is 69.4%. Overall, about 1.17 million out of 1.58 million social care staff in these settings have received a first dose, according to analysis by the PA news agency. This leaves 417,989 social care staff (26.4% of the total) who have not been vaccinated or whose vaccination has not yet been reported. The figures come as the Government has opened a public consultation on aproposal for staff to be required to get a jab as a condition of employment to protect elderly residents. A total of 44,450,252 coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,government figures show.,external That's 33,257,651 first doses and 11,192,601 second doses.

A further 18 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,today's government data shows.,external It brings the total number of people to die in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 127,345. A total of 2,729 new infections have also been recorded. The number of over 50s vaccinated has now hit 95% in England, NHS data shows. The take-up among those aged 45-49 is at 59% after they started being offered the jab earlier this month. But uptake among care home staff - one of the first groups to be offered the jab - is still at about 80%, despite attempts to get more to come forward. Latest figures show more than 33 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine with more than 10 million having received both doses.

""The situation is very critical, medical staff are
exhausted, ICUs have reached their maximum capacity and deaths
are on the rise,"" says Amenallah Messadi, a member of a scientific committee that advises the government. He blames the surge in cases on the spread of the Covid variant that was first detected in Britain. The government has closed all schools until 30 April and
banned people from driving cars at night to restrict movement. Tunisia has recorded about 10,000 deaths since the pandemic began. Keith Farrow said he had been left feeling anxious People in an English town say they are ""in limbo"" over when they will get their second Covid jabs, despite waiting longer than the recommended time. Government guidance says everyone should be offered a second vaccine dose within 12 weeks of the first jab to be fully vaccinated against the virus. But Keith Farrow, 75, who lives in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, says his 12-week wait was up on Sunday 18 April and he is still waiting. Another local resident has told the BBC they feel they have been ""left in limbo"", while others say they are concerned that delays could make them more vulnerable to Covid-19. Deputy chief nurse Rebecca Neno, from NHS Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group, said ""immunity doesn't just end at 12 weeks"".

Church shortlists 'must include ethnic minorities',"All shortlists for senior Church of England posts must include at least one ethnic minority candidate, a report has said. It is one of 47 recommendations made by the Archbishops' Anti-Racism Taskforce, which was established last year after the Black Lives Matter protests. It said the Church has ""an alarmingly retrograde trend"" when it comes to ethnic minority senior bishops. Failing to act would have ""devastating effects"" on the future of the Church. The archbishops of Canterbury and York welcomed the report but did not commit to enforcing the recommendation on shortlists. It comes after the Archbishop of Canterbury,Justin Welby, this week said the Church should not use non-disclosure agreements, following BBC Panorama revelations that they were being used to silence staff complaining of racism. Clergy speak out over 'racism in Church of England' Church is 'deeply institutionally racist' - Welby Ex-bishop rebuked over racial stereotyping The taskforce examined 25 previous reports on racial justice over the past 36 years and said that despite hundreds of recommendations, the Church had overseen ""decades of inaction"" which ""carry consequences"". It called for annual reporting on recruitment, mandatory training in all dioceses to embed anti-racism practice, and for full-time racial justice officers to be employed in every diocese for a five-year term. It wants to see a plan drawn up to increase representation of minority ethnic people to at least 15% at all levels of governance by 2030, reflecting the proportion of minority ethnic worshippers. Currently, there are just five minority ethnic bishops and nine deans, archdeacons, and senior staff. The most recent figures reveal 93.7% of senior staff in the Church - including bishops, archdeacons and cathedral clergy - were white British. All the proposals have a timetable for action and details of which part of the Church is responsible for delivery. ""A failure to act now will be seen as another indication, potentially a last straw for many, that the Church is not serious about racial sin,"" the report said. The taskforce also said statues linked to slavery in churches should be given extra context. ""While history should not be hidden, we also do not want to unconditionally celebrate or commemorate people who contributed to or benefitted from the tragedy that was the slave trade,"" the report said. Augustine Tanner-Ihm believes ""this is a safeguarding issue, not just a 'woke' issue"" Last year, the archbishop of Canterbury said the Church was""still deeply institutionally racist"". He and the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, welcomed the taskforce's report and said they would implement five of the recommendations ""immediately"". These include establishing a racial justice commission and a racial justice directorate to implement the taskforce's recommendations, and encouraging the General Synod to co-opt 10 ethnic minority candidates to serve as members between 2021-26. They said: ""We hope we will be the generation to halt this cycle of inaction."" In an interview with Nick Robinson on the Political Thinking podcast, Mr Welby said he was ""committed to contextualisation"" for controversial statues in churches but said ""99.99% will stay"". Rev Arun Arora, from Durham diocese and taskforce co-chair, said he hoped the report will ""be a watershed moment in the Church's journey towards racial justice"". Co-chair Rev Sonia Barron, from Lincoln diocese, said the current culture in the Church ""tolerates certain kinds of racism, and it's therefore essential that that culture changes"". She added: ""There's now a genuine sense of urgency I think, and a need for action, and we cannot let this moment pass."" But Augustine Tanner-Ihm,who had accused the Church of racism, said he did not think the report would lead to real change. ""More reports isn't going to help anything,"" he told BBC News. ""Actually, this is a safeguarding issue, not just a 'woke' issue."" ""In the Bible it says judge people by their fruits - what do they produce? ""And actually, for over 100 years, the Church hasn't produced any fruit when it comes to race relations, and I don't think it will.""

Met Office to build climate supercomputer,"The Met Office's existing supercomputer The Met Office is working with Microsoft to build a weather forecasting supercomputer in the UK. They say it will provide more accurate weather forecasting and a better understanding of climate change. TheUK government said,externalin February 2020 it would invest Â£1.2bn in the project. It is expected to be one of the top 25 supercomputers in the world when it is up and running in the summer of 2022. Microsoft plans to update it over the next decade as computing improves. ""This partnership is an impressive public investment in the basic and applied sciences of weather and climate,"" said Morgan O'Neill, assistant professor at Stanford University, who is independent of the project. ""Such a major investment in a state-of-the-art weather and climate prediction system by the UK is great news globally, and I look forward to the scientific advances that will follow."" The Met Office said the technology would increase their understanding of the weather  - and will allow people to better plan activities, prepare for inclement weather and get a better understanding of climate change. The supercomputer will be able to: provide more detailed weather models run more potential weather scenarios improve localised forecasts better predict severe weather The new supercomputer will be six times more capable than the current one ""Working together we will provide the highest quality weather and climate datasets and ever more accurate forecasts that enable decisions to allow people to stay safe and thrive,"" said Penny Endersby, chief executive of the Met Office. Microsoft UK chief executive Clare Barclay said the supercomputer would help the UK remain at the forefront of climate science. The exact location for the new computer was not revealed; however, the Met Office said it would be in the south of the UK. It will use Microsoft Azure's cloud computing services and integrate Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Cray supercomputers. It will run on 100% renewable energy and will have more than 1.5 million processor cores and more than 60 petaflops - or 60 quadrillion (60,000,000,000,000,000) calculations per second. That will, in theory, allow it to handle more data, more rapidly, and run it through simulations of the atmospheremore accurately. Cody Godwin is a reporter based in San Francisco.

Can unionists block another independence referendum?,"In the 2014 referendum 55% of people in Scotland voted ""no"" to independence In the second of a two-part series looking at the Scottish election, we explore the strategies of the parties who want to stop another independence referendum. Scotland goes to the polls in a couple of weeks' time - and the result could have a significant impact on the future of the union. The SNP and Scottish Greens back another referendum in the next five years. Alex Salmond - who is leading the new Alba Party - wants even more urgency.I wrote about it earlier this week. But unionist parties - those who favour Scotland staying part of the UK - are going into this election trying to stop them holding the balance of power, and arguing a debate on Scotland's constitutional future would be a distraction when the country is trying to recover from coronavirus. So what's their plan to convince voters? SCOTLAND ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage If you look at most election campaigns, the main question is normally a simple one. Who do you want to run the country? Things are slightly different in Scotland just now. The main opposition parties don't really argue that they are going to form the next Scottish government. Instead, they are asking voters to back them to stop the SNP winning a majority - and to stop another independence referendum. Douglas Ross wants to avoid another referendum by preventing the SNP from winning a majority The Scottish Conservative pitch at this election relies heavily on their unionist credentials. In the last few years, opposition to independence has given the party a new lease of life in Scotland, leading them to leapfrog Scottish Labour into second place last time around. Douglas Ross, the party's new leader, told me forRadio 4's PM programme: ""If we can stop that SNP majority again we can stop another referendum and really get our parliament and Scottish politics focussed on recovery - and I think that's where the public want to see their politicians really focussing all their efforts."" There's a bit of an irony in that answer. While the Conservatives are opposed to a referendum - they are happy to talk about independence because it is one of their main selling points to the electorate. There's also the fact that Boris Johnson has made clear that he will refuse to grant the Scottish Parliament the power to hold another referendum - even if there's a pro-independence majority. I asked Douglas Ross: doesn't the prime minister saying he'll block a referendum undermine the argument that you need to vote Conservative at Holyrood to stop one? ""The SNP have said they don't care what a Tory PM or a UK government says - they will go ahead regardless with a wildcat, illegal referendum,"" he said, referring to the SNP's suggestion it would pass a referendum bill and dare Westminster to challenge it in the courts. He added: ""Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed she wants a referendum in the next couple of years. She has accepted that means campaigning to separate Scotland from the rest of the UK during our recovery phase from this pandemic - and I don't want to see that division and arguments breaking up families and workplaces and communities again"". Scottish Labour's new leader Anas Sarwar does not want to go over ""old arguments"" on the constitution Opposition to independence has reinvigorated the Tories in Scotland - they have in the past urged people to lend them their votes to stop another referendum and in the past it seems to have worked. The opposite is true for Labour, the party who once dominated Scotland. Their apparent lack of clarity on the constitution is seen as one of the main reasons their support has fallen. I've written before aboutthe party's Scotland problem. But there is some optimism under new leader Anas Sarwar. There are even some whispers about the party maybe retaking second place as an alternative to both the SNP and Conservatives (those whispers are played down by Labour strategists - and dismissed as fanciful by many Tories too). A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.More information about these elections Enter your postcode, or the name of your English council or Scottish or Welsh constituency to find out. Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Mr Sarwar told me: ""The mistake that both Douglas Ross and Nicola Sturgeon make is they think they can only talk to the half of the country that agrees with them and not the other half. I'm not willing to do that."" The problem is - Labour has tried to move beyond the constitution before. It's position has, the argument goes, left it in a bit of a constitutional no man's land; nationalists disliked that it didn't support independence, unionists thought it was too soft. Mr Sarwar added: ""People know my view. I don't support independence - I don't support a referendum. I think it would be wrong for us to come through this collective trauma of Covid and go back to those old arguments where we seek to divide people across the country. Instead I want to focus on rebuilding our NHS, restoring our economy, renewing our education system so that it works for everyone across the country.""

I've been speaking to quite a few candidates in the last couple of weeks. On the unionist side - many would admit tactical voting is a big part of this election. If the Conservatives are the biggest pro-union party in an area, some Labour voters are considering lending them their vote or vice versa. Many candidates would argue it has worked in the past. But there are some unionist strategists who are nervous. They believe the SNP have a decent chance of forming a majority on their own. Even if they don't there is likely to be a pro-referendum majority when you factor in the Scottish Greens (and maybe Alex Salmond's Alba). So being the biggest unionist party in the next parliament really matters. The leader of that party will play a big part in framing the debate over another referendum. If one does happen they'll be a key voice in framing the arguments which could decide the future of the union Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, says he wants to ""put the recovery first"" There is another unionist voice in this debate too. The Scottish Liberal Democrats. In the early years of devolution, they were in power with Labour as a coalition. In the last Holyrood parliament, they were the fifth party. Their leader, Willie Rennie, told me: ""What we want to do is put the recovery first. We want to tackle the issues that we're really strong on in terms of investing in mental health services, education, climate, jobs. Those are the top priorities for the Liberal Democrats. You won't get that with the Conservatives - because they want to spend the next five years arguing with the SNP about independence."" He added: ""We need partnership and we need to make sure we put that dark division of the last five years certainly - the poisonous atmosphere that's developed - behind us and work together in partnership."" This video can not be played Election 2021: How does Scotland's voting system work? You'll notice the pitch is quite similar among the three major unionist parties: vote for us so we can focus on recovery from the pandemic instead of independence. The SNP say the opposite - independence is crucial to controlling that recovery In two weeks' time we'll find out which of those visions Scottish voters prefer.

Google and Apple attacked on app store 'monopoly',"Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook Senators have grilled Apple and Google in Washington over ""anti-competitive"" behaviour related to their app stores. Representatives from Tile, Spotify and Match also gave evidence, accusing the two tech firms of charging exorbitant fees and copying their ideas. Both Apple and Google's app stores charge fees of up to 30% for in-app purchases. The two companies said the fees were justified to provide security for users. The Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel focussed on claims that Apple's App Store and Google's Google Play are anti-competitive. Senator Amy Klobuchar said that Apple's App Store was a ""literal monopoly"". She said both stores ""exclude or suppress apps that compete with their own products"" and ""charge excessive fees that affect competition in the app store economy"". Google Play and the App Store are where the vast majority of apps worldwide are downloaded. Developers claim that because of a lack of competition Apple and Google can charge extortionate rates. There were also claims that Apple used its App Store to unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's new AirTag The hearing came a day after Apple launched its new product: AirTags. These can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them. The product looks very similar to something already on the market - Tile. Tile's locator disc Tile's General Counsel Kirsten Daru said ""We welcome competition but it has to be fair competition and Apple's idea of competing is patently unfair."" She also accused Apple of preventing Tile from using the technology behind Apple's Find My function, giving AirTags an unfair advantage. Apple said the product was different. ""We didn't copy Tile's product... It's extremely different to anything else on the market,"" said Apple's Chief Compliance Officer, Kyle Andeer. Spotify also accused Apple of using its App Store to charge unfair rates - something Spotify's Head of Global Affairs, Horacio Gutierrez, described as an ""Apple Tax"". He also said that Apple directly competed with Spotify with Apple Music, and the in-app charges had made Spotify less competitive. ""They are undercutting us on price,"" he said. He also criticised Apple for having rules that meant they were unable to tell customers that the service was cheaper if it was bought away from the App Store. Apple said that Spotify had ""been incredibly aggressive when it comes to dealing with artists and creators, and driving a hard bargain"". Mr Andeer said that ""less than 1% of Spotify users pay a commission to Apple"". Match, which owns Tinder, also criticised Apple and Google for the charges it had to pay. ""It is iron-fisted monopoly control,"" said Match General Counsel Jared Sine. ""When an industry player has the power to dictate how apps operate, how much they will be forced to pay, and in many cases, if they will even survive, it is a monopoly."" Both Apple and Google rejected the idea that their app stores were monopolies - and said the charges were fair. On 3 May, Apple and Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, will begin a court case in their dispute over the App Store charges.

Google and Apple attacked on app store 'monopoly'Republican and Democrat senators criticise Apple and Google for alleged anti-competitive behaviour.Technology,"Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook Senators have grilled Apple and Google in Washington over ""anti-competitive"" behaviour related to their app stores. Representatives from Tile, Spotify and Match also gave evidence, accusing the two tech firms of charging exorbitant fees and copying their ideas. Both Apple and Google's app stores charge fees of up to 30% for in-app purchases. The two companies said the fees were justified to provide security for users. The Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel focussed on claims that Apple's App Store and Google's Google Play are anti-competitive. Senator Amy Klobuchar said that Apple's App Store was a ""literal monopoly"". She said both stores ""exclude or suppress apps that compete with their own products"" and ""charge excessive fees that affect competition in the app store economy"". Google Play and the App Store are where the vast majority of apps worldwide are downloaded. Developers claim that because of a lack of competition Apple and Google can charge extortionate rates. There were also claims that Apple used its App Store to unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's new AirTag The hearing came a day after Apple launched its new product: AirTags. These can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them. The product looks very similar to something already on the market - Tile. Tile's locator disc Tile's General Counsel Kirsten Daru said ""We welcome competition but it has to be fair competition and Apple's idea of competing is patently unfair."" She also accused Apple of preventing Tile from using the technology behind Apple's Find My function, giving AirTags an unfair advantage. Apple said the product was different. ""We didn't copy Tile's product... It's extremely different to anything else on the market,"" said Apple's Chief Compliance Officer, Kyle Andeer. Spotify also accused Apple of using its App Store to charge unfair rates - something Spotify's Head of Global Affairs, Horacio Gutierrez, described as an ""Apple Tax"". He also said that Apple directly competed with Spotify with Apple Music, and the in-app charges had made Spotify less competitive. ""They are undercutting us on price,"" he said. He also criticised Apple for having rules that meant they were unable to tell customers that the service was cheaper if it was bought away from the App Store. Apple said that Spotify had ""been incredibly aggressive when it comes to dealing with artists and creators, and driving a hard bargain"". Mr Andeer said that ""less than 1% of Spotify users pay a commission to Apple"". Match, which owns Tinder, also criticised Apple and Google for the charges it had to pay. ""It is iron-fisted monopoly control,"" said Match General Counsel Jared Sine. ""When an industry player has the power to dictate how apps operate, how much they will be forced to pay, and in many cases, if they will even survive, it is a monopoly."" Both Apple and Google rejected the idea that their app stores were monopolies - and said the charges were fair. On 3 May, Apple and Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, will begin a court case in their dispute over the App Store charges.

Apology after report finds war graves 'racism',"Boris Johnson said he is ""deeply troubled"" by failures to properly commemorate black and Asian troops who died fighting for the British Empire during World War One. Some troops were commemorated collectively or their names were recorded in registers, while their white counterparts had headstones. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologised in the Commons aftera report,externalblamed ""pervasive racism"". Mr Wallace pledged to ""take action"". The prime minister offered an ""unreserved apology"" over the findings of the review by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. ""Our shared duty is to honour and remember all those, wherever they lived and whatever their background, who laid down their lives for our freedoms at the moment of greatest peril,"" he said. Mr Wallace expressed ""deep regret"" in the House of Commons, as he told MPs there was ""no doubt"" prejudice had played a part in what happened after WWI. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace apologises: ""There can be no doubt prejudice played a part in some of the commission's decisions"" The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which is tasked with commemorating those who died in the two world wars, has also apologised over its findings. Labour MP David Lammy, who was critical to bringing the matter to light, called it a ""watershed moment"". The African soldiers dragged into Europe's war Marking the memories of a million service personnel Mr Wallace said: ""On behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government both of the time and today, I want to apologise for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation. ""Whilst we can't change the past, we can make amends and take action,"" he said. He said there were cases where the commission ""deliberately overlooked evidence"" that would have allowed it to find the names of the dead. And he said there were examples of officials employing an ""overarching imperial ideology connected to racial and religious differences"" in order to ""divide the dead and treat them unequally in ways that were impossible in Europe"". Outlining the next steps, Mr Wallace said the Commonwealth War Graves Commission will: search in the historical record for inequalities in commemoration and act on what is found renew its commitment to equality in commemoration by building physical or digital commemorative structures use its online presence and wider education activities to reach out to all the communities of the former British Empire touched by the two world wars to make sure their hidden history is brought to life and, over the next six months, assemble a global and diverse community of experts to help make this happen Mr Wallace also announced a public consultation over plans to waive the visa fee for service personnel from the Commonwealth and Nepal who choose to settle in the UK in order to honour their contribution. An inquiry by the commission was set up following a 2019 Channel 4 documentary, calledUnremembered,external, which was presented by Mr Lammy. The report found that at least 116,000 casualties from WW1, most of whom were of African, Indian or Egyptian origin, ""were not commemorated by name or possibly not commemorated at all"". But that figure could be as high as 350,000, it said. It also cited racist comments such as the governor of a British colony saying in 1923 that: ""The average native... would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" This video can not be played David Matthews tells the story of his great-uncle who fought in World War One Shadow justice secretary Mr Lammy told the BBC that while making the documentary in Kenya and Tanzania, he discovered mass graves in which Africans had been ""dumped with no commemoration whatsoever"". He said it was a travesty that men who served the British Empire were not commemorated properly, but welcomed the report. ""I'm just really, really pleased that the dignity that these men deserved - who were dragged from their villages and commandeered to work for the British Empire - that dignity that they deserve in death can be granted to them,"" he said. Mr Lammy added that work must be done to find their names in archives where that is possible, and to establish how local communities would like them to be commemorated. He also said Commonwealth soldiers should not be ""whitewashed"" out of history books, while Mr Wallace said it was a ""deep regret"" that his own WW1 education had included ""very little about the contribution from the Commonwealth countries and the wider at the time British Empire"". This video can not be played David Olusoga: ""It's another organisation that's had to be dragged into admitting its history."" Historian Prof David Olusoga, whose TV company produced Unremembered, told BBC Breakfast that apologies were not enough and resources would need to be committed if the commission was serious about restorative justice. ""If the Commonwealth War Graves Commission had set up a committee and discovered that 100,000 white British soldiers lay in mass graves - unmarked, uncommemorated - and the documentation proved that that had been deliberate, what would they do?"" he said. Six million soldiers from the British Empire served in WW1. Between 45,000 and 54,000 Asian and African personnel who died in the conflict were ""commemorated unequally"", the commission said. World War One was the first truly global war, fought not just in the trenches of France but in the Middle East, Asia and Africa Britain's colonies sent millions of men to fight for the empire during the conflict India, which at that time included Pakistan and Bangladesh, sent the most soldiers - more than 1.4 million The British Army in East Africa was mainly composed of African soldiers by November 1918, according to the Imperial War Museum At least 180,000 Africans served in the Carrier Corps in East Africa and provided logistic support to troops at the front Around 15,000 people from the West Indies enlisted in WW1, including 10,000 from Jamaica, according to the National Army Museum Colonies as far away as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) also sent a similar number between them Britain had soldiers from six different continents: Europe, North America, South America, Australasia, Asia and Africa The report concluded that the failure to properly commemorate the individuals was influenced by a scarcity of information, errors inherited from other organisations and the opinions of colonial administrators. ""Underpinning all these decisions, however, were the entrenched prejudices, preconceptions and pervasive racism of contemporary imperial attitudes,"" it added. The report picked out an example from 1923 when the governor of the Gold Coast colony, now Ghana, argued for collective memorials rather than individual ones. At a meeting in London, it was said that the governor, F G Guggisberg, said: ""The average native of the Gold Coast would not understand or appreciate a headstone."" In response, commission employee Arthur Browne said: ""In perhaps two or three hundred years' time, when the native population had reached a higher stage of civilisation, they might then be glad to see that headstones had been erected on the native graves and that the native soldiers had received precisely the same treatment as their white comrades."" The report said Mr Browne's response showed ""what he may have considered foresight, but one that was explicitly framed by contemporary racial prejudice"". The commission, which was founded in 1917 as the Imperial War Graves Commission, said the events of a century ago were wrong then and were wrong now. Its director general, Claire Horton, said: ""We recognise the wrongs of the past and are deeply sorry and will be acting immediately to correct them."" As part of the commission's work to search for unnamed war dead and those who are potentially not commemorated, it will also look at those who died in World War Two, although it is not thought that inequalities seen in WW1 were as widespread then. Ms Horton said the report was ""sober"" reading but gave the commission the ability - ""now that we know the numbers and the areas to look"" - to start the searches properly to ""right the wrongs of the past"". The war graves commission was founded with a remit to remember every individual who had died in World War One, regardless of rank, class, religion or race. The idea of equal treatment was controversial, but it became a cornerstone of remembrance. Outside Europe, however, the commission enacted a policy of extreme discrimination, categorising the fallen as ""white"", ""Indians"" or what it called ""natives"". In southern Kenya, white soldiers lie beneath named memorials in a well-tended cemetery.  Next door in a scruffy field is where their African comrades are buried - no names, just a general memorial. The consequence of the commission's failings is not only to do a great injustice to the black and Asian soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought alongside their white European comrades in two world wars, it is to misrepresent our history.

The Africans dragged into Europe's war,"Askaris (local soldiers) during shooting practice in German East Africa - now Tanzania More than one million people died in East Africa during World War One. Some soldiers were forced to fight members of their own families on the battlefield because of the way borders were drawn up by European colonial powers, writes Oswald Masebo. I was born and raised in a simple home in the rural district of Ileje about 1,000km from Dar es Salaam, in south-west Tanzania. The district is at the border with Malawi where the hilly plateaus of Ileje and Rungwe districts rise above the plains of Lake Nyasa and Kyela district. My family has made a living from the land of Ileje for generations.  During World War One, Ileje and the surrounding environments became a battle ground between German forces and British allied forces from Malawi. Although the war began in 1914, it was the battles fought in 1915 and 1916 which were most intense and which had grave consequences to the generation of my great-grandparents. Ten years ago, I asked my own grandfather Jotam Masebo what he knew about World War One. His recollections remind us of grinding hardship. I quote: ""Our parents narrated to us a lot about this war. The timing of the war was bad. It broke at the time when our parents were about to begin planting maize, beans, cassava, groundnut, and potatoes... The fighting created fear and insecurity that disrupted the agricultural production of our parents and led to the most acute famine that killed many people. The fighting killed innocent men, women, and children."" The fighting at the river Songwe border was particularly notorious because some of the soldiers and carrier corps involved in it were related to enemy soldiers. People living on both sides of the border lived together as a single community until the notorious Berlin Conference created a boundary to separate the German colony of Tanzania and the British colony of Malawi. The boundaries passed through the middle of these people and divided them. They would come to fight during World War One, representing the interests of their respective colonial masters. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 was convened by Otto von Bismarck to discuss the future of Africa The Berlin Act of 1885, signed by the 13 European powers in attendance, included a resolution to ""help in suppressing slavery"" The colonial powers were more interested in protecting old markets and exploiting new ones though, and they began carving up Africa leaving people from the same tribe on different sides of European-imposed borders BBC: Slavery and the Scramble for Africa Why was the first German defeat of WW1 in Africa? Was the Western Front the most multi-racial place on Earth? World War One: The global conflict that defined a century On a recent visit back home and I asked the elders what they know of World War One. An old man known as Ngubhombeleghe Swilla advised me to go to Ngana and  hills to witness look-out posts and machine-gun mounts that still exist today. I set out to see them - a day's journey. The leader of Kasumulu village walked with me to a high vantage point on the outskirts of the village where metal structures, now rust into the hillside.  I was astonished to find these remnants of World War One heritage in my region. It was from here in 1916 that German forces fled to Mozambique. Although Tanzania was a battleground for World War One, very little is known about the role, position and social identities of Tanzanians who directly participated in the war. Existing scholarly narratives focus on German and British military personnel. Yet, oral sources I have collected claim that African men and women played a key role in sustaining the war-related operations in south-west Tanzania.  Kaswashi Pwele of Kapelekesi and Labani Kibona of Isoko  - who I interviewed in 2008 - recounted that Africans were a majority in the German colonial army. They emphasised that the German colonial army was essentially an African army. But they could not tell the exact number of Africans in the army. John Iliffe's archival research suggests that Germany had about 15,000 soldiers in south-west Tanzania in 1916 out of whom about 3,000 were Germans and the remaining 12,000 were Tanzanians whose names are not recorded. The Tanzanian carrier corps also played a central role in sustaining the war. Their story should be recovered. It is estimated that during the peak of military operations in 1916 the German colonial state conscripted some 45,000 African members of carrier corps. And let's not forget the general public of ordinary men and women who grew food such as maize, beans, and cassava. They also raised cattle, goat, sheep, pigs, and chicken. The colonial armies relied on this food to feed soldiers and carrier corps.  Oral recollections tell us Tanzanians did not give out this food willingly. Armies acquired it by force, by looting Tanzanian rural homes and communities. In 1996, Kileke Mwakibinga recalled: ""At the time of the war, of 1914, I was still a young boy. But I was watching the entire goings on when the soldiers were passingâ¦ elders were persecuted and persecuted. Others were captured here and there. I was watching all thisâ¦ They came and looked for thingsâ¦ they would enter a house, if they found milk they would just take it. If they saw chicken, they just took them. That is when the Germans were fleeing."" Oswald Masebo is Professor of History at the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Dar es Salaam - Ubhuche, Invisible Histories of the First World War broadcasts on BBC Radio 3's The Essay: World War One Round the World on Friday 3 July at 22:45. It is part of a global year-long partnership between the British Council, BBC World Service and BBC Radio 3 calledThe War That Changed the World. You can catch up viaiPlayer. Both the German military forces in Tanzania and the invading British forces from Nyasaland and Rhodesia engaged in these barbaric acts of looting food reserves of the generation of my great-grandparents, creating a food shortage which my grandfather spoke about. But perhaps the most surprising element in this elusive story is a silence of the names and identities of African soldiers and carriers in the oral history itself. I find this to be surprising and unique because Tanzanian soldiers and leaders who participated in other military engagements are known and remembered. For example, some of the names and identities of Tanzanians who fought in the Maji Maji wars of resistance in Southern Tanzania from 1905 to 1907 are known and remembered. Maji Maji wars were local protests against German colonial exploitation, oppression, and forced cultivation of cotton. The resistance was sparked by a charismatic spiritual leader Kinjekitile Ngwale who claimed to possess medicine which would protect warriors against German bullets, turning them to ""maji"".  Maji is the Kiswahili word for water. Many people died as bullets never changed into water. Maji Maji remains a heroic story in Tanzania, which is taught to every young Tanzanian in primary and secondary school. Kinjekitile Ngwale is celebrated and romanticised for his readiness to die in order to preserve the independence, autonomy, and respect of Africans.  The Maji Maji museum in Songea was built to celebrate the heroic lives of soldiers and leaders of the war - it contains narratives, sculptures, and even pictures of these heroes. Each year there is a month-long commemoration of the annual Maji Maji war in that district. An Askari monument in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania So why is the story so different for World War One?  Why are the names and identities of thousands of Tanzanians who served as soldiers and carrier corps unknown? Perhaps this is because they were not appreciated by Germany. In some oral accounts Germany even held them responsible for Germany not winning the war. Kaswashi Pwele claimed that ""German military officials blamed Africans for not winning the war. They accused some Africans for lacking loyalty to Germany and for leaking security information to Britain."" But isn't the key reason for the invisibility of the names and identities of Tanzanian soldiers and carrier corps to be found in the attitude of the British colonial state which took over from the Germans? Elders told me the British were very suspicious of Africans who had worked for the Germans. Soldiers and carrier corps who served in the German army were the least trusted. According to the elders, some of these soldiers and carrier corps were deported to Nyasaland.  Some were detained for some years. It was risky to be labelled a pro-German royalist.  It was dangerous. As a coping strategy, many men who had participated in the war on the German side made ""creative adaptations"" by concealing their identities and war experience. ""Creative adaptations"" - it's another way to say ""hiding the truth"", perhaps a polite expression for lying.  I have translated creative adaptations from the wordubhuche, in the Ndali language, my mother tongue and the language used by elders I spoke to. Ubhuche helped people to avoid the dangers of a new colonial regime.  This helped them to live peacefully and to prosper under British colonialism. They also learned to speak negatively about German colonialism, even those who had individually benefited from it. The silences on the names and identities we see today are probably the result of this creative adaptation of African soldiers and carrier corps to the British colonial regime after the war. It might be too late to interview the eye witnesses but listening closely, creatively, and critically to our elders, we can still hear echoes of the voices of African soldiers, carrier corps, and the larger public during World War One. Let me conclude by reflecting on that visit I made to the south west.   I'm going to make Ubhuche - a Creative Adaptation of my own - I'm going to adapt what I've learnt from research to imagine the invisible stories of World War One. Standing in the World War One battlefields at Kasumulu, I could see the River Songwe that the British and German colonisers used to divide our great-grandparents as different people: as either Tanzanians or Malawians. I also saw a glimpse of a soldier from a century past, standing with his rifle. Next to him, a carrier with supplies for the colonial army on his head and back. I imagine them as proud men of values. They accepted the war, probably reluctantly, and went to fight against British Malawian soldiers, perhaps their cousins who lived on the other side of the River Songwe. They have no military uniform. They fought in traditional dress.  I know some killed enemies, and some of them died.  And when I think of them, I don't think only of the conflict they fought in, but also the inner conflict that they combated at the end of the war. It's important for me to remember the public too, the impact on my great-grandmother and her children during the war.  I imagine the ordinary men, women, and children in those hills, plains, and along the river. They were full of fear and insecurity, they suffered from acute food shortage, had their houses burned by combatants, they were exhausted by war traumas. Women and children were probably at the highest risk from this global crisis that unfolded in their villages. But I know that just as my people suffered in this war, many also survived and overcame the challenges.  Their creative adaptations, the Ubhuche, helped them to endure and prosper. They may be invisible in the mainstream history. Let us not forget them.

UK to speed up climate change target,"Radical new climate change commitments will set the UK on course to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035, the UK government has announced. Hitting the targets would require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy. For the first time, climate law will be extended to cover international aviation and shipping. But Labour said the government had to match ""rhetoric with reality"". It urged Boris Johnson to treat ""the climate emergency as the emergency it is"" and show ""greater ambition"". The prime minister's commitments, which are to become law, bring forward the current target for reducing carbon emissions by 15 years. This would be a world-leading position. Homes will need to be much better insulated, and people will be encouraged to drive less and walk and cycle more. Aviation is likely to become more expensive for frequent fliers. China and US pledge climate change commitment Have these seven green targets been met? World's wealthiest 'at heart of climate problem' Tax fliers and get rid of SUVs, government told Covid-19 paused climate emissions â but they're rising again The government has accepted the advice of its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) to adopt the emissions cut, which is based on 1990 levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) haspredicted a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic. The UK's new commitments come as US President Joe Biden prepares to stage a climate summit from Washington DC. Environmentalists welcomed the government's move, but warned that ministers had consistently failed to achieve previous CCC-set targets. And they insisted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak must show clearly how the transition is to be funded. Tom Burke, who chairs the environmental think tank E3G, explained what policy changes were needed to achieve the goal: ""The most important thing, I think, is for [the prime minister] to focus his policy around energy efficiency, around wind and solar, and around storage of electricity and the management of the grid,"" he said. However, he told the BBC's Today programme: ""At the moment, it's... a bit of a Boris blunderbuss and is a huge range of marginal things instead of a concentration of effort on those things that will deliver the most emissions reductions in the fastest time."" Leo Murray of the climate charity Possible called the announcement ""fantastic"", but added: ""We're not on track to meet previous climate commitments and in many ways the government is still failing."" Mr Murray said ministers were ""facing both directions at the same time"", as they had scrapped the Green Homes Grant for insulating homes, had not stopped airport expansion and were ""still pushing a Â£27bn roads budget"". The CCC report accepted by the government says low-carbon investment must scale up to Â£50bn a year in the UK. But it adds that in time fuel savings from more efficient equipment will cancel out investment costs. The CCC believes around 1% of GDP - national wealth - would need to be spent on shifting away from fossil fuels over 30 years. Its chairman, Lord Deben, said previously: ""The implication of this path is clear: the utmost focus is required from government over the next 10 years. ""If policy is not scaled up across every sector, if business is not encouraged to invest, if the people of the UK are not engaged in this challenge - the UK will not deliver net zero by 2050. The 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action."" Ed Matthew, campaigns director of E3G, said: ""Setting an ambitious emission reduction target would boost the UK's diplomatic drive to persuade other countries to set out ambitious targets of their own."" He added: ""The UK now has the opportunity to spark a global green industrial revolution, but ultimately its credibility will rest on action."" Net zero means cutting emissions as far as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, tree planting. The government has adopted the new 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut because scientists say this is needed to keep the rise in global temperatures close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""The character of this government on climate change is now clear: targets without delivery. ""So while any strengthening of our targets is the right thing to do, the government can't be trusted to match rhetoric with reality."" He added: ""We need a government that treats the climate emergency as the emergency it is. That means greater ambition than this government matched with much more decisive action."" Green Party MP Caroline Lucas commented: ""The most glaring problem [with the plan] is the government's failure to address what's driving the climate crisis: an outdated and exploitative economic system that treats our planet and natural world as peripheral to our lives and, worse, expendable. ""The Prime Minister needs to accompany stronger climate targets with an economic reset to put the health and well-being of people and planet above short-term profit and growth.""

"North and Midlands 'leading jobs recovery'Several areas now have more job vacancies than before the pandemic, a study finds.Business","Britain's jobs growth is being led by cities and towns in the North and Midlands, according to a report. Hiring has gathered pace since lockdown started to ease, but the growth is unevenly spread, joint research by the Centre of Cities think-tank and jobs site Indeed found. Barnsley and Mansfield have seen the biggest rises in job vacancies, while Aberdeen and Belfast had the lowest. The study analysed vacancies in 63 cities and large towns. It found that in some parts of the country job postings now exceed their pre-pandemic level. Nine cities or towns now have more job vacancies than before the pandemic, led by Barnsley (+21%), Mansfield (20%) and Stoke (17%). Other places where postings have recovered least are led by Aberdeen (-53%), Belfast (-39%) and Crawley (-39%). Towns and cities in south east England figured heavily among places at the bottom of the recovery list. London is among the areas showing the slowest recovery, with job postings in the capital still 26% below their pre-pandemic level. Under-35s bearing brunt of jobs crisis 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' UK outlook 'uncertain' despite vaccine, says Bank Elena Magrini, senior analyst at the Centre for Cities, said: ""Places reliant on tourism, aviation and office workers have been particularly hard hit and still have high shares of people who are unemployed or on furlough."" Crawley, for example, is home to Gatwick Airport, which has been hard hit by job cuts due to the coronavirus collapse in air travel. Ms Magrini added that despite the patchy recovery, there are reasons for optimism. ""Once we have reopened the economy, policy makers need to focus on building back better - growing the economy by creating better paid, higher skilled jobs for people right across the country,"" she said. The improving picture in the North and Midlands was partly driven by the mix of available jobs. Recoveries have been strongest in areas with a greater pre-pandemic share of postings in occupations related to the production and distribution of goods, such as manufacturing, driving and stocking, as well as essential services like healthcare, social care and education. On the other hand, places with a higher share of pre-pandemic job opportunities in food and beverage services and hospitality and tourism are lagging behind. Pawel Adrjan, head of EMEA research at Indeed, said: ""Cities and towns in the North and Midlands have been buoyed by rising manufacturing, distribution, healthcare and education jobs. But at the same time areas reliant on hospitality, tourism and higher paying jobs that can be performed from home have seen only sluggish growth. ""We've seen how quickly the jobs market reacts to policy and public health announcements and policy makers will hope the eventual unwinding of Covid-19 restrictions will help level up the jobs recovery.""
