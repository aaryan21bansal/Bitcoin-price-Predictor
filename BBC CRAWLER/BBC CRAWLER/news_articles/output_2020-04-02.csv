Coronavirus conman barges in on 83-year-old woman,"Doorstep criminals are adapting old scams (picture posed by model) A coronavirus conman barged into the home of an 83-year-old woman claiming he was ""from health and safety"" and needed to check her property. The potential thief demanded Â£220 from the lady, who has dementia and was following guidance to stay at home amid the outbreak. He left empty-handed after she told him she only had 20p in cash with her. Trading standards officers say this is an example of how con artists are exploiting the current crisis. Years-old doorstep crimes and frauds are being revised to steal from people left alone and vulnerable by the coronavirus restrictions. Cases of kindness within communities still far outnumber doorstep crimes, but those on the front line say there is an increasing risk of exploitation. In the case of the 83-year-old woman, the cold caller repeatedly banged on the door and said she would be arrested if she did not let him in. AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Trading standards officers said cases of doorstep crime and other scams were rising, and urged family and neighbours to look out for the vulnerable, albeit from an appropriate distance. With only about 5% of scams reported to the authorities, they are also encouraging people to come forward if they have been targeted so cases can be investigated. Other doorstep crimes reported in recent weeks include: Fake and dangerous hand sanitisers, face masks and swabbing kits sold online and door-to-door Collections supposedly for charities helping the vulnerable, but are actually straightforward theft Gangs arriving unannounced to ""disinfect"" driveways, then charging well over the odds National Trading Standards (NTS), the frontline UK consumer protection body, said thieves were also offering to shop for housebound residents, but stealing the cash they were given. Louise Baxter, head of the NTS scams team, said: ""As people stay indoors to prevent the spread of Covid-19, criminals are preying on people in vulnerable situations who are isolated and living alone. ""There has never been a more important time for neighbours to look out for each other."" Doorstep scams 'linked to modern slavery' Warning of spike in scams linked to crisis The organisation has previously warned that members of the gangs involved in such criminality could be victims of modern slavery themselves. Some have their passports, ID and money taken by gangmasters who then put them to work, paying them poorly or not at all. Contact theCitizens Advice consumer helpline,externalto seek advice and report cases Action Fraud is thereporting service,externalfor fraud and cyber crime Online training to guard against scams is available fromFriends Against Scams,external Trading standards officers, who would normally visit victims, alongside other support charities and possibly police officers are themselves stretched and subject to social distancing guidelines. Katherine Hart, lead officer for doorstep crime at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said that while officers might not be able to visit in person, they could still investigate and urged people to report crimes. Without a complaint, no investigation can be started. Officers were able to issue advice remotely, and community forums were playing a vital role in issuing warnings, she said. Scam texts like this one have become more common Alongside doorstep crime, there have been widespread warnings about online, text and telephone scams which use coronavirus as a trigger to attempt to steal personal information and drain bank accounts. These range from unsolicited emails and texts claiming to be from utility providers, asking for banking and other details, to offers of refunds for cancelled holidays on fake websites. One suggests people have been fined for leaving their home during the outbreak, playing on people's fears. Many text messages impersonate the authorities and use links to fake sites, or to install malware on computers. Katy Worobec, managing director for economic crime at banking trade body, UK Finance, told BBC 5 Live Breakfast that ""it would have helped"" if the government had not put a link in its coronavirus advice text message to everybody in the UK. ""It has opened the floodgates a little for fraudsters to copy that idea,"" she said.

CCTV released in hunt for 'girlfriend trek' teen,"Owen Harding seen on CCTV images in Saltdean on the day of his disappearance CCTV images of a missing teenager who disappeared from his home a week ago have been released. Owen Harding, 16, left his family home in Saltdean, East Sussex, on Thursday 26 March. His mother has said he was upset and it is thought he may have set off on a 280-mile walk to see his girlfriend in Pocklington, East Yorkshire. Pictures published by Sussex Police show Owen walking away from his home on the day he disappeared. The force said he walked south along Bannings Vale at about 18:50 GMT, and may have turned into Hamsey Road. Owen's mum, Stella Harding, said: âHe was upset. We were talking about travel restrictions because of the Covid-19 situation and I think he needed to go and stomp it off. âWe often go for walks in this area and when he didnât come back I started to worry and I spoke to my friends and we went to look for him.â Two witnesses have reported a boy matching his description alongside the A259 near the clifftop at about 18:15 BST. Police have appealed to any drivers who may have recorded Owen on dashcam after this time. Police have searched nearby cliffs and urged drivers to check dashcam footage taken in that area Owen is described as white, 6ft tall, of athletic build, and with short brown hair. He was wearing a black or dark hooded top, grey tracksuit trousers and white trainers. Sussex Police said he has not been in touch with any friends or family since leaving home.

Twin's warning after sister's coronavirus death,"Caroline Saunby's husband Victor is now looking after their twin boys alone A woman who died from coronavirus had been putting up with what she thought was tonsillitis, her sister has said. Caroline Saunby, 48, from New Marske on Teesside, became unwell on Friday. She improved slightly but then collapsed on Sunday. Her six-year-old twin boys and husband are now waiting to see if they have caught the virus. Her identical twin, Sarah Jarvis, said her sister thought her sore throat was ""nothing major at all"". ""Why would she go to work if she thought she was going to die?"" she said. After two days ignoring her suspected tonsillitis, Mrs Saunby developed a ""raging fever"", sickness and diarrhoea but her husband, Victor, was advised that, unless she had extreme breathing difficulties, she should stay at home. He called an ambulance when she collapsed, which arrived within minutes, followed by another, then a paramedic car and the air ambulance. Mrs Saunby was given CPR and taken to hospital but died later the same day. Ms Jarvis said the extended family - who all live within five minutes of each other - were distraught because they could not go near Mrs Saunby at the time and cannot go near each other now. ""We can't console the boys. Vic's had to deep clean his own house to try and make it as safe as possible because no-one's allowed in,"" she said. Mr Saunby and his children are now in quarantine for 14 days. ""They've all been exposed so we're just waiting to see - and we can't get tested to see whether they're going to get ill,"" Ms Jarvis said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE BODY?Doctors on the front line explain HOW FAST IS THE VIRUS GROWING?The UK spread compared to other countries Ms Jarvis said she was worried about what will happen if her sister's husband becomes unwell too. ""Those boys have lost their mother. If he got sick how can you leave those boys in the house with him?"" she said. ""If he shows symptoms he would have to go to hospital and I would have to go and live in the house and take the risk."" Ms Jarvis said she wanted to warn people ""how serious this is"". ""If people do start to take it more seriously and more lives are saved, well hopefully it won't be in vain, this terrible thing that's happened to us,"" she said.

How the day unfolded,"New York City authorities advise residents to wear facemasks when they leave home President Trump issues new guidelines for care homes for the elderly in his daily news conference More than a million confirmed cases of coronavirus have been registered globally The worldwide death toll has passed 50,000; more than 200,000 have recovered UK Health Secretary sets a goal of 100,000 tests in England per day by end of month People across the UK clap and cheer for key workers The World Bank launches a $1.9bn emergency fund to help 25 countries, starting with India In the US, new weekly unemployment claims hit a record high of 6.6m Ashitha Nagesh, Vanessa Buschschluter, Joshua Cheetham, Kate Whannel, Paul Seddon, Matt Cannon, Vanessa Barford, Gary Rose, Jim Todd, Andreas Illmer, Saira Asher, Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi and Yvette Tan We're pausing our live coverage for now, but we'll be back in the morning. A lot has happened today. To re-cap, here are some of the main headlines. Social distancing measures at a pharmacy in New Delhi Vice-president Mike Pence says a face mask advisory will be rolled out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the next few days. So far, Los Angeles and New York City have both ordered residents to wear masks whenever they go out in public. But the federal government has so far not made that recommendations for the entire nation. ""Just remember its not a substitute,"" for other social distance measures, Dr Deborah Birx quickly chimes in, adding that hand-washing and social distancing are also extremely important safety measures. US coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx says the government is still debating whether to update federal guidelines to require all Americans to wear masks in public. But she warns against getting a ""false sense of protection by wearing a mask"", adding that there are a number of ways people can get infected. This false sense of security, she says ""worries us and it's why we're still debating the mask"". Dr Birx says that washing hands and staying more than 2m (6ft) apart is at this point more important that wearing a mask. A mask, she says, is ""not a substitute"" for social-distancing and other mitigation mandates that are already in place. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter On the day that the US reported 6.6 million new unemployment filings last week â doubling the record set the previous week and dwarfing any earlier mark â the White House chose to lead its daily briefing on the economic aid being directed to stanch the economic bleeding. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who helped craft the $2.2tn (Â£1.8tn) economic aid package Congress passed last week, said government efforts focused on three areas:  ""We want American businesses to be kept intact,"" Mnuchin said. ""We want you to have a business you can reopen when itâs appropriate."" Mnuchinâs assurances come after the New York Times reported numerous financial institutions were confused about the small-business loan process and unsure whether they would be able to handle what is expected to be a huge demand for the funds. The latest economic indicators suggest many US businesses are teetering on the brink, shedding payroll simply to stay financially afloat. Congress rushed to pass an aid package to address the crisis. The question now is whether the administration can get the help out the door in time. White House economic aide Peter Navarro says a ""black market"" on personal protective equipment (PPE) has sprung up, which has been driving up prices on needed medical equipment. He claims that ""domestic sources here are being exported"" overseas. Earlier today, US officials announced that the FBI had seized half a million pieces of medical protective gear from brokers hoarding them, and had re-distributed the gear to healthcare workers in New York and New Jersey. Mr Navarro pledges that US law enforcement will ""crack down unmercifully"" on ""hoarders and brokers trying to make money off the misery"". He calls on anyone with PPE inventory to contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and not buyers outside of the US. Each day, news of more deaths is a huge source of alarm to people across the country. But what are the death figures really telling us? And how bad is it going to get? Read the full story here Before briefly leaving the podium moments ago, President Trump talked about taking another coronavirus test. The result from Mr Trump's doctor has just been passed around the White House briefing room. It is at least the second test that the White House says the president has taken. In a hospital in Queens, New York City - the worst-affected area in the US city with the most cases - doctors are being forced to make decisions they would never normally be faced with. The BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel spoke to one young doctor at Elmhurst hospital - unofficially the first Covid-19 hospital in the country. She described a desperate shortage of ventilators, a relentless stream of severely ill and critical patients, and staff being forced to perform procedures they hadn't been trained for. And while the situation is dire now, the peak of the outbreak in the US is still weeks away. Read the full storyhereabout how US doctors are fighting on the frontline of the coronavirus. Mr Trump is introducing new guidelines to ""protect elderly Americans"". He says nursing homes should immediately ban ""all medically unnecessary personnel"", noting that many such facilities have already done this. He also calls on elderly care homes to ""assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents"" to limit the spread of infection. Mr Trump also says care homes should create separate areas for sick and non-sick patients, adding that these measures may be extended into the future and even after the virus is fought back. Mr Trump excuses himself from the briefing room, but not before saying that he took a quick coronavirus test earlier today. ""I took it, it took me literally a minute to take it,"" he says, adding that it took 14 minutes to come back negative.  New York City has asked anyone leaving their home to wear a face mask. A new bulletin from city health officials advises that infected people can spread the Covid-19 for days before they even begin to show symptoms. ""A face covering can help prevent you from spreading Covid-19 to other people, so you should wear one whenever you leave the home,"" the guidance says, adding that any cloth or scarf will do. But the letter asks the public not to use surgical and healthcare worker masks, as those are required by actual first responders such as nurses, doctors and paramedics. The emergency loans scheme for UK businesses struggling to survive amid the coronavirus pandemicis being revamped following strong criticism. The Treasury says it had received more than 130,000 loan enquires from firms but fewer than 1,000 had been approved. Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, says the changes to the scheme would make it easier for firms to access loans. Labour welcomed the measures but accused the government of being ""behind the curve"" when implementing support measures. ""If we have your information, youâll get in two weeks,"" says Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, denying reports that it may take months for Americans to receive the money Congress dolled out in their massive $2.2tr stimulus package. If the government does not have your information, he says, people will need to go to a website to register their details. Elderly citizens, who already receive social security payments from the government, will not have to re-register, he says. Asked when those without a bank account will receive their cheques, the treasury secretary  says it will take longer than for other people. But, he adds, the money must come quickly - and ""quickly is a matter of weeks, not months"". The captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, Brett Crozier, has been removed from his post after he complained that the US navy was not doing enough to prevent coronavirus from spreading rampantly through the aircraft carrier. Capt Crozier had written a letter to his bosses saying that urgent action needed to be taken to prevent American troops from dying outside of wartime. ""He exercised extremely poor judgement"" said Acting US Navy Secretary Thomas Modly. He also told reporters that Capt Crozier was being fired for allegedly leaking the letter to the media. He said the  letter ""created the impression the Navy was not responding to his questions"". ""It creates the perception the Navy is not on the job; the government is not on the job. That's just not true."" Uninfected members of the ship's 4,000 crew are being quarantined in Guam after the governor of the US island territory said they could stay as long as they had no interactions with locals. President Donald Trump is leading the coronavirus taskforce briefing in Washington, which has just begun. He's joined by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who Mr Trump says will give more details on how Americans can receive the $1,200 cheques as part of the coronavirus congressional bailout. According to reports, federal officials are expected to advise that Americans throughout the country begin wearing face masks whenever they go out in public until the crisis is over. The coronavirus-hit Coral Princess cruise ship is going to dock in Fort Lauderdale in Florida, its owner has said. The ship has been stuck at sea since 19 March after being banned from docking in Buenos Aires. There are 1,898 people on the ship, 12 of whom have tested positive for Covid-19. Three of the Princess Cruises' other ships have had outbreaks on board too, including the Diamond Princess in Japan. On 12 March the company cancelled all new cruises for 60 days. Two other virus-hit cruises arrived in Fort Lauderdale earlier today - the Zaandam, which has people with confirmed and suspected coronavirus on board, and its sister ship the Rotterdam, which is carrying asymptomatic passengers who were originally on the Zaandam. Andrew Rae, whose parents Morven and Ian are still on board the Zaandam, told the BBC: ""We're not entirely out of the woods yet. When they tell me they've got a flight booked and they're on their way home I'll be a lot happier."" Morven and Ian Rae are on the Zaandam, which docked in Fort Lauderdale earlier today The World Bank says it has launched a $1.9bn (Â£1.5bn) emergency fund to help 25 countries with their response to the coronavirus pandemic. It said it was moving quickly on projects in 40 other nations. India will receive the largest amount of funding - $1bn - to improve screening, tracing and laboratory diagnostics. The money will also go towards procuring personal protective equipment and to setting up isolation wards. The bank said funding would go to countries on nearly every continent.,externalOther beneficiaries include Pakistan, which will receive $200m, and Afghanistan which will get over $100m. In addition, the World Bank said it was working to redeploy $1.7bn of existing funds and was prepared to spend up to $160bn over the next 15 months to help fight the pandemic. The White House coronavirus taskforce briefing is due to start in the coming hour. President Donald Trump has been regularly appearing alongside health officials. Critics have accused Mr Trump of using the briefings to boost his poll numbers at a time when campaign rallies, like all mass gatherings, are banned. Here's what else is happening around the country The Professional Footballers' Association has said it ""fully accepts that players will have to be flexible and share the financial burden"" of the coronavirus pandemic. The trade union for professional association footballers in England and Wales says its members must act ""in order to secure the long-term future of their own club and indeed the wider game"". The statement came after UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the ""first thing"" Premier League footballers could do to help is ""take a pay cut"". Speaking at the government's daily briefing, Mr Hancock added: ""Everybody needs to play their part in this national effort and that means Premier League footballers."" On Wednesday, Premier League clubs were accused by Julian Knight, the chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, ofliving in a ""moral vacuum""after some clubs furloughed non-playing staff while preserving the wages of highly-paid players. BBC Question Time There's a question about whether the UK was too late in ordering personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS workers. Donna Kinnair, chief executive at the Royal College of
Nursing, says they have been urging the government ""for weeks"" to make this a priority. She says she has been assured ""we do have enough"" but adds she is concerned about how new supplies will be replenished. She adds that she is still hearing reports of shortages on the front line.

Should more of us wear masks?,"Should more of us wear face masks to help slow the spread of coronavirus? This question is to be assessed by a panel of advisers to theWorld Health Organization (WHO).,external The group will weigh up research on whether the virus can be projected further than previously thought; a study in the US suggests coughs can reach 6m and sneezes up to 8m. The panel's chair, Prof David Heymann, told BBC News that the new research may lead to a shift in advice about masks. The former director at the WHO explained: ""The WHO is opening up its discussion again looking at the new evidence to see whether or not there should be a change in the way it's recommending masks should be used."" The WHO recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m from anyone coughing or sneezing to avoid the risk of infection. It says people who are sick and show symptoms should wear masks. Who should be wearing masks? US considers cloth face masks for public But it advises that healthy people only need to wear them if they are caring for others suspected of being infected or if they themselves are coughing or sneezing. The new research suggests coughs and sneezes might project liquid further than previously thought It emphasises that masks are only effective if combined with frequent hand-washing and used and disposed of properly. The UK, along with other countries including the US, advises that social distancing should mean staying at least 2m apart. This advice is based on evidence showing that viruses can only be transmitted while carried within drops of liquid. The understanding is that most of those drops will either evaporate or fall to the ground near to the person who released them. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, used high-speed cameras and other sensors toassess precisely what happens after a cough or sneeze.,external They found that an exhalation generates a small fast-moving cloud of gas that can contain droplets of liquid of varying sizes - and that the smallest of these can be carried in the cloud over long distances. The study - conducted in laboratory conditions - found that coughs can project liquid up to 6m away and that sneezes, which involve much higher speeds, can reach up to 8m away. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The scientist who led the study, Prof Lydia Bourouiba of MIT, told me that she is concerned about the current concept of ""safe distances"". ""What we exhale, cough or sneeze is a gas cloud that has high momentum that can go far, traps the drops of all sizes in it and carries them through the room,"" she said. ""So having this false idea of safety at one to two metres, that somehow drops will just fall to the ground at that distance is not based on what we have quantified, measured and visualised directly."" Prof Bourouiba's view is that in certain situations, especially indoors in poorly ventilated rooms, wearing masks would reduce the risks. For example, when facing someone who's infected, masks could help divert the flow of their breath and its load of virus away from your mouth. ""Flimsy masks are not going to protect from inhaling the smallest particulates in the air because they do not provide filtration,"" Prof Bourouiba said. ""But they would potentially divert the cloud that is being emitted with high momentum to the side instead of forward."" Prof Heymann said that masks needed to be worn consistently According to Prof Heymann, the new research from MIT and other institutions will be evaluated because it suggests that droplets from coughs and sneezes could be projected further than originally thought. He said that if the evidence is supported, then ""it might be that wearing a mask is equally as effective or more effective than distancing."" But he adds a warning that masks need to be worn properly, with a seal over the nose. If they become moist, Prof Heymann explained, then particles can pass through. People must remove them carefully to avoid their hands becoming contaminated. He adds that masks need to be worn consistently. ""It's not on to wear a mask and then decide to take it off to smoke a cigarette or eat a meal - it must be worn full time,"" he said. The panel, known as the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards, is due to hold its next virtual meeting in the next few days. A spokesperson for Public Health England said there was little evidence of widespread benefit from wearing masks outside clinical settings. ""Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good universal hygiene behaviour in order for them to be effective. ""Research also shows that compliance with these recommended behaviours reduces over time when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods."" Masks have long been in use across Asia Long popular in many countries in Asia, masks are now being assessed for public use by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In Austria, the police now wear them and anyone dealing with the police will have to wear one too. Supermarkets there will insist that customers do too. A once-rare sight in Europe is becoming more common, and new advice from the WHO would accelerate that change.

A lot has happened today. To re-cap, here are some of the main headlines. Social distancing measures at a pharmacy in New Delhi Vice-president Mike Pence says a face mask advisory will be rolled out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the next few days. So far, Los Angeles and New York City have both ordered residents to wear masks whenever they go out in public. But the federal government has so far not made that recommendations for the entire nation. ""Just remember its not a substitute,"" for other social distance measures, Dr Deborah Birx quickly chimes in, adding that hand-washing and social distancing are also extremely important safety measures. US coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx says the government is still debating whether to update federal guidelines to require all Americans to wear masks in public. But she warns against getting a ""false sense of protection by wearing a mask"", adding that there are a number of ways people can get infected. This false sense of security, she says ""worries us and it's why we're still debating the mask"". Dr Birx says that washing hands and staying more than 2m (6ft) apart is at this point more important that wearing a mask. A mask, she says, is ""not a substitute"" for social-distancing and other mitigation mandates that are already in place. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter On the day that the US reported 6.6 million new unemployment filings last week â doubling the record set the previous week and dwarfing any earlier mark â the White House chose to lead its daily briefing on the economic aid being directed to stanch the economic bleeding. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who helped craft the $2.2tn (Â£1.8tn) economic aid package Congress passed last week, said government efforts focused on three areas:  ""We want American businesses to be kept intact,"" Mnuchin said. ""We want you to have a business you can reopen when itâs appropriate."" Mnuchinâs assurances come after the New York Times reported numerous financial institutions were confused about the small-business loan process and unsure whether they would be able to handle what is expected to be a huge demand for the funds. The latest economic indicators suggest many US businesses are teetering on the brink, shedding payroll simply to stay financially afloat. Congress rushed to pass an aid package to address the crisis. The question now is whether the administration can get the help out the door in time. White House economic aide Peter Navarro says a ""black market"" on personal protective equipment (PPE) has sprung up, which has been driving up prices on needed medical equipment. He claims that ""domestic sources here are being exported"" overseas. Earlier today, US officials announced that the FBI had seized half a million pieces of medical protective gear from brokers hoarding them, and had re-distributed the gear to healthcare workers in New York and New Jersey. Mr Navarro pledges that US law enforcement will ""crack down unmercifully"" on ""hoarders and brokers trying to make money off the misery"". He calls on anyone with PPE inventory to contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and not buyers outside of the US. Each day, news of more deaths is a huge source of alarm to people across the country. But what are the death figures really telling us? And how bad is it going to get? Read the full story here Before briefly leaving the podium moments ago, President Trump talked about taking another coronavirus test. The result from Mr Trump's doctor has just been passed around the White House briefing room. It is at least the second test that the White House says the president has taken. In a hospital in Queens, New York City - the worst-affected area in the US city with the most cases - doctors are being forced to make decisions they would never normally be faced with. The BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel spoke to one young doctor at Elmhurst hospital - unofficially the first Covid-19 hospital in the country. She described a desperate shortage of ventilators, a relentless stream of severely ill and critical patients, and staff being forced to perform procedures they hadn't been trained for. And while the situation is dire now, the peak of the outbreak in the US is still weeks away. Read the full storyhereabout how US doctors are fighting on the frontline of the coronavirus. Mr Trump is introducing new guidelines to ""protect elderly Americans"". He says nursing homes should immediately ban ""all medically unnecessary personnel"", noting that many such facilities have already done this. He also calls on elderly care homes to ""assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents"" to limit the spread of infection. Mr Trump also says care homes should create separate areas for sick and non-sick patients, adding that these measures may be extended into the future and even after the virus is fought back. Mr Trump excuses himself from the briefing room, but not before saying that he took a quick coronavirus test earlier today. ""I took it, it took me literally a minute to take it,"" he says, adding that it took 14 minutes to come back negative.  New York City has asked anyone leaving their home to wear a face mask. A new bulletin from city health officials advises that infected people can spread the Covid-19 for days before they even begin to show symptoms. ""A face covering can help prevent you from spreading Covid-19 to other people, so you should wear one whenever you leave the home,"" the guidance says, adding that any cloth or scarf will do. But the letter asks the public not to use surgical and healthcare worker masks, as those are required by actual first responders such as nurses, doctors and paramedics. The emergency loans scheme for UK businesses struggling to survive amid the coronavirus pandemicis being revamped following strong criticism. The Treasury says it had received more than 130,000 loan enquires from firms but fewer than 1,000 had been approved. Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, says the changes to the scheme would make it easier for firms to access loans. Labour welcomed the measures but accused the government of being ""behind the curve"" when implementing support measures. ""If we have your information, youâll get in two weeks,"" says Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, denying reports that it may take months for Americans to receive the money Congress dolled out in their massive $2.2tr stimulus package. If the government does not have your information, he says, people will need to go to a website to register their details. Elderly citizens, who already receive social security payments from the government, will not have to re-register, he says. Asked when those without a bank account will receive their cheques, the treasury secretary  says it will take longer than for other people. But, he adds, the money must come quickly - and ""quickly is a matter of weeks, not months"". The captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, Brett Crozier, has been removed from his post after he complained that the US navy was not doing enough to prevent coronavirus from spreading rampantly through the aircraft carrier. Capt Crozier had written a letter to his bosses saying that urgent action needed to be taken to prevent American troops from dying outside of wartime. ""He exercised extremely poor judgement"" said Acting US Navy Secretary Thomas Modly. He also told reporters that Capt Crozier was being fired for allegedly leaking the letter to the media. He said the  letter ""created the impression the Navy was not responding to his questions"". ""It creates the perception the Navy is not on the job; the government is not on the job. That's just not true."" Uninfected members of the ship's 4,000 crew are being quarantined in Guam after the governor of the US island territory said they could stay as long as they had no interactions with locals. President Donald Trump is leading the coronavirus taskforce briefing in Washington, which has just begun. He's joined by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who Mr Trump says will give more details on how Americans can receive the $1,200 cheques as part of the coronavirus congressional bailout. According to reports, federal officials are expected to advise that Americans throughout the country begin wearing face masks whenever they go out in public until the crisis is over. The coronavirus-hit Coral Princess cruise ship is going to dock in Fort Lauderdale in Florida, its owner has said. The ship has been stuck at sea since 19 March after being banned from docking in Buenos Aires. There are 1,898 people on the ship, 12 of whom have tested positive for Covid-19. Three of the Princess Cruises' other ships have had outbreaks on board too, including the Diamond Princess in Japan. On 12 March the company cancelled all new cruises for 60 days. Two other virus-hit cruises arrived in Fort Lauderdale earlier today - the Zaandam, which has people with confirmed and suspected coronavirus on board, and its sister ship the Rotterdam, which is carrying asymptomatic passengers who were originally on the Zaandam. Andrew Rae, whose parents Morven and Ian are still on board the Zaandam, told the BBC: ""We're not entirely out of the woods yet. When they tell me they've got a flight booked and they're on their way home I'll be a lot happier."" Morven and Ian Rae are on the Zaandam, which docked in Fort Lauderdale earlier today The World Bank says it has launched a $1.9bn (Â£1.5bn) emergency fund to help 25 countries with their response to the coronavirus pandemic. It said it was moving quickly on projects in 40 other nations. India will receive the largest amount of funding - $1bn - to improve screening, tracing and laboratory diagnostics. The money will also go towards procuring personal protective equipment and to setting up isolation wards. The bank said funding would go to countries on nearly every continent.,externalOther beneficiaries include Pakistan, which will receive $200m, and Afghanistan which will get over $100m. In addition, the World Bank said it was working to redeploy $1.7bn of existing funds and was prepared to spend up to $160bn over the next 15 months to help fight the pandemic. The White House coronavirus taskforce briefing is due to start in the coming hour. President Donald Trump has been regularly appearing alongside health officials. Critics have accused Mr Trump of using the briefings to boost his poll numbers at a time when campaign rallies, like all mass gatherings, are banned. Here's what else is happening around the country The Professional Footballers' Association has said it ""fully accepts that players will have to be flexible and share the financial burden"" of the coronavirus pandemic. The trade union for professional association footballers in England and Wales says its members must act ""in order to secure the long-term future of their own club and indeed the wider game"". The statement came after UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the ""first thing"" Premier League footballers could do to help is ""take a pay cut"". Speaking at the government's daily briefing, Mr Hancock added: ""Everybody needs to play their part in this national effort and that means Premier League footballers."" On Wednesday, Premier League clubs were accused by Julian Knight, the chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, ofliving in a ""moral vacuum""after some clubs furloughed non-playing staff while preserving the wages of highly-paid players. BBC Question Time There's a question about whether the UK was too late in ordering personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS workers. Donna Kinnair, chief executive at the Royal College of
Nursing, says they have been urging the government ""for weeks"" to make this a priority. She says she has been assured ""we do have enough"" but adds she is concerned about how new supplies will be replenished. She adds that she is still hearing reports of shortages on the front line.

"Emergency loans for firms revamped after criticismFirms have made more than 130,000 loan enquires, but fewer than 1,000 had been approved.Business","A revamped loan fund for ailing firms hit by the coronavirus lockdown will have an immediate impact, RBS has said. RBS chairman Sir Howard Davies admitted there had been problems but expects to see a ""sharp increase"" in lending to small firms in the next few days. On Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak overhauled the scheme amid claims banks were taking advantage of the crisis. The government has pledged to guarantee Â£330bn of loans but only Â£145m has been lent so far. Small firms say they have struggled with onerous eligibility criteria for the government-backed loans, which are being issued by High Street banks and other lenders. They have also complained of facing interest rates of up to 30% and being asked to make unreasonable personal guarantees. It comes as the UK is facing recession as large parts of the economy are shut down. On Friday, the influential Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey showed Britain's dominant services industry suffered its biggest slump in March since 1996, sinking from a reading of 53.2 to 34.5. Any figure below 50 marks contraction. Mr Sunak said that under changes to the Coronavirus Business Interuption Loan Scheme (CBILS): Applications will not be limited to businesses that have been refused a loan on commercial terms, extending the number who benefit. However, the Treasury has not capped the interest rates banks can charge. Banks will be banned from asking company owners to guarantee loans with their own savings or property when borrowing up to Â£250,000 Larger firms with a turnover of up to Â£500m will also be eligible for more help - with state-backed loans of up to Â£25m available to firms with revenues of between Â£45m-500m. Sir Howard, who used to chair the Financial Services Authority (now known as the Financial Conduct Authority), told the BBC's Today programme that the process of checking borrowers' eligibility had been ""difficult"". He also said RBS had struggled with the demand after inquiries about the loans jumped ""by 45 times"" in a week. ""I think we have to accept that the scale of this process and the speed with which it's been put in place has caused challenges for everybody,"" he said. ""But we've had good discussions with the Treasury and small firms, and I think the changes announced overnight will make a quite a big difference."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health On Wednesday,Business Secretary Alok Sharma said it would ""completely unacceptable""if any banks were unfairly refusing funds to good businesses in financial difficulty. He also referenced the financial crisis - when taxpayers bailed out a number of the UK's largest banks - suggesting lenders should now repay the favour. Chancellor Rishi Sunak overhauled the loan scheme for virus-hit firms However, Sir Howard told the BBC that comparing the current crisis to 2008 was ""rewriting history"". ""In the last crisis the problem was that the banks didn't have the money to lend, there was a credit crunch. ""We're not in that position at all. The banks have got the money to lend, we have a large amount of capital, we are not constrained in the volumes we can lend."" On Thursday, Mr Sunak said the government was making ""great progress"" on supporting businesses to help manage their cashflows but needed to take ""further action"" by extending the scheme. But some firms still feel they will struggle to access the loans fast enough or that they are too risky. There has been widespread concern, acknowledged by the government, that some of the emergency measures to provide financial assistance to businesses are not working. Too few firms felt able or willing to take on loans that carried an 80% government guarantee to the lender but not the borrower. The Treasury has announced new rules, meaning business owners asking to borrow less than Â£250,000 will no longer have to offer up personal guarantees. Perhaps most importantly, the requirement for companies to have first tried to get a normal commercial loan elsewhere will be dropped. However, they are still loans. Companies wishing to take them out will be 100% liable for the debt and the government has not capped the interest rate banks can charge even though banks are able to borrow at close to 0%. The loans may now be available to more businesses but what's not clear is whether firms want them. Labour welcomed the measures but accused the government of being ""behind the curve"" when implementing support measures. ""There remain huge gaps in support for employees and self-employed that must be addressed immediately if people are to avoid facing serious hardship in this crisis,"" said shadow chancellor John McDonnell. The head of the Confederation of British Industry, Carolyn Fairbairn, described the changes as a ""big step forward"" although she said more detail was needed. ""Each week brings unprecedented levels of economic support and it's encouraging to see the government stepping in where urgent help is needed."" Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's a very necessary and timely intervention by the chancellor, because clearly, businesses were being promised interest-free, fee-free, government support by the banks. ""Time and time again, the FSB has heard from our members and other small businesses who've approached banks seeking these emergency loans that they were being offered anything but."" Stephen Jones, the chief executive of UK Finance which represents the banks, also welcomed the changes. Speaking to the Today programme, he said: ""It was clear that those viable businesses, who were required to be offered under the terms of the scheme commercial lending under commercial terms, felt aggrieved that they were not given access to the scheme and therefore the change gives the scheme to all businesses who are capable of repaying debt after this crisis is over. ""This change is extremely welcome and it means that banks will not be forced to make very unenviable assessments in terms of who cannot or can access the scheme in terms of viable businesses out there.""

Players should take pay cut - Hancock,"Hancock's comments came after Conservative colleague Julian Knight said football was in a ""moral vacuum"" over the issue Premier League footballers should ""take a pay cut and play their part"" during the coronavirus pandemic, says health secretary Matt Hancock. Some clubs havefurloughed non-playing staffbut not looked at players' wages. ""Given the sacrifices many people are making, the first thing PL footballers can do is make a contribution,"" he said at the daily government briefing. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said ""players will have to share the financial burden"". In a statement, the PFA added: ""We are aware of the public sentiment that the players should pay non-playing staff's salaries. However, our current position is that - as businesses - if clubs can afford to pay their players and staff, they should. ""The players we have spoken to recognise that the non-playing staff are a vital part of their club and they do not want to see club staff furloughed unfairly. ""Any use of the government's support schemes without genuine financial need is detrimental to the wider society. ""In instances where clubs have the resources to pay all staff, the benefit of players paying non-playing staff salaries will only serve the business of the club's shareholders."" Check out BBC Sport's five things to do today Hancock's comments came on a day when the number of UK deaths from coronavirus rose to 2,921 and followed those made by Conservative colleague Julian Knight, who is chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee. Knight has written to Premier League chief executive Richard Masters calling for action on player wages, saying clubs which furlough non-playing staff but do not impose cuts on player wages should be subjected to a windfall tax if they do not change approach by Tuesday, 7 April. ""The purpose of the coronavirus job retention scheme is not to support the economics of Premier League clubs,"" Knight wrote. The PFA statement added: ""We fully accept that players will have to be flexible and share the financial burden of the Covid-19 outbreak in order to secure the long-term future of their own club and indeed the wider game. ""Our advice going out to players at this point reflects that expectation."" Premier League sidesTottenham,Newcastle,BournemouthandNorwichhave opted to utilise the government's job retention scheme. Players, coaches and executive staff at Norwich have donated Â£200,000, made up of a percentage of their salaries, to help local people affected by the pandemic. Players at Championship leaders Leeds United have alreadyvolunteered to take a wage deferral, while Birmingham City players who earn more than Â£6,000 a week have beenasked to take a 50% cut for the next four months. In Europe,Barcelona and Atletico Madrid players have taken a 70% pay cut, while Juventus players and manager Maurizio Sarri have agreed tofreeze their pay for four months. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe became the first Premier League boss to take a voluntary pay cut during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber, technical director Dan Ashworth and head coach Graham Potter have each taken a ""significant"" voluntary pay cut but no decision has been taken on whether to furlough any of the club's staff. BBC sports editor Dan Roan Some will no doubt view politicians' criticism of highly-paid footballers as a convenient deflection tactic at a time of intensifying scrutiny on the government's handling of a national crisis. No players have so far objected to contributing some of their wealth to help their clubs at a time when their finances are in peril. But there is now a perception that the PFA has been too slow to agree action, and by failing to take the initiative have ensured a PR disaster for their members, especially after several clubs furloughed non-playing staff. The PFA needs to look after the interests of less well paid players in Leagues One and Two of course. But it has not gone unnoticed that negotiations are being led by chief executive Gordon Taylor, who promised to stand down from his Â£2m per year role more than a year ago, but remains in power. The union has been holding out for a collective wage deferral and has finally broken its silence to explain its position, with some thinly-veiled digs at some clubs in its statement. But during talks with the Premier League over the past two days it has been made very clear to the PFA that an actual pay cut is required, with clubs deprived of matchday revenue and worried that TV rights-holders will start demanding hundreds of million of pounds worth of refunds. I understand any cut would not be as high as the 70% reduction seen at clubs like Barcelona, but that now seems to be the direction of travel with an agreement anticipated on Friday. For many, however, such a gesture should already have been made.

"Emergency loans for firms revamped after criticismFirms have made more than 130,000 loan enquires, but fewer than 1,000 had been approved.","A revamped loan fund for ailing firms hit by the coronavirus lockdown will have an immediate impact, RBS has said. RBS chairman Sir Howard Davies admitted there had been problems but expects to see a ""sharp increase"" in lending to small firms in the next few days. On Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak overhauled the scheme amid claims banks were taking advantage of the crisis. The government has pledged to guarantee Â£330bn of loans but only Â£145m has been lent so far. Small firms say they have struggled with onerous eligibility criteria for the government-backed loans, which are being issued by High Street banks and other lenders. They have also complained of facing interest rates of up to 30% and being asked to make unreasonable personal guarantees. It comes as the UK is facing recession as large parts of the economy are shut down. On Friday, the influential Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey showed Britain's dominant services industry suffered its biggest slump in March since 1996, sinking from a reading of 53.2 to 34.5. Any figure below 50 marks contraction. Mr Sunak said that under changes to the Coronavirus Business Interuption Loan Scheme (CBILS): Applications will not be limited to businesses that have been refused a loan on commercial terms, extending the number who benefit. However, the Treasury has not capped the interest rates banks can charge. Banks will be banned from asking company owners to guarantee loans with their own savings or property when borrowing up to Â£250,000 Larger firms with a turnover of up to Â£500m will also be eligible for more help - with state-backed loans of up to Â£25m available to firms with revenues of between Â£45m-500m. Sir Howard, who used to chair the Financial Services Authority (now known as the Financial Conduct Authority), told the BBC's Today programme that the process of checking borrowers' eligibility had been ""difficult"". He also said RBS had struggled with the demand after inquiries about the loans jumped ""by 45 times"" in a week. ""I think we have to accept that the scale of this process and the speed with which it's been put in place has caused challenges for everybody,"" he said. ""But we've had good discussions with the Treasury and small firms, and I think the changes announced overnight will make a quite a big difference."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health On Wednesday,Business Secretary Alok Sharma said it would ""completely unacceptable""if any banks were unfairly refusing funds to good businesses in financial difficulty. He also referenced the financial crisis - when taxpayers bailed out a number of the UK's largest banks - suggesting lenders should now repay the favour. Chancellor Rishi Sunak overhauled the loan scheme for virus-hit firms However, Sir Howard told the BBC that comparing the current crisis to 2008 was ""rewriting history"". ""In the last crisis the problem was that the banks didn't have the money to lend, there was a credit crunch. ""We're not in that position at all. The banks have got the money to lend, we have a large amount of capital, we are not constrained in the volumes we can lend."" On Thursday, Mr Sunak said the government was making ""great progress"" on supporting businesses to help manage their cashflows but needed to take ""further action"" by extending the scheme. But some firms still feel they will struggle to access the loans fast enough or that they are too risky. There has been widespread concern, acknowledged by the government, that some of the emergency measures to provide financial assistance to businesses are not working. Too few firms felt able or willing to take on loans that carried an 80% government guarantee to the lender but not the borrower. The Treasury has announced new rules, meaning business owners asking to borrow less than Â£250,000 will no longer have to offer up personal guarantees. Perhaps most importantly, the requirement for companies to have first tried to get a normal commercial loan elsewhere will be dropped. However, they are still loans. Companies wishing to take them out will be 100% liable for the debt and the government has not capped the interest rate banks can charge even though banks are able to borrow at close to 0%. The loans may now be available to more businesses but what's not clear is whether firms want them. Labour welcomed the measures but accused the government of being ""behind the curve"" when implementing support measures. ""There remain huge gaps in support for employees and self-employed that must be addressed immediately if people are to avoid facing serious hardship in this crisis,"" said shadow chancellor John McDonnell. The head of the Confederation of British Industry, Carolyn Fairbairn, described the changes as a ""big step forward"" although she said more detail was needed. ""Each week brings unprecedented levels of economic support and it's encouraging to see the government stepping in where urgent help is needed."" Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's a very necessary and timely intervention by the chancellor, because clearly, businesses were being promised interest-free, fee-free, government support by the banks. ""Time and time again, the FSB has heard from our members and other small businesses who've approached banks seeking these emergency loans that they were being offered anything but."" Stephen Jones, the chief executive of UK Finance which represents the banks, also welcomed the changes. Speaking to the Today programme, he said: ""It was clear that those viable businesses, who were required to be offered under the terms of the scheme commercial lending under commercial terms, felt aggrieved that they were not given access to the scheme and therefore the change gives the scheme to all businesses who are capable of repaying debt after this crisis is over. ""This change is extremely welcome and it means that banks will not be forced to make very unenviable assessments in terms of who cannot or can access the scheme in terms of viable businesses out there.""

Boots staff safety fears as shoppers keep browsing,"Boots staff have told the BBC they feel ""unsafe"" at work as customers continue to browse for hair dye and fake tan despite the coronavirus pandemic. Staff said they were frustrated some branches had reopened beauty aisles and lifted limits on the number of shoppers allowed inside at once. Some stores were still waiting for visors, face masks and gloves for pharmacy workers, others said. Boots said it was doing whatever it could to protect its staff. One staff member who works on the pharmacy at a branch in south-west England told the BBC she was wearing her own gloves to work because her team had not been provided with any to use during shifts. Her store had initially closed off aisles containing non-essential products and limited the number of customers allowed in â but she said those measures were lifted this week with no explanation given to staff on the shop floor. ""The doors are just open and anyone can wander in - people are looking at makeup, wandering around,"" she said. ""No one needs to buy fragrance right now."" She said the pharmacy was ""overwhelmed"" and that the plastic screens placed between staff and customers were ""small"" and ""pointless"". Shoppers confused over what are 'essential items' Like other pharmacy chains, Boots has been designated an essential retailer in the UK's effort to prevent the spread of the virus, which is why its stores can stay open. It is not alone in having to strike a balance between serving customers and keeping pharmacy teams safe - and Paul Day, director of the Pharmacists' Defence Association union, said it was ""at the good end of the scale"" when it came to protecting pharmacy staff. He said community pharmacists up and down the country, which had already been ""squeezed"", were under increased pressure because of the outbreak. And Boots, like other chains, faces the additional question of how to protect non-pharmacy staff. An employee who works on the tills at a branch in the West Midlands said Boots should ""only let a certain amount of people"" into stores, and not sell things like ""mascaras and candles"". Tracey Clements, chief operating officer for Boots UK, thanked staff for the ""amazing care and commitment they are showing"". ""I know that this is a difficult time and we are doing all we can to make sure our colleagues have the NHS-recommended PPE available, alongside extra Perspex and plastic screening and social distancing equipment they can use,"" she said in a statement. ""We have over 60,000 colleagues and we are doing whatever we can to protect them whilst they work on the frontline of healthcare.â Two online petitions - which together have more than 1,400 signatures - say ""non-essential"" Boots sales assistants should not have to come in to work and should be given paid leave. Boots no longer requires staff on its No7 beauty range to come into work, has furloughed beauty advisors and said it was one of the first retailers to ask all vulnerable and pregnant colleagues to stay at home on full pay.

""I went in on Monday morning and I witnessed staff hanging around doing nothing â chatting in the canteen because thereâs nothing to do,"" she said. She said staff were counting packets of crisps and tidying the stock room to fill time. ""This is people who are actually travelling on public transport to get into Boots to do these non-essential jobs,"" she said, adding that she had to take two buses to get to work. A sales assistant on the makeup aisle in a branch in north-east England said the store was mostly empty, but people still came in looking at mascaras while staff were ""standing around doing nothing"". ""This puts us at extreme risk as it only takes one infected customer to enter the store and pass it on,"" he claimed. ""The knock-on effect of this would be huge."" He acknowledged that it was a ""stressful"" time for Boots, but added that shop floor staff had not received direct communication from the company and needed more ""clarity"".

"Hancock aims for 100,000 tests a day by May","This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""I'll stop at nothing to protect frontline staff"" The government is aiming to carry out 100,000 coronavirus tests a day in England by the end of April, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said, as he announced a ""five-pillar"" testing plan. It comes as the government was criticised for not increasing the number of tests more quickly. Currently, there are around 10,000 tests being carried out a day. The new target includes swab tests, which are already in use, and blood tests, which are yet to be launched. It was originally thought the target would be for the whole of the UK, but the government later issued a correction saying the goal will only be for England. The number of people with the virus who have died in the UK has risen by 569, taking the total to 2,921 as of 17:00 BST on Wednesday. Speaking at the end of his seven days of quarantineafter testing positive for the virus,Mr Hancock said 100,000 tests ""is the goal and I'm determined we'll get there"". The five points in Mr Hancock's plan, which are designed to combine to deliver the new target, are: Swab tests - to check if people already have the virus - in labs run by Public Health England Using commercial partners such as universities and private businesses like Amazon and Boots to do more swab testing Introducing antibody blood tests to check whether people have had the virus Surveillance to determine the rate of infection and how it is spreading across the country Building a British diagnostics industry, with help from pharmaceutical giants Mr Hancock said that the UK wants to buy 17.5 million antibody tests, ""subject to them working"". He added that the government was working with nine companies who have offered the blood tests - but he added ""they have got to work"" and the government will not allow them to be rolled out if they are not effective. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthwelcomed the new target but said,externalit was ""not the 250,000 Boris Johnson promised"". Mr Hancock said the government still hopes to get to 250,000. Mr Ashworth also called for more clarity and details, asking how many of the 100,000 tests will be blood tests, and what role testing will play in the government's ""exit strategy"" to end the lockdown. On Wednesday,,externalthere was capacity for 12,799 daily tests in England - although just 10,650 people were tested. The government's target by mid-April had been to test 25,000 per day. Latest figures show 163,194 people in the UK had so far been tested for the virus, of which 33,718 were confirmed positive. In Wales,the Welsh Government plans to increase testingup to 9,000 a day by the end of April, whileScotland had a goalof 3,500 by the same deadline. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health After days of mounting criticism, the five-point testing plan was an attempt to reassure the public the government is on top of the issue. But key questions remain. There are basically two broad types of tests despite the five separate points - one to diagnose the presence of the virus and one to identify whether an individual has had it in the past (the so-called antibody test). In the coming week or two, the diagnostic test is the priority. Staff need access to them to allow them to return to work if they fear they have or their household members have symptoms. In the longer-term, the antibody test comes into play. The big unknown is how many people have been exposed to the virus without knowing it because they did not show symptoms. There are suggestions as many as half of infected cases may fall into this category. That could be vital in deciding what to do once the impact of lockdown is felt in falling numbers of cases and deaths. If there has been widespread infection it reduces the likelihood of a second wave and continued spread of the virus. The problem is the ability to hit the goal set - 100,000 tests a day - is out of the government's hands. A global shortage of the chemicals and kits for the diagnostic test is a serious difficulty. What is more, there are no guarantees the antibody tests the UK government is looking to use will work. Mr Hancock also said there had been problems with some tests being inaccurate. ""In one case a test that I'm being urged to buy missed three out of four positive cases for coronavirus,"" he explained. ""That means that three-quarters of cases, that test would have given the false comfort of sending someone with coronavirus back on the wards. Approving tests that don't work is dangerous and I will not do it."" Earlier, senior health officials said they were ""frustrated"" by the UK's lack of progress in expanding testing, and the current figures were ""nowhere near where we need to get to"". Some critics pointed out the UK was well behind countries like Germany in testing, but Mr Hancock said the UK ""didn't go into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry"" like other countries. There are two main types of coronavirus test that are useful in fighting the epidemic: Theantigenor ""have I got coronavirus now?"" test will tell you if someone is currently infected and risks spreading it to others. That's the one that is being used to check very ill patients in hospitals and will now be rolled out to NHS staff too. Theantibodyor ""have I recently had coronavirus"" test is not available to the public yet but Public Health England is ordering it in the millions and will distribute it as soon as they are confident about its accuracy. That would help tell us how many people got coronavirus with no or only mild symptoms. Both are vital to get a better handle on how to stop the spread of this deadly disease. NHS England medical director Stephen Powis told the briefing there were ""reasons to be hopeful"" - including that there is early evidence the transmission rate had fallen to below one, meaning each infected person infects less than one person. ""That's important because if it's the case that we are no longer passing the virus on to multiple people, so to less than one person for everyone who is infected, then that is additional evidence that infections are going to reduce,"" he said. This video can not be played NHS England:  Coronavirus âtransmission rate may have fallen below oneâ But he added people should not become complacent, adding that they are ""reasons to continue"" with the social distancing measures. The warning came hours before thenumber of confirmed infections globally passed one million, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University. Also announced at the press briefing: The government was writing off Â£13.4bn of historic NHS debt, so that hospital trusts are in a ""stronger position"" to deal with the outbreak Premier Leaguefootballers should take a pay cut to helpthe UK respond to the crisis, Mr Hancock said, adding that: ""Everyone needs to play their part."" It comes after some clubswere criticised for using a government schemeto cut the salaries of non-playing staff, while paying players in full Public Health Englandhas updated its guidance,externalon when staff should wear personal protective equipment The government is considering issuing immunity certificates to those shown to have had the virus - but Mr Hancock added that it was ""too early in the science"" to give further details Mr Hancock credited the Labour Party for some of the government's financial measures, saying ministers listened and ""took those steps"" Around 8% of all NHS England staff, and 5.7% of all doctors, are off work because of coronavirus-related reasons Who can still get free Covid tests?

A man has been handed a six-week jail term today, served already due to his time remanded in custody, in a âhumaneâ act by a judge because of the coronavirus crisis. Matthew Hatfield, 41, of Bryn-y-Baal, Mold, had admitted breaching a sexual harm prevention order by deleting the internet history on his mobile phone. Judge Niclas Parry, at Mold Crown Court, said he was taking an exceptional course because of Hatfield's health and fears for him. Allowing him to self-isolate and receive medical equipment could save Hatfieldâs life, he said. The father of a doctor on the front line of the fight against coronavirus has started a crowdfunding drive to get protective gear for her amid claims her supplied mask does not fit properly. Mark Sharpe, from Anglesey, said his daughter had been working on Ysbyty Gwyneddâs emergency department but had been redeployed to the respiratory ward. He said she could not work on the Covid-19 ward because the FFP3 masks supplied by the NHS did not fit her as she is too slight. The FFP3 Mask is an oral nasal disposable mask recommended by the World Health Organisation  and should be âface-fit tested before useâ to guarantee adequate protection. A spokesman for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which runs the hospital, said: âTrained staff at all three of our acute sites are providing fit testing to ensure our Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) protects our staff correctly. âThere are processes in place for staff who have any concerns about the fit of PPE to seek expert guidance.â  A hospice has lost 90% of its income due to the coronavirus outbreak. Officials from north west Wales-based St David's Hospice have predicted ""huge challenges on the horizon"". Their frontline clinical staff continue to care for vulnerable patients in Llandudnoâs 14 bed inpatient unit, as well as community services. Due to the closure of charity shops and events being cancelled, nearly 90% of the hospiceâs income has stopped. To raise funds, officials have devised an Easter indoor and outdoor activity pack with recipes, games and activities for family members to get involved with. Head of fundraising, marketing and communications Margaret Hollings said:

âSt Davidâs Hospice is currently fundraising through the most challenging times the hospice has ever faced and at the same time our inpatient and community services remain open to patients who are vulnerable. ""Our staff are very much on the frontline along with the NHS and itâs down to us fundraisers to make sure that end of life care can continue for those who desperately need it through the pandemic in north west Walesâ. A Welsh doctor has described the huge effort being made to treat an increasing number of patients diagnosed with coronavirus. Dr Martin Bevan, who is the unit medical director at Neath Port Talbot Hospital, spoke outside a Covid ward which is currently treating five patients â but until a week ago was a rheumatology unit. ""It's been re-purposed, itâs now an acute medical unit where we admit patients who are either suspected or known to be [Covid] positive,"" he said. ""So we're able now to admit patients direct from the community or transferred from Singleton and Morriston hospitals.â There are five on the unit and another four who have tested positive for coronavirus on the medical wards. Dr Bevan â who himself suffered with the symptoms of the illness - said the patients started arriving just a few days ago, but they expect many more in the coming days. âWe only have five beds out of 17 used on the admission unit and we have a 40 bed ward upstairs ready as well for transfers from the medical unit,"" he said. ""I anticipate within the next few weeks we will be probably fill up. âBut we still have plenty of capacity in the hospital. So we hope that we will have sufficient capacity to cope with the projected demands that are predicted at the moment.â He said that the staff there are ready for what comes next. âWe are confident that we can cope with whatever's thrown at us. Obviously, no one knows what is going to happen,"" Dr Bevan added. ""But I think we are as well prepared as we can be. And you know, all eventualities have been considered.â âAll this is challenging. My role has changed considerably over the last week. ""I am a consultant rheumatologist but now I am working in acute medicine and doing resident on calls. So that is a big change. But everyone is stepping up to the challenge. And there have been a lot of volunteers to work in the Covid areas. â All across Wales, people have again come out in force to show their appreciation for NHS staff and key workers. Actor Luke Evans has joined other stars of stage, screen and sports to thank NHS staff. The Beauty and the Beast star, who was brought up in Aberbargoed, tweeted a YouTube video with fellow stars offering their support and thanks. Evans recently praised staff at Swansea's Morriston Hospital who saved his father's hand after an accident with a circular saw. Allow Twitter content?

Pets at Home seeing âexceptional demandâ,"Pets at Home says it is seeing ""exceptional levels of demand"" amid the coronavirus outbreak. The pet store and vets group said people had been spending more as pets played an ""increasingly vital role in our lives"" during the crisis. As designated ""essential retailers"",external, pet shops and vets can stay open during the pandemic. Pets at Home said it had now shut non-essential parts of the business such as its Groom Room grooming salons. In an update for the year to 26 March, the retailer said annual profits would be higher than expected due to the recent spike in demand for pet products and healthcare. However, it warned of an uncertain outlook for 2020-21 saying it was not ""immune"" to the crisis. Retail analyst Richard Hyman told the BBC that the higher demand the chain was experiencing might be temporary. ""I think what may have happened is that some of the panic buying that we've seen domestically has been extended for the same reason for people and pets. ""I think for supermarkets it will remain at an elevated level as long as the market for eating out is paralysed. Whereas for pets I would expect demand to ease, so this may well be a blip."" The government has issued a list of which ""essential"" retailers are allowed to stay open. They include: Supermarkets and other food shops Pharmacies Petrol stations Newsagents Bicycle shops Home and hardware stores Laundrettes and dry cleaners Garages Pet shops Post Offices Banks Businesses are still able to take online orders and deliver items to people's homes. Last week, school leaders criticised Pets at Home for arguing that all of its staff - including non-veterinary workers - should be classed as essential workers so they could access emergency childcare. However, since being officially classed as an essential retailer, the firm said it had moved staff from non-essential parts of the business to essential functions that provided food and medicine. It said it was seeking to ""strike a balance"" between providing essential services to the public alongside safeguarding the health of customers and staff. The firm is offering discounts to NHS workers but,unlike some supermarkets, has not offered its own staff pay rises for continuing to go into work. Boss Peter Pritchard said: ""I am extremely grateful that our colleagues and operations have shown such resilience and flexibility to meet the recent exceptional level of demand from both existing and new customers. ""The health and safety of our colleagues, partners, suppliers, customers and pets remains our top priority. We continue to take all appropriate action in line with government advice and remain vigilant to the potential impact of Covid-19 as we start the new financial year.""

Breaking|Breaking newsConfirmed global coronavirus cases pass one million,"Healthcare services around the world have been overwhelmed by the pandemic More than a million cases of coronavirus have been registered globally, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University - another grim milestone as the world grapples with the spreading pandemic. Nearly 53,000 people have died and more than 210,000 have recovered, according to theUS university's figures.,external The US has the most cases, and more than 1,000 died there in the past day. The disease, Covid-19, first emerged in central China three months ago. Though the tally kept by Johns Hopkins records one million confirmed cases, the actual number is thought to be much higher. It took a month and a half for the first 100,000 cases to be registered. A million was reached after a doubling in cases over the past week. Nearly a quarter of cases have been registered in the United States, while Europe accounts for around half. The pandemic is taking a huge economic toll: an extra 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefit last week. The US has reported 1,169 deaths in 24 hours - the highest daily death toll of any country so far. Earlier, Spain said 950 people had died in a day, which is a record number for Europe in this outbreak. The number of confirmed Spanish cases rose from 102,136 on Wednesday to 110,238 - an 8% rise that is similar to the rate recorded in previous days. Authorities believe the virus is now peaking and say they expect to see a drop in figures in the days ahead. ""We continue with an increase of around 8%. This points, as we have already seen, to a stabilisation in the data that we're registering,"" said MarÃ­a JosÃ© Sierra, from the Spanish health ministry's emergency co-ordination unit. Spain, the worst-hit nation after Italy in terms of deaths, has also lost nearly 900,000 jobs since mid-March.

He was later visited by the police and accused of scaremongering.Dr Li died on 6 February after contracting the viruswhile treating patients in Wuhan. Grief and anger after the death of Dr Li Wenliang China first informed the World Health Organization (WHO) about cases of pneumonia with unknown causes,externalon 31 December. On 3 January, the BBC wrote its first news report about a ""mystery virus"" in Wuhan. At the time, 44 cases had been confirmed, 11 of which were considered severe. Many feared there would be a repeat of the 2003 Sars outbreak that killed 774 people. By 18 January the confirmed number of cases had risen to around 60 - but experts estimated the real figure was closer to 1,700. Just two days later, as millions of people prepared to travel for the lunar new year, the number of cases more than tripled to more than 200 and the virus was detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.

LEADING THE WAY:The US governor who saw it coming early ON FRONTLINE:'Nurses prepare for the worst but not this' REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis On 23 January, Wuhan went into lockdown. At that point, 18 people had died and 570 others had been infected, including in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United States. Ten days later, a 44-year-old man in the Philippines died of the virus - the first death reported outside of China. A week later, an 80-year-old tourist died in France - Europe's first coronavirus death. The virus appeared in Iran five days later -  two people died within hours of their diagnosis being announced. Iran would later become a hotspot for the virus. Italy saw a major surge in cases on 23 February, and 10 towns in Lombardy went into lockdown, later extended to the whole of Italy. On 23 March, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a three-week lockdown in the UK. Three days later, on 26 March, the US officially overtook China as the country hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 86,000 confirmed cases. By 2 April, this had risen to more than 217,000 - almost double the number of cases in Italy. On the same day the US hit another grim milestone. Media reports put the death toll between Wednesday and Thursday at about 1,000, the highest yet of any country in a single 24-hour period.

"UK sets aim of 100,000 tests a day by end of April","This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""I'll stop at nothing to protect frontline staff"" The government is aiming to carry out 100,000 coronavirus tests a day in England by the end of April, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said, as he announced a ""five-pillar"" testing plan. It comes as the government was criticised for not increasing the number of tests more quickly. Currently, there are around 10,000 tests being carried out a day. The new target includes swab tests, which are already in use, and blood tests, which are yet to be launched. It was originally thought the target would be for the whole of the UK, but the government later issued a correction saying the goal will only be for England. The number of people with the virus who have died in the UK has risen by 569, taking the total to 2,921 as of 17:00 BST on Wednesday. Speaking at the end of his seven days of quarantineafter testing positive for the virus,Mr Hancock said 100,000 tests ""is the goal and I'm determined we'll get there"". The five points in Mr Hancock's plan, which are designed to combine to deliver the new target, are: Swab tests - to check if people already have the virus - in labs run by Public Health England Using commercial partners such as universities and private businesses like Amazon and Boots to do more swab testing Introducing antibody blood tests to check whether people have had the virus Surveillance to determine the rate of infection and how it is spreading across the country Building a British diagnostics industry, with help from pharmaceutical giants Mr Hancock said that the UK wants to buy 17.5 million antibody tests, ""subject to them working"". He added that the government was working with nine companies who have offered the blood tests - but he added ""they have got to work"" and the government will not allow them to be rolled out if they are not effective. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthwelcomed the new target but said,externalit was ""not the 250,000 Boris Johnson promised"". Mr Hancock said the government still hopes to get to 250,000. Mr Ashworth also called for more clarity and details, asking how many of the 100,000 tests will be blood tests, and what role testing will play in the government's ""exit strategy"" to end the lockdown. On Wednesday,,externalthere was capacity for 12,799 daily tests in England - although just 10,650 people were tested. The government's target by mid-April had been to test 25,000 per day. Latest figures show 163,194 people in the UK had so far been tested for the virus, of which 33,718 were confirmed positive. In Wales,the Welsh Government plans to increase testingup to 9,000 a day by the end of April, whileScotland had a goalof 3,500 by the same deadline. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health After days of mounting criticism, the five-point testing plan was an attempt to reassure the public the government is on top of the issue. But key questions remain. There are basically two broad types of tests despite the five separate points - one to diagnose the presence of the virus and one to identify whether an individual has had it in the past (the so-called antibody test). In the coming week or two, the diagnostic test is the priority. Staff need access to them to allow them to return to work if they fear they have or their household members have symptoms. In the longer-term, the antibody test comes into play. The big unknown is how many people have been exposed to the virus without knowing it because they did not show symptoms. There are suggestions as many as half of infected cases may fall into this category. That could be vital in deciding what to do once the impact of lockdown is felt in falling numbers of cases and deaths. If there has been widespread infection it reduces the likelihood of a second wave and continued spread of the virus. The problem is the ability to hit the goal set - 100,000 tests a day - is out of the government's hands. A global shortage of the chemicals and kits for the diagnostic test is a serious difficulty. What is more, there are no guarantees the antibody tests the UK government is looking to use will work. Mr Hancock also said there had been problems with some tests being inaccurate. ""In one case a test that I'm being urged to buy missed three out of four positive cases for coronavirus,"" he explained. ""That means that three-quarters of cases, that test would have given the false comfort of sending someone with coronavirus back on the wards. Approving tests that don't work is dangerous and I will not do it."" Earlier, senior health officials said they were ""frustrated"" by the UK's lack of progress in expanding testing, and the current figures were ""nowhere near where we need to get to"". Some critics pointed out the UK was well behind countries like Germany in testing, but Mr Hancock said the UK ""didn't go into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry"" like other countries. There are two main types of coronavirus test that are useful in fighting the epidemic: Theantigenor ""have I got coronavirus now?"" test will tell you if someone is currently infected and risks spreading it to others. That's the one that is being used to check very ill patients in hospitals and will now be rolled out to NHS staff too. Theantibodyor ""have I recently had coronavirus"" test is not available to the public yet but Public Health England is ordering it in the millions and will distribute it as soon as they are confident about its accuracy. That would help tell us how many people got coronavirus with no or only mild symptoms. Both are vital to get a better handle on how to stop the spread of this deadly disease. NHS England medical director Stephen Powis told the briefing there were ""reasons to be hopeful"" - including that there is early evidence the transmission rate had fallen to below one, meaning each infected person infects less than one person. ""That's important because if it's the case that we are no longer passing the virus on to multiple people, so to less than one person for everyone who is infected, then that is additional evidence that infections are going to reduce,"" he said. This video can not be played NHS England:  Coronavirus âtransmission rate may have fallen below oneâ But he added people should not become complacent, adding that they are ""reasons to continue"" with the social distancing measures. The warning came hours before thenumber of confirmed infections globally passed one million, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University. Also announced at the press briefing: The government was writing off Â£13.4bn of historic NHS debt, so that hospital trusts are in a ""stronger position"" to deal with the outbreak Premier Leaguefootballers should take a pay cut to helpthe UK respond to the crisis, Mr Hancock said, adding that: ""Everyone needs to play their part."" It comes after some clubswere criticised for using a government schemeto cut the salaries of non-playing staff, while paying players in full Public Health Englandhas updated its guidance,externalon when staff should wear personal protective equipment The government is considering issuing immunity certificates to those shown to have had the virus - but Mr Hancock added that it was ""too early in the science"" to give further details Mr Hancock credited the Labour Party for some of the government's financial measures, saying ministers listened and ""took those steps"" Around 8% of all NHS England staff, and 5.7% of all doctors, are off work because of coronavirus-related reasons Who can still get free Covid tests?

"UK applauds NHS staff and other key workersPeople clapped, banged pots and pans, and played the bagpipes to honour key workers battling the virus.UK","This video can not be played Clap for Carers: Watch the UK applaud its key workers People across the UK have taken part in a second ""Clap for Carers"" tribute, saluting NHS staff and other key workers dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Delivery drivers, supermarket staff, care workers and bin collectors were among those honoured by the nation. Households banged pots and pans, while others played the bagpipes to show their support. Theevent is now expected to happen every Thursday at 20:00 BST.,external Households gathered on balconies, doorsteps and gardens to pay tribute to the efforts of key workers during the crisis. Emergency workers and NHS workers also joined in the applause. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is currently self-isolating in his flat above Number 11 Downing Street after testing positive for coronavirus - joined in, standing alone in his doorway to applaud. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also joined the tribute, from his Islington constituency. Last week's inaugural event paid tributeto NHS workers working on the frontline of the pandemic. The initiative was devised by Annemarie Plas, from Brixton, south-west London, who was inspired by same event happening in her home country of the Netherlands, and in many other countries. Ms Plas posted details of the event on her social media channels, and enthusiasm for taking part quickly spread across the UK. A string of buildings including the Shard in central London and Windsor Castle, in Berkshire, were lit up blue to mark the moment. Meanwhile bagpipers across Scotland performed tunes to pay tribute to key workers. Finlay MacDonald, 42, of Clarkston in East Renfrewshire, took part, calling it a ""really special moment"". ""All our neighbours were out in their gardens with a rousing round of applause. We have heard from people in Japan, South Africa, America, Spain and Italy who are all taking part."" Finlay MacDonald plays the pipes at his home in Glasgow alongside sons Elliott, ten, and Fionn, eight to salute local heroes Comedian Jason Manford took to Twitter to post a photograph of his 96-year-old grandmother joining in the applause. He wrote: ""She's beaten breast cancer and Hitler and is still here at the age of 96. ""She's not gonna let a virus get her now!

"'Hero's welcome' for paramedic at supermarketApplause from shoppers ""made me feel special after a tough run of shifts"", says David Tillyer.Norfolk","David Tillyer said acts of kindness towards NHS staff made them feel appreciated A ""humbled and emotional"" paramedic has thanked a stranger who paid for his shopping and customers who applauded him at a supermarket. People queuing outside Lidl in Cromer, Norfolk, made way for David Tillyer - who had just finished a night shift - ""with applause and thank-yous"". He said a woman who ""ran up and swiped her card"" as he went to pay told him: ""Not much you can do to stop me"". His thank-you on Facebook has been shared 78,000 times. ""I am humbled and a bit emotional,"" wrote Mr Tillyer, who works for the East of England Ambulance Service (EEAS) ""Thank you to the lady that did that and thank you to all the shoppers that made me feel special after a tough run of shifts #NHSandProud #stayhome #covidkindness.""

""About two-thirds of the way through the queue someone said 'let's give him a round of applause', and people started clapping and saying thank you.

Players must take a pay cut - Hancock,"Hancock's comments came after Conservative colleague Julian Knight said football was in a ""moral vacuum"" over the issue Premier League footballers should ""take a pay cut and play their part"" during the coronavirus pandemic, says health secretary Matt Hancock. Some clubs havefurloughed non-playing staffbut not looked at players' wages. ""Given the sacrifices many people are making, the first thing PL footballers can do is make a contribution,"" he said at the daily government briefing. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said ""players will have to share the financial burden"". In a statement, the PFA added: ""We are aware of the public sentiment that the players should pay non-playing staff's salaries. However, our current position is that - as businesses - if clubs can afford to pay their players and staff, they should. ""The players we have spoken to recognise that the non-playing staff are a vital part of their club and they do not want to see club staff furloughed unfairly. ""Any use of the government's support schemes without genuine financial need is detrimental to the wider society. ""In instances where clubs have the resources to pay all staff, the benefit of players paying non-playing staff salaries will only serve the business of the club's shareholders."" Check out BBC Sport's five things to do today Hancock's comments came on a day when the number of UK deaths from coronavirus rose to 2,921 and followed those made by Conservative colleague Julian Knight, who is chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee. Knight has written to Premier League chief executive Richard Masters calling for action on player wages, saying clubs which furlough non-playing staff but do not impose cuts on player wages should be subjected to a windfall tax if they do not change approach by Tuesday, 7 April. ""The purpose of the coronavirus job retention scheme is not to support the economics of Premier League clubs,"" Knight wrote. The PFA statement added: ""We fully accept that players will have to be flexible and share the financial burden of the Covid-19 outbreak in order to secure the long-term future of their own club and indeed the wider game. ""Our advice going out to players at this point reflects that expectation."" Premier League sidesTottenham,Newcastle,BournemouthandNorwichhave opted to utilise the government's job retention scheme. Players, coaches and executive staff at Norwich have donated Â£200,000, made up of a percentage of their salaries, to help local people affected by the pandemic. Players at Championship leaders Leeds United have alreadyvolunteered to take a wage deferral, while Birmingham City players who earn more than Â£6,000 a week have beenasked to take a 50% cut for the next four months. In Europe,Barcelona and Atletico Madrid players have taken a 70% pay cut, while Juventus players and manager Maurizio Sarri have agreed tofreeze their pay for four months. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe became the first Premier League boss to take a voluntary pay cut during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber, technical director Dan Ashworth and head coach Graham Potter have each taken a ""significant"" voluntary pay cut but no decision has been taken on whether to furlough any of the club's staff. BBC sports editor Dan Roan Some will no doubt view politicians' criticism of highly-paid footballers as a convenient deflection tactic at a time of intensifying scrutiny on the government's handling of a national crisis. No players have so far objected to contributing some of their wealth to help their clubs at a time when their finances are in peril. But there is now a perception that the PFA has been too slow to agree action, and by failing to take the initiative have ensured a PR disaster for their members, especially after several clubs furloughed non-playing staff. The PFA needs to look after the interests of less well paid players in Leagues One and Two of course. But it has not gone unnoticed that negotiations are being led by chief executive Gordon Taylor, who promised to stand down from his Â£2m per year role more than a year ago, but remains in power. The union has been holding out for a collective wage deferral and has finally broken its silence to explain its position, with some thinly-veiled digs at some clubs in its statement. But during talks with the Premier League over the past two days it has been made very clear to the PFA that an actual pay cut is required, with clubs deprived of matchday revenue and worried that TV rights-holders will start demanding hundreds of million of pounds worth of refunds. I understand any cut would not be as high as the 70% reduction seen at clubs like Barcelona, but that now seems to be the direction of travel with an agreement anticipated on Friday. For many, however, such a gesture should already have been made.

Boots staff safety fears as shoppers keep browsingEmployees fear risk of coronavirus when staffing aisles selling non-essential items.UK,"Boots staff have told the BBC they feel ""unsafe"" at work as customers continue to browse for hair dye and fake tan despite the coronavirus pandemic. Staff said they were frustrated some branches had reopened beauty aisles and lifted limits on the number of shoppers allowed inside at once. Some stores were still waiting for visors, face masks and gloves for pharmacy workers, others said. Boots said it was doing whatever it could to protect its staff. One staff member who works on the pharmacy at a branch in south-west England told the BBC she was wearing her own gloves to work because her team had not been provided with any to use during shifts. Her store had initially closed off aisles containing non-essential products and limited the number of customers allowed in â but she said those measures were lifted this week with no explanation given to staff on the shop floor. ""The doors are just open and anyone can wander in - people are looking at makeup, wandering around,"" she said. ""No one needs to buy fragrance right now."" She said the pharmacy was ""overwhelmed"" and that the plastic screens placed between staff and customers were ""small"" and ""pointless"". Shoppers confused over what are 'essential items' Like other pharmacy chains, Boots has been designated an essential retailer in the UK's effort to prevent the spread of the virus, which is why its stores can stay open. It is not alone in having to strike a balance between serving customers and keeping pharmacy teams safe - and Paul Day, director of the Pharmacists' Defence Association union, said it was ""at the good end of the scale"" when it came to protecting pharmacy staff. He said community pharmacists up and down the country, which had already been ""squeezed"", were under increased pressure because of the outbreak. And Boots, like other chains, faces the additional question of how to protect non-pharmacy staff. An employee who works on the tills at a branch in the West Midlands said Boots should ""only let a certain amount of people"" into stores, and not sell things like ""mascaras and candles"". Tracey Clements, chief operating officer for Boots UK, thanked staff for the ""amazing care and commitment they are showing"". ""I know that this is a difficult time and we are doing all we can to make sure our colleagues have the NHS-recommended PPE available, alongside extra Perspex and plastic screening and social distancing equipment they can use,"" she said in a statement. ""We have over 60,000 colleagues and we are doing whatever we can to protect them whilst they work on the frontline of healthcare.â Two online petitions - which together have more than 1,400 signatures - say ""non-essential"" Boots sales assistants should not have to come in to work and should be given paid leave. Boots no longer requires staff on its No7 beauty range to come into work, has furloughed beauty advisors and said it was one of the first retailers to ask all vulnerable and pregnant colleagues to stay at home on full pay. AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health A customer adviser in a Devon branch, who specialises in skincare, said she was ""flabbergasted"" that she and her colleagues were expected to go in to work. ""I went in on Monday morning and I witnessed staff hanging around doing nothing â chatting in the canteen because thereâs nothing to do,"" she said. She said staff were counting packets of crisps and tidying the stock room to fill time. ""This is people who are actually travelling on public transport to get into Boots to do these non-essential jobs,"" she said, adding that she had to take two buses to get to work. A sales assistant on the makeup aisle in a branch in north-east England said the store was mostly empty, but people still came in looking at mascaras while staff were ""standing around doing nothing"". ""This puts us at extreme risk as it only takes one infected customer to enter the store and pass it on,"" he claimed. ""The knock-on effect of this would be huge."" He acknowledged that it was a ""stressful"" time for Boots, but added that shop floor staff had not received direct communication from the company and needed more ""clarity"".

"Don't post rainbow pictures to Nightingale, NHS saysDespite a social media shout-out for rainbow artwork, the NHS has now asked people to share their pictures online only","Helena from Hampshire had prepared her rainbow picture The NHS has asked people to stop posting rainbow pictures to the new Nightingale hospital in London after a social media request went viral.

Labour leadership ballot closes,"Voting in the contest to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader has closed. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy or Sir Keir Starmer will be announced as the new leader on Saturday. The party's next deputy leader - replacing Tom Watson who resigned in December - will also be revealed. It is understood members will hear the result via email and the media after aspecial conference was cancelled over the coronavirus outbreak. Mrs Long-Bailey confirmed earlier this week that the candidates had been asked to record a victory speech âso it can be sent out over the airwaves as quickly as possibleâ. After the ballot closed, Sir Keir, who is widely considered to be the front-runner in the contest, posted a video on Twitter, saying: ""It's been a long campaign and it's ending in circumstances that none of us could have predicted. ""But we've kept it positive, we've demonstrated unity."" Corbyn was 'vilified' as Labour leader, says wife He added that all of the leadership candidates have ""demonstrated to our party, to our movement and hopefully to the country that real good can come out of this election"". Ms Nandy said in her video, also posted on Twitter after the ballot closed, that the contest had ended ""in the hardest of circumstances"". But during the campaign they ""showed Labour to be a party that has humility and self-confidence"" and ""honest when we get things wrong, but ambitious about our future"". She said Labour ""is a party that will win again"". Who will be Labour's next leader? 100 years of Labour in charts Voting began on 24 February. Among those casting their votes were 114,000 new members who had joined since December's election, when Labour won its lowest number of seats since 1935. Members of affiliated trades unions and groups have also been voting, as well as about 14,700 ""registered supporters"" who paid Â£25 to take part on a one-off basis. The ballot used a preferential system, with members ranking the candidates in order of preference. If one fails to get more than half the first preference votes, the second preference votes of the lowest-ranked candidate are redistributed until the contest produces a winner. The system is the same for the deputy leadership race, where shadow education secretary Angela Rayner is regarded as the front-runner. Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, Scotland's only remaining Labour MP Ian Murray, Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan and shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon are also in the running for the role.

Should more of us wear face masks?,"Should more of us wear face masks to help slow the spread of coronavirus? This question is to be assessed by a panel of advisers to theWorld Health Organization (WHO).,external The group will weigh up research on whether the virus can be projected further than previously thought; a study in the US suggests coughs can reach 6m and sneezes up to 8m. The panel's chair, Prof David Heymann, told BBC News that the new research may lead to a shift in advice about masks. The former director at the WHO explained: ""The WHO is opening up its discussion again looking at the new evidence to see whether or not there should be a change in the way it's recommending masks should be used."" The WHO recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m from anyone coughing or sneezing to avoid the risk of infection. It says people who are sick and show symptoms should wear masks. Who should be wearing masks? US considers cloth face masks for public But it advises that healthy people only need to wear them if they are caring for others suspected of being infected or if they themselves are coughing or sneezing. The new research suggests coughs and sneezes might project liquid further than previously thought It emphasises that masks are only effective if combined with frequent hand-washing and used and disposed of properly. The UK, along with other countries including the US, advises that social distancing should mean staying at least 2m apart. This advice is based on evidence showing that viruses can only be transmitted while carried within drops of liquid. The understanding is that most of those drops will either evaporate or fall to the ground near to the person who released them. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, used high-speed cameras and other sensors toassess precisely what happens after a cough or sneeze.,external They found that an exhalation generates a small fast-moving cloud of gas that can contain droplets of liquid of varying sizes - and that the smallest of these can be carried in the cloud over long distances. The study - conducted in laboratory conditions - found that coughs can project liquid up to 6m away and that sneezes, which involve much higher speeds, can reach up to 8m away. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The scientist who led the study, Prof Lydia Bourouiba of MIT, told me that she is concerned about the current concept of ""safe distances"". ""What we exhale, cough or sneeze is a gas cloud that has high momentum that can go far, traps the drops of all sizes in it and carries them through the room,"" she said. ""So having this false idea of safety at one to two metres, that somehow drops will just fall to the ground at that distance is not based on what we have quantified, measured and visualised directly."" Prof Bourouiba's view is that in certain situations, especially indoors in poorly ventilated rooms, wearing masks would reduce the risks. For example, when facing someone who's infected, masks could help divert the flow of their breath and its load of virus away from your mouth. ""Flimsy masks are not going to protect from inhaling the smallest particulates in the air because they do not provide filtration,"" Prof Bourouiba said. ""But they would potentially divert the cloud that is being emitted with high momentum to the side instead of forward."" Prof Heymann said that masks needed to be worn consistently According to Prof Heymann, the new research from MIT and other institutions will be evaluated because it suggests that droplets from coughs and sneezes could be projected further than originally thought. He said that if the evidence is supported, then ""it might be that wearing a mask is equally as effective or more effective than distancing."" But he adds a warning that masks need to be worn properly, with a seal over the nose. If they become moist, Prof Heymann explained, then particles can pass through. People must remove them carefully to avoid their hands becoming contaminated. He adds that masks need to be worn consistently. ""It's not on to wear a mask and then decide to take it off to smoke a cigarette or eat a meal - it must be worn full time,"" he said. The panel, known as the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards, is due to hold its next virtual meeting in the next few days. A spokesperson for Public Health England said there was little evidence of widespread benefit from wearing masks outside clinical settings. ""Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good universal hygiene behaviour in order for them to be effective. ""Research also shows that compliance with these recommended behaviours reduces over time when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods."" Masks have long been in use across Asia Long popular in many countries in Asia, masks are now being assessed for public use by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In Austria, the police now wear them and anyone dealing with the police will have to wear one too. Supermarkets there will insist that customers do too. A once-rare sight in Europe is becoming more common, and new advice from the WHO would accelerate that change.

"Health experts 'frustrated' by low UK virus testsSome 2,921 people have died with coronavirus in UK hospitals, as PHE calls for more NHS staff testing.","Drive-through testing sites for some NHS staff have opened in southern England Health officials say they are ""frustrated"" by a lack of progress in expanding UK coronavirus testing. Prof Paul Cosford of Public Health England (PHE) said ""everybody involved"" was unhappy testing had not ""got to the position yet that we need to get to"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson responded to criticism of the UK's strategy by hailing screening as a solution to ""unlock the puzzle"" of coronavirus. It came as a further 569 patients died with coronavirus in UK hospitals. As of 17:00 BST on Wednesday, the overall number of deaths with the virus in the UK was 2,921. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr Johnson, who continues to suffer mild symptoms during self-isolation in Downing Street after contracting the virus himself, has faced widespread criticism over his government's testing strategy. Around 13,000 tests are available each day against a target of 25,000. Prof Cosford said testing would hit 15,000 per day ""imminently"" and that PHE had played its part in ensuring tests were ""available to support clinical treatment of patients who need it"". The government has confirmed that 2,800 NHS frontline staff out of half a million in England have been tested for coronavirus since the outbreak began. Prof Cosford, PHE's emeritus medical director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the figure was ""nowhere near where we need to get to but it's a good start"". Meanwhile, Labour MP Dawn Butler said her uncle died after contracting coronavirus in hospital following a fall. ""Government needs to test everyone who works in the hospitals without delay,""she wrote on Twitter,external. And Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti said the slow pace of testing showed ""a lack of clarity of what the plan is and how it is going to be executed"". Can I get tested for coronavirus? Boots staff safety fears as shoppers keep browsing Shoppers confused over what 'essential items' are Sir Paul Nurse, chief executive of the Francis Crick research institute - which will soon be able to conduct 500 Covid-19 tests a day - said a Dunkirk-style effort was needed to co-ordinate smaller laboratories and increase test numbers. ""We are a lot of little boats and the little boats can be effective,"" he said, referring to the evacuation of Allied troops from the beaches of the French city during World War Two. He added: ""The government has put some big boats, destroyers in place. That's a bit more cumbersome to get working and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well."" The daily figures for the number of new cases, deaths and tests virtually mirror those released yesterday. At this stage, when we are on an upwards trajectory, the fact that there has not been significant increases in terms of cases and deaths can perhaps be interpreted as a good sign. But what is more important is the trend over a few days - not 24 hours in isolation. Any improvement will be seen in the number of new cases first. They were hovering around the 2,500 to 3,000 mark in the five days up to yesterday. Then the number of new cases jumped to over 4,300, which has been nearly matched today. There will be hope that this is where it plateaus, before dropping down. In a video message on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson said that increased screening would be how the UK defeats the coronavirus. ""I want to say a special word about testing, because it is so important, and as I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through,"" he said. ""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end."" This video can not be played The PM posted a video message on Twitter on Wednesday evening Mr Johnson said more coronavirus testing would enable staff who were self-isolating - either because they had symptoms or shared a household with someone who was sick - to know if they were safe to work. Antibody tests - which look for signs of immunity in the blood - could also show who had already had coronavirus and was therefore not at risk of being infected or passing the infection on to others, the prime minister said. However, these tests are not yet ready for use and it is not clear when they will be. The prime minister's official spokesman said more than 2,800 people had been tested at drive-through sites and a ""significant number"" additionally in NHS and Public Health England laboratories, with an update expected later. The spokesman confirmed that two laboratories, in addition to one in Milton Keynes, were being set up in Cheshire and Glasgow to process tests in the North of England and Scotland. An NHS coronavirus drive through test centre is already in place at Chessington World of Adventures car park Ambulance workers outside the Nightingale Hospital at the Excel centre in London Health Secretary Matt Hancock has held talks with industry figures, issuing what his department said was a ""rallying call"" to improve diagnostic capability. However, some NHS trusts have said they are limited in the number of tests they can carry out due to continued shortages of swabs, reagents and testing kits. Despite there being capacity for 12,799 daily tests in England, there were only 10,657carried out on Wednesday.,external As of 09:00 on 2 April, 163,194 people in the UK had been tested for the virus, of which 33,718 were confirmed positive. Meanwhile, Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge has become the first in the UK to use a new, much quicker Covid-19 test for staff and patients. Called Samba Two, it gives a result in just 90 minutes - as opposed to the 24 hours tests currently take - and has been adapted from an HIV test by a small Cambridge technology company. Businessman and philanthropist Sir Chris Hohn, who is helping make the test more widely available, told the BBC it could be a ""game-changer"" in helping hospitals cope with the crisis.

"More than 10,000 lives lost to coronavirus in Spain","A priest conducts a funeral in Pamplona - only relatives were allowed to attend The total number of coronavirus deaths in Spain has now exceeded 10,000. The country, the second-worst hit in terms of deaths, has also lost nearly 900,000 jobs. The US on Thursday said it saw  a record 6.6 million new unemployment benefit claims The unemployment figures are another sign of the dire impact the pandemic is having on businesses in many countries. Worldwide, confirmed coronavirus infections are nearing one million, according to Johns Hopkins University. The university's tracker has recorded more than 50,200 deaths globally; while more than 204,000 people have recovered. Covid-19 - the disease caused by coronavirus - has now claimed 10,003 lives in Spain as 950 new deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, the health ministry said. The number of confirmed cases rose from 102,136 on Wednesday to 110,238, an 8% rise that is similar to the rate recorded in previous days. Authorities believe the virus is now peaking and say they expect to see a drop in figures in the days ahead. ""We continue with an increase of around 8%. This points, as we have already seen, to a stabilisation in the data that we're registering,"" MarÃ­a JosÃ© Sierra, from the Spanish health ministry's emergency co-ordination unit, said at a news conference. This, she said, is resulting in an ""important lowering"" in the increase in the number of people being taken to intensive care units, already under pressure across the country. March's unemployment figure is the highest monthly jobless rise ever recorded in the country, which already had one of the eurozone's highest jobless rates. Spain banned all but essential outings and shut most businesses in mid-March. The data shows 898,822 people have lost their jobs since the start of the lockdown, including about 550,000 temporary workers. Spain's official unemployment figure rose to 3.5 million, the highest level since April 2017. ""This is an absolutely unprecedented situation,"" Labour Minister Yolanda DÃ­az told a news conference. The tourism and construction sectors were the hardest hit. Follow our latest updates The numbers come amid dire predictions about the possible economic impact of the measures imposed to fight the virus. A UN report estimated that up to 25 million jobs could be lost around the world. The number of new claims for unemployment benefit filed in the week ending 28 March, 6.65 million,  was double the previous week's claims of 3.3 million, according to Labor Department figures. The latest numbers were far higher than analysts' expectations and reflect the growing impact of businesses forced to shut down as lockdowns are imposed in more US states. The Labor Department's report cited the impact across hospitality, manufacturing and retail. There are fears that the number of jobless could reach 20 million, or 15% of the workforce - higher than during the Great Depression of the 1930s. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? US v ITALY v CHINA:How do death rates compare? LEADING THE WAY:The US governor who saw it coming early ON FRONTLINE:'Nurses prepare for the worst but not this' REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis More than 5,000 people have died in the US, including a six-week-old baby in Connecticut, believed to be the youngest American victim of the virus so far.Officials warned as many as 240,000 people could die in the US,even with the mitigation measures in place. Confirmed infections across the US rose by more than 25,000 in one day. The worst-hit place is New York City, where nearly 47,500 people have tested positive and more than 1,300 have died, but new clusters are flaring up in places like Detroit and New Orleans. Florida, Georgia and Mississippi have become the latest US states to issue lockdown orders. More than 75% of the country's population have been ordered to stay at home. This video can not be played US death rates v UK, Italy and South Korea Italy has the world's highest death toll. The latest figures issued on Thursday showed 13,915 had died in total, up by 760 over the past 24 hours. There were 2,477 new infections, bringing the total of current cases to 83,049 - a 3.1% rise. The country was the first in the West to impose stringent measures to curb the virus, and the government has warned of a ""severe"" recession. On Thursday, Italy's main business association said industrial output could fall up to 15% in the second quarter of the year. It already fell by the most since 2009 in the first three months of this year. Germany's Economy Minister Peter Altmaier warned the country's gross domestic product (GDP) - the sum of the value of goods and services produced in the economy - could see a decline this year bigger than during the 2009 financial crisis.

"Don't send rainbow pictures to Nightingale, NHS says","Helena from Hampshire had prepared her rainbow picture The NHS has asked people to stop posting rainbow pictures to the new Nightingale hospital in London after a social media request went viral. The nurse who started the campaign said she wanted to create ""a sign of hope"" for patients and staff.

NHS Nightingale is a field hospital that has been set up at breakneck speed and will have 4,000 beds. It is now asking people to share their rainbow pictures digitally only. In an email to the BBC, the staff nurse, who said she was based in Birmingham, wrote that she had ""organised a small team"" to help her coordinate the artwork and hoped to get enough to share with other temporary hospitals as well, once they are set up. She asked for pictures to be laminated before they were sent in the post. Hundreds of parents took part, asking their children to draw rainbow-themed pictures, laminating them and sending them in.

Pets at Home seeing âexceptional demandâ'Vital role' of animals for households during the coronavirus pandemic lifts retailer's profit.,"Pets at Home says it is seeing ""exceptional levels of demand"" amid the coronavirus outbreak. The pet store and vets group said people had been spending more as pets played an ""increasingly vital role in our lives"" during the crisis. As designated ""essential retailers"",external, pet shops and vets can stay open during the pandemic. Pets at Home said it had now shut non-essential parts of the business such as its Groom Room grooming salons. In an update for the year to 26 March, the retailer said annual profits would be higher than expected due to the recent spike in demand for pet products and healthcare. However, it warned of an uncertain outlook for 2020-21 saying it was not ""immune"" to the crisis. Retail analyst Richard Hyman told the BBC that the higher demand the chain was experiencing might be temporary. ""I think what may have happened is that some of the panic buying that we've seen domestically has been extended for the same reason for people and pets. ""I think for supermarkets it will remain at an elevated level as long as the market for eating out is paralysed. Whereas for pets I would expect demand to ease, so this may well be a blip."" The government has issued a list of which ""essential"" retailers are allowed to stay open. They include: Supermarkets and other food shops Pharmacies Petrol stations Newsagents Bicycle shops Home and hardware stores Laundrettes and dry cleaners Garages Pet shops Post Offices Banks Businesses are still able to take online orders and deliver items to people's homes. Last week, school leaders criticised Pets at Home for arguing that all of its staff - including non-veterinary workers - should be classed as essential workers so they could access emergency childcare. However, since being officially classed as an essential retailer, the firm said it had moved staff from non-essential parts of the business to essential functions that provided food and medicine. It said it was seeking to ""strike a balance"" between providing essential services to the public alongside safeguarding the health of customers and staff. The firm is offering discounts to NHS workers but,unlike some supermarkets, has not offered its own staff pay rises for continuing to go into work. Boss Peter Pritchard said: ""I am extremely grateful that our colleagues and operations have shown such resilience and flexibility to meet the recent exceptional level of demand from both existing and new customers. ""The health and safety of our colleagues, partners, suppliers, customers and pets remains our top priority. We continue to take all appropriate action in line with government advice and remain vigilant to the potential impact of Covid-19 as we start the new financial year.""

US jobless claims hit new record as virus spreadsMore than 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week as the coronavirus spreads.Business,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits has hit a record high for the second week in a row as the economic toll tied to the coronavirus intensifies. More than 6.6 million people filed jobless claims in the week ended 28 March, the Department of Labor said. That is nearly double the week earlier, which was also a new record. The deepening economic crisis comes as the number of cases in the US soars to more than 236,000. With the death toll rising to more than 5,600, the White House recently said it would retain restrictions on activity to try to curb the outbreak. Analysts at Bank of America warned that the US could see ""the deepest recession on record"" amid forecasts that the unemployment rate could hit more than 15%. The outlook is a stark reversal for the world's biggest economy where the unemployment rate had been hovering around 3.5%. However, more than 80% of Americans are now under some form of lockdown, which has forced the closure of most businesses. By Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent This is the highest number of new unemployment claims in US history. But what is so terrifying is not just the magnitude but also the speed with which American firms have shed workers. Roughly 10 million Americans lost their jobs in just the last two weeks.  To put that in context, 9 million jobs were lost in the 2008 financial crisis. There were several reasons for this  week's historic increase. More states ordered non-essential businesses to close to contain the virus. According to economists, a fifth of the US workforce is now in some form of lockdown. And a government relief package signed last week expanded unemployment benefits to help more people, such as the self-employed and independent contractors. Some fear the true number could be even higher since many people couldn't even get through to file a claim. Given these are weekly figures, this data is the closest we have to real-time information showing just how catastrophic the pandemic is for the American economy. And it points to a bruising couple of months ahead. More than 3.3 million people filed claims two weeks ago, eclipsing the previous record of 695,000, set in 1982 and bringing the two-week total to about 10 million. The most recent figure was worse than many economists had feared. ""I don't usually look at data releases and just start shaking,"" said Heidi Shierholz, former chief economist at the US Department of Labor and now policy director at the Economic Policy Institute. ""This is a portrait of disaster ... It's like nothing we've ever seen before. It represents just incredible amounts of grief and suffering."" Workers in accommodation and food services were hit hard again this week, the Department of Labor said. But it added that states are reporting ""a wider impact across industries"". ""With this report there should be little doubt that ... US is already in deep recession and the global economy will be too"", tweeted Mohamed A El-Erian, chief economic adviser to financial services firm Allianz. Allow Twitter content?

The US recently passed a more than $2tn rescue bill, which funds direct payment for households, assistance for businesses and increased unemployment benefits. It also made more people eligible to receive benefits, including workers whose jobs are suspended rather than cut. There is speculation the government may provide further relief. Unlike other countries such as the UK, the US has not implemented a programme that pays firms to keep workers on the payroll - one reason the numbers are so stark, Ms Shierholz says. ""There's an attempt at it,"" Ms Shierholz said, pointing to the expanded eligibility. ""But this concept of keeping workers on payroll through a downturn is not well socialised in the US. It's just not how we've done things in the past."" Tears, fears and anxiety amid pandemic job losses.

"Labour leadership ballot closesEither Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy or Sir Keir Starmer will be announced as leader on Saturday.","Voting in the contest to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader has closed. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy or Sir Keir Starmer will be announced as the new leader on Saturday. The party's next deputy leader - replacing Tom Watson who resigned in December - will also be revealed. It is understood members will hear the result via email and the media after aspecial conference was cancelled over the coronavirus outbreak. Mrs Long-Bailey confirmed earlier this week that the candidates had been asked to record a victory speech âso it can be sent out over the airwaves as quickly as possibleâ. After the ballot closed, Sir Keir, who is widely considered to be the front-runner in the contest, posted a video on Twitter, saying: ""It's been a long campaign and it's ending in circumstances that none of us could have predicted. ""But we've kept it positive, we've demonstrated unity."" Corbyn was 'vilified' as Labour leader, says wife He added that all of the leadership candidates have ""demonstrated to our party, to our movement and hopefully to the country that real good can come out of this election"". Ms Nandy said in her video, also posted on Twitter after the ballot closed, that the contest had ended ""in the hardest of circumstances"". But during the campaign they ""showed Labour to be a party that has humility and self-confidence"" and ""honest when we get things wrong, but ambitious about our future"". She said Labour ""is a party that will win again"". Who will be Labour's next leader? 100 years of Labour in charts Voting began on 24 February. Among those casting their votes were 114,000 new members who had joined since December's election, when Labour won its lowest number of seats since 1935. Members of affiliated trades unions and groups have also been voting, as well as about 14,700 ""registered supporters"" who paid Â£25 to take part on a one-off basis. The ballot used a preferential system, with members ranking the candidates in order of preference. If one fails to get more than half the first preference votes, the second preference votes of the lowest-ranked candidate are redistributed until the contest produces a winner. The system is the same for the deputy leadership race, where shadow education secretary Angela Rayner is regarded as the front-runner. Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, Scotland's only remaining Labour MP Ian Murray, Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan and shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon are also in the running for the role.

US jobless claims hit new record as virus spreads,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits has hit a record high for the second week in a row as the economic toll tied to the coronavirus intensifies. More than 6.6 million people filed jobless claims in the week ended 28 March, the Department of Labor said. That is nearly double the week earlier, which was also a new record. The deepening economic crisis comes as the number of cases in the US soars to more than 236,000. With the death toll rising to more than 5,600, the White House recently said it would retain restrictions on activity to try to curb the outbreak. Analysts at Bank of America warned that the US could see ""the deepest recession on record"" amid forecasts that the unemployment rate could hit more than 15%. The outlook is a stark reversal for the world's biggest economy where the unemployment rate had been hovering around 3.5%. However, more than 80% of Americans are now under some form of lockdown, which has forced the closure of most businesses. By Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent This is the highest number of new unemployment claims in US history. But what is so terrifying is not just the magnitude but also the speed with which American firms have shed workers. Roughly 10 million Americans lost their jobs in just the last two weeks.  To put that in context, 9 million jobs were lost in the 2008 financial crisis. There were several reasons for this  week's historic increase. More states ordered non-essential businesses to close to contain the virus. According to economists, a fifth of the US workforce is now in some form of lockdown. And a government relief package signed last week expanded unemployment benefits to help more people, such as the self-employed and independent contractors. Some fear the true number could be even higher since many people couldn't even get through to file a claim. Given these are weekly figures, this data is the closest we have to real-time information showing just how catastrophic the pandemic is for the American economy. And it points to a bruising couple of months ahead. More than 3.3 million people filed claims two weeks ago, eclipsing the previous record of 695,000, set in 1982 and bringing the two-week total to about 10 million. The most recent figure was worse than many economists had feared. ""I don't usually look at data releases and just start shaking,"" said Heidi Shierholz, former chief economist at the US Department of Labor and now policy director at the Economic Policy Institute. ""This is a portrait of disaster ... It's like nothing we've ever seen before. It represents just incredible amounts of grief and suffering."" Workers in accommodation and food services were hit hard again this week, the Department of Labor said. But it added that states are reporting ""a wider impact across industries"". ""With this report there should be little doubt that ... US is already in deep recession and the global economy will be too"", tweeted Mohamed A El-Erian, chief economic adviser to financial services firm Allianz. Allow Twitter content?

The US recently passed a more than $2tn rescue bill, which funds direct payment for households, assistance for businesses and increased unemployment benefits. It also made more people eligible to receive benefits, including workers whose jobs are suspended rather than cut. There is speculation the government may provide further relief. Unlike other countries such as the UK, the US has not implemented a programme that pays firms to keep workers on the payroll - one reason the numbers are so stark, Ms Shierholz says. ""There's an attempt at it,"" Ms Shierholz said, pointing to the expanded eligibility. ""But this concept of keeping workers on payroll through a downturn is not well socialised in the US. It's just not how we've done things in the past."" Tears, fears and anxiety amid pandemic job losses.

Spain sees record rise in unemployment amid virus,"A priest conducts a funeral in Pamplona - only relatives were allowed to attend The total number of coronavirus deaths in Spain has now exceeded 10,000. The country, the second-worst hit in terms of deaths, has also lost nearly 900,000 jobs. The US on Thursday said it saw  a record 6.6 million new unemployment benefit claims The unemployment figures are another sign of the dire impact the pandemic is having on businesses in many countries. Worldwide, confirmed coronavirus infections are nearing one million, according to Johns Hopkins University. The university's tracker has recorded more than 50,200 deaths globally; while more than 204,000 people have recovered. Covid-19 - the disease caused by coronavirus - has now claimed 10,003 lives in Spain as 950 new deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, the health ministry said. The number of confirmed cases rose from 102,136 on Wednesday to 110,238, an 8% rise that is similar to the rate recorded in previous days. Authorities believe the virus is now peaking and say they expect to see a drop in figures in the days ahead. ""We continue with an increase of around 8%. This points, as we have already seen, to a stabilisation in the data that we're registering,"" MarÃ­a JosÃ© Sierra, from the Spanish health ministry's emergency co-ordination unit, said at a news conference. This, she said, is resulting in an ""important lowering"" in the increase in the number of people being taken to intensive care units, already under pressure across the country. March's unemployment figure is the highest monthly jobless rise ever recorded in the country, which already had one of the eurozone's highest jobless rates. Spain banned all but essential outings and shut most businesses in mid-March. The data shows 898,822 people have lost their jobs since the start of the lockdown, including about 550,000 temporary workers. Spain's official unemployment figure rose to 3.5 million, the highest level since April 2017. ""This is an absolutely unprecedented situation,"" Labour Minister Yolanda DÃ­az told a news conference. The tourism and construction sectors were the hardest hit. Follow our latest updates The numbers come amid dire predictions about the possible economic impact of the measures imposed to fight the virus. A UN report estimated that up to 25 million jobs could be lost around the world. The number of new claims for unemployment benefit filed in the week ending 28 March, 6.65 million,  was double the previous week's claims of 3.3 million, according to Labor Department figures. The latest numbers were far higher than analysts' expectations and reflect the growing impact of businesses forced to shut down as lockdowns are imposed in more US states. The Labor Department's report cited the impact across hospitality, manufacturing and retail. There are fears that the number of jobless could reach 20 million, or 15% of the workforce - higher than during the Great Depression of the 1930s. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

LEADING THE WAY:The US governor who saw it coming early ON FRONTLINE:'Nurses prepare for the worst but not this' REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis More than 5,000 people have died in the US, including a six-week-old baby in Connecticut, believed to be the youngest American victim of the virus so far.Officials warned as many as 240,000 people could die in the US,even with the mitigation measures in place. Confirmed infections across the US rose by more than 25,000 in one day. The worst-hit place is New York City, where nearly 47,500 people have tested positive and more than 1,300 have died, but new clusters are flaring up in places like Detroit and New Orleans. Florida, Georgia and Mississippi have become the latest US states to issue lockdown orders. More than 75% of the country's population have been ordered to stay at home. This video can not be played US death rates v UK, Italy and South Korea Italy has the world's highest death toll. The latest figures issued on Thursday showed 13,915 had died in total, up by 760 over the past 24 hours. There were 2,477 new infections, bringing the total of current cases to 83,049 - a 3.1% rise. The country was the first in the West to impose stringent measures to curb the virus, and the government has warned of a ""severe"" recession. On Thursday, Italy's main business association said industrial output could fall up to 15% in the second quarter of the year. It already fell by the most since 2009 in the first three months of this year.

'I was left gasping for air',"This video can not be played Jozef Wallis says coronavirus caused coughing so bad it left him ""gasping for air"" Jozef Wallis is a 40-year-old in good health, but ended up in an intensive care unit after contracting coronavirus. After a busy but otherwise ""normal Wednesday"" on 11 March, he went for drinks in the evening. Not long afterwards, he began to feel light-headed and his joints were aching. By the time he got home to Canada Water, south-east London, he was ""shivering uncontrollably"", he said. Mr Wallis shared an intensive care unit with five other patients I curled up on the sofa feeling pretty unwell. That quickly escalated into a fever. I felt either freezing cold, or incredibly hot. I had cold sweats and tingling sensations across my body. Then there was the onset of a painful dry cough which left me gasping for air. I really didn't want to move at all. Mr Wallis said he felt lucky to be diagnosed early. I stayed home and self-isolated. I'm fairly fit and healthy. I had no underlying health conditions. The latest news, information and advice about the coronavirus in London But several days later, I felt more weak and exhausted so my family called an ambulance. I was admitted to the intensive care unit at St Thomas's Hospital where they carried out tests. About 30 hours later, I was told I had tested positive for COVID-19. Where could I have caught it? I'm always on the Underground and frequently meeting many people. Mr Wallis was transported home by ambulance I was moved to a shared ward with five other patients who had coronavirus, and my condition was stabilised by doctors. I saw a range of ages and fitnesses. Two patients were moved to intensive care on assisted breathing. I was lucky enough to be discharged after five nights and people in hazmat suits transported me home We should be immensely proud of the whole NHS. From the ambulance crew to the porters, nurses and doctors. The system is under huge pressure but they still smile and make you feel comfortable. Mr Wallis urged others to stay home and ease the burden on the NHS Three weeks later, I'm feeling much better but still get tired quickly. Information is muddled, I'm not sure how much longer I have to isolate. Could I still be contagious or am I immune? It's unclear. This virus can attack anyone. I was lucky to catch it early on. The hospital had the situation under control, but because of the man-power needed for each of the isolated patients, we must all reduce the burden on the NHS by staying at home. I'm very thankful to the people there for us at our time of need."" As told to Jamie Moreland A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Boots staff safety fears as shoppers keep browsingEmployees fear risk of coronavirus when staffing aisles selling non-essential items.,"Boots staff have told the BBC they feel ""unsafe"" at work as customers continue to browse for hair dye and fake tan despite the coronavirus pandemic. Staff said they were frustrated some branches had reopened beauty aisles and lifted limits on the number of shoppers allowed inside at once. Some stores were still waiting for visors, face masks and gloves for pharmacy workers, others said. Boots said it was doing whatever it could to protect its staff. One staff member who works on the pharmacy at a branch in south-west England told the BBC she was wearing her own gloves to work because her team had not been provided with any to use during shifts. Her store had initially closed off aisles containing non-essential products and limited the number of customers allowed in â but she said those measures were lifted this week with no explanation given to staff on the shop floor. ""The doors are just open and anyone can wander in - people are looking at makeup, wandering around,"" she said. ""No one needs to buy fragrance right now."" She said the pharmacy was ""overwhelmed"" and that the plastic screens placed between staff and customers were ""small"" and ""pointless"". Shoppers confused over what are 'essential items' Like other pharmacy chains, Boots has been designated an essential retailer in the UK's effort to prevent the spread of the virus, which is why its stores can stay open. It is not alone in having to strike a balance between serving customers and keeping pharmacy teams safe - and Paul Day, director of the Pharmacists' Defence Association union, said it was ""at the good end of the scale"" when it came to protecting pharmacy staff. He said community pharmacists up and down the country, which had already been ""squeezed"", were under increased pressure because of the outbreak. And Boots, like other chains, faces the additional question of how to protect non-pharmacy staff. An employee who works on the tills at a branch in the West Midlands said Boots should ""only let a certain amount of people"" into stores, and not sell things like ""mascaras and candles"". Tracey Clements, chief operating officer for Boots UK, thanked staff for the ""amazing care and commitment they are showing"". ""I know that this is a difficult time and we are doing all we can to make sure our colleagues have the NHS-recommended PPE available, alongside extra Perspex and plastic screening and social distancing equipment they can use,"" she said in a statement. ""We have over 60,000 colleagues and we are doing whatever we can to protect them whilst they work on the frontline of healthcare.â Two online petitions - which together have more than 1,400 signatures - say ""non-essential"" Boots sales assistants should not have to come in to work and should be given paid leave. Boots no longer requires staff on its No7 beauty range to come into work, has furloughed beauty advisors and said it was one of the first retailers to ask all vulnerable and pregnant colleagues to stay at home on full pay. AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health A customer adviser in a Devon branch, who specialises in skincare, said she was ""flabbergasted"" that she and her colleagues were expected to go in to work. ""I went in on Monday morning and I witnessed staff hanging around doing nothing â chatting in the canteen because thereâs nothing to do,"" she said. She said staff were counting packets of crisps and tidying the stock room to fill time. ""This is people who are actually travelling on public transport to get into Boots to do these non-essential jobs,"" she said, adding that she had to take two buses to get to work. A sales assistant on the makeup aisle in a branch in north-east England said the store was mostly empty, but people still came in looking at mascaras while staff were ""standing around doing nothing"". ""This puts us at extreme risk as it only takes one infected customer to enter the store and pass it on,"" he claimed. ""The knock-on effect of this would be huge."" He acknowledged that it was a ""stressful"" time for Boots, but added that shop floor staff had not received direct communication from the company and needed more ""clarity"".

Pakistan cuts sentence over US journalist murder,"Pearl went missing in Karachi in 2002 while researching extremism Pakistan has overturned the death sentence of the man convicted of killing US journalist Daniel Pearl, defence lawyers have told reporters. British-born Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, imprisoned since 2002, has had his sentence reduced to seven years for kidnapping, said lawyer Khawaja Naveed. Three other men given life sentences over the killing have been acquitted by the Sindh High Court and released. The Sindh chief prosecutor says he will lodge an appeal in the Sheikh case. The province's prosecutor general Fiaz Shah told the BBC he expected Sheikh to remain in jail pending the appeal, which would be heard by the Supreme Court. A group of US journalists, including former colleagues of Pearl, said in 2011 that they believed Sheikh had not carried out the beheading. The Pearl Project alleged the killer was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is being held in Guantanamo Bay, accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks. Trial date set for 'architect of 9/11 attacks' Profile: Al-Qaeda 'kingpin' Mr Naveed said he expected his client to be released ""in a few days"". Pearl, who worked for the Wall Street Journal, went missing in January 2002. He had been researching links between Islamist militant activity in Karachi and Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a passenger plane using bombs hidden in his shoes. According to prosecutors, Omar Saeed Sheikh lured him to a meeting with an Islamic cleric. The two had built a relationship discussing concerns about their wives, who were both pregnant at the time. Almost a month later, a video showing the 38-year-old's beheading was sent to the US consulate in Karachi. Pearl's son, Adam, was born in May 2002. Sheikh was convicted of Pearl's murder in July 2002 by an anti-terrorism court, and has been on death row since. Sheikh was born in London in 1973, where he attended public school before going on to study at the London School of Economics. He did not graduate, failing to return after driving aid to Bosnia after his first year. He was arrested for being involved in the kidnapping of four tourists - three British and one American - in Delhi in 1994. He was released from prison as part of demands by militants who hijacked a plane in 1999. According to news agency Reuters, police in India later accused him of transferring money to one of the militants who flew a plane into the World Trade Center on 9/11. By M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The main argument of the defence lawyers was that the prosecution had failed to prove their case beyond doubt. They may have a point. There have been questions over whether the four had any direct role in Daniel Pearl's murder, though there was some evidence to show Sheikh's involvement in his kidnapping. Sheikh was widely seen as having links to Pakistan's top intelligence service, the ISI, as well as al-Qaeda, and had a role in forming the Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group that carried out attacks in Indian Kashmir during the 1990s. His arrest and conviction in 2002 came in quick succession, at a time when Pakistan was under severe pressure from the United States to eliminate terror networks operating on its soil. But the Pakistani judiciary has sat on his appeal for nearly two decades, and some observers believe the present ruling has come at a time when the mood in the US and the rest of the world has changed and nobody seems to be worried about the terrorists of the past.

Interest-free overdraft plan for bank customers,"Debt problems can affect people's mental health People struggling financially amid the coronavirus pandemic should not be charged interest on the first Â£500 of existing overdrafts for 90 days, the UK's financial watchdog has proposed. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also suggested repayments on loans and credit cards should be frozen for up to three months for those in trouble. The FCA said the outbreak had caused an âunprecedented financial shockâ. Experts suggest that support from banks at present is ""patchy"". Banks said they were facing record numbers of calls for help, but were supporting customers. In a timeframe reserved for emergency measures, the City watchdog is asking banks to respond to its proposed measures by Monday 6 April, and it wants them to come into force by Thursday 9 April. After the FCA recently announcedan ""overhaul"" for overdraft charges, many banks increased their charges for some customers and clustered around a similar figure of about 40%. In its latest announcement, the watchdog said: ""Over the next 90 days, firms would have to ensure all consumers are no worse off and not paying more than they would have under previous prices."" Other measures it has proposed to help struggle borrowers include: A three-month repayment freeze on loans A temporary freeze on credit card and store card debt up to three months Zero interest for three months on up to Â£500 for customers affected by coronavirus using an arranged overdraft for up to three months The FCA also said that consumers using any of these measures should not see their credit rating affected. FCA interim chief executive Christopher Woolard said: ""If confirmed, the package of measures we are proposing today will help provide affected consumers with the temporary financial support they need to help them weather the storm during this challenging time.""

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Some lenders have already put measures in place to assist people hit by the financial impact of the outbreak, but Martin Lewis, founder of Moneysavingexpert, described the picture as a ""banking lottery"". If approved, these proposals would bring a level playing field for borrowers. However, they would still need to contact their bank to access the help, rather than just stopping repayments. ""If you're struggling to afford interest and debt repayments, don't assume any of these things are in place until it's confirmed by your bank. If you just halt payments without confirmation, you may end up being chased for payments and having charges added to your debt,"" said Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. These are emergency rules to make sure that people who are affected by the crisis don't fall through the cracks. They could make a big difference because customers can apply for help knowing that the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - is on their side. Banks have already put their own measures in place to help families who are hit by a sudden loss of income. But their concessions vary and some don't match up to the level of protection that the FCA wants to see. On top of that, the new guidance stretches across a wide range of lending, from bank loans to catalogue credit. Customers still need to be aware that interest charges might build up in the background and have to be paid later on. But on overdrafts, the stop-gap regime is clear: you can request to pay zero interest for three months. This could make a big difference because it comes just as most big banks are introducing overdraft rates of nearly 40%. Contacting banks can be frustrating at present, with long queues, but information is also available on lenders' websites and some are offering online applications for help. Apart from the zero interest on Â£500 of arranged overdrafts, firms would be entitled to charge a ""reasonable rate of interest"" when a customer requested a repayment holiday on loans, credit cards, and store cards. Mr Lewis said: ""Payment holidays mean exactly what they say - you don't pay, but you can still be charged interest. And with interest rates often high, especially on cards, that can mean storing up trouble for future. ""Those struggling for cashflow may have no choice, but if you don't need to do it, don't."" Banks are already offeringthree-month mortgage repayment holidaysfor some struggling customers. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, which represents banks and other lenders, said: ""It is critical that the FCA's proposals do not disrupt the provision of credit to borrowers and takes account of the business models of all credit providers including those outside the mainstream market."" Mr Jones said that lenders have been receiving a record number of calls but have also faced staffing pressures. He urged customers to check their lender's website first to see if it answers their question, and consider getting in touch via online chat, social media and online banking and mobile apps.

"'I was left gasping for air'Jozef Wallis says he is in ""good health"" but still ended up in an intensive care ward.London","This video can not be played Jozef Wallis says coronavirus caused coughing so bad it left him ""gasping for air"" Jozef Wallis is a 40-year-old in good health, but ended up in an intensive care unit after contracting coronavirus. After a busy but otherwise ""normal Wednesday"" on 11 March, he went for drinks in the evening. Not long afterwards, he began to feel light-headed and his joints were aching. By the time he got home to Canada Water, south-east London, he was ""shivering uncontrollably"", he said. Mr Wallis shared an intensive care unit with five other patients I curled up on the sofa feeling pretty unwell. That quickly escalated into a fever. I felt either freezing cold, or incredibly hot. I had cold sweats and tingling sensations across my body. Then there was the onset of a painful dry cough which left me gasping for air. I really didn't want to move at all. Mr Wallis said he felt lucky to be diagnosed early. I stayed home and self-isolated. I'm fairly fit and healthy. I had no underlying health conditions. The latest news, information and advice about the coronavirus in London But several days later, I felt more weak and exhausted so my family called an ambulance. I was admitted to the intensive care unit at St Thomas's Hospital where they carried out tests. About 30 hours later, I was told I had tested positive for COVID-19. Where could I have caught it? I'm always on the Underground and frequently meeting many people. Mr Wallis was transported home by ambulance I was moved to a shared ward with five other patients who had coronavirus, and my condition was stabilised by doctors. I saw a range of ages and fitnesses. Two patients were moved to intensive care on assisted breathing. I was lucky enough to be discharged after five nights and people in hazmat suits transported me home We should be immensely proud of the whole NHS. From the ambulance crew to the porters, nurses and doctors. The system is under huge pressure but they still smile and make you feel comfortable. Mr Wallis urged others to stay home and ease the burden on the NHS Three weeks later, I'm feeling much better but still get tired quickly. Information is muddled, I'm not sure how much longer I have to isolate. Could I still be contagious or am I immune? It's unclear. This virus can attack anyone. I was lucky to catch it early on. The hospital had the situation under control, but because of the man-power needed for each of the isolated patients, we must all reduce the burden on the NHS by staying at home. I'm very thankful to the people there for us at our time of need."" As told to Jamie Moreland A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"BA set to suspend 36,000 staff amid virus crisis","British Airways has reached a deal to temporarily suspend more than 30,000 of its cabin crew and ground staff. The airline, which has grounded most of its fleet due to the coronavirus, has been locked in talks with unions for more than a week. But on Thursday, BA boss Alex Cruz told staff that a large majority of employees would be suspended for the next two months. He said the government's job retention scheme would fund 80% of their wages. Explaining the decision, Mr Cruz said: ""We need to act now to protect jobs and ensure that BA comes out the other side of this crisis in the best possible shape."" The decision will affect all staff at Gatwick and London City Airport after the airline suspended its operations at both locations until the crisis is over. ""The number of colleagues who will be furloughed reflects the significant drop in flying,"" Mr Cruz said. Under the jobs retention scheme, the government funds 80% of someone's salary capped at a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. But union Unite said there would be no cap on earnings under its agreement with BA. The union also said no BA staff would be made redundant during the coronavirus crisis. ""Given the incredibly difficult circumstances that the entire aviation sector is facing this is as good a deal as possible for our members,"" the union's national officer for aviation, Oliver Richardson, said in a statement. No one who works at British Airways will be surprised at today's announcement. When the planes are sitting on the ground - and nearly all of BA's fleet is doing just that, dispersed to regional airports around the country - there is no need for the army of workers who fly the aircraft, maintain them, load and unload the bags, and serve the passengers. Staff typically make up about 40% of an airline's costs, and BA should be able to reclaim 80% of wages from the government employment support scheme set up to help companies affected by the virus. BA has not, so far, asked the government for any other specific financial assistance. Nor has EasyJet, where senior sources say the general assistance programmes - wage assistance and loan guarantees - should be sufficient. Virgin Atlantic, however, continues to press, and has written to MPs pointing out that it provides the only British-flagged competition to British Airways on many key routes from Heathrow. So far the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has taken a hard line, saying airlines should exhaust all financial revenues before turning to the taxpayer. If Virgin does make a formal application for more aid, it will have to be able to show it has met the chancellor's test. BA had already reached a separate deal with its 4,000 pilots who will take a 50% pay cut over two months. John Strickland, independent aviation analyst, said ""tough negotiations"" between BA and the Unite union meant it had taken a while to reach an agreement. ""The pilots' deal for half pay was concluded rather earlier - I guess there was a recognition as to just how serious that issue was,"" he said. BA's parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), is in a better financial position than some of its competitors. The group has made healthy profits in recent years. But the airline's expected decision to suspend such a large number of workers gives a sense of how hard UK aviation has been hit by travel restrictions designed to stem the spread of the pandemic. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash With future bookings cancelled for the foreseeable future, airlines have been haemorrhaging cash. Over the next three months, the International Air Transport Association expects airlines to rack up losses of almost $40bn (Â£32.3bn). It said carriers were burning through their cash reserves fast, mainly because of the multi-billion-pound cost of refunding tickets for cancelled flights. Many staff at Virgin Atlantic have had their jobs suspended for two months and crews at Easyjet are out of work for three months. This week, British Airways has run government repatriation flights to get hundreds of British nationals home from Peru, after the country went into lockdown. It is one of several UK-based airlines that has agreed to run further repatriation flights in the coming weeks as hundreds of thousands of people are still stuck in other parts of the world.

Should more of us wear face masks?Experts are set to assess the value of face masks in helping slow the spread of coronavirus.Science & EnvironmentComments,"Should more of us wear face masks to help slow the spread of coronavirus? This question is to be assessed by a panel of advisers to theWorld Health Organization (WHO).,external The group will weigh up research on whether the virus can be projected further than previously thought; a study in the US suggests coughs can reach 6m and sneezes up to 8m. The panel's chair, Prof David Heymann, told BBC News that the new research may lead to a shift in advice about masks. The former director at the WHO explained: ""The WHO is opening up its discussion again looking at the new evidence to see whether or not there should be a change in the way it's recommending masks should be used."" The WHO recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m from anyone coughing or sneezing to avoid the risk of infection. It says people who are sick and show symptoms should wear masks. Who should be wearing masks? US considers cloth face masks for public But it advises that healthy people only need to wear them if they are caring for others suspected of being infected or if they themselves are coughing or sneezing. The new research suggests coughs and sneezes might project liquid further than previously thought It emphasises that masks are only effective if combined with frequent hand-washing and used and disposed of properly. The UK, along with other countries including the US, advises that social distancing should mean staying at least 2m apart. This advice is based on evidence showing that viruses can only be transmitted while carried within drops of liquid. The understanding is that most of those drops will either evaporate or fall to the ground near to the person who released them. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, used high-speed cameras and other sensors toassess precisely what happens after a cough or sneeze.,external They found that an exhalation generates a small fast-moving cloud of gas that can contain droplets of liquid of varying sizes - and that the smallest of these can be carried in the cloud over long distances. The study - conducted in laboratory conditions - found that coughs can project liquid up to 6m away and that sneezes, which involve much higher speeds, can reach up to 8m away. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The scientist who led the study, Prof Lydia Bourouiba of MIT, told me that she is concerned about the current concept of ""safe distances"". ""What we exhale, cough or sneeze is a gas cloud that has high momentum that can go far, traps the drops of all sizes in it and carries them through the room,"" she said. ""So having this false idea of safety at one to two metres, that somehow drops will just fall to the ground at that distance is not based on what we have quantified, measured and visualised directly."" Prof Bourouiba's view is that in certain situations, especially indoors in poorly ventilated rooms, wearing masks would reduce the risks. For example, when facing someone who's infected, masks could help divert the flow of their breath and its load of virus away from your mouth. ""Flimsy masks are not going to protect from inhaling the smallest particulates in the air because they do not provide filtration,"" Prof Bourouiba said. ""But they would potentially divert the cloud that is being emitted with high momentum to the side instead of forward."" Prof Heymann said that masks needed to be worn consistently According to Prof Heymann, the new research from MIT and other institutions will be evaluated because it suggests that droplets from coughs and sneezes could be projected further than originally thought. He said that if the evidence is supported, then ""it might be that wearing a mask is equally as effective or more effective than distancing."" But he adds a warning that masks need to be worn properly, with a seal over the nose. If they become moist, Prof Heymann explained, then particles can pass through. People must remove them carefully to avoid their hands becoming contaminated. He adds that masks need to be worn consistently. ""It's not on to wear a mask and then decide to take it off to smoke a cigarette or eat a meal - it must be worn full time,"" he said. The panel, known as the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards, is due to hold its next virtual meeting in the next few days. A spokesperson for Public Health England said there was little evidence of widespread benefit from wearing masks outside clinical settings. ""Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good universal hygiene behaviour in order for them to be effective. ""Research also shows that compliance with these recommended behaviours reduces over time when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods."" Masks have long been in use across Asia Long popular in many countries in Asia, masks are now being assessed for public use by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In Austria, the police now wear them and anyone dealing with the police will have to wear one too. Supermarkets there will insist that customers do too. A once-rare sight in Europe is becoming more common, and new advice from the WHO would accelerate that change.

"Spain sees record rise in unemployment amid virusThe country imposed strict measures to fight the coronavirus, which has killed more than 10,000 there.Europe","A priest conducts a funeral in Pamplona - only relatives were allowed to attend The total number of coronavirus deaths in Spain has now exceeded 10,000. The country, the second-worst hit in terms of deaths, has also lost nearly 900,000 jobs. The US on Thursday said it saw  a record 6.6 million new unemployment benefit claims The unemployment figures are another sign of the dire impact the pandemic is having on businesses in many countries. Worldwide, confirmed coronavirus infections are nearing one million, according to Johns Hopkins University. The university's tracker has recorded more than 50,200 deaths globally; while more than 204,000 people have recovered. Covid-19 - the disease caused by coronavirus - has now claimed 10,003 lives in Spain as 950 new deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, the health ministry said. The number of confirmed cases rose from 102,136 on Wednesday to 110,238, an 8% rise that is similar to the rate recorded in previous days. Authorities believe the virus is now peaking and say they expect to see a drop in figures in the days ahead. ""We continue with an increase of around 8%. This points, as we have already seen, to a stabilisation in the data that we're registering,"" MarÃ­a JosÃ© Sierra, from the Spanish health ministry's emergency co-ordination unit, said at a news conference. This, she said, is resulting in an ""important lowering"" in the increase in the number of people being taken to intensive care units, already under pressure across the country. March's unemployment figure is the highest monthly jobless rise ever recorded in the country, which already had one of the eurozone's highest jobless rates. Spain banned all but essential outings and shut most businesses in mid-March. The data shows 898,822 people have lost their jobs since the start of the lockdown, including about 550,000 temporary workers. Spain's official unemployment figure rose to 3.5 million, the highest level since April 2017. ""This is an absolutely unprecedented situation,"" Labour Minister Yolanda DÃ­az told a news conference. The tourism and construction sectors were the hardest hit. Follow our latest updates The numbers come amid dire predictions about the possible economic impact of the measures imposed to fight the virus. A UN report estimated that up to 25 million jobs could be lost around the world. The number of new claims for unemployment benefit filed in the week ending 28 March, 6.65 million,  was double the previous week's claims of 3.3 million, according to Labor Department figures. The latest numbers were far higher than analysts' expectations and reflect the growing impact of businesses forced to shut down as lockdowns are imposed in more US states. The Labor Department's report cited the impact across hospitality, manufacturing and retail. There are fears that the number of jobless could reach 20 million, or 15% of the workforce - higher than during the Great Depression of the 1930s. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

The country was the first in the West to impose stringent measures to curb the virus, and the government has warned of a ""severe"" recession. On Thursday, Italy's main business association said industrial output could fall up to 15% in the second quarter of the year. It already fell by the most since 2009 in the first three months of this year.

Oil prices rise on hopes of a price war truce,"Signs that Saudi Arabia and Russia may end an oil feud sent prices up more than 20% on Thursday, the biggest one-day leap on record. US President Donald Trump said he expected the two sides to cut supply, while Saudi Arabia called for an emergency meeting of oil producers. The Russian energy minister also said his country may re-enter talks. A deal to cut production - in response to the drop in demand from coronavirus shutdowns - collapsed last month. Since then, the cost of crude has fallen to lows not seen for almost two decades as Russia and Saudi Arabia slashed prices and ramped up production in a fight for market share. Those moves, alongside the wider collapse in demand, have caused US oil to its worst quarter on record. Prices fell by two thirds in the first three months of the year, rocking the American energy sector. The damage has prompted Washington to try to broker a new deal. BA expected to suspend 36,000 staff A fifth of smaller firms 'will run out of cash' Banks bow to pressure to axe investor payouts On Thursday, Mr Trump tweeted ""I expect & hope"" the two countries will agree to cut supply by 10 million barrels ""and maybe substantially more"". Speaking earlier about the dispute at a White House news conference, Mr Trump said: ""It's very bad for Russia, it's very bad for Saudi Arabia. I mean, it's very bad for both. I think they're going to make a deal"". Separately, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that Moscow would work to stabilise the market. The international benchmark, Brent crude, rose 21% to finish at $29.94 a barrel and the price of US oil, known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), jumped almost 25% to $25.32. Both were record gains. A cut of 10 million barrels per day would amount to about 10% of global output. Analysts said the US oil industry might also have to make cuts - either voluntarily to help stabilise prices or due to financial pressures because of the broader demand drop. Global demand for crude oil is predicted to be almost 23% lower this month than it was a year ago, according to research firm Rystad Energy. ""While a truce (if actually enacted) would be a positive [for oil prices], we believe the benefits from a likely modest reduction in global crude oil supply are still likely to be swamped by the decline in crude oil demand that we see today, courtesy of the coronavirus,"" said Stewart Glickman, analyst at CFRA Research. Mr Trump, who is set to meet the bosses of major energy companies, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, at the White House on Friday, has described the US energy sector as having been ""ravaged"". On Wednesday, it saw the first stock market-traded casualty of the collapse in oil prices when shale producer Whiting Petroleum, which was once the largest oil producer in the US state of North Dakota, filed for bankruptcy. The company said it had worked to cut costs and would continue to operate under a restructuring plan.

Loan and credit card payments set to be frozen,"Debt problems can affect people's mental health People struggling financially amid the coronavirus pandemic should not be charged interest on the first Â£500 of existing overdrafts for 90 days, the UK's financial watchdog has proposed. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also suggested repayments on loans and credit cards should be frozen for up to three months for those in trouble. The FCA said the outbreak had caused an âunprecedented financial shockâ. Experts suggest that support from banks at present is ""patchy"". Banks said they were facing record numbers of calls for help, but were supporting customers. In a timeframe reserved for emergency measures, the City watchdog is asking banks to respond to its proposed measures by Monday 6 April, and it wants them to come into force by Thursday 9 April. After the FCA recently announcedan ""overhaul"" for overdraft charges, many banks increased their charges for some customers and clustered around a similar figure of about 40%. In its latest announcement, the watchdog said: ""Over the next 90 days, firms would have to ensure all consumers are no worse off and not paying more than they would have under previous prices."" Other measures it has proposed to help struggle borrowers include: A three-month repayment freeze on loans A temporary freeze on credit card and store card debt up to three months Zero interest for three months on up to Â£500 for customers affected by coronavirus using an arranged overdraft for up to three months The FCA also said that consumers using any of these measures should not see their credit rating affected. FCA interim chief executive Christopher Woolard said: ""If confirmed, the package of measures we are proposing today will help provide affected consumers with the temporary financial support they need to help them weather the storm during this challenging time."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Some lenders have already put measures in place to assist people hit by the financial impact of the outbreak, but Martin Lewis, founder of Moneysavingexpert, described the picture as a ""banking lottery"". If approved, these proposals would bring a level playing field for borrowers. However, they would still need to contact their bank to access the help, rather than just stopping repayments. ""If you're struggling to afford interest and debt repayments, don't assume any of these things are in place until it's confirmed by your bank. If you just halt payments without confirmation, you may end up being chased for payments and having charges added to your debt,"" said Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. These are emergency rules to make sure that people who are affected by the crisis don't fall through the cracks. They could make a big difference because customers can apply for help knowing that the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - is on their side. Banks have already put their own measures in place to help families who are hit by a sudden loss of income. But their concessions vary and some don't match up to the level of protection that the FCA wants to see. On top of that, the new guidance stretches across a wide range of lending, from bank loans to catalogue credit. Customers still need to be aware that interest charges might build up in the background and have to be paid later on. But on overdrafts, the stop-gap regime is clear: you can request to pay zero interest for three months. This could make a big difference because it comes just as most big banks are introducing overdraft rates of nearly 40%. Contacting banks can be frustrating at present, with long queues, but information is also available on lenders' websites and some are offering online applications for help. Apart from the zero interest on Â£500 of arranged overdrafts, firms would be entitled to charge a ""reasonable rate of interest"" when a customer requested a repayment holiday on loans, credit cards, and store cards. Mr Lewis said: ""Payment holidays mean exactly what they say - you don't pay, but you can still be charged interest. And with interest rates often high, especially on cards, that can mean storing up trouble for future. ""Those struggling for cashflow may have no choice, but if you don't need to do it, don't."" Banks are already offeringthree-month mortgage repayment holidaysfor some struggling customers. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, which represents banks and other lenders, said: ""It is critical that the FCA's proposals do not disrupt the provision of credit to borrowers and takes account of the business models of all credit providers including those outside the mainstream market."" Mr Jones said that lenders have been receiving a record number of calls but have also faced staffing pressures. He urged customers to check their lender's website first to see if it answers their question, and consider getting in touch via online chat, social media and online banking and mobile apps.

Should more of us wear face masks?Experts are set to assess the value of face masks in helping slow the spread of coronavirus.Science & Environment,"Should more of us wear face masks to help slow the spread of coronavirus? This question is to be assessed by a panel of advisers to theWorld Health Organization (WHO).,external The group will weigh up research on whether the virus can be projected further than previously thought; a study in the US suggests coughs can reach 6m and sneezes up to 8m. The panel's chair, Prof David Heymann, told BBC News that the new research may lead to a shift in advice about masks. The former director at the WHO explained: ""The WHO is opening up its discussion again looking at the new evidence to see whether or not there should be a change in the way it's recommending masks should be used."" The WHO recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m from anyone coughing or sneezing to avoid the risk of infection. It says people who are sick and show symptoms should wear masks. Who should be wearing masks? US considers cloth face masks for public But it advises that healthy people only need to wear them if they are caring for others suspected of being infected or if they themselves are coughing or sneezing. The new research suggests coughs and sneezes might project liquid further than previously thought It emphasises that masks are only effective if combined with frequent hand-washing and used and disposed of properly. The UK, along with other countries including the US, advises that social distancing should mean staying at least 2m apart. This advice is based on evidence showing that viruses can only be transmitted while carried within drops of liquid. The understanding is that most of those drops will either evaporate or fall to the ground near to the person who released them. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, used high-speed cameras and other sensors toassess precisely what happens after a cough or sneeze.,external They found that an exhalation generates a small fast-moving cloud of gas that can contain droplets of liquid of varying sizes - and that the smallest of these can be carried in the cloud over long distances. The study - conducted in laboratory conditions - found that coughs can project liquid up to 6m away and that sneezes, which involve much higher speeds, can reach up to 8m away. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The scientist who led the study, Prof Lydia Bourouiba of MIT, told me that she is concerned about the current concept of ""safe distances"". ""What we exhale, cough or sneeze is a gas cloud that has high momentum that can go far, traps the drops of all sizes in it and carries them through the room,"" she said. ""So having this false idea of safety at one to two metres, that somehow drops will just fall to the ground at that distance is not based on what we have quantified, measured and visualised directly."" Prof Bourouiba's view is that in certain situations, especially indoors in poorly ventilated rooms, wearing masks would reduce the risks. For example, when facing someone who's infected, masks could help divert the flow of their breath and its load of virus away from your mouth. ""Flimsy masks are not going to protect from inhaling the smallest particulates in the air because they do not provide filtration,"" Prof Bourouiba said. ""But they would potentially divert the cloud that is being emitted with high momentum to the side instead of forward."" Prof Heymann said that masks needed to be worn consistently According to Prof Heymann, the new research from MIT and other institutions will be evaluated because it suggests that droplets from coughs and sneezes could be projected further than originally thought. He said that if the evidence is supported, then ""it might be that wearing a mask is equally as effective or more effective than distancing."" But he adds a warning that masks need to be worn properly, with a seal over the nose. If they become moist, Prof Heymann explained, then particles can pass through. People must remove them carefully to avoid their hands becoming contaminated. He adds that masks need to be worn consistently. ""It's not on to wear a mask and then decide to take it off to smoke a cigarette or eat a meal - it must be worn full time,"" he said. The panel, known as the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards, is due to hold its next virtual meeting in the next few days. A spokesperson for Public Health England said there was little evidence of widespread benefit from wearing masks outside clinical settings. ""Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good universal hygiene behaviour in order for them to be effective. ""Research also shows that compliance with these recommended behaviours reduces over time when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods."" Masks have long been in use across Asia Long popular in many countries in Asia, masks are now being assessed for public use by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In Austria, the police now wear them and anyone dealing with the police will have to wear one too. Supermarkets there will insist that customers do too. A once-rare sight in Europe is becoming more common, and new advice from the WHO would accelerate that change.

Should the UK use drones to disinfect public spaces?A group is calling for a change in regulation so drones can spray disinfectant in public places,"An XAG drone flown over a children's play park in China A group of drone experts is calling on the UK government to relax regulations on chemical spraying from the air during the coronavirus pandemic. It wants to train drone pilots from the emergency services to spray public areas with disinfectant. It has been done in China and India - but aerial spraying is largely banned in Europe. The drones can cover large areas - but there is debate around whether the method is effective. The Department of Health and Social Care said there were no plans to disinfect outside on a large scale. ""The expert advice is that disinfecting outdoor spaces would not be an effective use of resources,"" a spokesman said. ""We want to focus our efforts and resources on measures which have been recommended by scientific experts to have the most benefit in protecting the NHS and saving lives."" At the moment, Public Health England advises decontamination only where there has been a possible or confirmed case of the virus. The Health and Safety Executive did not comment. The Civil Aviation Authority, which oversees drone flight safety, said it was not involved in the decision. Drone pilots would be more protected than people walking the streets or driving vans with spray equipment, because they would be further away, said Jonathan Gill, from Harper Adams University, in Shropshire, who has spent four years researching spray drones used on farm crops in several countries outside of Europe. ""The spray drones would keep people away from dull, dirty, dangerous jobs,"" he said.

Chinese Investment Connections director Robert Pearson, who has been working with Chinese company XAG, which says its drones disinfected over 902 sq km (350 square miles) in 20 provinces of China, said: ""It's not one solution - but it's an important part of the arsenal."" ""A drone can spray 600,000 sq m a day - that's the equivalent of 100 workers."" Last month, DJI announced it had adapted its agricultural drones to spray disinfectant over 3 sq km in the city of Shenzhen, including ""factories, residential areas, hospitals, and waste treatment plants"". But this month, a spokesman told BBC News: ""The effectiveness of using drones for spraying disinfectant is still being tested"".

"Big Issue sellers struggle for cash in lockdownWith street sales banned, the homeless magazine's sellers have lost their income.","Big Issue sellers have lost their income with the end of street sales Big Issue sellers, forced off the streets by the coronavirus lockdown, are relying on emergency bailouts being provided by the magazine. Lord Bird, founder of the magazine, which helps the homeless earn a living, says many have been left in a ""parlous state"" without an income. He says sellers and the magazine are unable to get government support for lost earnings during the crisis. So the Big Issue is giving sellers cash from online sales and subscriptions. The ban on street selling has threatened to take away the regular earnings of its vendors. ""I genuinely don't know what I'm going to do, I really don't,"" says Robin Price, in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, who has been selling the magazine for 26 years. Will Adams says selling the Big Issue was his only income Apart from providing an income, Robin says selling the magazine helps his mental health. ""I'm going to miss my customers,"" he says. ""I'll miss the banter."" Meanwhile, Simon Gravell, a vendor in Norwich, fears it will ""put me back to where I was 10 years ago, sleeping rough"". In a bid to ensure the Big Issue survives the lockdown, the magazine has switched to subscriptions and online sales. This income will be distributed to sellers, including those who have been put into temporary accommodation for the homeless. Rough sleepers given accommodation in coronavirus outbreak Safe places needed for homeless to self-isolate The homeless people stranded by the pandemic And for the first time, the Big Issue will also be on sale in shops, including Sainsbury's and McColl's. Lord Bird says there would usually be 1,500 to 2,000 street sellers over the course of a year. The magazine has made contact with about 1,000 of these. Lord Bird says the magazine has to survive through the lockdown And they will be given cash, vouchers or top-ups for electricity and gas during the weeks when no street sales are possible, including by digital transfer. Billions have been promised by the government to support those employed or self-employed whose incomes have disappeared because of the coronavirus shutdown. But Lord Bird says the sellers, who operate as independent traders, are unlikely to have the financial records needed by the self-employed to get assistance. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

""I now have to go through the universal credit route, which is really hectic as you can imagine. ""I hate the fact I have to go back on benefits, as I have been working for a while now."" Simon Gravell fears he might have to return to rough sleeping Lord Bird says the magazine will carry on being independent and promoting self-reliance - under the principle of a ""hand up, not a handout"".

Big Issue sellers struggle for cash in lockdown,"Big Issue sellers have lost their income with the end of street sales Big Issue sellers, forced off the streets by the coronavirus lockdown, are relying on emergency bailouts being provided by the magazine. Lord Bird, founder of the magazine, which helps the homeless earn a living, says many have been left in a ""parlous state"" without an income. He says sellers and the magazine are unable to get government support for lost earnings during the crisis. So the Big Issue is giving sellers cash from online sales and subscriptions. The ban on street selling has threatened to take away the regular earnings of its vendors. ""I genuinely don't know what I'm going to do, I really don't,"" says Robin Price, in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, who has been selling the magazine for 26 years. Will Adams says selling the Big Issue was his only income Apart from providing an income, Robin says selling the magazine helps his mental health. ""I'm going to miss my customers,"" he says. ""I'll miss the banter."" Meanwhile, Simon Gravell, a vendor in Norwich, fears it will ""put me back to where I was 10 years ago, sleeping rough"". In a bid to ensure the Big Issue survives the lockdown, the magazine has switched to subscriptions and online sales. This income will be distributed to sellers, including those who have been put into temporary accommodation for the homeless. Rough sleepers given accommodation in coronavirus outbreak Safe places needed for homeless to self-isolate The homeless people stranded by the pandemic And for the first time, the Big Issue will also be on sale in shops, including Sainsbury's and McColl's. Lord Bird says there would usually be 1,500 to 2,000 street sellers over the course of a year. The magazine has made contact with about 1,000 of these. Lord Bird says the magazine has to survive through the lockdown And they will be given cash, vouchers or top-ups for electricity and gas during the weeks when no street sales are possible, including by digital transfer. Billions have been promised by the government to support those employed or self-employed whose incomes have disappeared because of the coronavirus shutdown. But Lord Bird says the sellers, who operate as independent traders, are unlikely to have the financial records needed by the self-employed to get assistance. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

And it has been trying to help sellers get universal credit support - but that can mean delays. Will Adams, who sells the magazine in Exeter, says: ""My life has been affected drastically, as the Big Issue was my only income. ""I now have to go through the universal credit route, which is really hectic as you can imagine. ""I hate the fact I have to go back on benefits, as I have been working for a while now."" Simon Gravell fears he might have to return to rough sleeping Lord Bird says the magazine will carry on being independent and promoting self-reliance - under the principle of a ""hand up, not a handout"". ""We've never taken any government money, always relied on the marketplace,"" says Lord Bird, a former rough sleeper himself. And he is determined the magazine's ""spirited club of solidarity"" will return to the streets after the lockdown.

"Testing will 'unlock coronavirus puzzle', PM says","Drive-through testing sites for some NHS staff have opened in southern England Health officials say they are ""frustrated"" by a lack of progress in expanding UK coronavirus testing. Prof Paul Cosford of Public Health England (PHE) said ""everybody involved"" was unhappy testing had not ""got to the position yet that we need to get to"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson responded to criticism of the UK's strategy by hailing screening as a solution to ""unlock the puzzle"" of coronavirus. It came as a further 569 patients died with coronavirus in UK hospitals. As of 17:00 BST on Wednesday, the overall number of deaths with the virus in the UK was 2,921. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr Johnson, who continues to suffer mild symptoms during self-isolation in Downing Street after contracting the virus himself, has faced widespread criticism over his government's testing strategy. Around 13,000 tests are available each day against a target of 25,000. Prof Cosford said testing would hit 15,000 per day ""imminently"" and that PHE had played its part in ensuring tests were ""available to support clinical treatment of patients who need it"". The government has confirmed that 2,800 NHS frontline staff out of half a million in England have been tested for coronavirus since the outbreak began. Prof Cosford, PHE's emeritus medical director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the figure was ""nowhere near where we need to get to but it's a good start"". Meanwhile, Labour MP Dawn Butler said her uncle died after contracting coronavirus in hospital following a fall. ""Government needs to test everyone who works in the hospitals without delay,""she wrote on Twitter,external. And Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti said the slow pace of testing showed ""a lack of clarity of what the plan is and how it is going to be executed"". Can I get tested for coronavirus? Boots staff safety fears as shoppers keep browsing Shoppers confused over what 'essential items' are Sir Paul Nurse, chief executive of the Francis Crick research institute - which will soon be able to conduct 500 Covid-19 tests a day - said a Dunkirk-style effort was needed to co-ordinate smaller laboratories and increase test numbers. ""We are a lot of little boats and the little boats can be effective,"" he said, referring to the evacuation of Allied troops from the beaches of the French city during World War Two. He added: ""The government has put some big boats, destroyers in place. That's a bit more cumbersome to get working and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well."" The daily figures for the number of new cases, deaths and tests virtually mirror those released yesterday. At this stage, when we are on an upwards trajectory, the fact that there has not been significant increases in terms of cases and deaths can perhaps be interpreted as a good sign. But what is more important is the trend over a few days - not 24 hours in isolation. Any improvement will be seen in the number of new cases first. They were hovering around the 2,500 to 3,000 mark in the five days up to yesterday. Then the number of new cases jumped to over 4,300, which has been nearly matched today. There will be hope that this is where it plateaus, before dropping down. In a video message on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson said that increased screening would be how the UK defeats the coronavirus. ""I want to say a special word about testing, because it is so important, and as I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through,"" he said. ""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end."" This video can not be played The PM posted a video message on Twitter on Wednesday evening Mr Johnson said more coronavirus testing would enable staff who were self-isolating - either because they had symptoms or shared a household with someone who was sick - to know if they were safe to work. Antibody tests - which look for signs of immunity in the blood - could also show who had already had coronavirus and was therefore not at risk of being infected or passing the infection on to others, the prime minister said. However, these tests are not yet ready for use and it is not clear when they will be. The prime minister's official spokesman said more than 2,800 people had been tested at drive-through sites and a ""significant number"" additionally in NHS and Public Health England laboratories, with an update expected later. The spokesman confirmed that two laboratories, in addition to one in Milton Keynes, were being set up in Cheshire and Glasgow to process tests in the North of England and Scotland. An NHS coronavirus drive through test centre is already in place at Chessington World of Adventures car park Ambulance workers outside the Nightingale Hospital at the Excel centre in London Health Secretary Matt Hancock has held talks with industry figures, issuing what his department said was a ""rallying call"" to improve diagnostic capability. However, some NHS trusts have said they are limited in the number of tests they can carry out due to continued shortages of swabs, reagents and testing kits. Despite there being capacity for 12,799 daily tests in England, there were only 10,657carried out on Wednesday.,external As of 09:00 on 2 April, 163,194 people in the UK had been tested for the virus, of which 33,718 were confirmed positive. Meanwhile, Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge has become the first in the UK to use a new, much quicker Covid-19 test for staff and patients. Called Samba Two, it gives a result in just 90 minutes - as opposed to the 24 hours tests currently take - and has been adapted from an HIV test by a small Cambridge technology company. Businessman and philanthropist Sir Chris Hohn, who is helping make the test more widely available, told the BBC it could be a ""game-changer"" in helping hospitals cope with the crisis.

NHS 111 has 1.7m queries in 15 days,"In the past 15 days, NHS 111 has responded to more than 1.7 million inquiries from people concerned they might have symptoms of coronavirus. About 1.5 million were web-based assessments, while the rest were calls to the 111 phone number or 999. People who think they have symptoms - a fever or a new, continuous cough - should use the online service and call only if they cannot get help online. The NHS Digital data is not based on outcomes of tests for coronavirus. And the numbers do not represent individual people - it is possible some have sought help more than once or via various channels. Meanwhile, the government faces growing criticism over a lack of testing for front-line staff who could return to work if found clear of the virus. On Tuesday, Cabinet Office MinisterMichael Gove admitted the UK had to go ""further, faster"" to increase testing. It came as a13-year-old boy from south London with coronavirus died. Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, from Brixton, is thought to be the youngest reported victim of the disease in the UK. The total recorded number of UK deaths with coronavirus in hospitals now stands at 2,352, 563 more than yesterday. The Department of Health says 29,474 people have tested positive for the virus, up 4,324 since Tuesday.

"PM vows more virus tests as UK deaths exceed 2,000Following criticism, Boris Johnson says the government is ""massively increasing"" coronavirus testing.","NHS workers have been tested at a drive-through site at an Ikea store in Wembley, north London The government is facing growing pressure to ramp up coronavirus testing, as the UK saw its biggest daily increase in deaths. Some 2,352 virus patients had died in hospital as of 17:00 on Tuesday - up 563 in a day,the latest figures show,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said testing was ""massively increasing"" and it was ""the way through"" the pandemic. Meanwhile a major international climate meeting,COP26, is the latest event to be postponed as a result of the virus. The climate talks were due to take place at Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus in November - which is being turned into a temporary field hospital to treat coronavirus patients. The UN's climate body, the UNFCCC, and the UK government said the summit would be pushed back to 2021. Ina video message posted on Twitter,external, the prime minister said Wednesday had been a ""sad, sad day"" due to the high number of deaths in the UK. Mr Johnson, who is self-isolating in Downing Street after contracting the virus, also reiterated the government's commitment to ""ramp up"" testing. He said: ""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end."" The government has been under pressure to increase the screening of medics, so that those who are self-isolating unnecessarily can return to work. More than 3,500 NHS frontline staff in England and Wales have been tested for the virus since the outbreak began. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said a shortage of chemicals needed for the tests meant the NHS - which employs 1.2m in England - could not screen all workers. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was working with NHS England, Public Health England and other organisations to boost test capacity with an additional network of labs and testing sites. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England medical director, told a daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street that there was currently capacity for about 3,000 tests a day for frontline NHS staff. She said the ""intention"" was for testing for frontline staff to increase from ""thousands to hundreds of thousands within the coming weeks"". The World Health Organization has said the world is set to reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide in the next few days. Dr Doyle said the UK was not in ""as severe"" a position as Spain, the US or Italy, but added there was ""no reason to be complacent"". She said while the spread of the virus was most advanced in London, the Midlands was ""obviously a concern"" too. As of 9:00 on Wednesday, 152,979 people in the UK had been tested for the virus with 29,474 confirmed positive. This includes 4,139 cases in the Midlands and 8,341 in London. Dr Doyle added while use of public transport had gone down since the government enforced social distancing measures, an ""up-tick"" in motor vehicle use in the last 24 hours was ""slightly concerning"". She urged members of the public to stay home to ""protect the NHS"". The number of questions about the lack of testing at the daily press conference came as no surprise. The government has been heavily criticised for not increasing testing capacity more quickly. Dr Doyle said she was confident the UK would achieve the target of 25,000 tests a day by the end of the month. There is some way to go - over the past 24 hours just shy of 10,000 tests have been done. The lack of tests means NHS staff have had to self-isolate at home when members of their household show symptoms. News that there are going to be five drive-through centres for staff will also help. But it was interesting Dr Doyle was also asked by how much more testing can be increased by in the long-term. If the number of cases does come down, testing will play a crucial role in allowing the lockdown to be eased. The plan would be to contain the virus by testing lots of people quickly. That will require the UK to be able to tests hundreds of thousands of people a day. A doctor who came out of retirement to volunteer for the NHS has become the fourth UK medic to die with the virus, which causes the disease Covid-19. Dr Alfa Sa'adu, 68, had been volunteeringat Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn when he contracted coronavirus. His son Dani Saadu posted online that his dad had died after ""fighting the virus for two weeks"". ""My dad was a living legend, worked for the NHS for nearly 40 years saving people's lives here and in Africa,"" he said. The BBC's head of statistics Robert Cuffe said the latest increases in the number of patients dying with coronavirus balance out with the below-average rises on Sunday and Monday. How to understand the coronavirus death toll He said the number of new deaths has been increasing at a slightly slower rate than earlier in the epidemic, ""but if that keeps up, we'd expect to see in the region of a thousand deaths a day by the weekend"".

The prime minister's official spokesperson said the government was working with a number of suppliers which had come forward with offers of PPE, or proposals to manufacture more. It follows criticism from some frontline workers over the lack of protective equipment, with staff at one hospital in Essexwarning they could ""limit services""to patients with coronavirus ""to a bare minimum"" over fears for their own safety.
