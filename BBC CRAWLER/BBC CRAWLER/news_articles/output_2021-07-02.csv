"NHS worker killed at random by gang, court hears","David Gomoh graduated with a marketing degree from London South Bank University An NHS worker was stabbed to death by gang members who were selecting targets at random in a ""petty but fatal game of one-upmanship"", a court has heard. David Gomoh, 24, was attacked seconds after leaving his home in Canning Town, east London, on 26 April 2020. He was killed days after his father had died with coronavirus. Muhammad Jalloh, 19, David Ture, 19, Vanei Colubali, 22, and a 17-year-old boy from Telford, Shropshire, all deny murder. The Old Bailey heard that the group, members of the Northsides Newham Gang, chose Mr Gomoh at random to send a message to the Custom House and Beckton gangs. Mr Gomoh had no links to any gang. Before the killing, the defendants had tried to attack another man in the same area who managed to escape, the court heard. Mr Gomoh, who worked in supply and procurement for the NHS, suffered catastrophic injuries in the attack, on Freemasons Road. He managed to get to his feet and stumble the short distance home, the jury was told. He eventually bled to death in front of his family. In the seconds before the attack, Mr Gomoh had been on the phone to his girlfriend. The court was told she heard someone demand: ""Where are you from?"", followed by the sounds of a struggle. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC said Mr Gomoh was chosen because ""he had the misfortune to live in an area of London that is frequented by rival gangs"". He described them as ""rival gangs who are involved in a violent feud with each other, rival gangs who like to attack each other, and rival gangs who like to brag about the devastation they have wrought upon each other"". Mr Jalloh, from Cambridge, Mr Ture and Mr Colubali, both of no fixed address, also deny conspiracy to cause GBH in connection with an earlier incident. The trial continues.

Belarus closes border to Ukraine over coup claim,"President Lukashenko claims his security forces uncovered ""terrorist sleeper cells"" Belarus has closed its border with Ukraine, claiming that arms are being smuggled into the country. President Alexander Lukashenko says it is part of an attempt by outside powers to overthrow his authoritarian regime. Mr Lukashenko claimed - without providing proof - that his security services had uncovered a foreign-backed terrorist sleeper cells plotting to oust him from power. ""They have crossed the line. We cannot forgive them,"" he said. He alleged the weapons were being shipped to terrorist cells funded by Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and the US. ""A huge amount of weapons is coming from Ukraine to Belarus. That's why I ordered border-security forces to fully close the border with Ukraine,"" Mr Lukashenko said, at a ceremony marking the country's 30 years of independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union. He said he would confront Germany's Angela Merkel and other leaders about the claims. Ukraine denied interfering in Belarus's domestic affairs and said closing the 1,084-km (674-mile) border would make its people ""suffer"". Belarus shares a border with Ukraine in the south. It borders Poland and Lithuania in the west, Latvia in the north, and Russia in the east. Belarus plane: What we know and what we don't Could tougher European action hurt Belarus? The move deepens a standoff between Belarus and outside powers.

Vauxhall set to build electric van at Ellesmere Port,"Stellantis owns Vauxhall, which makes cars and vans in Ellesmere Port The owner of Vauxhall could announce as early as next week plans to build electric vans at its Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire, the BBC understands. The investment, said to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds, would safeguard about 1,000 factory jobs. The future of the plant had been in doubt after Vauxhall's parent company, Stellantis, scrapped plans to build a new Astra model there. Nissan this week said it will make new electric cars at its Sunderland plant. Stellantis has been discussing options for the site with the UK government for several months, and is known to have been seeking financial support for its plans. Sales of vans have been booming during the pandemic, as a result of growing home delivery sales. Making vans may not be particularly glamorous, but right now it makes a lot of sense. While car sales have been badly affected by the pandemic, demand for smaller commercial vehicles has been soaring, due to the home delivery boom. Fleet operators are increasingly turning to low-emission options because of the tax advantages they provide. For Carlos Tavares, the pragmatic and outspoken CEO of Stellantis, it offers a useful compromise. He has been scathing about the UK government's plans to outlaw the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 - accusing them of destroying his company's business model in the UK. Now there is a new business model - and with Mr Tavares having previously made it clear that future production in the UK would depend on what support the government could offer, it's likely help from the taxpayer will be part of it. Stellantis is the world's fifth-largest car maker and also owns Peugeot, Fiat and Chrysler. The push into electric vehicle manufacturing has grown since the UK and other European countries announced a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars as of 2030. Nissan on Thursday announced a major expansion of electric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs. The Japanese carmaker will build its new-generation all-electric model at the site as part of a Â£1bn investment that will also support thousands of jobs in the supply chain. And Nissan's partner, Envision AESC, will build an electric battery plant.

US officer plays Taylor Swift to try to block video,"The officer played Taylor Swift's song Blank Space A US police officer played a Taylor Swift song on his phone in a bid to prevent activists who were filming him uploading the video to YouTube. The video platform regularly removes videos that break music copyright rules. However, the officer's efforts were in vain as the clip of the encounter in Oakland, California promptly went viral. Alameda County police told the BBC it was not ""approved behaviour"". The video was filmed by members of the Anti Police-Terror Project (APTP), which says it is a coalition that seeks to ""eradicate police terror in communities of colour"". Some of them were protesting outside the courthouse atthe pre-trial hearing of a San Leandro officer charged with the manslaughter,externalof a black man. In the video, the officer says: ""You can record all you want, I just know it can't be posted to YouTube."" When asked if playing music in this way is procedure, the officer responds: ""It's not specifically outlined."" Later in the video, he confirms: ""I'm playing music so that you can't post on YouTube."" The sheriff's department said: ""We have seen the video and referred it to our internal affairs bureau. This is not approved behaviour. It will not happen again."" The video, which was posted on 1 July, has had more than 180,000 views and remains online. It is also visible on the APTP's Twitter page.

Queen Victoria and Elizabeth II's statues toppled,"This video can not be played Watch: Statue of Queen Victoria toppled in Winnipeg, Canada A prominent statue of Queen Victoria has been torn down by protesters in Canada as anger grows over the deaths of indigenous children at residential schools. The protesters cheered as the statue at the legislature in Manitoba's capital Winnipeg was toppled on Thursday. A smaller statue of Queen Elizabeth II was also upended nearby. Local media say police used a stun gun to arrest a man at the scene but the protest was largely peaceful. Ten churches vandalised in Alberta on Canada Day The toppling of the statues came on Canada Day, an annual celebration on 1 July that marks the country's founding by British colonies in 1867. The recent discoveries of unmarked indigenous Canadian graves at residential schools hadprompted calls for national celebrations to be called off. A statue of Queen Elizabeth II was also torn down The British government condemned the toppling of the two statues. ""We obviously condemn any defacing of statues of the Queen,"" a spokesman said. ""Our thoughts,"" the spokesman added, ""are with Canada's indigenous community following these tragic discoveries and we follow these issues closely and continue to engage with the government of Canada with indigenous matters."" Around 750 graves found at Canada residential school Why Canada is mourning the deaths of 215 children More churches burn down on Canada indigenous land More than 150,000 indigenous Canadian children were taken from their families and forced to attend the schools during the 19th and 20th Centuries with the aim of forcibly assimilating them into society. An estimated 6,000 children died while attending these schools. Students were often housed in poorly built, poorly heated and unsanitary facilities. Municipalities across Canada cancelled celebrations and statues of figures involved with residential schools have been vandalised or removed. In Winnipeg, thousands took to the streets to honour victims of residential schools and rally support for indigenous communities. A group of protesters staged a rally against the treatment of indigenous children at Canada's residential schools The statue was torn down on Canada Day, a national holiday that marks the country's founding A group of protesters had marched on the Manitoba Legislature as part of a demonstration against the deaths of indigenous Canadian children at residential schools. Monarch of the UK, Canada and other territories from 1837 until her death in 1901, Queen Victoria was on the throne during the founding of the Canadian confederation. The British Crown negotiated treaties with indigenous First Nations in Canada and the government enacted its residential schools policy during her reign. At the protest in Winnipeg, the statue of Queen Victoria was daubed in red paint while a sign saying ""we were children"" was left nearby. Allow Twitter content?

A survivor of a residential school, Belinda Vandenbroeck,told Canadian broadcaster CBC,externalshe felt no remorse about the toppling of the statue, which she had had no part in. ""She [Queen Victoria] means nothing to me except that her policies and her colonialism is what is dictating us right to this minute as you and I speak,"" Ms Vandenbroeck said. Symbols of empire, colonialism and slavery have been targeted by protesters at demonstrations against racial injustice across the globe in the past year. Those demonstrations exploded worldwide following the death of African-American man George Floyd in May 2020. The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Last year, several prominent statues of Confederate leaders and slave owners were torn down and vandalised in the US, generating heated debate about monuments. Similar scenes were seen in the UK, whereBlack Lives Matter demonstrators tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colstonand threw it into a harbour during a protest in the city of Bristol.

PM confident of no problem over India jab travel,"Boris Johnson has said he is ""very confident"" there ""will not prove to be a problem"" for travellers who have received an Indian-made Covid jab. It comes after reports the European Union's passport scheme does not recognise the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India. The UK's medicines regulator has shared its data on the jab with its European counterpart, Downing Street said. Vaccine expert Prof Adam Finn said the vaccines were ""exactly the same stuff"". TheDaily Telegraph had reported,externalthat millions of people who have received doses from batches manufactured in India could face being blocked from taking European holidays. The UK has receivedfive million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute, which manufactures the jab under the name Covishield - although that name is not used in the UK. The Serum Institute has not received approval to make the Covid jab from the European drugs regulator but has been cleared by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). However, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said all AstraZeneca vaccines administered in the UK would appear under the brand name Vaxzevria - the same as the AstraZeneca jab produced elsewhere - on the NHS Covid Pass. It said ""no Covishield jabs have been administered in the UK"". On Friday the UK recorded 27,125 new cases of coronavirus and a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Could your AZ jab stop you going on holiday? Covid infections rising, but vaccines saving lives Currently the EU is rolling out a Digital Covid Certificate so travellers can prove their vaccination status in order to be exempt from quarantining when crossing an international border. A European Commission spokesman said that while entry to the EU should be allowed to those who are fully vaccinated with EU authorised jabs, member states could make their own decision on whether to allow entry for people vaccinated with jabs on the World Health Organization's emergency list - which includes Covishield. Several European countries havealready approved the Covishield jab for travel. These include Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Iceland and Switzerland. At the moment the EU does not accept the UK's NHS app for Covid certification but a UK government spokesman said it will be ""a key service"" as international travel is reopened. Individual countries including Greece and Spain do accept it. With batch numbers being visible via the UK's Covid pass it is not clear if officials EU countries could check if a person had received a dose originating in India. Earlier, Downing Street said the MHRA had shared its assessment of the vaccines with its European counterpart - the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - to assist the approvals process. During a press conference with German Chancellor Angel Merkel, the UK prime minister, Mr Johnson, said he saw ""no reason at all"" why MHRA-approved vaccines should not be used for vaccine passports. Mrs Merkel said that ""in the foreseeable future"" those with double jabs in high incidence areas, like Britain,""will be able to travel again without having to go into quarantine"". The Serum Institute is reportedlyseeking emergency authorisation from Europefor the Covishield jab, which has widely been distributed in poorer countries as part of the Covavax scheme. AstraZeneca also says it is working with the EMA on the ""inclusion of Covishield as a recognised vaccine for immunisation passports"" - although the EMA says there is currently no application for market authorisation. Prof Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme people should not be worried that they were any less protected by the Covishield jab and said the ""administrative hurdle"" should be ""straightened out"". ""We're in the early days of this new world of needed vaccine passports and there are lots of aspects of this that are still being sorted out for the first time,"" he said. ""But it's clearly, ultimately not in anyone's interest, including the European Union, to create hurdles that don't need to be there.""

"PM confident of no problem over India jab travelThe UK regulator has shared data on the Covishield jab with its European counterpart, No 10 says.HealthComments","Boris Johnson has said he is ""very confident"" there ""will not prove to be a problem"" for travellers who have received an Indian-made Covid jab. It comes after reports the European Union's passport scheme does not recognise the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India. The UK's medicines regulator has shared its data on the jab with its European counterpart, Downing Street said. Vaccine expert Prof Adam Finn said the vaccines were ""exactly the same stuff"". TheDaily Telegraph had reported,externalthat millions of people who have received doses from batches manufactured in India could face being blocked from taking European holidays. The UK has receivedfive million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute, which manufactures the jab under the name Covishield - although that name is not used in the UK. The Serum Institute has not received approval to make the Covid jab from the European drugs regulator but has been cleared by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). However, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said all AstraZeneca vaccines administered in the UK would appear under the brand name Vaxzevria - the same as the AstraZeneca jab produced elsewhere - on the NHS Covid Pass. It said ""no Covishield jabs have been administered in the UK"". On Friday the UK recorded 27,125 new cases of coronavirus and a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Could your AZ jab stop you going on holiday? Covid infections rising, but vaccines saving lives Currently the EU is rolling out a Digital Covid Certificate so travellers can prove their vaccination status in order to be exempt from quarantining when crossing an international border. A European Commission spokesman said that while entry to the EU should be allowed to those who are fully vaccinated with EU authorised jabs, member states could make their own decision on whether to allow entry for people vaccinated with jabs on the World Health Organization's emergency list - which includes Covishield. Several European countries havealready approved the Covishield jab for travel. These include Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Iceland and Switzerland. At the moment the EU does not accept the UK's NHS app for Covid certification but a UK government spokesman said it will be ""a key service"" as international travel is reopened. Individual countries including Greece and Spain do accept it. With batch numbers being visible via the UK's Covid pass it is not clear if officials EU countries could check if a person had received a dose originating in India. Earlier, Downing Street said the MHRA had shared its assessment of the vaccines with its European counterpart - the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - to assist the approvals process. During a press conference with German Chancellor Angel Merkel, the UK prime minister, Mr Johnson, said he saw ""no reason at all"" why MHRA-approved vaccines should not be used for vaccine passports. Mrs Merkel said that ""in the foreseeable future"" those with double jabs in high incidence areas, like Britain,""will be able to travel again without having to go into quarantine"". The Serum Institute is reportedlyseeking emergency authorisation from Europefor the Covishield jab, which has widely been distributed in poorer countries as part of the Covavax scheme. AstraZeneca also says it is working with the EMA on the ""inclusion of Covishield as a recognised vaccine for immunisation passports"" - although the EMA says there is currently no application for market authorisation. Prof Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme people should not be worried that they were any less protected by the Covishield jab and said the ""administrative hurdle"" should be ""straightened out"". ""We're in the early days of this new world of needed vaccine passports and there are lots of aspects of this that are still being sorted out for the first time,"" he said. ""But it's clearly, ultimately not in anyone's interest, including the European Union, to create hurdles that don't need to be there.""

"NHS worker killed at random by gang, court hearsDavid Gomoh died because he had the misfortune to live in an area frequented by gangs, a jury hears.London","David Gomoh graduated with a marketing degree from London South Bank University An NHS worker was stabbed to death by gang members who were selecting targets at random in a ""petty but fatal game of one-upmanship"", a court has heard. David Gomoh, 24, was attacked seconds after leaving his home in Canning Town, east London, on 26 April 2020. He was killed days after his father had died with coronavirus. Muhammad Jalloh, 19, David Ture, 19, Vanei Colubali, 22, and a 17-year-old boy from Telford, Shropshire, all deny murder. The Old Bailey heard that the group, members of the Northsides Newham Gang, chose Mr Gomoh at random to send a message to the Custom House and Beckton gangs. Mr Gomoh had no links to any gang. Before the killing, the defendants had tried to attack another man in the same area who managed to escape, the court heard. Mr Gomoh, who worked in supply and procurement for the NHS, suffered catastrophic injuries in the attack, on Freemasons Road. He managed to get to his feet and stumble the short distance home, the jury was told. He eventually bled to death in front of his family. In the seconds before the attack, Mr Gomoh had been on the phone to his girlfriend. The court was told she heard someone demand: ""Where are you from?"", followed by the sounds of a struggle. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC said Mr Gomoh was chosen because ""he had the misfortune to live in an area of London that is frequented by rival gangs"". He described them as ""rival gangs who are involved in a violent feud with each other, rival gangs who like to attack each other, and rival gangs who like to brag about the devastation they have wrought upon each other"". Mr Jalloh, from Cambridge, Mr Ture and Mr Colubali, both of no fixed address, also deny conspiracy to cause GBH in connection with an earlier incident. The trial continues.

Man charged with assault over Whitty incident,"Estate agent Lewis Hughes in video footage from the incident on Sunday evening A man has been charged with common assault after England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty was accosted by a group of men in a London park. Lewis Hughes, 23, of Wigton Way in Romford, east London, was charged on Thursday over the incident, which took place on Sunday, the Met Police said. Officers spoke to the victim, who had not suffered any injuries, and checked his welfare, the force added. They then reviewed video footage that emerged later. Mr Hughes was charged by postal requisition and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 30 July. ""At approximately 19:20hrs on Sunday, 27 June officers in St James's Park became aware of a man being accosted by a group of men,"" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. ""Officers subsequently reviewed video footage which emerged after the incident and the matter was referred to the Public Order Crime Team. Enquiries continue."" A video of the incident had been widely shared on social media. Chris Whitty: The man with our lives in his hands BBC Radio 4 - Profile, Prof Chris Whitty Mr Hughes previously apologised for any ""upset"" caused and said he had lost his job as an estate agent over the incident. ""If I made [Prof Whitty] feel uncomfortable, which it does look like I did, then I am sorry to him for that,"" he told the Sun. Police previously said that when they spoke to Prof Whitty at the time he did not wish to make any allegations. It was not the first time Prof Whitty has been filmed being confronted by a member of the public. Earlier this month, a man in Oxford accused him of lying to the public about coronavirus, while in February a man accosted the chief medical officer in Westminster. And a group of people gathered outside what was apparently Prof Whitty's London flat on Saturday, chanting and shouting. Prof Chris Whitty (left) has regularly appeared alongside the PM at televised Covid briefings Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, he has been front and centre of the UK's decision-making and communication of messages to the public. He took on the chief medical officer role in October 2019, and until the coronavirus threat emerged, had never done broadcast interviews or held press briefings or conferences. One of the country's foremost experts in infectious diseases, he has worked as a doctor in Africa and Asia, as well as the UK. He continues to practise medicine at University College London Hospitals, where he was spotted doing a shift over Christmas. His mother was a teacher and his father was a diplomat who was murdered by terrorists in Greece after they flagged him down in his car in 1984.

Concern over boosters as GPs 'already stretched',"All adults aged 50 and over in the UK are likely to be eligible for a third booster dose of a Covid vaccine in the autumn GPs in Scotland are concerned about delivering Covid booster jabs as they are working ""beyond full capacity"". Older age groups could receive the third vaccine when they see their GP for a flu jab ahead of winter. But the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) in Scotland said there was a risk in balancing boosters with seeing other vulnerable patients. The Scottish government said it would work with GPs and health boards to plan the programme in line with advice. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) gave the NHS the green light tostart planning a booster programme, advising that they will give additional protection against new variants before winter. More than 30 million of the most vulnerable should receive a third dose, including all adults aged 50 and over, and anyone younger who qualifies for a flu jab. Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch told the BBC the JCVI was trialling whether GPs could give boosters to older people attending flu vaccine appointments. However, Dr David Shackles, who jointly chairs RCGP Scotland, said general practice had been expressing serious concerns about the ""already stretched workforce"" for some time. He said: ""General practice is already working beyond full capacity and GPs have had unprecedented demand for appointments due to backlog. ""We understand the risk is balancing the need to vaccinate those requiring flu and Covid-19 boosters against requirement to see patients with acute problems and chronic illnesses that they may have put off dealing with during the height of the pandemic."" Dr Shackles reiterated calls for ""urgent action"" to boost the workforce, adding that GPs would work hard to make sure all patients could access the vaccine. Covid cases in Scotland surpass 4,000 for first time NHS plans booster jab for those 50 and over Tayside patient numbers almost double overnight Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The Scottish government said it welcomed the advice from the JCVI and would offer the booster to priority groups from September. A spokeswoman said: ""The committee will consider additional scientific data as it becomes available over the next few months, ahead of formulating final advice. ""In the meantime we will work closely with NHS boards and GPs to plan for this potential booster campaign, in line with this interim advice."" It comes as Scotland's daily Covid casessurpassed 4,000 for the first timesince mass testing began. Third wave cases began to surpass January's peak towards the end of June. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously said the government would monitor the impact cases had on hospital admissions - which rose from from 235 on Wednesday to 275 on Thursday. Scotland's largest health boards have said it is ""too early"" to share plans for a future booster programme. However, NHS Lothian confirmed it was looking to use some current mass centres alongside additional, more localised venues. NHS Tayside said it planned to continue its blended model of using GP surgeries and local centres. Prof Jason Leitch told BBC Scotland that plans could involve younger age groups using pharmacies, mass vaccination centres or mobile vaccination units. He said: ""It's one of the reasons why the joint committee have given us early notice - so we can work that out in consultation with GP practices and [health] boards whether we need to keep some of our mass vaccination centres. ""One of the things they've said and are doing trials about this is, can we give it at the same time as the flu vaccine? That would be very convenient. So everybody who gets the flu vaccine already on the same visit could also have a Covid vaccine. ""Companies are even working on putting the two vaccines into the one vial - they haven't done that quite yet but the first trials of giving the two vaccines together suggest [they are] both safe and effective. That will continue over the summer."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What rules are changing, and when? CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

Germany hopes to open up for double-jabbed Britons,"This video can not be played Angela Merkel says Germany will relax the need for quarantine rules for some travellers Double-jabbed people should be able to travel from the UK to Germany without quarantining ""in the foreseeable future"", Angela Merkel has said. The German chancellor said her country was ""continuously reviewing"" its Covid travel restrictions, after meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Johnson said he thought progress was being made on the issue. Mrs Merkel is visiting the UK in her final official trip as chancellor. What are the UK's travel rules? In a press conference following their talks at Chequers, the prime minister's Buckinghamshire residence, the two leaders spoke about trade and post-Brexit relations. The chancellor was then asked when Britons who have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine should expect to be able to travel to Germany. She said Germany had adopted restrictions in response to the Delta variant, which she said was now spreading ""very rapidly"" in her country. ""But as you know we are reviewing continuously our travel restrictions and we think that in the foreseeable future those who have received double jabs will then, according to our classification - and now Britain obviously is a high incidence area - will be able to travel again without having to go into quarantine,"" she said. ""At the beginning we didn't have much experience with this variant but we're dealing with it,"" she added. ""And that is a continuous learning process... we have to adjust time and again to the most recent developments."" Mrs Merkel, who is due to step down later this year, also met the Queen at Windsor Castle. And she addressed a meeting of the UK cabinet - the first foreign leader to do so since President Clinton in 1997, although on this occasion the meeting was a virtual one. Mrs Merkel's comments about travel mark a change in tone. Last week said she wanted other countries to follow Germany's lead by introducing tougher restrictions for UK travellers because of concerns about the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. Since May, travellers from the UK have been banned from entering Germany,aside from a few limited exceptions,external. Those who are allowed in from the UK must quarantine for 14 days. However, Mrs Merkel did express ""grave concern"" about the numbers of football fans attending Euro 2020 matches at Wembley Stadium, and said she had outlined this during their talks. ""We in Germany, as you know, have less people attend games in the Munich stadium but the British government will obviously take its own decision,"" she said. ""But I am very much concerned whether it is not a bit too much."" Mr Johnson said sporting events were being opened up in a ""very careful and controlled manner"" and that vaccinations had built up a ""very considerable wall of immunity"" in the UK. He is expected to announce the latest steps towards ending lockdown in England in the next few days, with international travel high on the agenda. The talks followreports that the European Union's passport schemedoes not recognise doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India known as Covishield. Mr Johnson said during the press conference he was ""very confident"" that there ""will not prove to be a problem"" for travellers who have received these jabs. On Friday, the UK recorded 27,125 new Covid cases and a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. More than 85% of UK adults have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and more than 63% are fully vaccinated,according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external ""YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON YOUR FACE"":An inside look into unregulated training in aesthetics 36 HOURS TO AVOID HOMELESSNESS:Mother-of-four Rosie tries to keep her family afloat PM confident of no problem over India jab travel What are the UK's travel rules?

UK shares India jab data with EU amid travel fears,"Boris Johnson has said he is ""very confident"" there ""will not prove to be a problem"" for travellers who have received an Indian-made Covid jab. It comes after reports the European Union's passport scheme does not recognise the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India. The UK's medicines regulator has shared its data on the jab with its European counterpart, Downing Street said. Vaccine expert Prof Adam Finn said the vaccines were ""exactly the same stuff"". TheDaily Telegraph had reported,externalthat millions of people who have received doses from batches manufactured in India could face being blocked from taking European holidays. The UK has receivedfive million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute, which manufactures the jab under the name Covishield - although that name is not used in the UK. The Serum Institute has not received approval to make the Covid jab from the European drugs regulator but has been cleared by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). However, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said all AstraZeneca vaccines administered in the UK would appear under the brand name Vaxzevria - the same as the AstraZeneca jab produced elsewhere - on the NHS Covid Pass. It said ""no Covishield jabs have been administered in the UK"". On Friday the UK recorded 27,125 new cases of coronavirus and a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Could your AZ jab stop you going on holiday? Covid infections rising, but vaccines saving lives Currently the EU is rolling out a Digital Covid Certificate so travellers can prove their vaccination status in order to be exempt from quarantining when crossing an international border. A European Commission spokesman said that while entry to the EU should be allowed to those who are fully vaccinated with EU authorised jabs, member states could make their own decision on whether to allow entry for people vaccinated with jabs on the World Health Organization's emergency list - which includes Covishield. Several European countries havealready approved the Covishield jab for travel. These include Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Iceland and Switzerland. At the moment the EU does not accept the UK's NHS app for Covid certification but a UK government spokesman said it will be ""a key service"" as international travel is reopened. Individual countries including Greece and Spain do accept it. With batch numbers being visible via the UK's Covid pass it is not clear if officials EU countries could check if a person had received a dose originating in India. Earlier, Downing Street said the MHRA had shared its assessment of the vaccines with its European counterpart - the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - to assist the approvals process. During a press conference with German Chancellor Angel Merkel, the UK prime minister, Mr Johnson, said he saw ""no reason at all"" why MHRA-approved vaccines should not be used for vaccine passports. Mrs Merkel said that ""in the foreseeable future"" those with double jabs in high incidence areas, like Britain,""will be able to travel again without having to go into quarantine"". The Serum Institute is reportedlyseeking emergency authorisation from Europefor the Covishield jab, which has widely been distributed in poorer countries as part of the Covavax scheme. AstraZeneca also says it is working with the EMA on the ""inclusion of Covishield as a recognised vaccine for immunisation passports"" - although the EMA says there is currently no application for market authorisation. Prof Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme people should not be worried that they were any less protected by the Covishield jab and said the ""administrative hurdle"" should be ""straightened out"". ""We're in the early days of this new world of needed vaccine passports and there are lots of aspects of this that are still being sorted out for the first time,"" he said. ""But it's clearly, ultimately not in anyone's interest, including the European Union, to create hurdles that don't need to be there.""

PM discusses travel curbs with Merkel on UK visit,"The talks are taking place at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence PM Boris Johnson is discussing Covid travel restrictions with Angela Merkel in her final official visit to the UK as German chancellor. Mrs Merkel, who is due to step down later this year, has previously called for all UK travellers to Europe to face quarantine. Trade and post-Brexit relations are also on the agenda. The chancellor arrived at Chequers, the prime minister's Buckinghamshire residence, earlier for the talks. She will also meet the Queen at Windsor Castle and address a meeting of the UK cabinet - the first foreign leader to do so since President Clinton in 1997, although on this occasion the meeting will be a virtual one. Last week Mrs Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, said she wanted other countries to follow Germany's lead by introducing tougher restrictions for UK travellers because of concerns about the Delta variant. Since May, travellers from the UK have been banned from entering Germany,aside from a few limited exceptions,external. Those who are allowed to arrive from the UK must quarantine for 14 days. Mr Johnson is expected to announce the latest steps towards ending lockdown in England in the next few days, with international travel high on the agenda. In contrast to Mrs Merkel, he said on Thursday that double vaccinations could be a ""liberator"" as millions of people plan their summer breaks. PM upbeat about easing restrictions on 19 July Whatâs happening with the plan to end Covid restrictions? The pair will dine on an three-course meal featuring British produce including an English asparagus tart and Oxfordshire beef fillet during a working lunch. Ahead of the chancellor's visit, Mr Johnson said: ""The UK and Germany have a steadfast friendship and a shared outlook on many issues."" He is expected to announce the creation of an annual Â£10,000 award for a UK or Germany-based female scientist who has excelled in the field of astrophysics. The two leaders greeted with an elbow bump ""Our scientists, innovators and industrialists work together every day to make the world a better place,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Over the 16 years of Chancellor Merkel's tenure the UK-Germany relationship has been re-energised and reinvigorated for a new era. ""And the new joint ventures we will agree will leave a legacy that will last for generations."" The visit will be Mrs Merkel's 22nd to the UK since taking office and is one of a series of farewell trips, with US President Joe Biden among those expected to host her later in the summer. She and Mr Johnson last met at the G7 summit in Cornwall in June.

Last foreign forces quit Afghanistan's Bagram base,"Afghan soldiers guarded Bagram on Friday The last US and Nato forces have left Afghanistan's Bagram airbase, the centre of the war against militants for some 20 years, US officials say. The pull-out could signal that the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is imminent. President Joe Biden has said US forces will be gone by 11 September. But the withdrawal from the sprawling base, north of Kabul, comes as the main jihadist group, the Taliban, advances in many parts of Afghanistan. In pictures: Two decades of the US at Bagram base Who are the Taliban? How can the West fight terror after leaving Afghanistan? A year of violence on the road to peace The 11 September deadline is the anniversary of the attacks on America in 2001, which killed nearly 3,000 people. The attacks were carried out by al-Qaeda, an international jihadist group then based in Afghanistan with the support of the Taliban, who had been in control of the country since the 1990s. A US-led coalition invaded Afghanistan later that year to defeat both groups. This video can not be played Biden deflects questions on Afghanistan, ""I want to talk about happy things."" America now wants to end its longest war with its huge cost in human lives and vast expense, and is leaving security to the Afghan government. Some 2,500-3,500 US troops were thought to be still in Afghanistan until recently and when they depart, fewer than 1,000 American soldiers will remain. As of May there were about 7,000 other coalition troops in Afghanistan but it is believed that most have now left, with Germany and Italy declaring their missions over on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a resurgent Taliban, buoyed by the expectation of the foreign withdrawal, has overrun dozens of districts, amid fears that a new civil war could erupt after the departure of foreign forces. Bagram is a bellwether of what's to come. This symbol of American military might was once a stronghold of Soviet forces. Now Afghan security forces will soon confront the challenge of securing this sprawling city within a city. Bagram is vital - in symbolic and strategic ways. Taliban fighters, advancing in districts across the country, have this prize in their sights. Even last October, residents of the town which has swelled all around it told us the Taliban were already in their midst. On a recent visit to the base, as the US packed up, we heard how Afghan security forces saw it as a mixed blessing. There's a wealth of military assets within its walls; but that treasure is a top target for Taliban, not to mention corrupt commanders and others eying this fortune. For the countless Afghans whose lives and livelihoods have long banked on this base - and who now feel abandoned - Bagram's new chapter is deeply worrying. At the White House on Friday, Mr Biden defended the withdrawal as ""a rational drawdown with our allies, so there is nothing unusual about it"". But as reporters pressed him, he told them: ""I'm not going to answer any more questions about Afghanistan."" Glancing down at his lectern, he said he wanted to celebrate the 4 July holiday weekend, adding that ""all across America people are going to ball games and doing good things"", and he would instead answer the ""negative questions"" of media next week. Asked by another journalist about Afghanistan, he said: ""I want to talk about happy things, man."" His spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a daily press briefing: ""We expect it [the withdrawal] to be completed by the end of August."" The airfield lies around 40km (25 miles) north of Kabul and is named after a nearby village. Your device may not support this visualisation It was built up by Moscow when the former Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s. US-led coalition forces moved in during December 2001, and it was developed into a huge base capable of holding up to 10,000 troops. New York City firefighters and police were flown in to bury a piece of rubble from the World Trade Center, destroyed in the 9/11 attacks, on the territory of the base. A piece of World Trade Center rubble was buried in the frozen ground of the base in December 2001 It is served by two runways, the most recent of which is 3.6km long, where large cargo and bomber aircraft can land. It has 110 parking spots for aircraft,external, which are protected by blast walls, and had a 50-bed hospital with a trauma bay, three operating theatres and a modern dental clinic, the Associated Press reports. This video can not be played From May 2021: Top US commander General Scott Miller reflects on Nato forces' time in Afghanistan ahead of its departure Its hangars and buildings included the main prison facility for people detained by US forces at the height of the conflict, which became known as Afghanistan's Guantanamo - after the infamous US military prison in Cuba. Bagram was one of the sites identified in a US Senate report on the CIA's interrogation of al-Qaeda suspects, including the use of torture, carried out in detention facilities. Bagram ex-detainees say they still bear the scars The top US commander in Afghanistan, General Austin Scott Miller, met President Ashraf Ghani to discuss ""continued US assistance and co-operation"", the president's office said in a tweet on Friday. About 650 US troops are expected to remain in the country, the Associated Press reports, to provide protection for diplomats and help guard Kabul's international airport, a vital transport hub for the landlocked country. They are guarding the airport alongside troops from America's Nato ally Turkey, while a new agreement for its security is negotiated with the Afghan government. The airport's US protection includes a counter-rocket, artillery, mortar system and the troops to operate it, as well as helicopter support. Other American troops will guard the US Embassy in Kabul. How much has the Afghanistan war cost the US? Military analysts say the ability of the Afghan government to maintain control over Bagram will be vital to its efforts to defend Kabul and push back the Taliban. ""Henceforth the Afghan army forces will protect it and use it to combat terrorism,"" Afghan defence ministry spokesman Fawad Aman tweeted on Friday. The Taliban stopped attacks on coalition forces after signing an agreement with the US in February of last year, when they also promised to end co-operation with international jihadist groups. But the militants have continued fighting government forces. Every morning brings fresh reports of overnight fighting, the BBC's South Asia editor, Jill McGivering, says. Battles between the Taliban and government forces in Herat, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Paktia are all making news. Some reports suggest June saw some of the worst violence since the arrival of the coalition, with hundreds of lives lost. And hard-won development is under threat too with many schools, government buildings and power pylons now damaged or destroyed. These wounded Afghan soldiers were rescued by helicopter north of Kandahar last month A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, welcomed the US withdrawal from Bagram, telling AFP news agency it would ""pave the way for Afghans to decide about their future between themselves"". The war is thought to have taken the lives of more than 47,000 Afghan civilians and nearly 70,000 Afghan troops, as well asthe lives of 2,442 US soldiers and more than 3,800 US private security contractors,external, and 1,144 soldiers from other coalition countries. The Costs of War project at Brown University, which analyses America's wars this century, estimates thatthe war has cost America a total of $2.26tn,external(Â£1.64tn). From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.

PM discusses travel curbs with Merkel on UK visitThe German chancellor has previously suggested all UK travellers to Europe should have to quarantine.UK Politics,"The talks are taking place at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence PM Boris Johnson is discussing Covid travel restrictions with Angela Merkel in her final official visit to the UK as German chancellor. Mrs Merkel, who is due to step down later this year, has previously called for all UK travellers to Europe to face quarantine. Trade and post-Brexit relations are also on the agenda. The chancellor arrived at Chequers, the prime minister's Buckinghamshire residence, earlier for the talks. She will also meet the Queen at Windsor Castle and address a meeting of the UK cabinet - the first foreign leader to do so since President Clinton in 1997, although on this occasion the meeting will be a virtual one. Last week Mrs Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, said she wanted other countries to follow Germany's lead by introducing tougher restrictions for UK travellers because of concerns about the Delta variant. Since May, travellers from the UK have been banned from entering Germany,aside from a few limited exceptions,external. Those who are allowed to arrive from the UK must quarantine for 14 days. Mr Johnson is expected to announce the latest steps towards ending lockdown in England in the next few days, with international travel high on the agenda. In contrast to Mrs Merkel, he said on Thursday that double vaccinations could be a ""liberator"" as millions of people plan their summer breaks. PM upbeat about easing restrictions on 19 July Whatâs happening with the plan to end Covid restrictions? The pair will dine on an three-course meal featuring British produce including an English asparagus tart and Oxfordshire beef fillet during a working lunch. Ahead of the chancellor's visit, Mr Johnson said: ""The UK and Germany have a steadfast friendship and a shared outlook on many issues."" He is expected to announce the creation of an annual Â£10,000 award for a UK or Germany-based female scientist who has excelled in the field of astrophysics. The two leaders greeted with an elbow bump ""Our scientists, innovators and industrialists work together every day to make the world a better place,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Over the 16 years of Chancellor Merkel's tenure the UK-Germany relationship has been re-energised and reinvigorated for a new era. ""And the new joint ventures we will agree will leave a legacy that will last for generations."" The visit will be Mrs Merkel's 22nd to the UK since taking office and is one of a series of farewell trips, with US President Joe Biden among those expected to host her later in the summer. She and Mr Johnson last met at the G7 summit in Cornwall in June.

"Asda to allow permanent hybrid working for officesThe supermarket says most of its 4,000 head office staff can choose to work at home or other locations.BusinessComments","Asda has announced it will make hybrid working permanent at its head offices once Covid restrictions are lifted. The supermarket group said staff at Asda House in Leeds and George House in Leicester can choose where they work. Around 4,000 staff work at both offices, with the majority based in Leeds. England is set to lift final Covid measures on 19 July and many businesses have indicated they will continue to allow flexible working. However, not all companies plan to embrace a hybrid approach. Goldman Sachs International has said it wants people to come back into the office once restrictions have ended. Asda said its new approach ""will encourage colleagues to select the best location to do their job"", including home, head office or even a store or depot. Covid: Should I be working from home or going back to the office? How do you feel about going back to the office? Goldman Sachs delays return to office for workers When employees have meetings or training, they will be encouraged to come into the office. But Asda said staff also ""have the flexibility to work from home when it is more productive to do so, such as tasks that involve planning or research"". Asda's plan is similar to oneadopted by Nationwide, which will allow the building society's 13,000 office employees to ""work anywhere"". Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon and the 3,000 staff based at those sites can either move to the nearby headquarters, work from home or mix the two. Some employees may be able to work from a local High Street branch if they prefer, instead of travelling to an office. Jacki Simpson, Asda's vice president of people operations, said: ""We have learned a great deal about working patterns during the last 16 months and have seen colleagues work productively across different locations."" She said the retailer had consulted with staff about how they wanted to work in the future. ""We know they welcome the increased flexibility of remote working,"" she said. ""However, they also acknowledge there is some work that is simply better done from the office, so as we move forward a hybrid working model is the right approach for our people and the business.""

His
offence? Speaking Russian in a post-match interview. Ukrainian
and Russian are both widely spoken in Ukraine, but prolonged tensions between
the two countries have built to the point where such things can be
controversial. An
official in charge of Ukraine's language law, Taras Kremin, said athletes are required to speak Ukrainian at public
appearances. But
while some agreed with the criticism, many saw it as an unnecessary dampener on
Dovbykâs footballing heroics. Ukrainian journalist Roman Burko said the language issue is
important, but should not be used to devalue Ukrainians' joy in
the victory over Sweden - ""a joy that unites Ukrainian citizens with very
different political preferences, who speak different languages"". And after nine years with Chelsea, Victor Moses has completed a permanent transfer to Spartak Moscow.

Ciaran Varley Back in Spain, Lionel Messi is officially out of work and a few teams - not all of them serious - have already tried to get him to sign for them. The world's (arguably) greatest player officiallybecame a free agent on Thursdayas his contract with Barcelona expired. That means he's available for nothing. Nada. Gratis. Among his suitors, one would have to imagine that clubs such as Manchester City, Paris St-Germain and possibly an Italian giant like Juventus or Inter Milan may be interested in trying to lure the six-time Ballon d'Or winner. On the other hand, the 34-year-old Argentine may well end up signing a contract extension to stay at the Nou Camp. In the meantime, there have been some rather unserious attempts to gain his signature. Ciaran looks at some of themright here. Switzerland v Spain (17:00 BST) This will be the first meeting between Switzerland and Spain at the Euros. Their three previous meetings in a major tournament came in the 1966, 1994 and 2010 World Cups, with Spain winning the first two and Switzerland triumphing last time out. Spain have lost just one of their 22 meetings with Switzerland in all competitions, with that defeat coming in their opening game of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Gelson Fernandes scored the game's only goal to give the Swiss victory against the then-European champions, but Spain went on to win the World Cup for the first time. Switzerland v Spain (17:00 BST) BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Now let's take a look at what the Swiss media are saying ahead of their big game. La Tribune de Geneve,externalkeeps it simple by asking, can Switzerland really beat Spain? ""Having reached this phase of the Euros
for the very first time, Switzerland is being carried by an unstoppable wind that blows to
unite all the cantons behind their âNatiâ (national team). Switzerland isnât
afraid of anything anymore.â Le Temps,externalhave also kept it pretty simple but less optimistic. They've compared the challenge of playing Spain like climbing Mount Everest. âSwitzerland may have

'only Devils with daring can defeat the Azzurri, with or without Kevin de Bruyne and Eden Hazard'. Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) This is the fifth meeting between the sides at a major tournament, with Italy winning three of the previous four encounters. Belgium reached the quarter-final stage at the last Euros in 2016, when they were knocked out by Wales. They've looked good since though, having lost just one of their last 27 games. The last time these two sides met was in the group stage at Euro 16,  with Italy coming out on top 2-0. The Azzurri are currently on a 31-game unbeaten run. Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) Belgium are sweating on the fitness of Kevin de Bruyne and Eden Hazard. Both came off during their win over Portugal in the last 16 and although boss Roberto Martinez said they could still play a part against Italy in Munich, they arenot expected to be ""100%"" fit. The headline in Belgium'sGazet van Antwerpenreads 'the state secret: is De Bruyne playing?'  Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) Simon GleaveHead of sports analysis, Gracenote ""Belgium are estimated to have around a 60% chance of progressing to the Euro 2020 semi-finals, according to the Gracenote forecasting model. ""Belgium moved to number one on our world ranking after their win against Portugal and Brazil's draw with Ecuador at the Copa America. Belgium began Euro 2020 as our pre-tournament favourites and were given a 14.1% chance of winning. They are currently second favourites behind England due to the latter's more favourable draw and potential home advantage in the last two rounds. Belgium's chance of winning Euro 2020 has increased to 24%. ""Italy began Euro 2020 ranked seventh in the world by Gracenote but they have subsequently risen to fourth. They were our fifth favourites before the tournament started with a 9.1% chance of winning Euro 2020. This has risen to 12.5%. Italy's long unbeaten run has only included one match against Gracenote's current top-10 teams, a draw against Portugal in 2018. While Italy's results have been impressive over the past three years, Belgium are a very different level of opposition to the teams they have beaten in that time.""

Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) La Gazzetta dello Sportfeatures the full Italy squad and says âWe are Italy:

Former Switzerland defenderStephane Henchozadded: ""It's even more difficult without Granit Xhaka because of his
leadership, the captain. ""We wonât be able to replace him with somebody similar,

while some agreed with the criticism, many saw it as an unnecessary dampener on
Dovbykâs footballing heroics. Ukrainian journalist Roman Burko said the language issue is
important, but should not be used to devalue Ukrainians' joy in
the victory over Sweden - ""a joy that unites Ukrainian citizens with very
different political preferences, who speak different languages"". And after nine years with Chelsea, Victor Moses has completed a permanent transfer to Spartak Moscow.

Kidd has been part of the backroom team at City for 12 years, having initially joined as technical development manager before becoming assistant manager when Roberto Mancini joined the club in 2009. The 72-year-old has worked under Manuel Pellegrini and Pep Guardiola and was recently praised by striker Liam Delap for the work he has done with him. Kidd has been a familiar figure in Manchester football for over 50 years, having been part of the United side that beat Benfica in the 1968 European Cup final. He also played for City, amongst others. ""It has been a privilege to be part of such an exciting chapter in this club's history,"" he said. Before we head off for the day, here's a note to let you know that Manchester football legend Brian Kidd, who helped United win their first European Cup in 1968 and played for City from 1976-79, has left City's coaching staff.

Ciaran Varley Back in Spain, Lionel Messi is officially out of work and a few teams - not all of them serious - have already tried to get him to sign for them. The world's (arguably) greatest player officiallybecame a free agent on Thursdayas his contract with Barcelona expired. That means he's available for nothing. Nada. Gratis. Among his suitors, one would have to imagine that clubs such as Manchester City, Paris St-Germain and possibly an Italian giant like Juventus or Inter Milan may be interested in trying to lure the six-time Ballon d'Or winner. On the other hand, the 34-year-old Argentine may well end up signing a contract extension to stay at the Nou Camp. In the meantime, there have been some rather unserious attempts to gain his signature. Ciaran looks at some of themright here. Switzerland v Spain (17:00 BST) This will be the first meeting between Switzerland and Spain at the Euros. Their three previous meetings in a major tournament came in the 1966, 1994 and 2010 World Cups, with Spain winning the first two and Switzerland triumphing last time out. Spain have lost just one of their 22 meetings with Switzerland in all competitions, with that defeat coming in their opening game of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Gelson Fernandes scored the game's only goal to give the Swiss victory against the then-European champions, but Spain went on to win the World Cup for the first time. Switzerland v Spain (17:00 BST) BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Now let's take a look at what the Swiss media are saying ahead of their big game. La Tribune de Geneve,externalkeeps it simple by asking, can Switzerland really beat Spain? ""Having reached this phase of the Euros

Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) This is the fifth meeting between the sides at a major tournament, with Italy winning three of the previous four encounters. Belgium reached the quarter-final stage at the last Euros in 2016, when they were knocked out by Wales. They've looked good since though, having lost just one of their last 27 games. The last time these two sides met was in the group stage at Euro 16,  with Italy coming out on top 2-0. The Azzurri are currently on a 31-game unbeaten run. Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) Belgium are sweating on the fitness of Kevin de Bruyne and Eden Hazard.

Belgium began Euro 2020 as our pre-tournament favourites and were given a 14.1% chance of winning.

Belgium's chance of winning Euro 2020 has increased to 24%. ""Italy began Euro 2020 ranked seventh in the world by Gracenote but they have subsequently risen to fourth. They were our fifth favourites before the tournament started with a 9.1% chance of winning Euro 2020. This has risen to 12.5%. Italy's long unbeaten run has only included one match against Gracenote's current top-10 teams, a draw against Portugal in 2018.

"Labour is back after by-election win, says Starmer","This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""What a fantastic victory... of hope over division"" Sir Keir Starmer has declared ""Labour is back"" after the party held on at the Batley and Spen by-election. The Labour leader headed to the West Yorkshire constituency to celebrate Kim Leadbeater's narrow 323-vote win. He said it was a victory for ""hope over division, and decency over hatred"", after a bitter campaign, and ""just the start"" for Labour. Ms Leadbeater will now represent the seat previously held by her sister Jo Cox, who was murdered there in 2016. Sir Keir hailed her ""incredible courage"" in standing for the seat, and claimed ""Labour is coming home"". Writing in the Guardian,external, he also promised the by-election would be ""a turning point, a sign that the politics of division and dishonesty won't win out, that unity and decency can"". Kuennsberg: Is politics starting to return to normal? Fraught by-election concludes in dramatic fashion Who is new Batley and Spen MP Kim Leadbeater? Voters react to Batley and Spen by-election The result will come as a relief to Sir Keir, who has been under pressure following recent election defeats for his party. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Conservative candidate Ryan Stephenson ran an ""incredibly positive campaign"" and ""did very well to reduce a longstanding Labour majority"". Speaking at a Downing Street press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Mr Johnson claimed the by-election result was the ""third biggest swing in favour of the government since the War"". Ms Leadbeater took the seat with 13,296 votes, giving her a slim victory over Mr Stephenson with 12,973. Former Labour and Respect MP George Galloway, standing for the Workers Party of Britain party, came third with 8,264. The former Bradford West MP had sought to win support from the seat's Labour voters, with the aim of toppling Sir Keir as Labour leader. This video can not be played Kim Leadbeater MP: ''If I can be half the MP that Jo was, I know that I'll do her proud'' His campaign had targeted voters unhappy at the party's stance on issues including the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and the disputed territory of Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan. An ethnically diverse seat, about 20% of the population is from an Asian background, with just under 19% being Muslim. Speaking in Cleckheaton, Sir Keir said Ms Leadbeater had won despite a split in Labour's vote, because ""former Tory voters voted for her"". ""The Tories had a clean hit, nobody was going against them, and they didn't win,"" he added. Writing in the Guardian on Saturday, he said: ""And as we emerge from restrictions, there is now a real opportunity to harness the solidarity and national spirit that we've seen over the last year. ""To make sure that after the last year of sacrifice, we build a more united, fair, and secure country. ""To rebuild our economy and our public services, to bring our communities back together and to put honesty and integrity back at the heart of our politics."" Sir Keir was reportedly facing a potential challenge from his deputy Angela Rayner if the party lost another northern English constituency to the Tories. It comes after the Tories took Hartlepool, a once rock-solid Labour seat in May, alongside losing more than 300 councillors in England's local elections. But Andrew Scattergood, co-chair of the Momentum campaign set up to campaign for former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said the party could not ""portray this as a massive victory"". ""We squeaked it over the line and there are some serious concerns,"" he told the BBC News Channel. The Batley and Spen result will take some pressure off Sir Keir Starmer. The atmosphere in Labour circles at Westminster since May's local elections has been febrile. Some Labour MPs fear things can only get worse - that more seats that were once safe are at risk. There was a swing of nearly 3% from Labour to the Conservatives in Batley and Spen - if a similar swing was reproduced nationally, at a general election, Labour would have lost 11 seats. Labour know their party's problems go deeper than the question of leadership - but preparations were being made for a worse result in Batley and Spen. Read Iain's full analysis Sixteen candidates in total ran in the contest. Turnout was 47.6%, with 37,786 verified ballots cast out of a total electorate of 79,373. The vote was triggered after the previous Labour MP for the seat, Tracy Brabin, became West Yorkshire's first elected mayor in May. She first won the seat in a by-election after Ms Cox was murdered by a far-right extremist in Birstall, part of the constituency, in 2016. The Conservatives fought a relatively low-key campaign, with Mr Stephenson saying he was focused on talking to voters about ""the issues that matter here"". Conservative Party co-chair Amanda Milling said it had been a ""disappointing result"" for her party. She said therecent resignation of Matt Hancockas health secretary after breaking social distancing rules was ""one of a number of different issues that came up"" that had been raised by voters on the doorstep. But she added that for her party to ""run this close"" was still ""exceptional"", given it has been in government since 2010. Are you a Batley and Spen voter? How did you vote and why?

What result means for Starmer,"Jo Cox was killed in her constituency in 2016 Jo Cox is still held in high regard in Batley and Spen. Alighting at Batley station, there is a huge picture of her, helping volunteers clean up the platforms. The Labour MP's murder in nearby Birstall, in 2016, shocked the community. Her sister Kim Leadbeater is now the MP for the constituency, but her victory was far from guaranteed. Labour strategists were worried that rival candidate George Galloway would successfully sway South Asian voters, in particular, to lodge a protest vote, which they feared would have handed victory to the Conservatives. Mr Galloway amplified and played back to Muslim voters their concerns: that the Labour leadership had not spoken up enough for Palestinians during the recent hostilities in Gaza, and had not stood up for Kashmiris' aspirations for self-determination. Labour strategists also knew that the second defeat at a by-election in as many months -following the loss of Hartlepool- would inevitably call in to question Sir Keir Starmer's leadership - a scenario they wanted to avoid at all costs. Labour is back after by-election win, says Starmer Labour hold Batley and Spen seat in by-election Fraught by-election concludes in dramatic fashion The Batley and Spen result will take some pressure off Sir Keir. The atmosphere in Labour circles at Westminster since May's local elections has been febrile. Sir Keir hit the campaign trail to back Kim Leadbeater Some Labour MPs fear things can only get worse - that more seats that were once safe are at risk. There was a swing of nearly 3% from Labour to the Conservatives in Batley and Spen - if a similar swing was reproduced nationally, at a general election, Labour would have lost 11 seats. Labour know their party's problems go deeper than the question of leadership - but preparations were being made for a worse result in Batley and Spen. Angela Rayner did not sanction moves by her supporters, her aides say Some MPs on the party's left say they were being sounded out by supporters of deputy leader Angela Rayner, who were testing the level of backing for a leadership bid. Her aides say this was not officially sanctioned. It's unlikely that putsch will now come to shove. A leading MP on the left said: ""Angela is the real loser from this result."" Discussions had also been taking place about freeing up a seat for Andy Burnham, to allow the Manchester Metro Mayor to return to Westminster, according to one insider, although Mr Burnham himself was not involved in these moves. One shadow minister told me he viewed Mr Burnham as a possible leadership option, but he would wait to see how Sir Keir fought back over the coming months. If the party was ""in the same place next Spring"", and with the prospect of a 2023 election, ""we may have to act,"" he told me. Influential supporters and advisers to Sir Keir concede he now has to do more to convince the party that he is an agent of change. One of them told me: ""He is going to have a rocky time but he needs to come out fighting. ""The Labour brand is the problem. People are not yet ready to look again at Labour - he must commit himself, we must commit ourselves, to changing the party."" Labour sources say Sir Keir will, effectively, relaunch his leadership on Monday - with a ""bold address"" to the party's MPs and peers. But he will need to redouble efforts to make an impression with the voters as well as his own politicians. It was a closely-fought by-election I visited Batley before polling day to look at the candidates' campaign tactics - and how they were being received. This by-election was always going to be a major challenge for Labour. A Brexit-supporting independent candidate, Paul Halloran, got 6,432 votes at the 2019 general election. Labour had a majority of 3,525. So, as the Americans would say: do the math. With Mr Halloran opting not to stand at the by-election, the Conservatives were always the most likely beneficiaries. Labour saw a narrow road to victory - their task was to retain as many older, usually loyal, South Asian voters as possible by convincing them that a vote for George Galloway was in effect a vote for a Conservative MP. They also sought to convince as many former Labour voters who defected to the Conservatives that Kim Leadbeater was more of a community champion than a conventional politician. Labour was helped by the fact that Brexit was no longer a topic of heated doorstep discussions. The party may also have been aided byMatt Hancock's resignation, although campaigners say the former health secretary's Covid rule-breaking was rarely raised by voters. Instead, they fought a ""local campaign on local issues"". Kim Leadbeater was promoted as the only ""local candidate"" and her Conservative opponent, Ryan Stephenson, as an outsider, despite being a councillor in Leeds, less than a 15 minute train journey away. Batley was the scene of protest marches during the campaign Labour sought not just to win back Conservative defectors but to squeeze the small but potentially vital Liberal Democrat vote. Kim Leadbeater opposed the building of an Amazon warehouse on farmland in Cleckheaton, which has two Lib Dem councillors, arguing that green spaces should not be traded for jobs. Concerns over building on green spaces helpedthe Lib Dems overturn a large Conservative majorityin last month's Chesham and Amersham by-election. Labour were also fortunate that the Green Party candidate withdrew when historic, inappropriate tweets came to wider public attention. Labour also took a very targeted approach to campaigning, with a series of newsletters tailor-made for different towns in the constituency. So, the The Batley Local had Ms Leadbeater opposing fly-tipping, whereas the Heckmondwike Local trumpets a local council success - the building of the Spen Valley Leisure centre. Labour targeted local towns with tailor-made messages Labour insiders deny they were saying different things to different people - a common Labour complaint about Lib Dem by-election tactics - just that they were responding to local concerns. And local concerns, in particular the state of the roads, were a major factor. It is hard to believe that a pothole in Yorkshire had the potential to hole the Labour leadership at Westminster below the waterline - but Labour's campaigners acknowledged that this issue - along with traffic congestion - was raised more than any other. Households in the hilly area stretching from Perseverance Terrace down the main Dewsbury Road in Batley mainly come from a South Asian background - and they had been pressing for the roads to be resurfaced for years, they told me. When the by-election was called, some of the streets were suddenly improved - a development that was met with cynicism rather than gratitude, among the local residents. Some voters were suspicious when roads were repaired by the council Indeed, scepticism towards the local, Labour-led, Kirklees Council was so widespread, it was even getting the blame for events outside its control. The Conservatives expected to get flak for the closure of the local police station but Tory organisers admitted that it was helpful that George Galloway also seemed happier to put the council not the government in the frame. Labour had to work hard convince people that it was years of central government, Conservative austerity that was to blame - not neglect by the local council. And Labour pledged to build a new police station. Labour tried to counter George Galloway's presence in the South Asian community in a number of ways, including - at the most basic - ensuring MPs from an Asian background were very visible on the streets. Labour supporters from that community sent WhatsApp messages to friends in Batley and Spen pointing out what they saw as Mr Galloway's poor track record as an MP in nearby Bradford - where he defeated Labour at a by-election in 2012. George Galloway mounted a high-profile campaign Some of this seemed to strike a chord with older Muslim voters I spoke to before polling day. ""George Galloway is very good at chatting,"" Yunis, a businessman, told me. ""But, I ask, is he going to do the job? We have issues with Palestine but voting for him is a gamble."" Muzainah, a student, belongs to a generation that seems far less tribally loyal to Labour. She said: ""Palestine is important but I am looking at all aspects of this - and George is very good with the community."" Leaflet-after-Labour-leaflet stressed that ""this was a two horse race"". In other words, vote Galloway, get Boris Johnson's man. Labour tried to use the threat of the Tories getting in But one leaflet in particular stirred controversy within the Labour Party - it showed a picture of Boris Johnson with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu - in an apparent attempt to dog-whistle to Muslim voters. A spokesman for Keir Starmer defended the leaflet by saying it suggested to voters that the election of a Conservative MP would boost Boris Johnson, who hadn't spoken out on human rights abuses in Kashmir. And a letter from Kim Leadbeater stressed her and her party's commitment to a ""two state solution"" - a Palestinian state alongside Israel - in the Middle East. Labour's message on its Middle East policy Labour of course say they were the real victims of dirty tricks - from their candidate being harangued in the street by an opponent of gay rights, to fake leaflets purporting to be from trade unions - the provenance of which has not been established - suggesting that the party would not stand up for the concerns of white working class voters. The Conservative plan was to stay above the fray and the mud-slinging and try to give as few reasons to the electorate as possible to vote actively against them. Their candidate, Ryan Stephenson, wasn't invisible but his presence did feel ethereal and perhaps he needed to be more vocal when up against a passionate Labour candidate. Internal Conservative critics believe a bolder campaign may have produced a better result. Many of the attack lines against Labour were left to George Galloway to deliver. And Labour fought a more impressive ""ground war"" than their political enemies, with activists saying the ""get out the vote"" operation was run with military precision and more than 400 footsoldiers. Going door-to-door, I found very little hostility to Sir Keir Starmer personally. Nadeem Raja wanted to send a message to Labour But for some in the South Asian community, the prospect of unseating the Labour leader was a central motivating factor in the campaign Nadeem Raja runs the Indian Muslim Welfare Society and said he had supported Labour since moving to the UK from Pakistan in 1993 - but this time he had backed the Galloway campaign. 'I am not saying Jeremy Corbyn was an angel but his whole life it was clear what he stands for, his whole moral current. ""Our perception of Keir Starmer is he has no policies, no drive. He sits on the fence."" He added: ""We need to send a message to the Labour leadership, and other parties that Muslim votes matter."" Sir Keir clearly needs to improve relations with voters who feel alienated - but he has faced down an explicit attempt by George Galloway and some of his supporters to unseat him. A Labour source said that the contest was presented as a referendum on Sir Keir's leadership - and he won. In some ways, the Batley and Spen result should be unspectacular - simply holding a seat that had been Labour since 1997. But given the recent disappointing results in the English local elections - as well as Hartlepool - expectations were so low that simply holding on feels more like a gain.

Bloody Sunday: The victims,"Top row, left to right: Patrick ""Paddy"" Doherty, Gerald Donaghey, John ""Jackie"" Duddy, Hugh Gilmour, Michael Kelly, Michael McDaid, Kevin McElhinney. Bottom row, left to right: Bernard McGuigan, Gerard McKinney, William McKinney, William Nash, James Wray, John Young Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on marchers during a civil rights march in Londonderry on 30 January 1972. It became known as Bloody Sunday and these are the victims: Married father-of-six Patrick Doherty, known as Paddy, was 31 years old when he joined the march. He worked in the city's Du Pont factory and was an active member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. Mr Doherty died as he was trying to crawl to safety. In the Saville Report - a re-examination of the events of Bloody Sunday carried out by Lord Mark Saville and published in 2010 - said Mr Doherty was unarmed. The inquiry also found there was ""no doubt"" he was shot by Soldier F, who changed his story over the years. The Widgery Inquiry - announced the day after Bloody Sunday and chaired by Lord Widgery - largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame, although he described the soldiers' shooting as ""bordering on the reckless"". That earlier inquiry said that if the soldier had shot Mr Doherty in the belief he had a pistol, that belief was ""mistaken"". The 17year-old was a member of the IRA's youth wing, Fianna na Ãireann. He had become involved in the civil unrest and had been jailed for six months for rioting the year before. A police photograph taken shortly after he was pronounced dead showed a nailbomb in Mr Donaghey's pocket. A soldier later said he had found four nailbombs among Mr Donaghey's clothing. Widgery dismissed claims that the devices had been planted after death - saying nobody had offered any evidence to the contrary. But the Saville Inquiry heard that neither the soldier who first examined Mr Donaghey nor the Army medical officer who received him at an aid post had found anything suspicious when they checked the teenager. In conclusion, Saville found the nailbombs were ""probably"" on Mr Donaghey but said he was not preparing to throw them at the time nor was he shot because he was carrying them. The report said he was shot by Soldier G while trying to escape from the soldiers. One of a family of 15, the factory worker is thought to have been the first to be killed. The 17-year-old boxer, known a Jackie, had represented his club in bouts across Ireland and in Liverpool. He had attended the march ""for the craic"" with his friends and against his father's advice. The picture above shows a group of people carrying the dying teenager though the streets of Derry, lead by the then Fr (later Bishop) Edward Daly waving a bloodied handkerchief. It became one of the enduring images of Northern Ireland's Troubles. The Saville report concluded Mr Duddy was unarmed and ""probably"" shot by Soldier R, as he ran away from soldiers. Widgery said he had not been armed and was probably hit by a bullet intended for someone else. The 17-year-old was the youngest of eight children and a trainee tyre fitter. He was shot as he was running away from the soldiers in a crowd of up to 50 people. A woman said she heard him cry ""I'm hit, I'm hit"". A single bullet had struck him in the chest and arm. The teenager was pulled to safety behind a barricade but died shortly afterwards. Saville said Mr Gilmour was unarmed and Soldier U had fired at him as he ran away from the soldiers. Widgery concluded Mr Gilmour was not shot from behind and had probably been standing on a barricade when he was hit. The 17-year-old had been training to be a sewing machine mechanic and the march was his first taste of the civil rights movement. He went, his family said, because his friends were going. He was shot in the stomach near a barricade. He was carried to the safety of a house and died in an ambulance on the way to hospital. At Saville, Soldier F admitted that he had shot Michael Kelly - but said that he had only fired at people with bombs or weapons. However, Saville concluded Mr Kelly was unarmed. Widgery said forensic tests found firearms residue on Mr Kelly's right cuff and that indicated he was close to someone who was firing at the soldiers from the barricade. ""But I do not think that this was Kelly, nor am I satisfied that he was throwing a bomb at the time when he was shot,"" said Widgery. The second-youngest of a family of 12, the 20-year-old worked as a barman. Mr McDaid was arrested but then escaped out of the back of an Army vehicle before being shot near a barricade. Saville concluded that Mr McDaid was unarmed and he was shot by either Soldier P, Soldier J or Soldier E. Widgery could not identify who had fired the shot. Forensic tests found lead particles on Mr McDaid's jacket and right hand, and Widgery discounted the possibility that the clothing and body had been contaminated by residue from soldiers or their vehicles. The 17-year-old was the middle child of five and was described as a hardworking supermarket employee. He was shot as he tried to make his way to safety. Saville said Soldier L or Soldier M shot Mr McElhinney, who was ""unarmed"", as he crawled away from the soldiers. It suggests they probably did so on the orders of senior officers. Widgery said the firer was probably ""Sergeant K"". ""He described two men crawling from the barricade in the direction of the door of the flats and said that the rear man was carrying a rifle. He fired one aimed shot but could not say whether it hit. ""Sergeant K obviously acted with responsibility and restraint."" A 41-year-old married man with six children, Bernard McGuigan was a factory worker and handyman. Shot as he went to the aid of Patrick Doherty, Mr McGuigan was waving a white handkerchief as a single bullet struck the back of his head. He fell to the ground, beside a 19-year-old paramedic. ""He raised his hand in the air and shouted 'Don't shoot, don't shoot'. And seconds later he was just shot and landed in my lap."" Saville found there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot an unarmed Mr McGuigan. Widgery said forensic tests had found lead residue on his hands and a scarf, consistent with the cloth having been wrapped around a revolver that had been fired. His widow denied the scarf belonged to her husband, and Widgery concluded it was not possible to say whether Mr McGuigan was using or carrying a weapon. A father-of-eight whose youngest was born eight days after his death on Bloody Sunday and named after him. Mr McKinney managed a junior soccer team and ran the city's Ritz rollerskating rink. The 35-year-old was shot as he tried to make his way to safety. The Saville Report concluded Soldier G, a private, shot an ""unarmed"" Gerard McKinney. That bullet passed through him before hitting another victim, Gerald Donaghey. Widgery said his death was one of the most confusing episodes of the day and that forensic tests found no evidence that Mr McKinney had handled weapons. A printer at the Derry Journal newspaper, the 27-year-old was the oldest of 10 and was engaged to be married. A keen amateur photographer, he had set out to film the Bloody Sunday march on a camera he had received as a Christmas present. Like Gerald McKinney (no relation), he was in a group and was shot as he ran for cover. ""Willie was not a stone-thrower, a bomber or a gunman. He had gone to the civil rights march in the role of amateur photographer,"" said the newspaper's tribute to him. Saville said there were four soldiers -  E, F, G or H -  who could have fired at Mr McKinney and another victim, Jim Wray. Up to five more people were injured by the same group of soldiers. All four soldiers insisted they had shot at people carrying bombs or firearms - claims rejected by Saville. The Widgery report put William McKinney's death in the same category as Gerald McKinney - both men had been shot without justification. In March 2019, the Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. On 2 July 2021,it was announcedthe prosecution of Soldier F would not continue. Reviews of the cases were prompted by the collapse of the trial in Belfast of two other veterans for Troubles-era offences. The PPS said that given ""related evidential features"", it concluded ""there was no longer a reasonable prospect of key evidence in proceedings against Soldier F... being ruled admissible"". The 19-year-old dock worker was the seventh of 13 children and the brother of Olympic boxer Charlie Nash. Mr Nash was shot in the chest near a barricade. Alexander Nash saw his son being shot and went to help him, and was then shot himself. Saville concluded that shots fired by Soldier P, Soldier J and Soldier E, caused the deaths of William Nash, as well as victims Michael McDaid and John Young. The inquiry rejected claims that the three soldiers fired because the men were armed. Soldier P told Widgery that he had returned fire after a man consistent with Mr Nash's description had fired first. ""In view of the site of the injury it is possible that Soldier P has given an accurate account of the death of Nash,"" said the report. The 22-year-old had worked in England for some time and was engaged to an English girl. Friends said he was outgoing and worked in a city bar and dancehall at weekends. His entire family had attended the march after going to Mass together. Mr Wray's death, like that of Gerald McKinney and William McKinney, happened during the chaos as people ran for cover. Saville said Mr Wray, who posed no great danger, was shot twice in the back and there were four soldiers who could have fired at him  - soldiers E, F, G or H. The second shot was probably fired as he lay wounded, said Saville, meaning there could have been ""no possible justification"". Widgery said there was no photographic evidence of what had happened to Mr Wray, but he had been in the general vicinity of where soldiers claimed that civilians had opened fired. On 2 July 2021,it was announcedthe prosecution of Soldier F for the murder of James Wray and William McKinney would not continue. The 17-year-old was the youngest of six and worked in a menswear shop. He was shot near a barricade as he tried to take cover. Saville concluded John Young was killed in the same shooting incident that claimed the lives of William Nash and Michael McDaid. He also said he was unarmed and shot by soldiers P, J or E. One witness told Widgery that Mr Young had gone to help another teenager who had been shot. Widgery said: ""Young was undoubtedly associated with the youths who were throwing missiles at the soldiers from the barricade and the track of the bullet suggests that he was facing the soldiers at the time.""

We'll be back with live text commentary on that gameright here from 16:00 BST. Until then, we'll leave you with some of today's top stories: All kick-off times BST That game is the last of the Euro 2020 quarter-finals: And to whet the appetite, here's a reminder of the moment England got there... Ukraine v England (Sat, 20:00 BST) Paul BrownBBC Monitoring He scores Ukraine's winner against Sweden in added time in extra time to take them to the Euro 2020 quarter-finals to play England, but forward Artem Dovbyk has drawn some criticism in his homeland. His
offence? Speaking Russian in a post-match interview. Ukrainian
and Russian are both widely spoken in Ukraine, but prolonged tensions between
the two countries have built to the point where such things can be
controversial. An
official in charge of Ukraine's language law, Taras Kremin, said athletes are required to speak Ukrainian at public
appearances. But
while some agreed with the criticism, many saw it as an unnecessary dampener on
Dovbykâs footballing heroics. Ukrainian journalist Roman Burko said the language issue is
important, but should not be used to devalue Ukrainians' joy in
the victory over Sweden - ""a joy that unites Ukrainian citizens with very
different political preferences, who speak different languages"". And after nine years with Chelsea, Victor Moses has completed a permanent transfer to Spartak Moscow.  

The Nigeria winger, 30, spent last season on loan with the Russian side. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Simon StoneBBC Sport It's the end of an era at Manchester City, with confirmation Brian Kidd is to leave the club. Kidd has been part of the backroom team at City for 12 years, having initially joined as technical development manager before becoming assistant manager when Roberto Mancini joined the club in 2009. The 72-year-old has worked under Manuel Pellegrini and Pep Guardiola and was recently praised by striker Liam Delap for the work he has done with him. Kidd has been a familiar figure in Manchester football for over 50 years, having been part of the United side that beat Benfica in the 1968 European Cup final. He also played for City, amongst others. ""It has been a privilege to be part of such an exciting chapter in this club's history,"" he said. Before we head off for the day, here's a note to let you know that Manchester football legend Brian Kidd, who helped United win their first European Cup in 1968 and played for City from 1976-79, has left City's coaching staff.

Ciaran Varley Back in Spain, Lionel Messi is officially out of work and a few teams - not all of them serious - have already tried to get him to sign for them. The world's (arguably) greatest player officiallybecame a free agent on Thursdayas his contract with Barcelona expired. That means he's available for nothing. Nada. Gratis. Among his suitors, one would have to imagine that clubs such as Manchester City, Paris St-Germain and possibly an Italian giant like Juventus or Inter Milan may be interested in trying to lure the six-time Ballon d'Or winner. On the other hand, the 34-year-old Argentine may well end up signing a contract extension to stay at the Nou Camp. In the meantime, there have been some rather unserious attempts to gain his signature. Ciaran looks at some of themright here. Switzerland v Spain (17:00 BST) This will be the first meeting between Switzerland and Spain at the Euros. Their three previous meetings in a major tournament came in the 1966, 1994 and 2010 World Cups, with Spain winning the first two and Switzerland triumphing last time out. Spain have lost just one of their 22 meetings with Switzerland in all competitions, with that defeat coming in their opening game of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Gelson Fernandes scored the game's only goal to give the Swiss victory against the then-European champions, but Spain went on to win the World Cup for the first time. Switzerland v Spain (17:00 BST) BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Now let's take a look at what the Swiss media are saying ahead of their big game. La Tribune de Geneve,externalkeeps it simple by asking, can Switzerland really beat Spain? ""Having reached this phase of the Euros
for the very first time, Switzerland is being carried by an unstoppable wind that blows to
unite all the cantons behind their âNatiâ (national team). Switzerland isnât
afraid of anything anymore.â Le Temps,externalhave also kept it pretty simple but less optimistic. They've compared the challenge of playing Spain like climbing Mount Everest. âSwitzerland may have
beaten the world champions, but itâs about to face Spain, which has never
really worked well â and all of this without its captain, Granit Xhaka.â Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) Belgium'sDe Standaardcarries a rallying call for the Red Devils in today's paper... 'only Devils with daring can defeat the Azzurri, with or without Kevin de Bruyne and Eden Hazard'. Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) This is the fifth meeting between the sides at a major tournament, with Italy winning three of the previous four encounters. Belgium reached the quarter-final stage at the last Euros in 2016, when they were knocked out by Wales. They've looked good since though, having lost just one of their last 27 games. The last time these two sides met was in the group stage at Euro 16,  with Italy coming out on top 2-0. The Azzurri are currently on a 31-game unbeaten run. Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) Belgium are sweating on the fitness of Kevin de Bruyne and Eden Hazard. Both came off during their win over Portugal in the last 16 and although boss Roberto Martinez said they could still play a part against Italy in Munich, they arenot expected to be ""100%"" fit. The headline in Belgium'sGazet van Antwerpenreads 'the state secret: is De Bruyne playing?'  Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) Simon GleaveHead of sports analysis, Gracenote ""Belgium are estimated to have around a 60% chance of progressing to the Euro 2020 semi-finals, according to the Gracenote forecasting model. ""Belgium moved to number one on our world ranking after their win against Portugal and Brazil's draw with Ecuador at the Copa America. Belgium began Euro 2020 as our pre-tournament favourites and were given a 14.1% chance of winning. They are currently second favourites behind England due to the latter's more favourable draw and potential home advantage in the last two rounds. Belgium's chance of winning Euro 2020 has increased to 24%. ""Italy began Euro 2020 ranked seventh in the world by Gracenote but they have subsequently risen to fourth. They were our fifth favourites before the tournament started with a 9.1% chance of winning Euro 2020. This has risen to 12.5%. Italy's long unbeaten run has only included one match against Gracenote's current top-10 teams, a draw against Portugal in 2018. While Italy's results have been impressive over the past three years, Belgium are a very different level of opposition to the teams they have beaten in that time."" Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) Tuttosporthas a similar show of unity to theCorreire dello Sport, saying 'you are all of us' before Italy's quarter-final clash. Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) La Gazzetta dello Sportfeatures the full Italy squad and says âWe are Italy:
face-off with Lukakuâs Belgium to become great againâ. Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku was Inter Milan's top scorer in Serie A as they became Italian champions last season. Belgium v Italy (20:00 BST) Back to the European newspapers now, and the front page of theCorriere dello Sportin Italy reads 'we are with you' and 'the moment of truth'. Now, if social media and celebs is something that interests you then this is something that might grab your attention. Cristiano Ronaldo tops Instagram's rich list as the celebrity thought to be able to charge more than anyone else for a sponsored post.

Last foreign forces quit Afghanistan's Bagram baseThe sprawling airbase has been the centre of operations against the Taliban and al-Qaeda for almost 20 years.Asia,"Afghan soldiers guarded Bagram on Friday The last US and Nato forces have left Afghanistan's Bagram airbase, the centre of the war against militants for some 20 years, US officials say. The pull-out could signal that the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is imminent. President Joe Biden has said US forces will be gone by 11 September. But the withdrawal from the sprawling base, north of Kabul, comes as the main jihadist group, the Taliban, advances in many parts of Afghanistan. In pictures: Two decades of the US at Bagram base Who are the Taliban? How can the West fight terror after leaving Afghanistan? A year of violence on the road to peace The 11 September deadline is the anniversary of the attacks on America in 2001, which killed nearly 3,000 people. The attacks were carried out by al-Qaeda, an international jihadist group then based in Afghanistan with the support of the Taliban, who had been in control of the country since the 1990s. A US-led coalition invaded Afghanistan later that year to defeat both groups. This video can not be played Biden deflects questions on Afghanistan, ""I want to talk about happy things."" America now wants to end its longest war with its huge cost in human lives and vast expense, and is leaving security to the Afghan government. Some 2,500-3,500 US troops were thought to be still in Afghanistan until recently and when they depart, fewer than 1,000 American soldiers will remain. As of May there were about 7,000 other coalition troops in Afghanistan but it is believed that most have now left, with Germany and Italy declaring their missions over on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a resurgent Taliban, buoyed by the expectation of the foreign withdrawal, has overrun dozens of districts, amid fears that a new civil war could erupt after the departure of foreign forces. Bagram is a bellwether of what's to come. This symbol of American military might was once a stronghold of Soviet forces. Now Afghan security forces will soon confront the challenge of securing this sprawling city within a city. Bagram is vital - in symbolic and strategic ways. Taliban fighters, advancing in districts across the country, have this prize in their sights. Even last October, residents of the town which has swelled all around it told us the Taliban were already in their midst. On a recent visit to the base, as the US packed up, we heard how Afghan security forces saw it as a mixed blessing. There's a wealth of military assets within its walls; but that treasure is a top target for Taliban, not to mention corrupt commanders and others eying this fortune. For the countless Afghans whose lives and livelihoods have long banked on this base - and who now feel abandoned - Bagram's new chapter is deeply worrying. At the White House on Friday, Mr Biden defended the withdrawal as ""a rational drawdown with our allies, so there is nothing unusual about it"". But as reporters pressed him, he told them: ""I'm not going to answer any more questions about Afghanistan."" Glancing down at his lectern, he said he wanted to celebrate the 4 July holiday weekend, adding that ""all across America people are going to ball games and doing good things"", and he would instead answer the ""negative questions"" of media next week. Asked by another journalist about Afghanistan, he said: ""I want to talk about happy things, man."" His spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a daily press briefing: ""We expect it [the withdrawal] to be completed by the end of August."" The airfield lies around 40km (25 miles) north of Kabul and is named after a nearby village. Your device may not support this visualisation It was built up by Moscow when the former Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s. US-led coalition forces moved in during December 2001, and it was developed into a huge base capable of holding up to 10,000 troops. New York City firefighters and police were flown in to bury a piece of rubble from the World Trade Center, destroyed in the 9/11 attacks, on the territory of the base. A piece of World Trade Center rubble was buried in the frozen ground of the base in December 2001 It is served by two runways, the most recent of which is 3.6km long, where large cargo and bomber aircraft can land. It has 110 parking spots for aircraft,external, which are protected by blast walls, and had a 50-bed hospital with a trauma bay, three operating theatres and a modern dental clinic, the Associated Press reports. This video can not be played From May 2021: Top US commander General Scott Miller reflects on Nato forces' time in Afghanistan ahead of its departure Its hangars and buildings included the main prison facility for people detained by US forces at the height of the conflict, which became known as Afghanistan's Guantanamo - after the infamous US military prison in Cuba. Bagram was one of the sites identified in a US Senate report on the CIA's interrogation of al-Qaeda suspects, including the use of torture, carried out in detention facilities. Bagram ex-detainees say they still bear the scars The top US commander in Afghanistan, General Austin Scott Miller, met President Ashraf Ghani to discuss ""continued US assistance and co-operation"", the president's office said in a tweet on Friday. About 650 US troops are expected to remain in the country, the Associated Press reports, to provide protection for diplomats and help guard Kabul's international airport, a vital transport hub for the landlocked country. They are guarding the airport alongside troops from America's Nato ally Turkey, while a new agreement for its security is negotiated with the Afghan government. The airport's US protection includes a counter-rocket, artillery, mortar system and the troops to operate it, as well as helicopter support. Other American troops will guard the US Embassy in Kabul. How much has the Afghanistan war cost the US? Military analysts say the ability of the Afghan government to maintain control over Bagram will be vital to its efforts to defend Kabul and push back the Taliban. ""Henceforth the Afghan army forces will protect it and use it to combat terrorism,"" Afghan defence ministry spokesman Fawad Aman tweeted on Friday. The Taliban stopped attacks on coalition forces after signing an agreement with the US in February of last year, when they also promised to end co-operation with international jihadist groups. But the militants have continued fighting government forces. Every morning brings fresh reports of overnight fighting, the BBC's South Asia editor, Jill McGivering, says. Battles between the Taliban and government forces in Herat, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Paktia are all making news. Some reports suggest June saw some of the worst violence since the arrival of the coalition, with hundreds of lives lost. And hard-won development is under threat too with many schools, government buildings and power pylons now damaged or destroyed. These wounded Afghan soldiers were rescued by helicopter north of Kandahar last month A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, welcomed the US withdrawal from Bagram, telling AFP news agency it would ""pave the way for Afghans to decide about their future between themselves"". The war is thought to have taken the lives of more than 47,000 Afghan civilians and nearly 70,000 Afghan troops, as well asthe lives of 2,442 US soldiers and more than 3,800 US private security contractors,external, and 1,144 soldiers from other coalition countries. The Costs of War project at Brown University, which analyses America's wars this century, estimates thatthe war has cost America a total of $2.26tn,external(Â£1.64tn). From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.

Asda to allow permanent hybrid working for offices,"Asda has announced it will make hybrid working permanent at its head offices once Covid restrictions are lifted. The supermarket group said staff at Asda House in Leeds and George House in Leicester can choose where they work. Around 4,000 staff work at both offices, with the majority based in Leeds. England is set to lift final Covid measures on 19 July and many businesses have indicated they will continue to allow flexible working. However, not all companies plan to embrace a hybrid approach. Goldman Sachs International has said it wants people to come back into the office once restrictions have ended. Asda said its new approach ""will encourage colleagues to select the best location to do their job"", including home, head office or even a store or depot. Covid: Should I be working from home or going back to the office? How do you feel about going back to the office? Goldman Sachs delays return to office for workers When employees have meetings or training, they will be encouraged to come into the office. But Asda said staff also ""have the flexibility to work from home when it is more productive to do so, such as tasks that involve planning or research"". Asda's plan is similar to oneadopted by Nationwide, which will allow the building society's 13,000 office employees to ""work anywhere"". Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon and the 3,000 staff based at those sites can either move to the nearby headquarters, work from home or mix the two. Some employees may be able to work from a local High Street branch if they prefer, instead of travelling to an office. Jacki Simpson, Asda's vice president of people operations, said: ""We have learned a great deal about working patterns during the last 16 months and have seen colleagues work productively across different locations."" She said the retailer had consulted with staff about how they wanted to work in the future. ""We know they welcome the increased flexibility of remote working,"" she said. ""However, they also acknowledge there is some work that is simply better done from the office, so as we move forward a hybrid working model is the right approach for our people and the business.""

Britons reassured on India-made jabs and EU travel,"Boris Johnson has said he is ""very confident"" there ""will not prove to be a problem"" for travellers who have received an Indian-made Covid jab. It comes after reports the European Union's passport scheme does not recognise the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India. The UK's medicines regulator has shared its data on the jab with its European counterpart, Downing Street said. Vaccine expert Prof Adam Finn said the vaccines were ""exactly the same stuff"". TheDaily Telegraph had reported,externalthat millions of people who have received doses from batches manufactured in India could face being blocked from taking European holidays. The UK has receivedfive million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute, which manufactures the jab under the name Covishield - although that name is not used in the UK. The Serum Institute has not received approval to make the Covid jab from the European drugs regulator but has been cleared by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). However, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said all AstraZeneca vaccines administered in the UK would appear under the brand name Vaxzevria - the same as the AstraZeneca jab produced elsewhere - on the NHS Covid Pass. It said ""no Covishield jabs have been administered in the UK"". On Friday the UK recorded 27,125 new cases of coronavirus and a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Could your AZ jab stop you going on holiday? Covid infections rising, but vaccines saving lives Currently the EU is rolling out a Digital Covid Certificate so travellers can prove their vaccination status in order to be exempt from quarantining when crossing an international border. A European Commission spokesman said that while entry to the EU should be allowed to those who are fully vaccinated with EU authorised jabs, member states could make their own decision on whether to allow entry for people vaccinated with jabs on the World Health Organization's emergency list - which includes Covishield. Several European countries havealready approved the Covishield jab for travel. These include Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Iceland and Switzerland. At the moment the EU does not accept the UK's NHS app for Covid certification but a UK government spokesman said it will be ""a key service"" as international travel is reopened. Individual countries including Greece and Spain do accept it. With batch numbers being visible via the UK's Covid pass it is not clear if officials EU countries could check if a person had received a dose originating in India. Earlier, Downing Street said the MHRA had shared its assessment of the vaccines with its European counterpart - the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - to assist the approvals process. During a press conference with German Chancellor Angel Merkel, the UK prime minister, Mr Johnson, said he saw ""no reason at all"" why MHRA-approved vaccines should not be used for vaccine passports. Mrs Merkel said that ""in the foreseeable future"" those with double jabs in high incidence areas, like Britain,""will be able to travel again without having to go into quarantine"". The Serum Institute is reportedlyseeking emergency authorisation from Europefor the Covishield jab, which has widely been distributed in poorer countries as part of the Covavax scheme. AstraZeneca also says it is working with the EMA on the ""inclusion of Covishield as a recognised vaccine for immunisation passports"" - although the EMA says there is currently no application for market authorisation. Prof Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme people should not be worried that they were any less protected by the Covishield jab and said the ""administrative hurdle"" should be ""straightened out"". ""We're in the early days of this new world of needed vaccine passports and there are lots of aspects of this that are still being sorted out for the first time,"" he said. ""But it's clearly, ultimately not in anyone's interest, including the European Union, to create hurdles that don't need to be there.""

Statues of British queens toppled in Canada,"This video can not be played Watch: Statue of Queen Victoria toppled in Winnipeg, Canada A prominent statue of Queen Victoria has been torn down by protesters in Canada as anger grows over the deaths of indigenous children at residential schools. The protesters cheered as the statue at the legislature in Manitoba's capital Winnipeg was toppled on Thursday. A smaller statue of Queen Elizabeth II was also upended nearby. Local media say police used a stun gun to arrest a man at the scene but the protest was largely peaceful. Ten churches vandalised in Alberta on Canada Day The toppling of the statues came on Canada Day, an annual celebration on 1 July that marks the country's founding by British colonies in 1867. The recent discoveries of unmarked indigenous Canadian graves at residential schools hadprompted calls for national celebrations to be called off. A statue of Queen Elizabeth II was also torn down The British government condemned the toppling of the two statues. ""We obviously condemn any defacing of statues of the Queen,"" a spokesman said. ""Our thoughts,"" the spokesman added, ""are with Canada's indigenous community following these tragic discoveries and we follow these issues closely and continue to engage with the government of Canada with indigenous matters."" Around 750 graves found at Canada residential school Why Canada is mourning the deaths of 215 children More churches burn down on Canada indigenous land More than 150,000 indigenous Canadian children were taken from their families and forced to attend the schools during the 19th and 20th Centuries with the aim of forcibly assimilating them into society.

Queen Victoria statue toppled by Canada protesters,"This video can not be played Watch: Statue of Queen Victoria toppled in Winnipeg, Canada A prominent statue of Queen Victoria has been torn down by protesters in Canada as anger grows over the deaths of indigenous children at residential schools. The protesters cheered as the statue at the legislature in Manitoba's capital Winnipeg was toppled on Thursday. A smaller statue of Queen Elizabeth II was also upended nearby. Local media say police used a stun gun to arrest a man at the scene but the protest was largely peaceful. Ten churches vandalised in Alberta on Canada Day The toppling of the statues came on Canada Day, an annual celebration on 1 July that marks the country's founding by British colonies in 1867.

A statue of Queen Elizabeth II was also torn down The British government condemned the toppling of the two statues. ""We obviously condemn any defacing of statues of the Queen,"" a spokesman said.

'Coercion and rape': Investigating my yoga schoolYour pictures,"Warning: This article contains descriptions of sexual assault BBC journalist Ishleen Kaur was a passionate yoga teacher with Sivananda, one of the biggest yoga movements in the world, until a disturbing social media post led her to uncover multiple allegations of sexual abuse spanning decades, right up to the present day. Since I discovered yoga in my mid-20s, it had become a huge part of my world. Like many devoted yogis, it was not just an exercise class for me, but a way of life. I didn't just teach classes at my local Sivananda centre, I volunteered to cook and clean there too. Sivananda teachings influenced every aspect of my existence. But then in December 2019, I received a notification on my phone. It was a post in my Sivananda Facebook group about the movement's late revered founder, Swami Vishnudevananda. A woman called Julie Salter had written that Vishnudevananda had sexually abused her for three years at the Sivananda headquarters in Canada. She wrote that when she finally found the strength - decades later - to report this to the Sivananda management board, ""the reactions ranged from silence, to the attempt to silence"". I have now interviewed 14 women who allege abuse at the hands of senior Sivananda teachers, many of whom have not spoken about this to family and friends, let alone made it public. I have also spoken to a former staff member who says her concerns were not addressed by the Sivananda board. My investigation has exposed claims of an abuse of power and influence within the organisation I once held so dear. I vividly remember my first day at the Sivananda ashram in Kerala, southern India, where I trained as a yoga teacher in 2014. On the wall was a magnificent photo of Swami Vishnudevananda, Sivananda's late founder, and the man Julie would go on to expose. His teachings were so powerful that many yogis renounced all worldly connections and dedicated their lives to the organisation. I could understand why. I was going through a very challenging time and Sivananda gave me a new-found peace. The asanas - or postures - gave me physical strength; Sivananda's principles of karma, positive thinking and meditation nourished my soul. Ishleen at the Sivananda ashram in Kerala In 2015 I married a man who was living in London. I felt daunted by the idea of moving to be with him there, until I discovered there was a Sivananda centre in Putney, not far from our new home. My husband would joke that the centre was my first love, not him. Ishleen on the stage at a Sivananda demonstration Two months after Julie Salter's Facebook post, two Sivananda board members flew in from Europe to talk to the Putney staff. I hoped they would answer at least some of the many questions I had swirling around my head. But their response was vague, and they seemed defensive during the Q and A that followed. I knew I would have to speak to Julie myself. Originally from New Zealand, Julie was 20 and travelling in Israel when she first came across the teachings of Sivananda. She quickly became immersed in the life of the movement, and in 1978, moved to its headquarters in Canada. Vishnudevananda was based there and Julie was asked to become his personal assistant, something she initially regarded as a privilege. But she says her schedule was brutal. She worked from 05:00 until almost midnight, seven days a week - all without pay. She says Swami Vishnudevananda became unpredictable, often shouting at her. ""So of course, my own boundaries were getting more and more weakened,"" she tells me. And then events took a darker turn. One day when Julie was working in Vishnudevananda's house, she found him lying down listening to devotional tapes. He asked her to lie down next to him. When Julie said she didn't understand what he wanted, he told her: ""Tantra yoga"" - a yoga practice which has become associated with spiritual sex, but simply means working towards spiritual enlightenment through deep relaxation. Nevertheless, Julie says Vishnudevananda had only ever referenced it in theoretical terms, during a lecture. ""I said: 'I don't understand,' and despite everything in my body and mind saying, 'No', I did lay down. And then there was the sexual contact. And then after that, I was downstairs again, working, and in total shame - and everything else - anguish, self blame, guilt."" Julie says she was coerced into various sexual acts, including penetrative sex, for more than three years. Sivananda is a form of classical yoga which emphasises both physical and spiritual wellbeing Founded by Swami Vishnudevananda in 1959 in Montreal, Canada, and named after his guru Swami Sivananda There are nearly 60 Sivananda ashrams and centres in 35 countries around the world and nearly 50,000 trained Sivananda teachers Several other high-profile yoga gurus have been accused of abusing their position in recent years, includingBikram Chaudhry, Pattabhi Jois, andBhagwan Rajneesh Guru is a BBC investigation by Ishleen Kaur and produced by Louise Adamou. Listen to the podcast on theWorld Service/BBC Sounds,onThe Documentaryorin Hindi,external The guru-disciple relationship, known in yoga as the guru shishya parampara, is an unspoken agreement that the follower will surrender to the guru's wishes. She now considers Vishnudevananda's actions to have been rape, as her position made her ill-equipped to consent given the ""power dynamics"" at play. Julie with Vishnudevananda ""I was quite isolated, I was living on the other side of the world from family, anything I knew in the past. I was financially dependent on the organisation."" I then spoke to two women who had responded within minutes to Julie's Facebook post, alleging Vishnudevananda had abused them too. Pamela told me Vishnudevananda raped her during a retreat in 1978 at Windsor Castle in London, as she was lying in a deep state of relaxation, known in yoga as corpse pose. Lucille says he raped her three times during the mid '70s in the Canadian ashram. She says the first two times she naively justified it as tantric yoga, but the third time he gave her money and she felt ""like a prostitute"". Vishnudevananda died in 1993 but it took Julie another six years to find the strength to leave the organisation. Her only hope is that, by speaking out now, she can save others from suffering in the way that she did. Because as I was to discover, Vishnudevananda may have died, but the abuse of Sivananda devotees did not die with him. Julie's Facebook post had opened a floodgate. I've since spoken to 11 women who have made serious allegations against two other Sivananda teachers, one of whom the BBC believes is still active in the organisation. Among the shocking allegations is an account by Marie (not her real name), who says she was groomed by one teacher - who we can't name for legal reasons - over a number of years. She says she was really confused when their relationship became sexual but felt she had no choice but to go along with it. After more than a year without any sexual contact from him, she remembers one occasion when he came into her room uninvited. Silently, he got on top of her, penetrated her, ejaculated, and left without saying a word. Five other women have told me that this same man sexually abused them. They don't know each other but their stories all follow a similar pattern of grooming and assault. Catherine (not her real name), was just 12 years old, and attending a Sivananda children's camp in Canada in the '80s when she said the teacher first took a sexual interest in her. She says the man would massage her and touch her bottom. When she was 15, he began touching her more explicitly, grabbing her between her legs and touching her breasts. She says the last time he assaulted her she was 17. She was taking a nap and woke up to find him on top of her. She left the organisation that day. Another complainant says she was assaulted by the same man as recently as 2019. We contacted this man and offered him the opportunity to respond, but he has failed to address the allegations we have put to him. The BBC understands he is still actively involved in Sivananda in India, although the organisation denies this. The other teacher accused of abuse is Maurizio Finocchi, also known as Swami Mahadevananda. I have spoken to eight women about their allegations against him. One of them, Wendy, was working as Mahadevananda's personal assistant in the Canada headquarters in 2006. One of her jobs was to print out his emails and take them to his cabin. On the day in question, he called her to bring the emails and his breakfast through to his bedroom where he was sitting up in bed. As she handed him a tray, she says he grabbed her arm and flipped the sheet back, under which she realised he was masturbating. She says he then ejaculated onto her arm. ""And I just remember feeling that I was almost not human to him. I was really a means to an end."" Wendy says if women approached senior staff to report worrying - and in some cases, criminal - behaviour, the staff would cast it in the framework of a spiritual teaching called ""guru's grace"". ""If something was problematic or confusing - and I'm talking about even administrative thingsâ¦ but certainly around sexual relations and questionable relationships - you'd be told: 'No, the fact that you're having a problem is actually 'guru's grace'. ""As in you're being taught some kind of a valuable lesson."" We contacted Mahadevananda to offer him the opportunity to respond to the allegations, but our request went unanswered. The BBC has, however, seen a copy of an email he sent to a lawyer who has been crowdfunded by a Sivananda community Facebook group, called Project Satya, which I became a member of. In the email he apologises for what he calls his ""misdeeds"", and promises to ""endeavour not to do it again"". Another thing I wanted to understand was, how much of this did Sivananda's management already know? Julie tells me she finally found the strength to report her abuse in 2003 when she attended a meeting with a member of the Executive Members' Board (EBM) - the board created by Vishnudevananda to act as Sivananda caretakers after his death. She says that board member was Swami Mahadevananda. ""We were there for a while, but basically he acknowledged that he had known about it for years."" Swami Mahadevananda is one of the other teachers who faces sexual abuse allegations - but at the time Julie didn't know this. Julie says she told four more board members about her allegation over the next few weeks. The trustees deny that Julie discussed her allegations with them in 2003. However the BBC has seen an email from Mahadevananda in which he confirms he did meet Julie at that time.  He describes it as informal, but says after this meeting the allegations became ""open knowledge"". In 2006, Julie attended a mediated meeting with EBM, where discussions over some kind of financial support for her took place. The abuse allegations were also raised. The trustees told the BBC that both sides were pleased with the results at the time, but Julie says nothing ever materialised. So the following year Julie's solicitor wrote to the board seeking compensation and threatening a claim for damages. In response, she received a letter from the EBM's solicitor questioning why Julie was raising the matter so long after the alleged abuse. Sivananda say that after the meeting with Julie they began implementing protocols for members and guests designed to give everyone a safe environment in which to speak out about such allegations. We asked them why they continue to revere the man who sexually abused her. The ""Sivananda Organisation honours its lineage and its teachings"", was their response. Vishnudevananda, pictured here with Peter Sellers, used to take 'peace flights' to places of conflict As for Mahadevananda, our investigation has found evidence that the board knew about his alleged sexual impropriety as early as 1999. Because he himself admitted it to them. Swami Saradananda, an American woman on the EBM at the time, told us that in 1998/99 she received a phone call from the director of the Delhi ashram in tears. The director told her that Mahadevananda was walking around without his trousers - which Saradananda took to mean in his underwear. When she phoned to challenge Mahadevananda, he explained that wasn't right. He wasn't in his underwear - he was naked. And that wasn't his only revelation. ""He told me that he hadn't worn anything below the waist, and he had come into the office where [the Delhi director] was working and masturbated in front of her."" Swami Saradananda, deeply disturbed, says she raised this at the next EBM meeting. She says all recording devices were switched off and the secretary sent out of the room. Mahadevananda was present and she says he confirmed her account was true. ""And he said: 'But if she doesn't want me to do it, OK, big deal. I won't do it any more.'"" When she interrupted to ask how they were going to deal with Mahadevananda's admission, one of the board replied: ""Well, he already said he's not going to do it any more. What do you want? His blood?"" Within a few months, Saradananda received a fax telling her that she had been voted off the board. We put this allegation to the EBM but they did not respond. Saradananda's revelations might account for the lack of surprise Wendy faced in 2006 when she told a senior member of staff in the Canadian headquarters that Mahadevananda had ejaculated on her. His response, she says, was: ""Damn, not again."" The staff member told her not to worry - the organisation had arranged for Swami Mahadevananda to have counselling. ""I wasn't aware that in Canada this would be defined as sexual assault. And I wasn't aware at that time that this could have been taken to the police,"" Wendy told me. Thirteen years later, the EBM did eventually investigate Mahadevananda, and then announced his retirement in their monthly magazine - a retirement which they have acknowledged they are funding. The notice said the executive board thanked him for his ""devoted and inspiring service"". Carol Merchasin, the lawyer crowdfunded by Project Satya, says she has spoken to 25-to-30 women who have alleged sexual assault against Sivananda staff. She says she has found every one of them to be credible. In the case of Catherine, she questions why the incident was not reported to the police once the Trustees became aware of the allegations. When, many years later, her parents found out and confronted them, Carol says they told them that nothing could be done without evidence. The EBM has told us the teacher who is alleged to have abused Catherine and others has been suspended from duties while they investigate. But we have been told by several sources that he is still involved in Sivananda's Indian ashrams, and when I called the Kerala ashram, I was told he did in fact teach a full course there earlier this year. The EBM declined to be interviewed, but sent us a statement which we set out here in full: ""The Board of Trustees fully sympathises with those who came forward and offers any individual who feels that they might have been affected by the conduct referred to in the [BBC investigation] its assurance that it will not tolerate abuse or disregard inappropriate behaviour. It apologises unreservedly for any historic mistakes which it made in addressing the allegations detailed in the [investigation]. ""As a result of those allegations, Sivananda has commissioned an independent investigation, and has appointed legal experts who have helped to review and implement safeguarding policies, and put in place appropriate training. The Sivananda Organisation has established a confidential reporting facility for anyone who is concerned about abuse. It is an absolute priority for the Sivananda Organisation that anyone coming into contact with it, in whatever capacity, is safeguarded from abuse or suffering. The Sivananda Organisation is a monastic order dedicated to physical, mental, and spiritual health and is committed to the safety of all of its members."" I have seen four of the investigation reports into the teacher we cannot name, all of which conclude that on the balance of probability the survivors are credible and their testimonies are truthful, and that two of them did report their abuse to the EBM. In April I returned to the Putney ashram where I had spent the last five years as a teacher and devotee. But this time I did not go inside. It struck me that the all-consuming nature of Sivananda that had attracted me was also what could make it so dangerous. The women I have spoken to all told me it was easy to lose a sense of reality, which made it harder to question what was going on. And I am aware that during our investigation the women who came forward were all Westerners. But it seems there are also Indian survivors - I've seen emails from women detailing what happened to them but they were too scared to speak to me. As for myself, it's over for me and Sivananda.

PM to discuss travel curbs with Merkel on UK visit,"The talks are taking place at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence PM Boris Johnson is discussing Covid travel restrictions with Angela Merkel in her final official visit to the UK as German chancellor. Mrs Merkel, who is due to step down later this year, has previously called for all UK travellers to Europe to face quarantine. Trade and post-Brexit relations are also on the agenda. The chancellor arrived at Chequers, the prime minister's Buckinghamshire residence, earlier for the talks. She will also meet the Queen at Windsor Castle and address a meeting of the UK cabinet - the first foreign leader to do so since President Clinton in 1997, although on this occasion the meeting will be a virtual one. Last week Mrs Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, said she wanted other countries to follow Germany's lead by introducing tougher restrictions for UK travellers because of concerns about the Delta variant. Since May, travellers from the UK have been banned from entering Germany,aside from a few limited exceptions,external. Those who are allowed to arrive from the UK must quarantine for 14 days. Mr Johnson is expected to announce the latest steps towards ending lockdown in England in the next few days, with international travel high on the agenda. In contrast to Mrs Merkel, he said on Thursday that double vaccinations could be a ""liberator"" as millions of people plan their summer breaks. PM upbeat about easing restrictions on 19 July Whatâs happening with the plan to end Covid restrictions? The pair will dine on an three-course meal featuring British produce including an English asparagus tart and Oxfordshire beef fillet during a working lunch. Ahead of the chancellor's visit, Mr Johnson said: ""The UK and Germany have a steadfast friendship and a shared outlook on many issues."" He is expected to announce the creation of an annual Â£10,000 award for a UK or Germany-based female scientist who has excelled in the field of astrophysics. The two leaders greeted with an elbow bump ""Our scientists, innovators and industrialists work together every day to make the world a better place,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Over the 16 years of Chancellor Merkel's tenure the UK-Germany relationship has been re-energised and reinvigorated for a new era. ""And the new joint ventures we will agree will leave a legacy that will last for generations."" The visit will be Mrs Merkel's 22nd to the UK since taking office and is one of a series of farewell trips, with US President Joe Biden among those expected to host her later in the summer. She and Mr Johnson last met at the G7 summit in Cornwall in June.

Bloody Sunday: The victimsVideoWhat was Bloody Sunday?,"Top row, left to right: Patrick ""Paddy"" Doherty, Gerald Donaghey, John ""Jackie"" Duddy, Hugh Gilmour, Michael Kelly, Michael McDaid, Kevin McElhinney. Bottom row, left to right: Bernard McGuigan, Gerard McKinney, William McKinney, William Nash, James Wray, John Young Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on marchers during a civil rights march in Londonderry on 30 January 1972. It became known as Bloody Sunday and these are the victims: Married father-of-six Patrick Doherty, known as Paddy, was 31 years old when he joined the march. He worked in the city's Du Pont factory and was an active member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. Mr Doherty died as he was trying to crawl to safety. In the Saville Report - a re-examination of the events of Bloody Sunday carried out by Lord Mark Saville and published in 2010 - said Mr Doherty was unarmed. The inquiry also found there was ""no doubt"" he was shot by Soldier F, who changed his story over the years. The Widgery Inquiry - announced the day after Bloody Sunday and chaired by Lord Widgery - largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame, although he described the soldiers' shooting as ""bordering on the reckless"". That earlier inquiry said that if the soldier had shot Mr Doherty in the belief he had a pistol, that belief was ""mistaken"". The 17year-old was a member of the IRA's youth wing, Fianna na Ãireann. He had become involved in the civil unrest and had been jailed for six months for rioting the year before. A police photograph taken shortly after he was pronounced dead showed a nailbomb in Mr Donaghey's pocket. A soldier later said he had found four nailbombs among Mr Donaghey's clothing. Widgery dismissed claims that the devices had been planted after death - saying nobody had offered any evidence to the contrary. But the Saville Inquiry heard that neither the soldier who first examined Mr Donaghey nor the Army medical officer who received him at an aid post had found anything suspicious when they checked the teenager. In conclusion, Saville found the nailbombs were ""probably"" on Mr Donaghey but said he was not preparing to throw them at the time nor was he shot because he was carrying them. The report said he was shot by Soldier G while trying to escape from the soldiers. One of a family of 15, the factory worker is thought to have been the first to be killed. The 17-year-old boxer, known a Jackie, had represented his club in bouts across Ireland and in Liverpool. He had attended the march ""for the craic"" with his friends and against his father's advice. The picture above shows a group of people carrying the dying teenager though the streets of Derry, lead by the then Fr (later Bishop) Edward Daly waving a bloodied handkerchief. It became one of the enduring images of Northern Ireland's Troubles. The Saville report concluded Mr Duddy was unarmed and ""probably"" shot by Soldier R, as he ran away from soldiers. Widgery said he had not been armed and was probably hit by a bullet intended for someone else. The 17-year-old was the youngest of eight children and a trainee tyre fitter. He was shot as he was running away from the soldiers in a crowd of up to 50 people. A woman said she heard him cry ""I'm hit, I'm hit"". A single bullet had struck him in the chest and arm. The teenager was pulled to safety behind a barricade but died shortly afterwards. Saville said Mr Gilmour was unarmed and Soldier U had fired at him as he ran away from the soldiers. Widgery concluded Mr Gilmour was not shot from behind and had probably been standing on a barricade when he was hit. The 17-year-old had been training to be a sewing machine mechanic and the march was his first taste of the civil rights movement. He went, his family said, because his friends were going. He was shot in the stomach near a barricade. He was carried to the safety of a house and died in an ambulance on the way to hospital. At Saville, Soldier F admitted that he had shot Michael Kelly - but said that he had only fired at people with bombs or weapons. However, Saville concluded Mr Kelly was unarmed. Widgery said forensic tests found firearms residue on Mr Kelly's right cuff and that indicated he was close to someone who was firing at the soldiers from the barricade. ""But I do not think that this was Kelly, nor am I satisfied that he was throwing a bomb at the time when he was shot,"" said Widgery. The second-youngest of a family of 12, the 20-year-old worked as a barman. Mr McDaid was arrested but then escaped out of the back of an Army vehicle before being shot near a barricade. Saville concluded that Mr McDaid was unarmed and he was shot by either Soldier P, Soldier J or Soldier E. Widgery could not identify who had fired the shot. Forensic tests found lead particles on Mr McDaid's jacket and right hand, and Widgery discounted the possibility that the clothing and body had been contaminated by residue from soldiers or their vehicles. The 17-year-old was the middle child of five and was described as a hardworking supermarket employee. He was shot as he tried to make his way to safety. Saville said Soldier L or Soldier M shot Mr McElhinney, who was ""unarmed"", as he crawled away from the soldiers. It suggests they probably did so on the orders of senior officers. Widgery said the firer was probably ""Sergeant K"". ""He described two men crawling from the barricade in the direction of the door of the flats and said that the rear man was carrying a rifle. He fired one aimed shot but could not say whether it hit. ""Sergeant K obviously acted with responsibility and restraint."" A 41-year-old married man with six children, Bernard McGuigan was a factory worker and handyman. Shot as he went to the aid of Patrick Doherty, Mr McGuigan was waving a white handkerchief as a single bullet struck the back of his head. He fell to the ground, beside a 19-year-old paramedic. ""He raised his hand in the air and shouted 'Don't shoot, don't shoot'. And seconds later he was just shot and landed in my lap."" Saville found there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot an unarmed Mr McGuigan. Widgery said forensic tests had found lead residue on his hands and a scarf, consistent with the cloth having been wrapped around a revolver that had been fired. His widow denied the scarf belonged to her husband, and Widgery concluded it was not possible to say whether Mr McGuigan was using or carrying a weapon. A father-of-eight whose youngest was born eight days after his death on Bloody Sunday and named after him. Mr McKinney managed a junior soccer team and ran the city's Ritz rollerskating rink. The 35-year-old was shot as he tried to make his way to safety. The Saville Report concluded Soldier G, a private, shot an ""unarmed"" Gerard McKinney. That bullet passed through him before hitting another victim, Gerald Donaghey. Widgery said his death was one of the most confusing episodes of the day and that forensic tests found no evidence that Mr McKinney had handled weapons. A printer at the Derry Journal newspaper, the 27-year-old was the oldest of 10 and was engaged to be married. A keen amateur photographer, he had set out to film the Bloody Sunday march on a camera he had received as a Christmas present. Like Gerald McKinney (no relation), he was in a group and was shot as he ran for cover. ""Willie was not a stone-thrower, a bomber or a gunman. He had gone to the civil rights march in the role of amateur photographer,"" said the newspaper's tribute to him. Saville said there were four soldiers -  E, F, G or H -  who could have fired at Mr McKinney and another victim, Jim Wray. Up to five more people were injured by the same group of soldiers. All four soldiers insisted they had shot at people carrying bombs or firearms - claims rejected by Saville. The Widgery report put William McKinney's death in the same category as Gerald McKinney - both men had been shot without justification. In March 2019, the Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. On 2 July 2021,it was announcedthe prosecution of Soldier F would not continue. Reviews of the cases were prompted by the collapse of the trial in Belfast of two other veterans for Troubles-era offences. The PPS said that given ""related evidential features"", it concluded ""there was no longer a reasonable prospect of key evidence in proceedings against Soldier F... being ruled admissible"". The 19-year-old dock worker was the seventh of 13 children and the brother of Olympic boxer Charlie Nash. Mr Nash was shot in the chest near a barricade. Alexander Nash saw his son being shot and went to help him, and was then shot himself. Saville concluded that shots fired by Soldier P, Soldier J and Soldier E, caused the deaths of William Nash, as well as victims Michael McDaid and John Young. The inquiry rejected claims that the three soldiers fired because the men were armed. Soldier P told Widgery that he had returned fire after a man consistent with Mr Nash's description had fired first. ""In view of the site of the injury it is possible that Soldier P has given an accurate account of the death of Nash,"" said the report. The 22-year-old had worked in England for some time and was engaged to an English girl. Friends said he was outgoing and worked in a city bar and dancehall at weekends. His entire family had attended the march after going to Mass together. Mr Wray's death, like that of Gerald McKinney and William McKinney, happened during the chaos as people ran for cover. Saville said Mr Wray, who posed no great danger, was shot twice in the back and there were four soldiers who could have fired at him  - soldiers E, F, G or H. The second shot was probably fired as he lay wounded, said Saville, meaning there could have been ""no possible justification"". Widgery said there was no photographic evidence of what had happened to Mr Wray, but he had been in the general vicinity of where soldiers claimed that civilians had opened fired. On 2 July 2021,it was announcedthe prosecution of Soldier F for the murder of James Wray and William McKinney would not continue. The 17-year-old was the youngest of six and worked in a menswear shop. He was shot near a barricade as he tried to take cover. Saville concluded John Young was killed in the same shooting incident that claimed the lives of William Nash and Michael McDaid. He also said he was unarmed and shot by soldiers P, J or E. One witness told Widgery that Mr Young had gone to help another teenager who had been shot. Widgery said: ""Young was undoubtedly associated with the youths who were throwing missiles at the soldiers from the barricade and the track of the bullet suggests that he was facing the soldiers at the time.""

Half marathon postponement 'tough' for charities,"This video can not be played Gareth Evans had been hoping to run his first half marathon to raise cash for cancer charities The postponement of this year's Cardiff Half Marathon will be a further blow for charities, it is warned. Organisers Run 4 Wales say the decision to cancel the event for the third time was due to uncertainty over social distancing rules in Wales. Calon Hearts director Sharon Owen said she had been forced to work from her garage due to the pandemic. Ms Owen said the situation was ""pretty tough,"" adding charities seemed to be left out ""all the time"". The Welsh government said it was supporting the sector under the Cultural Recovery Fund, and Cardiff council said it supported Run 4 Wales' decision. 'I was happy to be a guinea pig' Loneliness a 'bigger health risk than smoking or obesity' Hundreds could be homeless when eviction ban ends She said Calon Hearts - a small charity which provides defibrillators and training to use them - gave up its office last year because she could not afford to keep it open, which was ""upsetting"". She said just herself and one other person now run the charity from her her garage, supported by ""amazing volunteers"". Calon Hearts director Sharon Owen said the pandemic had been ""horrible"" for the charity ""The weekend of lockdown saw us lose quite a lot of money in events people were organising for us, and I saw where it was going from there,"" Ms Owen toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""It makes you stop and think: 'What's going to happen?' I had a total meltdown in thinking: 'Where is this money going to come from?' ""It's an outdoor event and you see the scenes that have been happening in Wembley: 60,000 supporters, and then Ascot and Wimbledon, and we can't do events here in Wales outside."" Ms Owen said Calon Hearts is ""not like big charities that have got big reserves"". ""I'm now working from my garage,"" an emotional Ms Owen told Oliver Hides. ""But that is what you do because you believe in the cause."" Phae Jones, of Ty Hafan, agreed there would be a ""financial impact"" from the race suspension Phae Jones, of Ty Hafan hospice in the Vale of Glamorgan, agreed there would be a ""financial impact"" from the race suspension. ""It's a reminder that we rely heavily on voluntary raised income,"" she said. ""On the last two occasions, when the half marathon should have taken place, our supporters who were running would have generated more than Â£100,000, so it's an incredible sum of money."" Child cancer charity Latch Cymru would normally expect to raise about Â£10,000 from the event. ""When you see other events in stadiums going ahead and thousands of people sitting together in them, it's just frustrating really,"" added Latch general manager Iwan Jones. The decision to suspend the event was taken after discussions between the Welsh government and Cardiff council. Runner Gareth Evans was going to raise money for a cancer charity Runner Gareth Evans, from Cardiff, said he was ""disappointed"" it had been postponed again as it was going to be his first half marathon and he was due to raise money for a cancer charity. He added: ""My two-year-old niece was diagnosed with a brain tumour earlier this year and I wanted to do something for the charity that's been supporting my family."" It is now hoped two events will take place in 2022, with the second race in October. Run 4 Wales chief executive Matt Newman said on Thursday: ""At present there are no plans to relax the two-metre social distancing rules, which provides significant operational challenges for mass-participation event organisers"". Runners are being encouraged to participate in a ""virtual"" event instead. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We have been in discussion throughout the pandemic with Run 4 Wales, including in relation to the decision to postpone. ""Major events are a vital part of Wales' visitor economy and that is why we have looked to support the sector, including Run 4 Wales, under the Cultural Recovery Fund."" Since its foundation in 2003, the Cardiff Half Marathon has become the UK's third-largest race after the London Marathon and the Great North Run.

Flood-hit villagers call for compensation,"Aysha Powell still has sandbags outside her home, 18 months after the flood People whose homes were severely flooded during Storm Dennis have called for compensation. Flooding in Pentre was mainly caused by ""woody debris"" blocking a culvert on land managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW), a report by Rhondda Cynon Taf council has found. NRW said not all the debris was related to its tree felling above Pentre. Aysha Powell, whose home was flooded, said NRW ""should be ashamed of themselves"" and pay compensation. Ms Powell, whose home was one of 159 in Pentre hit by flooding in 2020, added: ""It is appalling. We want compensation because our insurances have gone up, it's ruined our homes, the stress. ""I know one neighbour whose son thought he was going to die that night - it's upsetting to hear children have gone through that and also some families haven't had a penny because they [insurance providers] said it's a natural disaster."" Pentrewas hit by flooding five times in 2020, affecting 159 homes and 10 businesses. Rainfall during Storm Dennis was described as unprecedented Another resident, Mair Hughes, added: ""I think all of us should be compensated... we should get compensation from somewhere for all the heartache we've had."" Village flooded for second time after tree felling Storm Dennis victims recall 'rollercoaster' year 'Flooding scared my son so he won't have a bath' Labour MP for Rhondda Chris Bryant added: ""The report is really thorough and it proves what we all knew, which is basically the way that NRW cut down the trees on the mountains and then left lots of brash, logs and chunks of wood on the mountain which ended up getting into the watercourse was what caused the flooding. ""NRW must pay compensation to people here, they can't just pretend it has nothing to do with them, the facts are there, clear as a pikestaff."" ConservativeMember of the Senedd(MS) Janet Finch-Saunders agreed NRW should compensate residents, adding: ""NRW and the Welsh government need to step up to the plate now and do need to admit some sort of liability."" The Welsh government has been asked to comment. Homes and businesses were hit by the flooding during Storm Dennis NRW disputes the report's ""inference that its harvesting operations were the primary cause of the flooding"", adding that the felling was done properly. The council said ""unprecedented rainfall"" during Storm Dennis, which hit Wales on 15 and 16 February 2020, caused river levels to rise to record highs, as the area recorded its most significant flooding since the 1970s. It said ""significant impacts"" were identified by the council's flood risk management team, including stories from affected residents and information collected by the public health team, NRW and Welsh Water. ""The main source of flooding in the initial flood was due to a significant blockage by woody materials... at the Pentre Road culvert inlet,"" said the report. A flood-damaged sofa left on a pavement in Pentre NRW said its own report found felling operations were ""not likely to have been the primary cause of the flooding"". ""We accept that woody material washed off the mountains above Pentre may have contributed to blockages to the culvert system, which also included a significant amount of soil and rock,"" it continued. ""However, a proportion of the woody debris was unrelated to NRW's felling operations and was washed down as a natural consequence of such an extreme event. ""NRW therefore disagrees with the report's inference that its harvesting operations were the primary cause of the flooding during Storm Dennis."" Action to reduce the risk of future flooding includes significant upgrades to the Pentre Road inlet to reduce potential blockages, with multiple overflow systems in case of another blockage. A permanently monitored alarm system and CCTV will remotely alert the council of any problems. A ""super catchpit"" at Pleasant Street, capable of containing six tonnes of debris, aims to reduce the risk of debris being carried to the lower parts of the culvert system. NRW's water and forest management plans will be reviewed, including the treatment of tree clippings and refuse close to an ordinary watercourse. Welsh Water said its network ""was operating as it should have done during the storms"".Â Blocked culvert main cause of flood, report finds Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared jail or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

The Welsh government said it was supporting the sector under the Cultural Recovery Fund, and Cardiff council said it supported Run 4 Wales' decision. 'I was happy to be a guinea pig' Loneliness a 'bigger health risk than smoking or obesity' Hundreds could be homeless when eviction ban ends She said Calon Hearts - a small charity which provides defibrillators and training to use them - gave up its office last year because she could not afford to keep it open, which was ""upsetting"". She said just herself and one other person now run the charity from her her garage, supported by ""amazing volunteers"". Calon Hearts director Sharon Owen said the pandemic had been ""horrible"" for the charity ""The weekend of lockdown saw us lose quite a lot of money in events people were organising for us, and I saw where it was going from there,"" Ms Owen toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""It makes you stop and think: 'What's going to happen?' I had a total meltdown in thinking: 'Where is this money going to come from?' ""It's an outdoor event and you see the scenes that have been happening in Wembley: 60,000 supporters, and then Ascot and Wimbledon, and we can't do events here in Wales outside."" Ms Owen said Calon Hearts is ""not like big charities that have got big reserves"". ""I'm now working from my garage,"" an emotional Ms Owen told Oliver Hides. ""But that is what you do because you believe in the cause."" Phae Jones, of Ty Hafan, agreed there would be a ""financial impact"" from the race suspension Phae Jones, of Ty Hafan hospice in the Vale of Glamorgan, agreed there would be a ""financial impact"" from the race suspension. ""It's a reminder that we rely heavily on voluntary raised income,"" she said. ""On the last two occasions, when the half marathon should have taken place, our supporters who were running would have generated more than Â£100,000, so it's an incredible sum of money."" Child cancer charity Latch Cymru would normally expect to raise about Â£10,000 from the event. ""When you see other events in stadiums going ahead and thousands of people sitting together in them, it's just frustrating really,"" added Latch general manager Iwan Jones. The decision to suspend the event was taken after discussions between the Welsh government and Cardiff council. Runner Gareth Evans was going to raise money for a cancer charity Runner Gareth Evans, from Cardiff, said he was ""disappointed"" it had been postponed again as it was going to be his first half marathon and he was due to raise money for a cancer charity. He added: ""My two-year-old niece was diagnosed with a brain tumour earlier this year and I wanted to do something for the charity that's been supporting my family."" It is now hoped two events will take place in 2022, with the second race in October. Run 4 Wales chief executive Matt Newman said on Thursday: ""At present there are no plans to relax the two-metre social distancing rules, which provides significant operational challenges for mass-participation event organisers"". Runners are being encouraged to participate in a ""virtual"" event instead. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We have been in discussion throughout the pandemic with Run 4 Wales, including in relation to the decision to postpone. ""Major events are a vital part of Wales' visitor economy and that is why we have looked to support the sector, including Run 4 Wales, under the Cultural Recovery Fund."" Since its foundation in 2003, the Cardiff Half Marathon has become the UK's third-largest race after the London Marathon and the Great North Run.

"Labour is back after by-election win, says StarmerSir Keir Starmer hails Kim Leadbeater's victory in Batley and Spen as ""just the start"" for his party.UK Politics","This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""What a fantastic victory... of hope over division"" Sir Keir Starmer has declared ""Labour is back"" after the party held on at the Batley and Spen by-election. The Labour leader headed to the West Yorkshire constituency to celebrate Kim Leadbeater's narrow 323-vote win. He said it was a victory for ""hope over division, and decency over hatred"", after a bitter campaign, and ""just the start"" for Labour. Ms Leadbeater will now represent the seat previously held by her sister Jo Cox, who was murdered there in 2016. Sir Keir hailed her ""incredible courage"" in standing for the seat, and claimed ""Labour is coming home"". Writing in the Guardian,external, he also promised the by-election would be ""a turning point, a sign that the politics of division and dishonesty won't win out, that unity and decency can"". Kuennsberg: Is politics starting to return to normal? Fraught by-election concludes in dramatic fashion Who is new Batley and Spen MP Kim Leadbeater? Voters react to Batley and Spen by-election The result will come as a relief to Sir Keir, who has been under pressure following recent election defeats for his party. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Conservative candidate Ryan Stephenson ran an ""incredibly positive campaign"" and ""did very well to reduce a longstanding Labour majority"". Speaking at a Downing Street press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Mr Johnson claimed the by-election result was the ""third biggest swing in favour of the government since the War"". Ms Leadbeater took the seat with 13,296 votes, giving her a slim victory over Mr Stephenson with 12,973. Former Labour and Respect MP George Galloway, standing for the Workers Party of Britain party, came third with 8,264. The former Bradford West MP had sought to win support from the seat's Labour voters, with the aim of toppling Sir Keir as Labour leader. This video can not be played Kim Leadbeater MP: ''If I can be half the MP that Jo was, I know that I'll do her proud'' His campaign had targeted voters unhappy at the party's stance on issues including the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and the disputed territory of Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan. An ethnically diverse seat, about 20% of the population is from an Asian background, with just under 19% being Muslim. Speaking in Cleckheaton, Sir Keir said Ms Leadbeater had won despite a split in Labour's vote, because ""former Tory voters voted for her"". ""The Tories had a clean hit, nobody was going against them, and they didn't win,"" he added. Writing in the Guardian on Saturday, he said: ""And as we emerge from restrictions, there is now a real opportunity to harness the solidarity and national spirit that we've seen over the last year. ""To make sure that after the last year of sacrifice, we build a more united, fair, and secure country. ""To rebuild our economy and our public services, to bring our communities back together and to put honesty and integrity back at the heart of our politics."" Sir Keir was reportedly facing a potential challenge from his deputy Angela Rayner if the party lost another northern English constituency to the Tories. It comes after the Tories took Hartlepool, a once rock-solid Labour seat in May, alongside losing more than 300 councillors in England's local elections. But Andrew Scattergood, co-chair of the Momentum campaign set up to campaign for former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said the party could not ""portray this as a massive victory"". ""We squeaked it over the line and there are some serious concerns,"" he told the BBC News Channel. The Batley and Spen result will take some pressure off Sir Keir Starmer. The atmosphere in Labour circles at Westminster since May's local elections has been febrile. Some Labour MPs fear things can only get worse - that more seats that were once safe are at risk. There was a swing of nearly 3% from Labour to the Conservatives in Batley and Spen - if a similar swing was reproduced nationally, at a general election, Labour would have lost 11 seats. Labour know their party's problems go deeper than the question of leadership - but preparations were being made for a worse result in Batley and Spen. Read Iain's full analysis Sixteen candidates in total ran in the contest. Turnout was 47.6%, with 37,786 verified ballots cast out of a total electorate of 79,373. The vote was triggered after the previous Labour MP for the seat, Tracy Brabin, became West Yorkshire's first elected mayor in May. She first won the seat in a by-election after Ms Cox was murdered by a far-right extremist in Birstall, part of the constituency, in 2016. The Conservatives fought a relatively low-key campaign, with Mr Stephenson saying he was focused on talking to voters about ""the issues that matter here"". Conservative Party co-chair Amanda Milling said it had been a ""disappointing result"" for her party. She said therecent resignation of Matt Hancockas health secretary after breaking social distancing rules was ""one of a number of different issues that came up"" that had been raised by voters on the doorstep. But she added that for her party to ""run this close"" was still ""exceptional"", given it has been in government since 2010. Are you a Batley and Spen voter? How did you vote and why?

England doctors consider overtime ban over pay,"Senior doctors in England will be consulted on taking industrial action if the government's 1% pay rise offer is not improved. The British Medical Association says it will ask members about stopping paid and unpaid overtime if there is not a figure nearer 4%. The Royal College of Nursing has already said it will consider balloting over industrial action. It has called for a 12.5% pay rise this year. Pay review bodies covering most NHS workers have made recommendations which have not yet been published. In England, ministers must decide whether in the light of those reports they will increase their proposed 1% offer. NHS 1% pay rise is 'as much as we can give' - PM Hancock defends 1% NHS pay rise after strike threats Nurses prepare for strikes over 1% NHS pay rise Have you been affected by the issues in this story? Share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Industrial action by consultants would involve stopping paid and unpaid overtime, which would affect patient clinics and attempts by hospitals to reduce waiting lists, the BMA says. It argues that senior doctors are exhausted and feel undervalued because of previous below inflation pay rises. If industrial action is taken it would be the first by consultants since the 1970s apart from a day of action over pensions in 2012. Mike Henley, a consultant urologist in the East Midlands, says consultants' pay has been steadily eroded compared to other salaries in the public sector. ""I want to get back to fairness. Like everyone, I would rather not stop doing overtime,"" he says. ""But consultants do incredibly busy and stressful jobs - and we are underpaid compared to lawyers, for example. ""I don't expect to be paid like someone working in the City, but I don't expect to have a third of my pay removed either."" Mr Henley said the pandemic had made his job even more difficult and caring for patients had become more complex. ""For many, its been like wartime medicine,"" he says. The Department of Health said the government was committed to a wage rise for NHS staff, including consultants, when pay increases elsewhere in the public sector had been paused. The health department recommended the 1% pay award to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. It would cover nearly all hospital staff, but not GPs and dentists. Nurses have described the proposed pay rise as ""insulting"", with unions threatening strike action and warning that the ""pitiful"" rise may lead staff to quit their jobs - worsening staffing issues in the health service. Talks on pay are underway in Wales where the government has said it will not set a 1% ceiling on pay awards. In Northern Ireland all NHS staff have been offered a Â£500 bonus this year. Bonuses have also been offered in Scotland where longer-term pay negotiations are ongoing. Consultants, at the top end on NHS salary scales because of their years of medical experience and leadership, have not been minded to get involved in public pay disputes till now. The possible overtime bans could slow down attempts to reduce hospital waiting lists. This could be seen as sabre rattling and a bid to sway ministers ahead of their wage announcement. But it is indicative of the likely level of anger across the NHS workforce if the government response to the pay review bodies' recommendations is not far off the original 1% proposal.

Breaking|Breaking newsMan charged with assault over Whitty incidentA group of men were seen accosting England's chief medical officer in a park on Sunday.UK,"Estate agent Lewis Hughes in video footage from the incident on Sunday evening A man has been charged with common assault after England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty was accosted by a group of men in a London park. Lewis Hughes, 23, of Wigton Way in Romford, east London, was charged on Thursday over the incident, which took place on Sunday, the Met Police said. Officers spoke to the victim, who had not suffered any injuries, and checked his welfare, the force added. They then reviewed video footage that emerged later. Mr Hughes was charged by postal requisition and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 30 July. ""At approximately 19:20hrs on Sunday, 27 June officers in St James's Park became aware of a man being accosted by a group of men,"" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. ""Officers subsequently reviewed video footage which emerged after the incident and the matter was referred to the Public Order Crime Team. Enquiries continue."" A video of the incident had been widely shared on social media. Chris Whitty: The man with our lives in his hands BBC Radio 4 - Profile, Prof Chris Whitty Mr Hughes previously apologised for any ""upset"" caused and said he had lost his job as an estate agent over the incident. ""If I made [Prof Whitty] feel uncomfortable, which it does look like I did, then I am sorry to him for that,"" he told the Sun. Police previously said that when they spoke to Prof Whitty at the time he did not wish to make any allegations. It was not the first time Prof Whitty has been filmed being confronted by a member of the public. Earlier this month, a man in Oxford accused him of lying to the public about coronavirus, while in February a man accosted the chief medical officer in Westminster. And a group of people gathered outside what was apparently Prof Whitty's London flat on Saturday, chanting and shouting. Prof Chris Whitty (left) has regularly appeared alongside the PM at televised Covid briefings Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, he has been front and centre of the UK's decision-making and communication of messages to the public. He took on the chief medical officer role in October 2019, and until the coronavirus threat emerged, had never done broadcast interviews or held press briefings or conferences. One of the country's foremost experts in infectious diseases, he has worked as a doctor in Africa and Asia, as well as the UK. He continues to practise medicine at University College London Hospitals, where he was spotted doing a shift over Christmas. His mother was a teacher and his father was a diplomat who was murdered by terrorists in Greece after they flagged him down in his car in 1984.

Wildfire burns down most of Canada heatwave villageThe village of Lytton this week recorded the country's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F).,"This video can not be played Watch: Lytton, British Columbia residents flee wildfires A wildfire has burned 90% of the village that recorded Canada's highest ever temperature, the local MP says. Brad Vis said the fire had caused extensive damage to Lytton, in British Columbia, and to surrounding critical infrastructure. Jan Polderman, mayor of Lytton, told the BBC he had been ""lucky to get out with my own life"". ""There won't be very much left of Lytton,"" he said. ""There was fire everywhere."" Mr Poldermantold the BBC's Newshour programme his town was engulfed by a ""wall of fire"". Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves.However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Lytton this week recorded the country's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F). And abnormally high temperatures have been recorded in swathes of North America. British Columbia, in western Canada, recorded 486 deaths over five days compared with an average of 165 in normal times. Visual guide to the heatwave's causes How to look after yourself in hot weather Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe blamed the extreme weather. The western province had seen only three heat-related deaths over the past three to five years. This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" Many of those who died, Ms Lapointe said, had been living alone in unventilated homes. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas of Canada but there is not much respite for inland regions. The weather system is now moving eastwards over the Prairie provinces - Alberta and Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba have been placed under Environment Canada heat warnings. Residents fled on Wednesday, many without their belongings, as smoke and flame engulfed the village, which is home to about 250 people and located about 260km (162 miles) north-east of Vancouver. ""Within about 15 minutes the whole town was engulfed in flame,"" Mayor Polderman told the BBC. ""People basically just grabbed their pets, grabbed their keys and got into their car and fled.""

Winds of up to 71km/h (44 mph) were pushing the fire north into the community on Wednesday evening, CBC meteorologist Johanna Wagstaffe reported. Hot, dry and windy conditions in the area could mean the fire was moving at 10 or even 20km/h. The speed of the fire in Lytton meant many people fled without their possessions In a social media post on Thursday, MP Brad Vis said he would not be attending Canada Day activities because he was devoting all his time to the emergency situation. ""There are reports of several injuries. The situation is ongoing,"" he wrote. Residents were being directed to nearby communities where reception centres were being set up, while the British Columbia Wildfire Service was diverting crews and equipment from other areas to respond to the fire. Jean McKay, who left the First Nations community of Kanaka Bar, about 15km from Lytton, with her 22-year-old daughter Deirdre, told CBChow hard emotionally it had been to leave their home.,external ""I cried. My daughter cried. She said, 'I don't even know why I grabbed my key. We might not even have a home.' I said, 'Yeah I know. As long as we're together we'll survive.' I just pray that our houses are OK."" ""You can't even comprehend it,"" Lytton evacuee Edith Loring-Kuhanga told CBC Radio. ""Our entire town is gone."" Before the fire, Lytton had recordedthe highest temperature ever seen in Canada on three consecutive days,external. In Vancouver, British Columbia's biggest city, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people since Friday. The city has opened 25 air-conditioned cooling centres where people have been resting or working from their laptops. ""I have no air conditioning, only a fan at home - I came here just to work where it's cool,"" one woman, who gave her name only as Lou, told AFP news agency. Wildfires were also spotted in Central Okanagan, British Columbia In the US state of Oregon,health officials tied more than 60 deaths to the extreme heat,externalwhile in Washington state, 20 deaths were attributed to the weather, the Associated Press reports. Seattle, Portland and other cities broke all-time heat records, which climbed above 46C in places. Both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden warned of the threat of wildfires, with Mr Biden telling governors of western US states it was as ""severe as it's ever been"". I've heard from scientists who say that in just a few days they'll be able to determine just how much human driven warming has contributed to the searing temperatures seen in British Columbia. One interesting piece of evidence is the lack of respite that night brings - recent temperatures at midnight in BC have been 2C warmer than the normal summer daytime figure. Researchers say this combination of day and night-time heat is very dangerous for humans - a studypublished last year,externalindicated that these compound events are closely linked to emissions of greenhouse gases. Natural variability and local factors such as sea breezes can raise or limit the impacts of extreme heat.  But the bigger picture is the rising thermometer of global heating is impacting all events. ""Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change,"" Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford told the BBC. ""Climate change is definitely one of the drivers of the intensity of this Canadian heatwave - but it is not the only one and determining how much it impacts it, is a work in progress."" Even if they can't directly attribute this heatwave to climate change, experts say the fingerprints of global heating are all over it.

"Asylum queue nine times longer than in 2010There are 65,000 people waiting for asylum decisions from the UK government, figures suggest.","Patricia, now 19, applied for asylum two years ago and is among 65,000 people awaiting a decision The number of migrants waiting in the UK for their asylum claims to be processed was nine times higher by the end of last year than it was in 2010. One is Patricia, 19, who fled war and abuse in Liberia and says her mental health has suffered during the two years she has waited for a decision. There are currently 65,000 people in the queue, official figures obtained by the Refugee Council suggest. The Home Office said it had a plan to ""fix the broken asylum system"". Asylum seeker delays continue to rise Asylum claim delays 'unacceptably high' The Refugee Council obtained the figures from the Home Office under Freedom of Information legislation. The organisation's analysis shows the pandemic has contributed to a backlog which rose by a quarter in 2020. The figures show: the number of people waiting for an initial decision for more than a year rose almost tenfold from 3,588 in 2010 to 33,016 in 2020 the number of children awaiting an initial decision for more than a year rose more than twelvefold from 563 children in 2010 to 6,887 in 2020 and 55 applicants who applied as children have been waiting five years or more for a decision. Asylum seekers have told the BBC how being in limbo has affected their mental health. Patel pledges overhaul of asylum seeker rules Can Priti Patel's asylum plan work? Patricia, who asked not to use her real name, told the BBC she was given up by her family as a baby in war-torn Liberia. In her teens, abuse from her foster family forced her to run away. People traffickers brought her to Britain two years ago, aged 17, and she claimed asylum. Initially, officials said they would respond to her application ""as soon as possible"" and talked about looking at the case ""for 45 days"". ""The 45 days has taken more than two years now,"" she says. Having her life put on hold for so long ""has had a big effect,"" she says. ""I can't sleep well. I can't do anything good that I have to do"". Without an asylum decision, she cannot work, find a permanent home or take part in the vocational part of her college course. Having lost touch with her family years ago, Patricia has no support and she describes the wait as a ""very tough time for me"". Kemal was a maths teacher before he said he had to flee persecution by the Turkish government because of his links to the bannedGulenist movement. The only contact he has had with his wife and children for two years is through the internet. He lives in shared accommodation in Gateshead but the Home Office has yet to provide an initial ruling on whether his claim to have suffered political persecution in Turkey entitles him to refugee status. He says the wait has made him anxious and depressed. ""I was down, gloomy every day... for example last year, around three months... I just cannot sleep, something happening in my throat... I don't know what's happening. ""If I didn't have faith, I could do myself bad things."" Children are among new arrivals seeking asylum in the UK Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon says the backlog should be top of the agenda when it comes to reform of the asylum system. ""If you look at what the government has published, its proposals to reform the asylum system, there's nothing in it that talks about backlogs and delay, there's nothing in it which sets out a plan to address this problem."" The Home Office told the BBC it had a plan to ""fix the broken asylum system, which has been abused by those who have come here illegally, leading to increased numbers in the system and preventing genuine cases being looked at quickly. ""This is the most significant overhaul of our asylum system in decades, which will increase the fairness and efficacy of our system so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum. ""We are working to streamline cases and have already made significant progress in prioritising those with acute vulnerability but we are determined to clear the backlog to help speed up decisions and prevent people remaining in the system for long periods of time.""

ITV condemns deaths threats to Love Island star,"ITV has condemned death threats sent to Love Island contestant Chloe Burrows, calling them ""wholly unacceptable"". On Wednesday night's show, Burrows chose to recouple with Aaron Francis, leaving Shannon Singh single. The move resulted in Shannon departing the dating programme, causing people to send threats to Burrows online, with some encouraging her to kill herself. In a message posted to her Instagram, the 25-year-old's family described the trolling as ""absolutely disgusting"". ""This morning we woke up to yet another DM [direct message] encouraging Chloe to kill herself - there have been hundreds,"" they wrote. ""Not only that, but people are flooding her inbox threatening to kill her themselves. People... this is a game show, there is a cash prize!"" Love Island is now in its seventh series The family said they understood the ""frustration"" around Singh's eviction - but that Burrows, from Bicester in Oxfordshire, ""does not deserve to die"" as a result. ""Have the deaths of Sophie, Mike, and Caroline taught us nothing?"" they added, referring to former contestants Sophie Gradon, Mike Thalassitis and ex-host Caroline Flack. All three died by suicide, although their deaths were not linked to the show or social media trolling. In a statement posted to Twitter, ITV said: ""We want Love Island to be a positive experience for all of our cast and their friends and family members.

"Bars and restaurants struggle with staff isolatingThe industry wants a ""test to release"" system to solve worker shortages as cases rise.","Becky and David Salisbury worry that they could face repeated closures under the current rules Becky Salisbury and her husband David were in the car on Sunday when they got the news: one of the staff at their pub, the Alford Arms in Berkhamsted, had tested positive for Covid. So, after a rollercoaster year, overhauling how they work and installing every hygiene measure they could think of, the pub is now closed again, for 10 days. ""It's frustrating,"" says Becky. ""Having made some profit recently with nice weather and a good garden, unfortunately it's all going to go down the pan."" Becky and David are far from the only ones in this situation. Pubs and restaurants across the country are finding operating day-to-day a minefield. It only takes one case on site, and the NHS Test and Trace alerts come thick and fast, instructing staff to isolate. Without them, venues can't open. It isn't sustainable, the industry says, especially as cases continue to rise so rapidly. The government says self-isolation remains an essential part of the effort to control the spread of the virus. Restaurant stops serving lunch due to lack of staff Where have all the UK workers gone? A million more off furlough as scheme winds down Ian Payne, chairman of the nationwide Stonegate group of pubs, wrote on social media that the chain has around 1,000 people off, because they had been alerted by NHS Test and Trace, and 15 sites closed, because the management team were self-isolating. The Wetherspoon pub chain said six members of its staff had tested positive, leading to 69 further employees being required to self-isolate. Nick Collins, chief executive of the chain Loungers, which operates 173 cafe-bars, has also had to temporarily close some sites, and reallocate staff between venues. ""It's really challenging,"" he said, but he now fears that it ""could get worse"" as rates of the virus continue to rise. Nick Collins says test and trace disruptions are incredibly frustrating As a result, the body representing pubs and restaurants, UKHospitality, is calling on the government to reconsider the rules on isolation. ""For some weeks, we have been telling government about the severe staff shortages at venues,"" said UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. She said some team members were being told to isolate even if they hadn't shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive. Staff in the hospitality industry often work long hours UKHospitality would like to see a testing system that monitors whether staff are still negative for the virus, but allows them to continue working. ""If the system remains as it is, there's a threat of mass isolations, which would hugely damage trade, putting many companies at risk of failure,"" said Ms Nicholls. ""A strong focus on testing when cases are identified, rather than isolating fit and healthy people, would help to avoid mass isolations,"" she said. The government is running a pilot scheme to see whether allowing people who have been exposed to the virus to take daily tests instead of isolating is effective at controlling its spread. The government would continue to support the hospitality industry, but self-isolation was currently an essential part of the strategy for protecting the public, a government spokesperson said. ""By self-isolating, people are helping to break the chains of transmission while protecting friends and family from the virus and minimising the risk of further disruption in schools,"" the spokesperson said. Without a change to the rules, pubs such as Becky and David's, which cannot switch staff between multiple sites, fear they could end up yo-yoing between being open and closed all summer. ""I think the risk to all hospitality of having more than one closure this summer is really high,"" says Becky. ""We've done everything we can and we are still utterly vulnerable."" ""We have a machine that cleans the air. The staff wear hand cream that gives them four hours of protection. We clean religiously. But there's no way I can protect the staff from being pinged,"" she says. She has gently asked her team to be as careful as they can outside work, but they are mostly young and she says she can't ask them not to see their friends. Yet she knows that is the age group where levels of the virus are highest. ""We're reopening on Tuesday and we're really excited. But there's every chance someone could be in contact on Wednesday and we'd have to close again. It could happen,"" she says. Where have all the UK workers gone?

Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves.However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Lytton this week recorded the country's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F). And abnormally high temperatures have been recorded in swathes of North America. British Columbia, in western Canada, recorded 486 deaths over five days compared with an average of 165 in normal times. Visual guide to the heatwave's causes How to look after yourself in hot weather Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe blamed the extreme weather. The western province had seen only three heat-related deaths over the past three to five years. This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" Many of those who died, Ms Lapointe said, had been living alone in unventilated homes. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas of Canada but there is not much respite for inland regions. The weather system is now moving eastwards over the Prairie provinces - Alberta and Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba have been placed under Environment Canada heat warnings. Residents fled on Wednesday, many without their belongings, as smoke and flame engulfed the village, which is home to about 250 people and located about 260km (162 miles) north-east of Vancouver. ""Within about 15 minutes the whole town was engulfed in flame,"" Mayor Polderman told the BBC. ""People basically just grabbed their pets, grabbed their keys and got into their car and fled.""

Winds of up to 71km/h (44 mph) were pushing the fire north into the community on Wednesday evening, CBC meteorologist Johanna Wagstaffe reported. Hot, dry and windy conditions in the area could mean the fire was moving at 10 or even 20km/h. The speed of the fire in Lytton meant many people fled without their possessions In a social media post on Thursday, MP Brad Vis said he would not be attending Canada Day activities because he was devoting all his time to the emergency situation. ""There are reports of several injuries. The situation is ongoing,"" he wrote. Residents were being directed to nearby communities where reception centres were being set up, while the British Columbia Wildfire Service was diverting crews and equipment from other areas to respond to the fire. Jean McKay, who left the First Nations community of Kanaka Bar, about 15km from Lytton, with her 22-year-old daughter Deirdre, told CBChow hard emotionally it had been to leave their home.,external ""I cried. My daughter cried. She said, 'I don't even know why I grabbed my key. We might not even have a home.' I said, 'Yeah I know. As long as we're together we'll survive.' I just pray that our houses are OK."" ""You can't even comprehend it,"" Lytton evacuee Edith Loring-Kuhanga told CBC Radio. ""Our entire town is gone."" Before the fire, Lytton had recordedthe highest temperature ever seen in Canada on three consecutive days,external. In Vancouver, British Columbia's biggest city, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people since Friday. The city has opened 25 air-conditioned cooling centres where people have been resting or working from their laptops. ""I have no air conditioning, only a fan at home - I came here just to work where it's cool,"" one woman, who gave her name only as Lou, told AFP news agency. Wildfires were also spotted in Central Okanagan, British Columbia In the US state of Oregon,health officials tied more than 60 deaths to the extreme heat,externalwhile in Washington state, 20 deaths were attributed to the weather, the Associated Press reports. Seattle, Portland and other cities broke all-time heat records, which climbed above 46C in places. Both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden warned of the threat of wildfires, with Mr Biden telling governors of western US states it was as ""severe as it's ever been"". I've heard from scientists who say that in just a few days they'll be able to determine just how much human driven warming has contributed to the searing temperatures seen in British Columbia. One interesting piece of evidence is the lack of respite that night brings - recent temperatures at midnight in BC have been 2C warmer than the normal summer daytime figure. Researchers say this combination of day and night-time heat is very dangerous for humans - a studypublished last year,externalindicated that these compound events are closely linked to emissions of greenhouse gases. Natural variability and local factors such as sea breezes can raise or limit the impacts of extreme heat.  But the bigger picture is the rising thermometer of global heating is impacting all events. ""Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change,"" Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford told the BBC. ""Climate change is definitely one of the drivers of the intensity of this Canadian heatwave - but it is not the only one and determining how much it impacts it, is a work in progress."" Even if they can't directly attribute this heatwave to climate change, experts say the fingerprints of global heating are all over it.

By-election campaigners 'egged',"Tracy Brabin praised police for their swift response Labour activists campaigning ahead of the Batley and Spen by-election have been pelted with eggs and kicked in the head, the region's mayor has said. Tracy Brabin said she was leafleting for Labour in Batley on Sunday, when her group was ""followed, verbally abused and physically assaulted"". The West Yorkshire mayor and former Batley and Spen MP said campaigners included young people and the elderly. West Yorkshire Police has issued an image of a man wanted over the attacks. The force said it sought to speak to the man in relation to eggs being thrown at canvassers in Whitaker Street, Batley, at about 16.30 BST on Sunday. It said four offences of assault had been recorded, including one in which a man suffered minor injuries from being punched and kicked. The force said it believed three suspects, described as Asian men wearing hooded tops, were involved. More stories from around Yorkshire Ms Brabin - who also holds the police and crime commissioner role for the region - praised officers for their swift response. She said: ""The group I was with included young people and the elderly. I witnessed them being egged, pushed and forced to the ground and kicked in the head. ""We know why tensions are rising in our streets. Those who want to sow division are not welcome in our community. ""The actions of these people do not represent the Batley and Spen I know. We are kinder than this."" West Yorkshire Police has issued a CCTV still of a man who may have information about the attacks in Batley Speaking on a visit to Batley, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think it's appalling that people should face abuse of that kind, absolutely appalling."" Sunday's attacks followed a video shared online of Labour candidate Kim Leadbeater - the sister of former MP Jo Cox, who was murdered in the constituency in 2016 - being shouted at in the street by a man on Friday. In the clip, he raises his voice at her before she is pursued by a group to a car. Halifax Labour MP Holly Lynch, who has also been campaigning in the constituency, said: ""There has been a series of increasingly serious and violent attacks in recent days and this is absolutely unacceptable. ""Lawless thugs are seeking to intimidate and attack those involved in the proper democratic process."" Voters in Batley will go to the polls on 1 July Police attended a demonstration in Batley on Saturday, in which about 400 people took part and passed off ""largely without incident"". Three arrests were made - two for public order offences and one for possession of an offensive weapon. The by-election, triggered when Ms Brabin stood down following her election as West Yorkshire's mayor, takes place on Thursday.

Concern over boosters as GPs 'already stretched'GPs could be asked to deliver boosters to vulnerable patients who are eligible for the flu vaccine.Scotland,"All adults aged 50 and over in the UK are likely to be eligible for a third booster dose of a Covid vaccine in the autumn GPs in Scotland are concerned about delivering Covid booster jabs as they are working ""beyond full capacity"". Older age groups could receive the third vaccine when they see their GP for a flu jab ahead of winter. But the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) in Scotland said there was a risk in balancing boosters with seeing other vulnerable patients. The Scottish government said it would work with GPs and health boards to plan the programme in line with advice. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) gave the NHS the green light tostart planning a booster programme, advising that they will give additional protection against new variants before winter. More than 30 million of the most vulnerable should receive a third dose, including all adults aged 50 and over, and anyone younger who qualifies for a flu jab. Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch told the BBC the JCVI was trialling whether GPs could give boosters to older people attending flu vaccine appointments. However, Dr David Shackles, who jointly chairs RCGP Scotland, said general practice had been expressing serious concerns about the ""already stretched workforce"" for some time. He said: ""General practice is already working beyond full capacity and GPs have had unprecedented demand for appointments due to backlog. ""We understand the risk is balancing the need to vaccinate those requiring flu and Covid-19 boosters against requirement to see patients with acute problems and chronic illnesses that they may have put off dealing with during the height of the pandemic."" Dr Shackles reiterated calls for ""urgent action"" to boost the workforce, adding that GPs would work hard to make sure all patients could access the vaccine. Covid cases in Scotland surpass 4,000 for first time NHS plans booster jab for those 50 and over Tayside patient numbers almost double overnight Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The Scottish government said it welcomed the advice from the JCVI and would offer the booster to priority groups from September. A spokeswoman said: ""The committee will consider additional scientific data as it becomes available over the next few months, ahead of formulating final advice. ""In the meantime we will work closely with NHS boards and GPs to plan for this potential booster campaign, in line with this interim advice."" It comes as Scotland's daily Covid casessurpassed 4,000 for the first timesince mass testing began. Third wave cases began to surpass January's peak towards the end of June. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously said the government would monitor the impact cases had on hospital admissions - which rose from from 235 on Wednesday to 275 on Thursday. Scotland's largest health boards have said it is ""too early"" to share plans for a future booster programme. However, NHS Lothian confirmed it was looking to use some current mass centres alongside additional, more localised venues. NHS Tayside said it planned to continue its blended model of using GP surgeries and local centres. Prof Jason Leitch told BBC Scotland that plans could involve younger age groups using pharmacies, mass vaccination centres or mobile vaccination units. He said: ""It's one of the reasons why the joint committee have given us early notice - so we can work that out in consultation with GP practices and [health] boards whether we need to keep some of our mass vaccination centres. ""One of the things they've said and are doing trials about this is, can we give it at the same time as the flu vaccine? That would be very convenient. So everybody who gets the flu vaccine already on the same visit could also have a Covid vaccine. ""Companies are even working on putting the two vaccines into the one vial - they haven't done that quite yet but the first trials of giving the two vaccines together suggest [they are] both safe and effective. That will continue over the summer."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What rules are changing, and when? CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

"England senior doctors could strike over payConsultants will be consulted on industrial action if the 1% pay rise offer is not improved, says union.Health","Senior doctors in England will be consulted on taking industrial action if the government's 1% pay rise offer is not improved. The British Medical Association says it will ask members about stopping paid and unpaid overtime if there is not a figure nearer 4%. The Royal College of Nursing has already said it will consider balloting over industrial action. It has called for a 12.5% pay rise this year. Pay review bodies covering most NHS workers have made recommendations which have not yet been published. In England, ministers must decide whether in the light of those reports they will increase their proposed 1% offer. NHS 1% pay rise is 'as much as we can give' - PM Hancock defends 1% NHS pay rise after strike threats Nurses prepare for strikes over 1% NHS pay rise Have you been affected by the issues in this story? Share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Industrial action by consultants would involve stopping paid and unpaid overtime, which would affect patient clinics and attempts by hospitals to reduce waiting lists, the BMA says. It argues that senior doctors are exhausted and feel undervalued because of previous below inflation pay rises. If industrial action is taken it would be the first by consultants since the 1970s apart from a day of action over pensions in 2012. Mike Henley, a consultant urologist in the East Midlands, says consultants' pay has been steadily eroded compared to other salaries in the public sector. ""I want to get back to fairness. Like everyone, I would rather not stop doing overtime,"" he says. ""But consultants do incredibly busy and stressful jobs - and we are underpaid compared to lawyers, for example. ""I don't expect to be paid like someone working in the City, but I don't expect to have a third of my pay removed either."" Mr Henley said the pandemic had made his job even more difficult and caring for patients had become more complex. ""For many, its been like wartime medicine,"" he says. The Department of Health said the government was committed to a wage rise for NHS staff, including consultants, when pay increases elsewhere in the public sector had been paused. The health department recommended the 1% pay award to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. It would cover nearly all hospital staff, but not GPs and dentists. Nurses have described the proposed pay rise as ""insulting"", with unions threatening strike action and warning that the ""pitiful"" rise may lead staff to quit their jobs - worsening staffing issues in the health service. Talks on pay are underway in Wales where the government has said it will not set a 1% ceiling on pay awards. In Northern Ireland all NHS staff have been offered a Â£500 bonus this year. Bonuses have also been offered in Scotland where longer-term pay negotiations are ongoing. Consultants, at the top end on NHS salary scales because of their years of medical experience and leadership, have not been minded to get involved in public pay disputes till now. The possible overtime bans could slow down attempts to reduce hospital waiting lists. This could be seen as sabre rattling and a bid to sway ministers ahead of their wage announcement. But it is indicative of the likely level of anger across the NHS workforce if the government response to the pay review bodies' recommendations is not far off the original 1% proposal.
