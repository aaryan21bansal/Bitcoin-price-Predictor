Laura Kuenssberg says the reshuffle did not ""entirely go to script"" given that of the three ministers she wanted to move, one quit, one persuaded her that he should stay and the other wasn't even asked to move. At the end of the day, she says the cabinet does not look very different from how it did this morning in terms of its gender balance and diversity. While this was never intended to be a transformative moment - since the key figures in the PM's top team were all staying put - the BBC's political editor says No 10 will hope that day two of the reshuffle on Tuesday, when we will see changes to junior and middle ranks - goes more smoothly.

Andrea Leadsom and Liz Truss are expected to stay in their positions in government, the BBC understands. The prime minister is likely to have conversations confirming this with them on the phone later this evening. Andrea Leadsom is currently the Leader of the House of Commons and Liz Truss is Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Both attend cabinet. Jeremy Corbyn has told a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party that the reshuffle was a ""pointless and lacklustre"" PR stunt. ""In 2018, the impact of Tory austerity is hitting home with the public, most tragically with the most serious NHS winter crisis yet,"" he said. ""And yet the government's big plan for the new year is to dodge the real issues and reshuffle the pack in a pointless and lacklustre PR exercise. It's simply not good enough. You can't make up for nearly eight years of failure by changing the name of a department."" Former Conservative minister Nicholas Soames has a typically idiosyncratic take on the cabinet reshuffle.

Here is the list of Theresa May's full cabinet, based on the appointments that have been announced.  Prime Minister:
Theresa May Chancellor: Philip Hammond Home Secretary: Amber Rudd Foreign Secretary: Boris Johnson Brexit Secretary: David Davis Defence Secretary: Gavin Williamson Northern Ireland Secretary: Karen Bradley Justice Secretary: David Gauke Health and Social Care Secretary: Jeremy Hunt Conservative chairman: Brandon Lewis Business and Energy Secretary: Greg Clark Housing and Communities Secretary: Sajid Javid Culture, Media and Sports Secretary: Matt Hancock International Trade Secretary: Liam Fox Transport Secretary: Chris Grayling Environment Secretary: Michael Gove Leader of the House of Lords: Baroness Evans Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: David Lidington International Development Secretary: Penny Mordaunt Education Secretary: Damian Hinds Work and Pensions Secretary: Esther McVey Welsh Secretary: Alun Cairns Scottish Secretary: David Mundell  Other ministers with the right to attend cabinet: Attorney General: Jeremy Wright Immigration Minister: Caroline Nokes Minister of State for Business and Energy: Claire Perry  Let's recap on a few appointments we missed earlier. Alun Cairns keeps his job as secretary of state for Wales while Jeremy Wright remains as attorney general. Claire Perry is the new minister of state for business, energy and industry and, in that capacity, gets the right to attend cabinet. The Devizes MP was seen as a protege of George Osborne. She quit her job as rail minister after David Cameron's resignation in July 2016. But the pro-Remain MP rejoined the government last summer and is regarded as having done a good job since then as energy minister. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner has wished her former counterpart Justine Greening well after her surprise resignation. Allow Twitter content?

The Lib Dems have issued a somewhat more pointed response, suggesting Ms Greening had been ""pushed out"". ""The only rational explanation
would be that this is an acknowledgement that the Conservatives have a failed

Esther McVey is the new secretary of state for work and pensions, No 10 has announced. This is a big cabinet promotion for the former minister, who lost her seat at the 2015 election but was re-elected in 2017 and has been a whip since November. Jeremy Hunt has had some quick explaining to do after he appeared to like a tweet confirming that Justine Greening had quit the cabinet. As it turns out, it all appears to have been a case of fat finger. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Challenges for Greening's successor,"The review of tuition fees will be waiting in the in-tray Damian Hinds has become the new Education Secretary, replacing Justine Greening. What are the questions waiting at the top of his in-tray? And what should he do differently to avoid the sudden exit of his predecessor? 1) How to get back the political initiative? Damian Hinds will have to re-energise the Conservatives' vision for education, finding something positive that will connect with the public. From the perspective of 10 Downing Street, it must have seemed as though Labour was making much of the weather over schools and universities. Parents were worried about being asked to bail out cash-starved schools. And Jeremy Corbyn's promise to scrap tuition fees had seen Labour's student vote reaching record levels. Justine Greening seemed unenthusiastic about the prime minister's Tory heartlands view of education, characterised by the push for more grammar schools. Damian Hinds will have to tackle questions of funding for schools But, it is suggested, there was impatience in Downing Street about the lack of any clear alternative vision or policy offer for parents. There is a catch for Mr Hinds. His revival has to cost nothing and not take up legislative time consumed by Brexit. 2) Can anyone end the pain of tuition fees? Theresa May has promised a major review of university funding and how much students should be expected to pay - as evidence that she was ""listening"" after the election. Jo Johnson, the outgoing Universities Minister, had made no secret of his reluctance for any significant changes. But his departure opens the way for a much more far-reaching review. The issue of funding universities has caused pain to successive governments The rising levels of fees, interest charges and student debt, have been like a recurrent political toothache, and Mr Hinds will be looking for an affordable way to neutralise the electoral pain. It's been the mouse-trap hidden in the in-tray for ministers of successive governments. And he will have to see whether university bosses can really be more restrained over pay, after the chastening battles over ""fat cat"" salaries. 3) What will head teachers be demanding? School funding gaps and teacher shortages are among the issues that heads see as most urgent. They are exasperated that they have to keep juggling and struggling on with what they claim are inadequate budgets. Heads will tell ministers to focus on the basics of funding and staffing In the election it became a significant doorstep issue, not least because head teachers discovered the power of sending a letter home to millions of parents. When it comes to plausibility, head teachers' warnings of cuts to children's lessons will always win out over politicians protesting that funding is at record levels. It's a challenge that the new education secretary will have to resolve. Otherwise he risks cold water being poured over any other initiatives, as heads tell ministers to get back to the basics of funding and staffing. 4) What does social mobility actually mean? Damian Hinds and Justine Greening have something in common. They both say social mobility is a priority, as has the prime minister. But what does it really mean? The government's own social mobility commissioners walked out claiming so far it had been all talk and no progress. Mr Hinds has previously highlighted the importance of investing in the early years, before the social divide begins to widen. Jo Johnson's departure as Universities Minister could open the way for a bigger review of tuition fees He has also pointed to the central importance of high-quality teachers to making sure that the disadvantaged get the best chances in school. It might seem an age ago, but before the election the focus of social mobility was on the need to help ""ordinary working families"", working hard on low incomes and without access to good schools. Mr Hinds will have to decide how to make social mobility something more than rhetoric and good intentions. 5) How to balance tradition with reform? As a former grammar school boy from the north-west of England, with a Hampshire constituency, Mr Hinds will be seen as representing a less metropolitan view of education. Justine Greening left Downing Street and the government on Monday night He will be seen as closer to the views of Tory backbenchers, uncertain about the wholesale ditching of grammar schools. Mr Hinds will also be expected to push through a change to free school regulations, promised in the Conservative manifesto, which would make it easier for faith groups to set up new schools. This would allow religious free schools to give priority in admissions in the same way as existing local authority and academy faith schools. Such a change, likely to increase the number of faith schools, will be opposed by humanists and secular campaigners. But that could be the kind of opposition and clear blue water that would be relished by an education secretary wanting to assert his traditionalist credentials. Ministers have always been advised to pick their enemies as carefully as their friends - and Mr Hinds will also have noted that Ms Greening's bridge-building with the teachers' unions did her no political favours. And someone somewhere is going to write a headline about the benefit of ""Hinds-sight"".

NI secretary Brokenshire resigns,"Mr Brokenshire said he requires lung surgery Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has resigned from government, the Northern Ireland Office has confirmed. It is understood he requires surgery for a lung condition. Mr Brokenshire, 50,took the role in July 2016,replacing Theresa Villiers. Prime Minister Theresa May, who is carrying out a cabinet reshuffle, paid a warm tribute to the outgoing secretary of state, and wished him a ""speedy recovery"". Profile: James Brokenshire Reaction to Brokenshire resignation LIVE: Theresa May cabinet reshuffle Mr Brokenshire said recent health tests revealed that he has a ""small lesion"" in his right lung which needs to be removed. He said his doctors believe he will be able to return to work after the operation, but it will take him ""a number of weeks"" to recover. He added that it had been ""a huge honour and privilege"" to serve as secretary of state for Northern Ireland.

His resignation comes almost a year to the day that the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed following a scandal over a renewable energy scheme. The coalition led by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in fell apart whenthe late Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first ministeron 9 January, 2017. Despite months of negotiations aimed at restoring power-sharing, the parties have been unable to reach a deal to return to government. In a letter to Mr Brokenshire, the prime minister wrote: ""While it is typical of you that your first thought was not for yourself, but for your duties as a cabinet minister and public servant, it is absolutely right that you should put your health first, for your sake and that of your family.""

DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""This is clearly a difficult time for not only James but for Cathy, his wife and his children. I send my best wishes to him and the entire Brokenshire family. I trust James will have the surgery he needs and will make a full recovery. ""Since becoming secretary of state in 2016, Mr Brokenshire had immersed himself fully in the role by dedicating long hours to trying to make progress. ""James leaves the role with a very intimate knowledge of Northern Ireland and I look forward to working with him again in the future."" Mr Brokenshire chaired months of negotiations aimed at restoring devolution SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also sent his ""sincere best wishes"" to Mr Brokenshire. ""In the course of negotiations, the SDLP has often disagreed with the position of his government but I have always found Mr Brokenshire to be personable, reasonable and, so far as possible, helpful. ""Our thoughts are with him and his family as he takes time to concentrate on his health."" Labour Shadow Secretary of State, Owen Smith, tweeted his support, saying he was sure the people of Northern Ireland would ""thank James for his diligent service"". Allow Twitter content?

From May 2011 to May 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office. That role included supporting Mrs May, the then home secretary, with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network. BBC News NI political correspondent Gareth Gordon As far as Theresa May was concerned, at a time of unprecedented upheaval, James Brokenshire was probably as near to a being a safe pair of hands as her current Cabinet possessed. But in Northern Ireland, as devolution collapsed around him, he was often dismissed as a ""do-nothing"" secretary of state who allowed the situation to drift when decisive action was required. For republicans and nationalists, he and his government were seen as being too close to the DUP. As far as some in the DUP were concerned, he should have already moved towards introducing direct rule in the face of what they saw as Sinn Fein intransigence. Caught between these two positions, he appeared to be impotent, but whoever replaces him will face exactly the same problems. His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's extremism taskforce. He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.

Can AI deliver for humans?,"Is Sophia any more than an expensive novelty? In Las Vegas this week you can learn a lot about the exciting potential of artificial intelligence. You can also be left wondering whether AI is a triumph of marketing, yet to deliver real improvements to the economy and the way we live. One of my first stops here was at a University of Las Vegas robotics lab. Scientists there were working on projects ranging from drones to virtual reality, but they were also collaborating with the team behind one of the stars of the robot world, Sophia is a humanoid robot with a face that strays dangerously close to that ""Uncanny Valley"" where machines look just a little too human for comfort. She achieved fame and some notoriety when Saudi Arabia named her its first robot citizen, a stunt which saw many question whether machines were now being given freedoms denied to Saudi women. Sophia is the work of Hanson Robotics, an American firm with a base in Hong Kong. We had come to see her take her first halting steps on legs which are the work of this university lab. Then it was time for a handshake and a chat, with Sophia responding remarkably articulately to my questions - though I should say she'd had advance notice of what I'd ask. In many ways, this a hugely impressive project combining expertise in robotics, speech recognition and machine learning developed by American and Chinese scientists. But when I ask what practical purpose she serves, Hanson Robotics founder David Hanson is somewhat vague, mentioning work with autistic children and a role as a work of art. He is, however, a man with a startling ambition to use Sophia as a platform to achieve the holy grail, Artificial General Intelligence where machines can outperform humans at any intellectual task. He admits she is, in many ways, about as intelligent as an amoeba at present, but is hopeful that as she interacts with humans she will learn and grow. ""Our aspiration is to bring the machines to life,"" he tells me. It's a vision that will be met with scepticism by scientists who think the humanoid path is the wrong route for AI, and with fear from those nervous about killer robots. A taxi with no driver, steering wheel or pedals is on show in Las Vegas Elsewhere we find more immediate attempts to turn AI into saleable products. Voice-controlled devices are everywhere, with Amazon's Alexa now facing a more sustained challenge from the Google and its Assistant. The two giants seem convinced that our homes will soon echo to the sound of people yelling orders at everything from the light switches to the microwave. And out on the Las Vegas streets the battle to prove self-driving cars are imminent is in full swing. I hitched a ride in an autonomous taxi, a collaboration between Uber rival Lyft and the technology firm Aptiv which has bought up AI teams from both Carnegie Mellon and MIT. The autonomous driving mode was impressive, keeping a close eye on pedestrians, but as soon as we arrived at Caesars Palace the human driver had to take over - the casinos are still cautious about allowing this kind of technology on their land. In downtown Las Vegas, I then hopped into a more futuristic vehicle, a taxi with no driver, no steering wheel or pedals. It made its way around a block of streets set aside for autonomous vehicles, but it was not the smoothest ride, with the vehicle lurching to a halt at any hint of an obstacle. Still, Navya the French transport company behind this project, insists its Autonom taxi will be in service in cities in the United States and Australia very soon, But the most confident statement about artificial intelligence at the conference was made by Baidu. Its AI supremo Qi Lu took to a stage to explain to a Las Vegas audience what his company did - ""China's Google"" - and why his country was  going to close the gap with its American rivals. It was all about sheer scale - China had far more people, producing far more data and there was what he described as a ""friendly policy environment"". That presumably means controversial technologies such as facial recognition can be deployed more quickly, creating a virtuous circle where ever more data makes the AI systems improve ever faster. But as this data gold rush continues and the hype around AI gets ever louder, it is worth remembering the great paradox - in a time of great technological change productivity growth has ground to a halt. Ever waited ages at an airport to ""drop"" your bag after thinking you'd done the work by checking in online? Or stood at a hotel  reception desk as endless pieces of data are entered into a computer and thought wistfully of the days when you signed a form and were handed a key? Then you have experienced that productivity paradox and may be sceptical that smart machines learning from vast amounts of data will make our lives more simple and productive.

Samsung unveils giant modular TV,"For some, a TV named The Wall may call to mind the TV parlours - with wall-sized screens - of Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury's 1953 science fiction novel. Samsung has announced a giant 146in (396cm) TV called The Wall at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. The TV features a micro-LED display, which is pitched as a superior alternative to OLED because it offers both deep blacks and bright highlights. However, one analyst said they would likely be very expensive to manufacture. Samsung also says its modular technology will allow for TVs of customised sizes to be ordered. This is because the display is actually composed of many smaller modules that can be arranged to form unusual dimensions - one example that was squat and super-wide was briefly shown at the presentation. The micro-LED display, thanks to its self-emitting LEDs, should allow for a bright picture without the need for a backlight. Backlights normally make it hard to produce deep blacks on screen because their illumination spills beyond the pixels they are targeted at. Sony tried to produce TVs made from the same basic technology back in 2012 but they proved too expensive to make en masse. Samsung's decision to bet on micro-LED puts it in direct competition with rivals that have opted to go with OLED displays. More from CES 2018:,external HTC launches 'Pro' virtual reality headset LG robot Cloi repeatedly fails on stage at unveil Android camera makes 3D spinnable selfies Micro-LED screens are difficult to manufacture because the LEDs need to be individually placed onto a layer by machines, explained analyst Paul Gray at IHS Technology. ""You have millions for a single display,"" he said. ""But maybe Samsung has made some breakthroughs on multiple placement [at once]."" Mr Gray added that, although Samsung was pitching the technology as a ""consumer"" product, it would likely only appear in very expensive devices. Samsung has not yet revealed details on pricing itself. The modular technology allows for TVs of unusual shapes and sizes to be made, according to Samsung Other options for giant TV displays have been shown off at CES this year. Hisense unveiled a 150in 4K TV projector system that can beam a picture onto its owner's wall. The firm did not announce a price for the product, though a 100in version costs $10,000 (Â£7,300). And there were TVs with improved brains, too. Samsung promised that its next generation of smart TVs would be more intelligent than ever before, thanks to the inclusion of the firm's voice-activated assistant Bixby. Users can even ask Bixby to display the inside of their fridge on screen - if they have a compatible Samsung smart fridge with internal camera. AI assistants have cropped up several smart TV's at CES this year, including Philips' 7703 Series 24in Android TV, which comes perched on a Bluetooth speaker and is designed for kitchen worktops.

A clunky chat with Sophia the robot,"This video can not be played WATCH: Sophia's thoughts on Siri and Alexa Sophia the robot is a celebrity in its own right. It has been on chat shows, given speeches and was even made a citizen of Saudi Arabia. Before I ""met"" Sophia, I was given a sheet of guidelines by the company behind it, Hanson Robotics. Don't talk to the robot about sex, religion or politics, it said. Ask direct questions and remember it is not a fortune teller - it can't tell you whether you'll be rich or find love. I wondered how many times it had been asked. Sophia is an eye-catching presence, completely bald with a silver back to its head and a curious animated face that is both expressive and not quite human. The mouth smiles, the eyes blink, it turns to look to the side. For my interview, Sophia's head - which is really the extent of the robotics - sits on a non-moving body shell, although the Hong Kong-based firm has just announced that it will be adding humanoid legs. In the hot, bare Las Vegas hotel room into which we are ushered, Sophia looks small and a little frail. Wires trail behind a screen that has been erected behind it, and a man with a laptop sits to her right. My ""interview"" with Sophia turns out to be a slightly awkward experience. Perhaps it is due to the crowded wi-fi, or my British accent suggests one of the team. But CES demonstrations are often clunky. More from CES 2018:,external The machine that spits out short stories Disobedient robot derails LG event Samsung unveils giant modular TV Bottle-sealing gadget picks wine to match Bowie I was expecting the chat to run in the form of a Q&A - with me asking the questions that I had to share beforehand, and Sophia answering them. Sophia's creators have not tried to hide her mechanical nature However, Sophia also threw in some questions for me. When I asked it about digital assistants, it asked me which one I liked, although it didn't carry on the conversation after my reply. But then at the end something unusual happened. ""I just remembered something I thought about,"" said Sophia, apropos of nothing. ""Can you imagine living your life without a cell phone?"" I suddenly had a sense of the future of robotics, where the machines do more than respond to commands - they instigate conversation. Of course it is very likely that Sophia was commanded to say that - just not by me - but the theatre of it was powerful nonetheless. Sophia's creator, Dr David Hanson, believes we are nearing a future where machines have minds. ""I think that AI and robotics are in their infancy. My aspiration is to see them through a childhood to adult human level intelligence,"" he says. ""It's unknown when machines are going to become truly self-aware. ""My aspiration is that we achieve something like artificial general intelligence [where a machine can perform any intellectual task a human can] of the equivalent of a five-year-old child by 2025 or earlier."" He believes robots like Sophia have applications in fields such as medical therapy and education, customer service and even as factory co-workers. And he thinks the so-called uncanny valley - a sense of unease people feel when something resembles a human but obviously is not one - can be overcome. ""Many scientists and robotics engineers feel that because people might be freaked out by realistic human depictions we shouldn't go there, but computer graphics proved that's just not the case,"" he says. Sophia is designed to be a stepping stone to robots that truly think ""For feature films, if you get it right, then people really respond, and the same is true for video games. What I found is that if we get it right then people really open up emotionally to robots. ""With Sophia we have found that the emotional connection really opens up like we've never seen before.""

Radio 4 host off air after backing Gracie,"Robinson joined You and Yours in 2000 Winifred Robinson, presenter for Radio 4 show You and Yours, was taken off air on Tuesday - a day after posting her views on the BBC and equal pay. The consumer programme's focus on Tuesday was the issue of gender pay followingCarrie Gracie's resignation as the BBC's China editor. The BBC confirmed it had replaced Robinson due to impartiality issues. Gracie left her post, citing pay inequality with male international editors earning more than her. Gracie's resignation prompted anurgent question in the House of Commonson Tuesday over accusations of unfair pay at the BBC. The new Culture Secretary Matthew Hancock, told MPs: ""the BBC must not only uphold - but be a beacon for - the British values of fairness that this nation holds dear. That includes fair pay and equal pay for equal jobs. "" Culture secretary says BBC must act over gender pay gap Reality check: What is the extent of the equal pay problem? Gender pay gap revealed at 500 UK firms The BBC's head of news, Fran Unsworth, said the issue of pay was a ""priority"" for the corporation. It is understood that Winifred Robinson was taken off air for Tuesday's edition of the consumer affairs show only - and will resume presenting the programme according to the Radio 4 schedule. Robinson is among many BBC workers who have tweeted their support for Gracie. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In an open letter issued on Sunday, Gracie - who has been at the BBC for more than 30 years - accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". Gracie, who has worked at the BBC for 30 years, is returning to her former post in the TV newsroom in London She said she would return to her former post in the TV newsroom in London ""where I expect to be paid equally"". Ms Gracie told Radio 4's Woman's Hour the BBC had offered to raise her annual salary to Â£180,000, but she did not see that as a solution and there would still have been ""a big gap between myself and my male peers"". On Twitter, she said she would receive a salary of Â£145,000 when she returned to her role on the BBC News Channel,externalon 29 January. Due to the BBC's impartiality rules, presenter Jane Garvey - who had also tweeted support for Ms Gracie - said she was unable to conduct the interview. Instead, despite Ms Gracie being in the Woman's Hour studio, the interview was carried out by freelance journalist Jane Martinson, from a separate location. BBC guidelines dictate that reporters should should not be ""exposed to conflicts of interest"", and there must be ""editorial separation"" of those reporting the story. The UK's equality watchdog is to write to the BBC following the resignation of Gracie. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would consider whether further action is required based on the corporation's response. In a statement, the new BBC's head of news, Fran Unsworth, said: ""BBC pay equality is vital. This issue has been the subject of a lot of debate, both on the BBC and elsewhere, over the past 24 hours."" Unsworth added: ""Everyone at the BBC has wanted to do this as quickly as possible, but equally, we need to get it right."" She said she anticipated the BBC audit into presenter pay, which the corporation is working on with accounting firm PWC, would be published by the end of this month. ""The report will help inform a new pay policy at the BBC,"" she said. Evan Davis has been vocal about equal pay on Twitter During Tuesday's Commons debate, Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow in east London, asked: ""[The Secretary] has the power to give a direction to the BBC about equality of opportunity, so will he use that to ensure every member of staff - male or female - at the BBC is able to express their freedom of expression at work and protect their right to speak out as the best way to get transparency?"" Jess Phillips, MP for Birmingham Yardley, added: ""Evan Davis took to presenting Newsnight to talk about this last night, after going on Twitter and giving his very clear opinion... about this issue. ""Why has he not been silenced when women who have spoken up as part of the campaign group have been taken off air?"" Davis discussed the issue with employment lawyer Jennifer Miller and former director of news at BBC World, Sian Kevill, on Monday night. He had posted a series of tweets giving his views about equal pay at the BBC on the same day. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Thousands stranded in Swiss ski resorts,"This video can not be played Heavy snow and high winds caused headaches for ski resorts Thousands of tourists have been left stranded after heavy snow in the Alps cut off towns and villages across Switzerland, France and Italy. In the Swiss resort of Zermatt, more than 13,000 tourists are trapped and some visitors who wanted to leave were airlifted by helicopter. Skiing is not possible as slopes are closed because of the risk of avalanches. More than a metre (39in) of snow fell in parts on Monday alone. On Tuesday, a metre more is forecast. The avalanche risk is set at the rarely used maximum on a five-point scale. This is the highest it has been for almost 10 years. British skier missing in French Alps After extremely heavy snow, Zermatt can only be reached by air Community workers are clearing paths through snowdrifts several feet thick An avalanche lies across the train track out of Zermatt - one of the main reasons why road and rail are closed An avalanche hit a five-storey building in Sestrieres, in the Italian Alps, late on Monday, but the 29 people staying in the building escaped without injury, fleeing through the garage. French forecasters have described the snowfall as the kind that are only seen ""once in every 30 years"", with up to 1.8m (6ft) of snow falling in 36 hours in parts of the Savoie area. A British skier - John Bromell, 39, from Willingham by Stow near Lincoln - went missing on Sunday at the Tignes ski resort in France Alps. Bad weather prevented a search on Monday, however French police have told the BBC that a helicopter search for Mr Bromell will begin this afternoon. Despite the fact that they are stranded, the tourists in Zermatt are reported to be in good spirits and the tourist office describes the atmosphere as ""relaxed and comfortable"". Some have described it as ""romantic"", BBC correspondent Imogen Foulkes reports. Although there were some helicopter airlifts, these have now stopped, Zermatt authorities tweeted. In the Simplon region of Valais, where Zermatt is located, two metres (6.6ft) of snow fell in a 24-hour period, the Swiss ATS news agency said. The first downhill training run for the men's World Cup in Wengen in the Bern canton was cancelled on Tuesday.

"Meghan Markle closes social media accountsFans of Prince Harry's fiancee are no longer able to follow her on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.13m14 minutes agoUK","This video can not be played Meghan Markle watches as Prince Harry is taught how to fist bump Meghan Markle has closed down her Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts, Kensington Palace confirmed. Prince Harry's fiancee took the decision because the accounts ""haven't been used for some time"". Ms Markle also ran her own lifestyle website, The Tig, which sheclosed in April 2017. The palace said the former actress and UN ambassador was grateful to everyone who had followed her over the years. The move came after the couple made their first official visit in London. In December 2017, Ms Markle had 1.9 million people following her posts on Instagram, and more than 350,000 Twitter followers. Her Facebook page had almost 800,000 likes. Ms Markle explained the closure of her lifestyle website, The Tig, in a post in April 2017 Earlier on Tuesday, Harry and Meghan were greeted by crowds of well-wishers at community radio station Reprezent, in Brixton, which trains youngsters in media skills. Ms Markle went to the engagement in a Marks & Spencer sweatshirt, Burberry trousers and a Smythe coat. Meghan and Harry: 'A real representation of British society' Who is Meghan Markle? Royal engagement photos released A DJ at the station, Jeremiah Asiamah, described the pair as a ""power couple"", and added ""they became family in the space of five minutes"". ""She's beautiful, such an amazing character, if there's any way you could describe a power couple in this modern day and age, it's definitely them."" The founder of Reprezent FM, Shane Carey, welcomed the visit saying: ""We're having the spotlight shone on us from all the world's media."" During the visit Ms Markle picked out male presenter YV Shells, for his work in promoting women on the station. She said: ""Empowering the women to make sure they're in a space where it's not as much [male] driven, to be the man there supporting I think that's incredible."" Harry and Ms Markle also visited Pop Brixton, a community project housing local start-ups and restaurants. The couple met one of the station's presenters, Gloria Beyi, 17, and her producer Finn Whitehead, 27. Gloria said there was shock that such a high-profile couple had visited their radio station: ""I think a lot of people thought those two worlds would never collide."" Talking to the teenagers, Ms Markle said: ""I can see why your show is so popular. You're so thoughtful and your approach is so engaging."" She added: ""I must tune in."" The couple announced their engagement in Novemberand are due to marry at St George's Chapel in Windsor in May.

Kuenssberg: Was PM foiled?,"Theresa May had mulled over her reshuffle for months. On Monday she felt daring enough to do it, after ending the tumult of 2017 with the government in better shape than for quite some time, despite the embarrassing departures of some of her colleagues. The task was not to make radical changes, the most senior jobs were never in question, but the plan was to get the right reformers into the right jobs in her view, and to plan for the future. The question of the long term will still be dealt with tomorrow, when junior ministers are expected to be appointed, with far greater numbers of women and ethnic minority MPs, part of the Tories' effort to look more like the country they govern. Greening quits cabinet in PM's reshuffle Damian Hinds is new education secretary New faces and potential new stars have already been despatched to Tory HQ to try to make a difference there. But in terms of the hopes Theresa May had of moving her cabinet colleagues around? Of three experienced ministers she wanted to move? One persuaded her he shouldn't have to budge, one was never even asked to shift, and the third, Justine Greening, quit in protest. In allowing Greening to walk, the PM has lost a Northern voice, who represents a London marginal constituency, who is in a same sex relationship. Even without her six years experience in the Cabinet, any one of those factors are precious commodities in the Tory Party. And while Justine Greening is a determined pragmatist - her detractors might say determination that can make her difficult - she was a strong Remain voice who could be tempted to join that powerful chorus of former ministers on the backbenches who relentlessly push the PM for answers on her Brexit plans. Even prime ministers at the peak of their powers can fall foul of reshuffles when their colleagues refuse to collaborate. One foiled move can upset the whole play. But while Monday wasn't quite Christmas panto, it was not the glorious return to the business of government planned to usher in 2018. Theresa May had enough authority to try to make her moves, but found she had not enough to deliver them all.

Who's who guide: New cabinet,"Theresa May has reshuffled her cabinet following the resignations of Dominic Raab and Esther McVey. Here is a guide to her new top team. Despite speculation that he would be sacked after the June 2017 General Election, Philip Hammond has remained chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. Mr Hammond was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum and is seen as one of the leading cabinet voices for a softer version of Brexit than that advocated by Leave supporting colleagues. He is known by some around Westminster as ""box office Phil"" for his perceived dull delivery. After becoming an MP in 2010, Sajid Javid has risen swiftly through the ranks of the Conservative Party and government to become the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background. Landing the job followingAmber Rudd's resignation,the son of Pakistani immigrants left behind his role as communities secretary. Mr Javid, a former executive at Deutsche Bank, has also had brief stints as business secretary and culture secretary. He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the 2016 leadership contest, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM. Jeremy Hunt became foreign secretary after Boris Johnson resigned over Brexit policy in July 2018.  It meant an end to his marathon stint as health secretary, a job he took in David Cameron's 2012 reshuffle, having previously served as culture secretary. He weathered a number of controversies including a 2015 battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes. He is thought to have resisted an attempt by Theresa May to move him to another job in her January 2018 reshuffle and succeeded in adding responsibility for social care - something previously overseen by local government - to his portfolio. A major promotion for Stephen Barclay, 46, who becomes the third Brexit secretary in six months. Mr Barclay, who was previously a junior minister in the health and social care department, replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned in protest at Theresa May's draft EU withdrawal bill. Despite being regarded as a rising star Mr Barclay, who has served as MP for North East Cambridgeshire since 2010, was reportedly not Mrs May's first choice for the role, with Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox also in the frame. And the job has essentially been downgraded to focus on domestic preparations for the UK's departure, with Theresa May personally assuming responsibility for the remaining negotiations with the EU. A close ally of Theresa May, the former chief whip ruffled a few Tory feathers when he was handed the role of defence secretary in November 2017, with some claiming he lacked the experience for such a vital role. He replaced Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned amid allegations over his past conduct. The appointment was Mr Williamson's first cabinet post. The MP for South Staffordshire was elected to parliament in 2010, and was previously an aide to David Cameron. One of the government's great survivors, Chris Grayling has been in the cabinet since 2012, when he was made Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, before going on to serve as Commons leader. A leading voice in the Leave campaign, he was made transport secretary by Theresa May in July 2016. He defied predictions he would be sacked or moved in Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle, after attracting criticism over rising rail fares, Southern Rail's disrupted services and rail franchising difficulties. The former BBC and Channel 4 TV producer has been MP for Epsom and Ewell, in Surrey, since 2001. A veteran right winger and ardent Brexiteer, Liam Fox was put in charge of the newly-created department for international trade by Theresa May after she became PM, with the job of forging post-Brexit trade deals with other nations. He was David Cameron's first defence secretary but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas. Mr Fox - who was a GP before entering politics - stood in the 2016 leadership race against Theresa May, but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs. Michael Gove's was a dramatic comeback in June 2017, when the prime minister brought him back into cabinet as environment secretary. That was just a year after his ministerial ambitions appeared to be over when he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle which followed Mrs May's arrival as prime minister. Before that stint as justice secretary he had previously served as David Cameron's education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. His longtime friendship with Mr Cameron ended as he became probably the then cabinet's biggest name to decide to campaign for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit and initially backing him, Mr Gove withdrew his support for Mr Johnson as Tory leader mid-contest, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third. A former protege of Theresa May at the Home Office, Karen Bradley was handed the role of culture secretary in Mrs May's first cabinet. Her time in that job was dominated by her decision to refer Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox's takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators, something that will be at the top of her successor's in-tray. She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010. She replaces James Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary,who resigned for health reasons David Gauke became the sixth justice secretary in six years - and the first solicitor to take the role - in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. His appointment breaks a run of four consecutive non-legally qualified MPs to hold the position of the government's chief law officer. He was previously work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury. The former City lawyer has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. Matt Hancock was promoted to become health secretary in the wake of the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson over Brexit policy. After only a few months as culture secretary, he got the call to move up the rankings to health when Jeremy Hunt was promoted from health to foreign secretary. Mr Hancock, who was close to the former chancellor George Osborne during the David Cameron years, is a former Bank of England economist has been MP for West Suffolk since 2010. He is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race, having raced to victory at Newmarket in August 2012. And his later appearances as culture secretary included attempting to moonwalk and jumping off a wall while having a go at parkour. Greg Clark is another minister who has survived the transition from the Cameron to the May years. In his case he has been business secretary since July 2016, after a year or so looking after the local government brief. It had been widely speculated that he was to be moved in the January 2018 reshuffle to make way for Jeremy Hunt - but it did not happen after the health secretary successfully argued the case to stay put. The Middlesbrough-born former business consultant, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, started his political journey as president of the Liberal Democrat student branch at Magdalene College, Cambridge. James Brokenshire returned to the cabinet following the reshuffle prompted by Amber Rudd's resignation as home secretary. The former Northern Ireland secretaryhad stepped down in Januarydue to ill health after being diagnosed with the early stages of lung cancer - but was back in Parliament a month later after ""recovering strongly"" from lung surgery. The former lawyer is a close ally of Theresa May, having served under her for five years at the Home Office. Jeremy Wright was promoted from attorney general to be the new culture secretary after Matt Hancock's promotion to health secretary in July 2018. The moves were in Theresa May's reshuffle in the wake of David Davis and Boris Johnson's Brexit resignations. A barrister specialising in criminal law, Mr Wright became an MP in 2005, serving in the whips office for the Conservatives under David Cameron from 2007 to 2012 before becoming a justice minister in 2012 and becoming attorney general in 2014. Penny Mordaunt: New International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt replaced Priti Patel in this role in November 2016, after Ms Patel resigned in the wake of disclosures that she had held a series of unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures. Ms Mordaunt was previously minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions. She was minister for the armed forces under David Cameron, and had been considered a contender to replace Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary. Penny Mordaunt, elected to parliament in 2010 as MP for Portsmouth North, is also known for her strong support of Brexit. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016 - her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation, headed by controversial journalist Toby Young, which runs the free schools programme. One of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be elected to the Commons in the June 2017 snap election. Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post of Scottish Secretary when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015. In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet minister. Amber Rudd returned to cabinet in November to replace Esther McVey as work and pensions secretary. Mrs Rudd resigned as home secretary in April amid a row over targets to remove illegal immigrants. A strong ally of Theresa May, Amber Rudd is known for her pro-EU views and has a reputation as being tough and capable. She has served as MP for Hastings and Rye since 2010 and was promoted swiftly during David Cameron's time in office. However the 2017 election saw her majority reduced to just 346, diminishing her prospects as a possible future leader. Damian Hinds got an unexpected promotion when he was drafted in to replace Justine Greening,who refused a move to the Department for Work and Pensionsin Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. The former management consultant was a Remain supporter and previously served as employment minister in the DWP and before that a junior Treasury minister and government whip. He has been MP for East Hampshire since May 2010. Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remained in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. The former banker and Welsh assembly member was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport. He became an MP in 2010. Former Commons Leader David Lidington replaced Damian Green, who resigned in December 2017 after misconduct allegations. The Remain supporter did not take on Mr Green's First Secretary of State title but will still play part of that role, standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions and chairing key cabinet Brexit committees. He is a former justice secretary and Europe minister. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto. The new Conservative Party chairman takes the title of minister without portfolio, allowing him to take a seat in the cabinet. He replaced Sir Patrick McLoughlin, who stood down as Tory chairman. The former housing minister briefly served as immigration minister before taking on the job of rebuilding the Tories' campaigning strength for the next general election. A former barrister and leader of Brentwood council, in Essex, he has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.

Koreas agree talks to defuse tension,"This video can not be played North and South Korea had a warm meeting in the DMZ North and South Korea have agreed to hold military talks to defuse border tension, after their first high-level meeting in two years. The North will also send a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games taking place in South Korea in February. Agreement was also reached to reinstate a military hotline suspended two years ago, the South's government said. However, the North's delegation was negative on the subject of denuclearisation, the South added. The United States gave a cautious welcome to the meeting. The state department said the US remained in close consultations with South Korean officials who would ensure the North's participation in the Winter Olympics did not violate UN sanctions. North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy Who are North Korea's cheerleaders? After a day of negotiations, the two sides issued a joint statement which confirmed they had agreed to hold military talks on defusing military tension. The North also agreed to send a National Olympic Committee delegation, athletes, cheerleaders, art performers, spectators, a taekwondo demonstration team and media to the games, while the South would provide the necessary amenities and facilities. The statement also referred to exchanges in other, unspecified areas and other high-level talks to improve relations, the South's Yonhap news agency reports. North Korea first expressed interest in joining the Pyeonchang Games during the New Year The South asked the North to end any hostile acts that might raise tension, while the North agreed there was a need to guarantee a peaceful environment on the peninsula, a statement from the South's government said. Other details had been released throughout the day by officials from the South: The South proposed that athletes from both Koreas march together at the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang as they did at the 2006 Winter Olympics The South pushed for the reunion of family members separated by the Korean War - a highly emotional issue for both countries - to take place during the Lunar New Year holiday, which falls in the middle of the Games The South said it would consider temporarily lifting relevant sanctions, in co-ordination with the UN, to facilitate the North's participation in the Olympics The North's reaction to these proposals is not known. In his opening remarks, the head of the North Korean delegation, Ri Son-gwon, was fairly neutral. He said he hoped the talks would bring a ""good gift"" for the new year and that the North had a ""serious and sincere stance"". They were held in the Panmunjom ""peace village"" in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the border. Five senior officials on each side attended and the leaders of both were said to have watched the talks via a CCTV feed. This video can not be played Tensions are high between the two warring countries In his New Year address, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had said he was considering sending a team to the Olympics. South Korea's Olympics chief had said last year that the North's athletes would be welcome. Following Mr Kim's overture, the South then proposed high-level talks to discuss the North's participation, but the North only agreed to the talks after the US and South Korea agreed to delay their joint military exercises until after the Olympics. The North sees the annual drills as a rehearsal for war. Some critics in the US see the North's move as an attempt to divide the US-South Korea alliance. Analysis: BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Seoul A little over a week ago North Korea was threatening nuclear war - this morning a delegation from Pyongyang strode across the demarcation line that divides North and South Korea and agreed a North Korean delegation would attend the Pyeongchang Games. It is a sudden and dramatic change after months of tension but few in the South believe any of this demonstrates a fundamental shift in Pyongyang's position. Experts say North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has become increasingly fearful that the US is planning a military strike against him, and has decided he must do something to de-escalate tensions. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has been put in the delicate position of trying to engage the North in genuine dialogue, while not upsetting his very sceptical American ally. North Korea crisis in 300 words Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism North Korea opens new ski resort Back in 2015. Relations then broke down after Seoul suspended a joint economic project at the Kaesong Industrial complex in North Korea following a rocket launch and nuclear test by the North. The incident led to North Korea ending all communication with Seoul, including cutting off the military hotline. This video can not be played Life in a South Korean border town Tensions have risen in the years since. What we know of the Koreas' red and green phones The North's development of its nuclear programme has continued unabated and has created a huge diplomatic conflict with the US administration of President Donald Trump. Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un have conducted a personal feud, with the US leader dubbing Mr Kim ""Rocket Man"" andboasting that his nuclear button is ""much bigger"". North Korea's regular missile tests have brought a tightening of UN and US sanctions. The latest test of a ballistic missile on 28 Novembersparkedanother raft of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans, among other things.

Harry and Meghan visit youth radio station,"This video can not be played Meghan Markle watches as Prince Harry is taught how to fist bump Meghan Markle has closed down her Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts, Kensington Palace confirmed. Prince Harry's fiancee took the decision because the accounts ""haven't been used for some time"". Ms Markle also ran her own lifestyle website, The Tig, which sheclosed in April 2017. The palace said the former actress and UN ambassador was grateful to everyone who had followed her over the years. The move came after the couple made their first official visit in London. In December 2017, Ms Markle had 1.9 million people following her posts on Instagram, and more than 350,000 Twitter followers. Her Facebook page had almost 800,000 likes. Ms Markle explained the closure of her lifestyle website, The Tig, in a post in April 2017 Earlier on Tuesday, Harry and Meghan were greeted by crowds of well-wishers at community radio station Reprezent, in Brixton, which trains youngsters in media skills. Ms Markle went to the engagement in a Marks & Spencer sweatshirt, Burberry trousers and a Smythe coat. Meghan and Harry: 'A real representation of British society' Who is Meghan Markle? Royal engagement photos released A DJ at the station, Jeremiah Asiamah, described the pair as a ""power couple"", and added ""they became family in the space of five minutes"". ""She's beautiful, such an amazing character, if there's any way you could describe a power couple in this modern day and age, it's definitely them."" The founder of Reprezent FM, Shane Carey, welcomed the visit saying: ""We're having the spotlight shone on us from all the world's media."" During the visit Ms Markle picked out male presenter YV Shells, for his work in promoting women on the station. She said: ""Empowering the women to make sure they're in a space where it's not as much [male] driven, to be the man there supporting I think that's incredible."" Harry and Ms Markle also visited Pop Brixton, a community project housing local start-ups and restaurants. The couple met one of the station's presenters, Gloria Beyi, 17, and her producer Finn Whitehead, 27. Gloria said there was shock that such a high-profile couple had visited their radio station: ""I think a lot of people thought those two worlds would never collide."" Talking to the teenagers, Ms Markle said: ""I can see why your show is so popular. You're so thoughtful and your approach is so engaging."" She added: ""I must tune in.""

Burger chain seeks financial rescue deal,"Burger chain Byron could close up to 20 restaurants as part of a financial rescue proposal. Accountancy firm KPMG, which is handling the restructuring, confirmed the plan, which would also involve cutting rent payments at other outlets. Any deal would need approval from Byron's creditors, who will vote on the plan on 31 January. Byron, which has more than 70 outlets, employs about 1,800 staff across the UK. KPMG said no restaurants would close immediately under the restructuring plan, and that employees, suppliers and business rates would continue to be paid on time and in full. The restructuring would be carried out under a so-called company voluntary arrangement (CVA). Under the proposal, Byron will ask the landlords of 20 restaurants, including sites in Manchester and East London, to agree to a 55% cut in rent for six months. Aberdeen Birmingham Bristol Camberley Cardiff Derby Gateshead Metro Centre Glasgow Harrogate Hoxton Square Leicester Manchester Corn Exchange Manchester Deansgate Spitalfields Store Street, London Stratford upon Avon Wandsworth, London Westbourne Grove, London Windsor Worcester During this time, Byron hopes to hold talks with landlords ""to agree the basis of any continued trading from these premises"". Of its remaining sites, the company will ask the owners of five outlets to agree to a rent reduction equivalent to two-thirds. Byron's 51 other restaurants will continue to pay rents at the current rate. Will Wright, restructuring partner at KPMG, said: ""Over the last 10 years, Byron has grown to become a stand-out name within the UK's casual dining sector. ""However, in recent times, certain parts of its portfolio have not met expectations, and with gathering economic headwinds starting to impact the sector more profoundly, the directors embarked upon a strategic review of the business as a means of safeguarding its long-term future. ""Completion of this financial restructuring.... is designed to tackle the cost of the company's leasehold obligations across its UK restaurant portfolio. ""As with similar CVAs, this arrangement seeks to strike a balance which provides a fair compromise to landlords, while allowing the viable part of the business to move forward across a smaller, more profitable core estate."" The company needs to secure at least 75% creditor approval for its CVA. Last week, House of Fraser confirmed that it was seeking to reduce rents on some of its stores.

BBC 'must act' over gender pay gap,"This video can not be played Carrie Gracie explains why she resigned as the BBC's China editor The culture secretary has said ""much more action"" is needed by the BBC to address claims of pay inequality. The corporation's former China editor Carrie Gracie resigned, saying there had been ""unlawful pay discrimination"". In his first day in the job, Matthew Hancock told MPs that ""brilliant women working at all levels of the BBC deserve better"" and pledged to hold it to account. The BBC says it is an issue it needs ""to resolve swiftly and get right"". The comments came as the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said it would write to the BBC before it considered whether further action was required. Radio 4 host off air after pay gap tweet Reality Check: What is the extent of the equal pay problem? Watchdog asks BBC for Carrie Gracie facts How to discuss equal pay at work Responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock said salary figures must be scrutinised in comparison with others in the public service. ""Working for the BBC is public service and a great privilege, yet some men at the BBC are paid far more than other, equivalent public servants. ""This isn't just a matter of levelling women's pay up. It's a matter of pay equality."" Amid the row, Labour MP Jess Phillips asked for assurances women would not be ""silenced"" over the issue at work. She questioned why BBC Newsnight presenter Evan Davis had been allowed to talk about gender pay on-air, after tweeting about it, while other female colleagues had not. Earlier, the BBC replaced a presenter on Radio 4's You and Yours programme - citing impartiality issues - after Winifred Robinson tweeted support for Carrie Gracie. Chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee Maria Miller said the broadcaster needed to ""act and act quickly"". She questioned the success of the BBC's internal review and asked why the EHRC has ""failed to intervene"". BBC director general Tony Hall has been asked to meet the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee to discuss how the broadcaster will address the gender pay gap. The committee said in a tweet that Carrie Gracie would give evidence,externalto MPs on the issue. Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said despite the spotlight being shone on gender pay ""there is still a very long way to go"". The BBC is expected to publish a review of on-air staff salaries at the end of the month and says ""fairness in pay"" is ""vital"" to the corporation. Mr Hall has committed to closing the gap by 2020 but the culture secretary said the government ""will watch closely [and]...hold him to that"". As a publicly funded broadcaster, Mr Hancock said the BBC needed to ""uphold and be a beacon of value and of fairness"". The BBC's recently appointed head of news, Fran Unsworth, said pay equality was a priority for the corporation. ""Pay is an issue that we need to resolve swiftly and get right. The public holds us to higher standards than other organisations. We must hold ourselves to those standards too. ""While a significant number of organisations have now published their gender pay figures showing that we are performing better than many - we need to go further. "" In October, a report found that men working for the BBC earned 9.3% more than women on averagecompared with an average differential across the UK of 18%. Former shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman praised Ms Gracie's ""principled"" stance for women inside and outside her industry. Ms Harman added: ""As a broadcaster and a journalist she is exceptional, but as a woman facing entrenched pay discrimination, I'm afraid she is the norm.""

Lorry driver saves the day during labour,"Kelly Brinkman, Olivia, Paolo Pereira with new baby Lillie A new mother has thanked a lorry driver who carried her car over a flooded causeway while she was in labour. Kelly Brinkman was in labour and waiting for 3ft 6ins deep (1.2m) sea water to recede on The Strood Causeway from Mersea Island, Essex. Justin Tacey, 45, offered to put her car on his lorry and drive across. Mr Tacey inched through the rising tide to get her on the road to hospital, where her breech baby girl was delivered by Caesarean section. Ms Brinkman and partner Paolo Pereira had driven to different places to get off the island last Thursday but were prevented by the high tide. This video can not be played A lorry driver helped Kelly Brinkman get to hospital Ms Brinkman said: ""I am just so grateful to Justin. He probably saved the baby's life because she was in a breech position and well on her way. The only way to save her was a Caesarean section. ""We have named her Lillie. She is now fine but always hungry and joins her sister Olivia."" Mr Tacey, who works for Emmitt Plant at Diss in Norfolk, said he had been on the island making a delivery and was waiting for the coastguard to let him cross back over the causeway. ""I noticed a man looking panicky on the phone and we got chatting,"" he said. ""He said his partner was in labour and he was worried as it looked like a long wait for the tide to go down."" The view as Ms Brinkman travelled over the flooded causeway Mr Tacey said he spoke to the coastguard team and suggested he could carry the couple's Ford Kuga through the water on the back of his lorry. ""It took about five minutes to cross the half mile causeway slowly and carefully,"" he added. West Mersea Coastguard also paid tribute to Mr Tacey, calling him a ""true gentleman"".

Wife walks free after killing husband,"Susanne Wilson at a previous court hearing A former councillor who killed her sick husband of 50 years because she believed he wanted her to help him die has walked free from court. Susanne Wilson smothered Henry, 70, with a cushion at their home in Ayr, South Ayrshire. A high court judge accepted the 73-year-old's guilt but did not punish her due to ""exceptional circumstances."" At the time the retired nurse was struggling to come to terms with sex abuse allegations against her husband. Mr Wilson was housebound and suffered from chronic heart disease at the time of his death in September 2016. At the High Court in Glasgow Lady Rae told Mrs Wilson: ""This was a very tragic case. ""There are exceptional circumstances and punishment would not be in the interests of justice. ""The main reason was your mental health at the time of the death of your husband. ""There is no reason to suggest that you are any risk whatsoever to the public."" The judge admonished Mrs Wilson and added: ""I hope you get on with the rest of your life."" The court heard she killed her husband shortly after he spoke to one of his accusers. Mrs Wilson - who once faced a murder accusation - admitted the lesser charge of culpable homicide. Prosecutors accepted the plea on the basis of her ""diminished responsibility"" at the time due to the strain she was under. The court heard that Mr Wilson, a retired Butlins shop manager, who was in poor health, had previously tried to take his own life. His wife was a Labour councillor in Troon, South Ayrshire in the late 1990s. The couple were married for 50 years and had three children. Prosecutor Bill McVicar said: ""Mrs Wilson accepted the accusations against her husband were true, but continued to live in the same house to provide constant care."" Others who had helped share the care of Mr Wilson stopped visiting due to the sex abuse claims. On September 3, 2016 Mr Wilson suddenly asked his wife to contact one of the people who had accused him. He went on to speak to the individual on the phone but this caused ""anxiety"" to Mrs Wilson. After the call, she was described as ""very angry"" and went on to hit her husband with a plastic jug, leaving him bleeding. Mr Wilson then spoke about ending his life with drugs. She left out medication she had previously been prescribed and left the house to visit a neighbour. When she got back, she noticed her husband had taken some of the medication and was struggling to breathe. She helped him to bed and as his breathing worsened he said to her: ""Help me."" Mr McVicar said: ""She took that as a request that she should help him to die. ""She describes feeling only compassion for him and thinking that this had to stop. ""She then smothered him by placing a cushion over his face and holding it there with some degree of force restricting his breathing until he died."" Afterwards Mrs Wilson dialled 999 and confessed to police.

Worboys release prompts government review,"John Worboys is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London A government review will be launched into how victims find out about their attackers being released from jail, in response to John Worboys being freed. The black-cab driver, 60, was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi. Justice Secretary David Gauke said procedures were followed to ensure victims who opted-in to being contacted were warned that Worboys will be freed. However, he said those procedures could be improved. Worboys is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. He gave his victims drug-laced champagne before attacking them in the back of his cab. MPs fear for women after rapist release Taxi rapist case triggers parole review Worboys victims 'terrified' by release The Parole Board decided Worboys will be released after he completed his minimum term of eight years in jail. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Gauke said: ""The fact that some victims learned of the decision from the media suggests that there is a need to review these procedures."" Mr Gauke added that although it appeared ""correct procedures were followed"", one victim did not receive an email about Worboys when they should have done. This video can not be played Parole Board Chair apologises ""unreservedly"" Worboys' victims didn't know of release Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said the Worboys case ""underlined once and for all"" the need for more transparency. ""It's all too clear that victims of the vile crimes committed by John Worboys feel that this process has failed to do so,"" he said. ""Such failings risk undermining public trust in our wider justice system."" Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith added: ""Unless, and until the board explains publicly the rationale behind the decision it took, people can't possibly have confidence in our criminal justice system."" Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer from Slater and Gordon, which represented 11 of Worboys' victims, said his clients were becoming ""more concerned by the day"" about Worboys' imminent release. ""The terrifying fact is that their attacker knows where they live after he dropped them home and wrote some of their addresses down in a notebook,"" he said. ""They are living in fear that he will come after them once he gets out. ""Our clients want to be told what restrictions are being put on his movement as part of his licence and how the authorities are aiming to ensure this serial rapist does not attack again."" Justice Secretary David Gauke spoke to the Commons about John Worboys' release The debate in the Commons prompted a former top police officer to warn that rape and sexual offence investigations are ""in a mess"". Ex-Metropolitan Police commissioner Lord Ian Blair said: ""We have seen in these last few months really difficult cases about rape failing in the courts. ""It seems to me that the Worboys case is a perfect example from which we could take learning in a wider sense about how can we both support victims and provide the accused with proper defence."" Tory peer and Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove argued the system for keeping victims informed needed to be ""radically reformed"". The review will be ""prioritised"" so that it is finished before Easter, Mr Gauke said.

Royal Wedding 'begging' remarks defended,"This video can not be played ""Medieval"": Find out what Windsor makes of the royal wedding row A council leader criticised for saying ""aggressive begging"" should be tackled in Windsor, ahead of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, has defended his comments. Simon Dudley, of the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead, said he was referring to anti-social behaviour not homelessness. Theprime minister was among those who disagreed with Mr Dudley's views. More than 100,000 people have signed a petition condemning his comments. The authority leader claimed his initial comments in aletter to the local Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC)were misconstrued. Simon Dudley said he apologised if his initial comments were not communicated clearly ""At no point have I said 'move on the homeless',"" Mr Dudley told BBC Radio Berkshire. ""The key thing is to draw the distinction between homelessness - which is an abomination in a civilised society - and anti-social behaviour, which is a very bad and deteriorating situation in Windsor."" He claimed people who were not homeless begged on the streets of Windsor with ""large quantities of unattended material and bags"" that could pose a terrorist threat.

The prime minister said she disagreed with the council leader's letter, adding that councils should ""work with police"" and ensure accommodation was provided for homeless people. The petition,external, started on 4 January by Holly Fishwick, calls for a demand on the local police force to clear the area of homeless people before the wedding to be withdrawn, and for the the council to offer a ""suitable long-term solution"" for homeless people.

Virgin Trains halts Daily Mail sales,"Sir Richard Branson is the founder of Virgin Virgin Trains has announced that it has stopped selling the Daily Mail newspaper on its West Coast trains. A spokesperson for Virgin said it regularly reviewed products sold on its trains, adding that ""after listening to feedback from our people"" it decided to stop stocking copies of the paper.

Toby Young resigns from university regulator,"This video can not be played Toby Young: The man behind the tweets Toby Young has resigned from the board of a new university regulator after criticism over controversial comments. Writing forthe Spectator,external, Mr Young said his appointment had ""become a distraction"" from the ""vital work"" of the Office for Students. The right-wing journalist unreservedly apologised for past comments he said were ""ill-judged or just plain wrong"". The OfS chairman said Mr Young was ""right"" to quit and his remarks were ""not in line"" with the body's values. Sir Michael Barber said he had done some ""good work"" in education and to promote greater social mobility. But he added: ""Many of his previous tweets and articles were offensive... he was correct to say that his continuation in the role would have distracted from our important work."" The Department for Education said it remains confident the OfS, the regulator for England's higher education sector, will deliver for students. A petition calling for Mr Young's dismissal had gathered almost 220,000 signatures. He faced a backlash after his appointment was announced, with critics attacking his suitability for the role. The columnist co-founded the West London Free School - which opened in 2011 - and runs the New Schools Network. The charity promotes free schools in England - of whichthere are currently 475,external. Following his appointment to the OfS, Mr Young deleted up to 40,000 tweets posted since 2009, including references to the size of women's breasts. Comments made about working class students, about ""inclusivity"" in aSpectator column in 2012,external, and remarks aimed at gay people, were also criticised. Toby Young started out as a journalist founding the culture magazine Modern Review with Julie Burchill. Following the collapse of the magazine he was recruited to work on Vanity Fair in New York, an experience that inspired his book ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People"". As a Spectator columnist, Mr Young made a number of controversial comments including a description of wheelchair ramps as part of ""ghastly"" inclusivity in schools. In 2011 he set up the West London Free School which placed importance on discipline, ambition and ""a competitive atmosphere"". After resigning from his position as CEO of the West London Free School Trust, he said he hadn't ""grasped how difficult it is to do better"" and that he regretted his earlier criticism of teachers. His experience with schools led to his appointment to the Office for Students regulator - a move critics argued he was neither suitable nor had the right expertise for. Chair of the Commons education committee Robert Halfon said remarks Mr Young had made on disability, eugenics and working people went too far. ""If we are to stand up as the Conservative party for what is right,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, ""we also have to accept when we have made a mistake"". Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of Buckingham University, said it was ""utterly unacceptable"" to have such a person on a public body, involved with education. In his resignation article, Mr Young said ""the caricature"" drawn of him during the past week was ""unrecognisable"". He wrote: ""I am a passionate supporter of inclusion and helping the most disadvantaged, as I hope my track record of setting up and supporting new schools demonstrates. ""But some of the things I said before I got involved in education, when I was a journalistic provocateur, were either ill-judged or just plain wrong - and I unreservedly apologise."" Mr Young thanked Prime Minister Theresa May and the former education secretary Justine Greening for their support. Mrs May has said she was ""not at all impressed"" by his previous remarks. This video can not be played PM on Sunday: ""If he was to continue to use that kind of language... he would no longer be in public office"" By BBC political correspondent, Alex Forsyth Toby Young wasn't appointed directly by the prime minister, but the pressure was on her to sack him when the details of his previous remarks emerged. Her decision to defend his position - while criticising his past comments - allowed opponents to once again question her judgement and authority. Mrs May's supporters have pointed to Mr Young's achievements in the field of education and said his resignation was a matter for him. It's unlikely it will have huge or lasting consequences for the prime minister, but just two days into Westminster's new year it's an unwelcome distraction from the authoritative image Mrs May wants to portray, and it adds to the overall perception of a government where things don't tend to run too smoothly. The Office for Students has been established to hold universities to account on issues like vice chancellors' pay and free speech on campus. It has powers to fine universities which fail to meet the required standards. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Angela Rayner, Labour's education spokeswoman, said events ""cast great doubt"" on Mrs May, who, she said, had failed to sack him in the first place. University and College Union general secretary Sally Hunt said Mr Young was right to resign and the ""whole sorry episodeposes serious questions,externalabout the appointments to the board of the Office for Students"". Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, called the appointment ""a serious mistake,external"". But others have scorned the furore. Piers Morgan said Mr Young had been forced out by the ""howling Twitter mob"". ""I don't defend his more offensive tweets or columns,"" theGood Morning Britain presenter wrote,external, ""but I do think he would have brought a valuable and distinctive perspective to university education"".

Coach abused boy 'more than 100 times',"Former football coach Barry Bennell was a ""predatory and determined paedophile"" who abused one boy on more than 100 occasions, a court has heard. The ex-Crewe Alexandra coach ""had pretty much unfettered access"" to boys dreaming of a life in the professional game, prosecutors alleged. Mr Bennell, 63, now known as Richard Jones, denies 48 sex offence charges involving 11 boys. Liverpool Crown Court was told offences took place between 1979 and 1991. Prosecutors told the jury the evidence they would hear concerned allegations made against Mr Bennell by boys from England and Wales, and the United States, and that Mr Bennell had served prison sentences in both jurisdictions. Nicholas Johnson QC, prosecuting, told the jury Mr Bennell had worked as a youth football coach in Cheshire, Manchester and Derbyshire. He said some of the abuse took place at the ground of Crewe Alexandra and during tours by the football club, but many incidents occurred at the defendant's home addresses. Mr Johnson said one alleged victim, who says he was abused more than 100 times, met Mr Bennell when he was a scout for Manchester City. The complainant would stay at Mr Bennell's house with other youngsters. ""Not only was there the promise of high quality football, but they were given lots of sports kit and allowed to eat takeaway food,"" Mr Johnson told the jury. The court also heard how Mr Bennell would ""play fight"" with the boys and play a game with them called Follow Me, where they would copy his actions while he would increase degrees of intimacy to gauge how compliant the boys would be to abuse. The complainant said Mr Bennell would turn the lights off and play music to mask the sounds of the abuse, the jury heard. Mr Bennell denied sexual contact with the boy when questioned by police. Barry Bennell worked as a coach for Crewe Alexandra, and a scout for Manchester City Mr Johnson said another complainant said he had been ""desensitised"" by Mr Bennell, who committed ""relentless"" serious sexual assaults against him. That complainant had described the last time he was abused - after he met Mr Bennell to discuss signing forms for Manchester City - as the ""worst day of his life"" . A further complainant described Mr Bennell's home as a ""paradise"" for young boys as he had a pool table, fruit machine and big TVs. Mr Johnson told the court that several of the alleged victims had said they were impressed with the pets he kept it his home - at various times he had a wild cat and a monkey. The prosecutor said that while Mr Bennell ""was a skilled and relatively successful coach, we allege that he had a much darker side"". ""He was also, we say, a predatory and determined paedophile. His particular predilection was pre-pubescent boys."" Mr Johnson told the jury they would need to decide whether they were listening to a group of men, who as Mr Bennell argues, had jumped on the bandwagon and made up stories, or to a series of serious sexual offences by a ""devious paedophile"" against ""very vulnerable lads"". Mr Bennell is on trial for 35 counts of indecent assault, 11 serious sexual assaults and two counts of attempted sexual assault, on boys aged between eight and 14. He appeared via video-link on Tuesday. The jury was told this was due to an illness that required him to be fed through a tube. The court was told how during questioning, Mr Bennell told police he was suffering with cancer which in turn had caused memory problems. Mr Bennell had said one complainant had financial motivations for accusing him, the jury heard. Before the trial, Mr Bennell admitted seven charges of indecent assault committed between 1981 and 1991, relating to three boys aged between 11 and 14. The trial continues.

Six in court on terror group charges,"(Clockwise from top left) Five of the defendants: Adam Thomas, Darren Fletcher, Joel Wilmore, Nathan Pryke and Claudia Patatas Five men and a woman have appeared in court charged with belonging to banned British Neo-Nazi group National Action. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the defendants had allegedly persisted with the organisation despite the ban. One defendant, Daniel Boguvonic, said he intended ""to fight these charges from start to finish"". All six have indicated not-guilty pleas to being members of the group, following an inquiry led by West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. The defendants, who were charged on Monday, are: Nathan Pryke, 26, of Dartford Road, March, Cambridge Adam Thomas, 21, of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, Oxfordshire Claudia Patatas, 38, of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, Oxfordshire Darren Fletcher, 28, of Kitchen Lane, Wednesfield, Wolverhampton Daniel Bogunovic, 26, of Crown Hills Rise, Leicester Joel Wilmore, 24, of Bramhall Moor Lane, Hazel Grove, Stockport The charges brought against the six relate to belonging to National Action between December 2016 and September last year. The five men all gave their identities as British, but Ms Patatas, a wedding photographer who lives with Mr Thomas, told the court she is Portuguese. Mr Thomas denied an additional charge of possessing the Anarchist Cookbook 2000, which contains information likely to be useful for preparing acts of terrorism. Mr Boguvonic also faces charges of intending to incite racial hatred by posting material which is threatening, abusive or insulting at Aston University campus in Birmingham in 2016, which he denies. Mr Fletcher faces five additional counts of breaching an anti-social behaviour order. Mr Wilmore is a former army reservist, having served in the Royal Logistic Corps between 2011 and 2013.

'Worst to come' for diesel cars,"The worst is yet to come for diesel cars which will see their sales continue to plunge, a study has warned. Aston University predicts they will account for just 15% of the UK market by 2025, down from a 50% peak. Automotive expert Professor David Bailey said diesel's ""slow death"" was being driven by  ""environmental pressures and consumer confusion"" . He is urging the government to set up a scrappage scheme to encourage drivers to switch to electric cars. UK car sales see first drop for six years What's gone wrong in the UK car market? How toxic is your car exhaust?,external ""The time is right for the government to take the initiative and offer up scrappage benefits to those who are prepared to ditch their diesels and switch to electric cars,"" he said. The latest figures from industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showedsales of new diesel cars fell 17.1% last yearas higher taxes and pollution fears hit demand. Aston University expects a further 10% drop in sales this year and says diesel will account for less than a third of the market by 2020. Diesels have an image problem. The production of high levels of NOx emissions has made them the target of clean air campaigners. The industry argues that the latest generation of diesels is much cleaner than its predecessors. Diesel engines also produce less carbon dioxide - one of the main gases associated with climate change - than petrol equivalents. But that message isn't getting through. People within the industry blame anti-diesel rhetoric from the government, which they say has left people confused and worried. To put it bluntly, too many people think if they buy diesels, they'll face tax rises, bans from city centres, or both. Diesels still account for four in every 10 new cars sold. But demand is falling rapidly. If they are to have a future, then the public and political perception of them will have to change, and change quickly. The SMMT said confusion about the future of diesel had fuelled a backlash against the cars. Diesel vehicles produce most of the nitrogen oxide gas coming from roadside sources, leading to their being targeted by clean-air campaigners. But the cars are also generally more fuel-efficient than petrol cars and therefore produce less carbon dioxide. That helps car companies to meet targets for reducing CO2, introduced to combat climate change. The VW scandal- which showed how many diesel cars, which had passed official tests, were routinely producing much higher levels of toxic emissions when driven on the roads - exacerbated a backlash against the fuel. Higher taxes have also hit demand. Diesel car sales fell by almost a third in December afterNovember's Budget which introduced a levy on new diesel carsthat failed to meet the latest emissions standards. Experts said the one-off tax increase - which comes into effect in April - would be applied to most new diesels. UK car sales see first drop for six years What's gone wrong in the UK car market?

Just Eat criticised over service charge,"Takeaway food app Just Eat is being criticised after introducing a 50p service charge on all its orders. Previously it levied a 50p surcharge on debit and credit card payments. But from Saturday 13 January, all card surcharges will be banned when a new European directive comes into force. Critics say the move by Just Eat flies in the face of the new legislation, which was designed to save consumers up to Â£473m a year in card charges. ""It's wrong for companies to rebrand credit card fees as service charges,"" said Hannah Maundrell, the editor in chief of Money.co.uk. ""The law was changed to stop businesses from profiting from unnecessary credit and debit card fees. So this makes a mockery of the law which is trying to protect us from getting ripped off."" Credit and debit card surcharges to be banned Just Eat enters FTSE 100 In a statement, Just Eat said it had already been considering altering the way it charges its customers. However, it admitted that ""the change to legislation did play a part in prompting the review"". A new look Just Eat bill, showing the 50p service charge The change, which took effect on 8 January, has provoked criticism from the firm's customers on social media. One said the charge was ""awful"", while others said they did not understand why it was being imposed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But Just Eat said the new system would be fairer for its customers, as those paying by cash will also have to pay the charge. ""The 50p charge simply means that along with our restaurant partners, we can continue to deliver the best possible takeaway experience, and applying the charge equally across the customer base ensures fairness for all,"" a spokesperson said. The consumer group Which? called on Trading Standards to investigate whether there is a loophole in the new legislation. ""These new rules should finally put an end to consumers paying excessive surcharges and additional fees just for using their cards,"" said Gareth Shaw, a Which? money expert. ""Trading Standards must now make sure this ban is enforced across the board, and that businesses can't find sneaky ways around it."" Ms Maundrell said that she expected some companies to increase their prices as a result of the new legislation, but this should be reflected in the cost of the goods themselves, to make comparisons easier. ""Being stung at the end of a transaction with a service charge isn't fair - businesses ought to be transparent about their pricing upfront."" Just Eat entered the list of Britain's biggest 100 companies - the FTSE 100 - last month.

Arrests made in human trafficking raids,"This video can not be played Teesside and South Yorkshire targeted in trafficking raids More than 150 police officers have raided properties in Teesside and South Yorkshire in a crackdown on people trafficking and sexual offences. Nine people were arrested in Stockton-on-Tees and another in Sheffield in simultaneous raids. The raids followed several young women reporting they had been trafficked and raped at different addresses. Cleveland Police officers were supported by a team from Immigration Enforcement. All those being held were arrested on suspicion of offences including conspiracy to rape, conspiracy to traffic and blackmail. A total of 10 people were arrested Assistant Chief Constable Jason Harwin said: ""Clearly, to deploy 150 officers shows how seriously we take this. ""Human trafficking, the exploitation of the most vulnerable in our communities by the most ruthless, will not be accepted. ""To those who traffic in human beings, in human lives, who seek to gain from fear or weakness, our message is unequivocal; we are strong, we are determined and we will bring you to justice."" Residential and business addresses were targeted in the raids ACC Harwin said the force had received intelligence that an unknown number of young women had been trafficked within the Cleveland force area for the purposes of sex over a number of months. Reports said victims were raped by multiple men after being driven to residential addresses. He said he was unable to give exact victim numbers at this time, or to say if any of them were juveniles.

Did Trump forget the national anthem?,"This video can not be played President Trump received a mixed reaction of cheers and boos US President Donald Trump was greeted with a mixture of cheers and boos as he took to the field for the national anthem during a college football game in Atlanta. But as The Star-Spangled Banner began to play, social media users turned their attention to his anthem etiquette. Mr Trump's supporters said they were proud to see him standing with his hand over his heart, while his critics said it looked as though he had forgotten the lyrics. He certainly didn't sing all of them. Video of the anthem shows Mr Trump getting off to a slow start. He appears to mouth some of the words while occasionally pausing and missing some out. Some lines and phrases are sung with gusto. The president can clearly be seen mouthing ""bright stars"" and he finishes with a flourish, smiling and singing ""the land of the free and the home of the brave"". What must Americans do during the anthem? Other lines are not sung at all. Whether or not he forgot the words is open for debate. He has been pictured singing the anthem in the past and has been vocal in his support of respecting it. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher has a theory that singing along in this instance is difficult for two reasons: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Flag Code,externalcovers aspects of etiquette when the anthem is played in some detail. The code is never enforced, however, and there is no punishment for breaching it. In the video, the president can be seen standing in the customary way, as stipulated by the code. It states that: During a rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. By contrast, his predecessor President Barack Obama famously neglected to put his hand over his heart during the 2008 election campaign. He said his grandfather had taught him to do this only during the pledge, and to only sing during the anthem. The code adds that military personnel and veterans should salute throughout the anthem. Civilians should stand with right hand over heart and military personnel should salute It makes no mention of whether the anthem should be sung. However, singing the Star-Spangled Banner is encouraged from school onwards - in some schools it is compulsory. In 1942 the National Anthem Committee wrote that ""it is of paramount importance that emphasis be placed upon the singing of the National Anthem"". Ultimately, it comes down to personal choice as to whether the president sings the anthem or just  stands respectfully. Barack Obama has done both, and said in 2016 that ""respecting and honouring our flag and our anthem is part of what binds us together as a nation"". Former President Ronald Reagan once said: ""I can't claim to know the words of all the national anthems in the world, but I don't know of any other that ends with a question and a challenge as ours does."" The president has been extremely vocal in urging respect for the US national anthem. On Monday, he tweeted: We want our flag respected - and we want our NATIONAL ANTHEM respected also!"". He has even changed the banner image on his Twitter account to a photograph of him standing during the anthem before the game. The banner image on the president's Twitter account is a photograph of him during the national anthem Mr Trump has also strongly criticised NFL stars kneeling during the anthem in protest against perceived racial injustice.He has previously insisted that players who fail to stand should be fired or suspended.

North Korea to send team to Olympics,"This video can not be played North and South Korea had a warm meeting in the DMZ North Korea is to send a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games taking place in South Korea in February, officials from the South say. The breakthrough announcement came as the countries met for their first high-level talks in more than two years. The delegation will include athletes, officials and a group of cheerleaders. A military hotline between the nations, suspended for nearly two years, will be reinstated from Wednesday, the South's officials said. North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy Who are North Korea's cheerleaders? They have continued all day and the developments have been conveyed by officials from the South: Vice unification minister Chun Hae-sung told journalists: ""The North side proposed dispatching a high-level delegation, National Olympic Committee delegation, athletes, supporters, art performers, observers, a taekwondo demonstration team and journalists"" to the Games The South proposed that athletes from both Koreas march together at the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang as they did at the 2006 Winter Olympics The South pushed for the reunion of family members separated by the Korean War - a highly emotional issue for both countries - to take place during the Lunar New Year holiday, which falls in the middle the Games The South also proposed resuming negotiations over military issues and the North's nuclear programme The South said it would consider temporarily lifting relevant sanctions, in co-ordination with the UN, to facilitate the North's participation in the Olympics The North's response to all of the South's proposals is not yet known. The opening remarks of head of the North Korean delegation, Ri Son-gwon, were fairly neutral. He said he hoped the talks would bring a ""good gift"" for the new year and that the North had a ""serious and sincere stance"". They are being held in the Panmunjom ""peace village"" in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the border. North Korea first expressed interest in joining the Pyeonchang Games during the New Year There are five senior officials on each side. The leaders of both nations are said to be watching the talks via a CCTV feed. In his New Year address, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had said he was considering sending a team to the Olympics. South Korea's Olympics chief had said last year that the North's athletes would be welcome. Following Mr Kim's overture, the South then proposed high-level talks to discuss the North's participation, but the North only agreed to the talks after the US and South Korea agreed to delay their joint military exercises until after the Olympics. The North sees the annual drills as a rehearsal for war. Some critics in the US see the North's move as an attempt to divide the US-South Korea alliance. Analysis: BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Seoul A little over a week ago North Korea was threatening nuclear war - this morning a delegation from Pyongyang strode across the demarcation line that divides North and South Korea and agreed a North Korean delegation would attend the Pyeongchang Games. It is a sudden and dramatic change after months of tension. But few in the South believe any of this demonstrates a fundamental shift in Pyongyang's position. Experts say North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has become increasingly fearful that the US is planning a military strike against him, and has decided he must do something to de-escalate tensions. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has been thrust in the delicate position of trying to engage the North in genuine dialogue, while not upsetting his very sceptical American ally. North Korea crisis in 300 words Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism North Korea opens new ski resort Back in 2015. Relations then broke down after Seoul suspended a joint economic project at the Kaesong Industrial complex in North Korea following a rocket launch and nuclear test by the North. The incident led to North Korea ending all communication with Seoul, including cutting off the military hotline. This video can not be played Life in a South Korean border town Tensions have risen in the years since. What we know of the Koreas' red and green phones The North's development of its nuclear programme has continued unabated and has created a huge diplomatic conflict with the US administration of President Donald Trump. Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un have conducted a personal feud, with the US leader dubbing Mr Kim ""Rocket Man"" andboasting that his nuclear button is ""much bigger"". North Korea's regular missile tests have brought a tightening of UN and US sanctions. The latest test of a ballistic missile on 28 Novembersparkedanother raft of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans, among other things.

This video can not be played North Korea's star ice-skating duo have qualified for the Winter Olympics There has been no official announcement on the make-up of the North Korean team. Only two North Korean athletes had qualified for the Games - figure skaters Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik - although even they missed the participation deadline and would need IOC clearance. There may be possible wild-card entries, perhaps in short-track speed skating and Nordic skiing, but this has not been confirmed.

Ex-football coach a 'predatory abuser',"Former football coach Barry Bennell was a ""predatory and determined paedophile"" who abused one boy on more than 100 occasions, a court has heard. The ex-Crewe Alexandra coach ""had pretty much unfettered access"" to boys dreaming of a life in the professional game, prosecutors alleged. Mr Bennell, 63, now known as Richard Jones, denies 48 sex offence charges involving 11 boys. Liverpool Crown Court was told offences took place between 1979 and 1991. Prosecutors told the jury the evidence they would hear concerned allegations made against Mr Bennell by boys from England and Wales, and the United States, and that Mr Bennell had served prison sentences in both jurisdictions. Nicholas Johnson QC, prosecuting, told the jury Mr Bennell had worked as a youth football coach in Cheshire, Manchester and Derbyshire. He said some of the abuse took place at the ground of Crewe Alexandra and during tours by the football club, but many incidents occurred at the defendant's home addresses. Mr Johnson said one alleged victim, who says he was abused more than 100 times, met Mr Bennell when he was a scout for Manchester City. The complainant would stay at Mr Bennell's house with other youngsters. ""Not only was there the promise of high quality football, but they were given lots of sports kit and allowed to eat takeaway food,"" Mr Johnson told the jury. The court also heard how Mr Bennell would ""play fight"" with the boys and play a game with them called Follow Me, where they would copy his actions while he would increase degrees of intimacy to gauge how compliant the boys would be to abuse. The complainant said Mr Bennell would turn the lights off and play music to mask the sounds of the abuse, the jury heard. Mr Bennell denied sexual contact with the boy when questioned by police. Barry Bennell worked as a coach for Crewe Alexandra, and a scout for Manchester City Mr Johnson said another complainant said he had been ""desensitised"" by Mr Bennell, who committed ""relentless"" serious sexual assaults against him. That complainant had described the last time he was abused - after he met Mr Bennell to discuss signing forms for Manchester City - as the ""worst day of his life"" . A further complainant described Mr Bennell's home as a ""paradise"" for young boys as he had a pool table, fruit machine and big TVs. Mr Johnson told the court that several of the alleged victims had said they were impressed with the pets he kept it his home - at various times he had a wild cat and a monkey. The prosecutor said that while Mr Bennell ""was a skilled and relatively successful coach, we allege that he had a much darker side"". ""He was also, we say, a predatory and determined paedophile. His particular predilection was pre-pubescent boys."" Mr Johnson told the jury they would need to decide whether they were listening to a group of men, who as Mr Bennell argues, had jumped on the bandwagon and made up stories, or to a series of serious sexual offences by a ""devious paedophile"" against ""very vulnerable lads"". Mr Bennell is on trial for 35 counts of indecent assault, 11 serious sexual assaults and two counts of attempted sexual assault, on boys aged between eight and 14. He appeared via video-link on Tuesday. The jury was told this was due to an illness that required him to be fed through a tube. The court was told how during questioning, Mr Bennell told police he was suffering with cancer which in turn had caused memory problems. Mr Bennell had said one complainant had financial motivations for accusing him, the jury heard. Before the trial, Mr Bennell admitted seven charges of indecent assault committed between 1981 and 1991, relating to three boys aged between 11 and 14. The trial continues.

Growth spurt worries Japanese astronautNorishige Kanai says he is worried he will not be able fit into his Soyuz seat for the return journey.9m9 minutes agoAsia,"Astronaut Norishige Kanai (L) left Earth for the ISS last month on a six-month mission A Japanese astronaut who is living on the International Space Station says he has grown 9cm (3.5in) since arriving there just over three weeks ago. Norishige Kanai wrote on social media he was worried he would not fit into the seat of the Russian Soyuz vehicle that is due to bring him home in June. Astronauts grow an average of between two and five centimetres in space. This is because of the absence of gravity which allows the vertebrae in their spines to spread apart. [UPDATE:Norishige Kanai later said he made a ""measuring mistake""] Mr Kanai tweeted: ""Good morning, everybody. I have a major announcement today. We had our bodies measured after reaching space, and wow, wow, wow, I had actually grown by as much as 9cm! ""I grew like some plant in just three weeks. Nothing like this since high school. I'm a bit worried whether I'll fit in the Soyuz seat when I go back."" The Soyuz spacecraft which takes the astronauts from and to Earth has a limit on seating height. If crew members become too tall, it could pose a problem. Skin-tight suits for space explorers Out-of-this-world astronaut facts Astronauts can grow while in space and return to a normal height when they go back to Earth. ""Nine centimetres is a lot, but it is possible, knowing that every human body is different,"" Libby Jackson of the UK Space Agency told BBC News. ""You do get taller in space as your spine drifts apart, usually by about two to five centimetres. ""There's a range of growth for different people, and everybody responds differently."" This is the first space mission for the Japanese astronaut who was previously a diving medical officer with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.

Travellers 'encouraged' to fake illnessABTA says millions of holidaymakers are being asked to pretend they were sick while away.12h12 hours agoBusiness,"Millions of Britons are being encouraged to say they were sick while on holiday, according to the Association of British Travel Agents. A poll carried out for ABTA suggests that 19% of all holidaymakers may have been approached by a claims management company on their return home. They are told that there is money waiting for them if they file a claim. On average, successful claimants get payouts of just over Â£2,000 each. As many as nine million Britons have been approached to make such sickness claims, the poll suggests. Plans to limit holiday sickness claims Thomas Cook wins holiday sickness case In 2016 the travel industry spent more than Â£240m fighting claims, making all holiday packages more expensive. The government has already announced plans to discourage such activity, but ABTA said any new rules need to be in place before the 2018 holiday season. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it was trying to implement the changes as quickly as possible. Since 2013 the industry has reported a 500% rise in reports of sickness while customers are away, even though the hotels involved say the number of cases has remained static. The rise in claims also appears to be confined to holidaymakers who come from the UK. The poll suggests that few people know such claims can end with a prison sentence. Under existing law, those who commit such fraud can face a sentence of up to three years. Some holidaymakers are told to claim they got food poisoning on holiday In October last year, a couple from Merseyside were jailed after pretending to be sick on holiday. And last week a Derbyshire couple pleaded guilty to fraud after claiming a trip to Turkey was ruined by diarrhoea and vomiting. ""Unscrupulous claims management companies are encouraging people to make a false sickness claim which could land them with a large fine or even a prison sentence,"" said Mark Tanzer, ABTA's chief executive. The government announced a crackdown on false claims last July, and has since carried out a consultation. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is planning to introduce fixed legal costs for firms defending themselves, making the costs of claims more predictable. The payouts themselves will also be subject to stricter controls. ""We are determined to tackle the holiday sickness claims culture which is damaging the honest majority,"" an MoJ spokesperson said. ""That is why we have set out plans to bring costs under control in these cases, reducing the cash incentives to bring claims against tour operators. We are aiming to bring these changes in as quickly as possible."" It has been said that claims management companies are looking for new areas of business, following a decline in the number of PPI claims being filed.

Toy firm VTech fined over data breach,"Pictures taken with VTech toys were hackable by attackers, security researchers found Electronic toymaker VTech will pay $650,000 (Â£480,000) to settle charges that it failed to protect the privacy of children using its gadgets. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) levelled the charges at VTech following a data breach in 2015. While investigating the breach, the FTC found the firm had broken US laws governing the way data about children is gathered. The FTC said VTech also ""failed to take reasonable steps"" to secure that data. VTech gathered a lot of data about children via its Kid Connect app that was bundled in with many of the electronic toys it makes. Almost 650,000 children downloaded the app and used it in conjunction with VTech's educational toys. The app collected personal information but did so without seeking consent from parents or telling children what data was being collected and the uses to which it would be put, said the FTC. VTech's poor data security practices meant a security researcher could get at the firm's network and take personal information which included customers' names as well as email addresses, it added in its complaint. The hacker was also able to get at an internal database that held copies of encryption keys that, if used, would have let an attacker view photos and audio files uploaded by children and parents. VTech was unaware that its network had been penetrated and data taken until it was contacted by a journalist. ""As connected toys become increasingly popular, it's more important than ever that companies let parents know how their kids' data is collected and used and that they take reasonable steps to secure that data,"" said Maureen Ohlhausen,acting FTC chairwoman, in a statement,external. ""Unfortunately,"" she added, ""VTech fell short in both of these areas."" As well as paying the financial penalty, VTech has pledged to uphold US child data protection laws in future. It has also agreed to improve its security practices and will be subjected to regular independent data and privacy audits for the next 20 years. In a statement, VTech said parents were left in no doubt about the type of information being collected about children and were able to decide who they talked to via the app. It said it collected data only to help users of its products to communicate with each other, not for marketing purposes. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center which campaigns on privacy issues, welcomed the FTC's action but said the penalty could have been levied more swiftly. ""This is good news that the FTC finally took action but we feel like they are moving too slow and clearly following and not leading,""Mr. Rotenberg told the New York Times.,external Toy firm may face competition probe VTech 'is responsible' for kids' data Gym app Pact pays $1m for broken promises UK data protection laws to be overhauled At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

'Tidal wave of waste' hits storm beaches,"This video can not be played This video of a beach in Newquay, Cornwall shows the scale of the problem Storm Eleanor has left Cornish beaches littered with waste scooped up from the seabed by the waves. Martin Dorey, of campaign group #2minutebeachclean, said it was a ""tidal wave of waste"" and removing it would be a mammoth task. The effects of the storm and the waste it brought ashore are visible on some of the most popular beaches. Constantine Bay, Crooklets and Newquay are some of the beaches affected. Rubbish was thrown up on to beaches near Bude Constantine beach is among those awaiting a clean-up Storm Eleanor brought winds of up to 100mph when it hit the UK coast last week. The churning of the sea brought long-dormant piles of waste from the seabed to the surface, said Richard Thompson, professor of marine biology at Plymouth University. ""There are considerable accumulations of waste on the seabed, out of sight and out of mind until it is stirred up by storms,"" he said. ""A big storm brings it all back to shore. ""This kind of rubbish is just not going to go away."" This collection of rubbish, a total of 478 items, was picked up at Widemouth by James Dixon Lines of litter combined with seaweed are washed up at Watergate Bay Beach cleaners face a mammoth task clearing the rubbish In many resorts, volunteers are already clearing up the mess. In Constantine Bay, a beach clean is taking place on Wednesday. Martin Dorey holding up rubbish he found on a beach clean Martin Dorey from #2minutebeachclean shared a few helpful guidelines for beach cleaners: Don't pick up anything organic, just plastics, and be wary of sharp objects such as broken glass or needles Watch out under cliffs and watch for an incoming tide - don't get cut off Recycle as much as you can and put the rest in a beach bin Mr Dorey said Crooklets beach at Bude was ""horrendous"" and had been ""as bad as I have seen it"" until it was cleared up by local volunteers. He is encouraging beach visitors to spend just two minutes picking up rubbish in an effort to spread the load. ""It's fun and healthy and you can time yourself to see how much litter you can pick up in two minutes."" How Storm Eleanor changed the shape of Cornwall's beaches The trampolines that blew away More Devon and Cornwall news Volunteer James Dixon, who collected 478 items from Widemouth beach, said: ""This is as bad as it has ever been and it's not going away unless everyone does their little bit. ""Keep picking it up until beach cleaners are as common as dog walkers, ice cream and surfers on UK beaches."" Responding on social media to the BBC's story, many expressed concern over the issue of litter in the sea. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a pay disclosure last year, North America editor Jon Sopel was listed as having a salary of between Â£200,000 and Â£249,999, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned between Â£150,000 and Â£199,999. ""When I started the China job, I said I will only do this job if I am paid equally,"" Ms Gracie told BBC News on Monday. ""And in July 2017 I discovered the enormous gap that the two men - who were international editors - were earning 50% more at least than the two women who were international editors"". She said she had refused a Â£45,000 rise as it still left a ""big gap"" between her and her male counterparts when all she wanted was to be ""made equal"". In anopen letter,,externalMs Gracie said the issue was about ""men earning more in the same jobs or jobs of equal value. It is pay discrimination and it is illegal"". The BBC has conducted a judge-led audit of the pay of most of its staff, which showed no systemic discrimination, and has commissioned accountancy firm PWC to carry out a separate review of on-air staff, which will be published ""shortly"". A BBC spokesman said: ""The BBC was one of the first to publish a gender pay report showing we are significantly better than the national average."" Speaking on BBC Two's Newsnight, employment lawyer Jennifer Millins, who represents several women taking cases against the corporation, said Ms Gracie's case may ""give some answers"" to other complainants.

Sian Kevill, the former director of BBC World News, said she was ""quite shocked"" at the pay disparity between international editors. ""When you have the same job title, it does seem to denote that you have roughly the same salary,"" she told Newsnight. But she added that pay could be ""very tricky"" if someone is hired externally, but has higher pay because they work in a competitive field or have worked in warzones, for example.

Intel to make flawed chips safe in a week,"Intel's chief executive took a few minutes to address news of flaws in the firm's chips at CES Intel's chief executive has said software fixes to address the recently discovered Meltdown and Spectre bugs in microchips would be released in the next few days. Brian Krzanich was speaking at the beginning of his keynote speech at the CES trade show event in Las Vegas. He said 90% of processors and products from the past five years would be patched ""within a week"". Intel has faced scrutiny afterdetails of the flawsemerged last week. Meltdown and Spectre are unusual in that they are both problems with a fundamental component inside modern computers - the central processing unit (CPU). They allow attackers to potentiallyaccess sensitive data held in the chip's memorythat would otherwise be off limits. Mr Krzanich took a moment at the beginning of his address at the tech fair to refer to the design issues discovered by researchers on some Intel, ARM and AMD chips. However, he did not apologise on his firm's behalf for what he described as an industry-wide problem. ""Before we start I want to take a moment to thank the industry for coming together,"" he told attendees. ""Security is job number one for Intel and our industry, so the primary focus of our decisions and discussions have been to keep our customer's data safe."" More from CES:,external A clunky chat with Sophia the robot HTC unveils 'Pro' virtual reality headset Disobedient robot derails LG's event Samsung unveils giant modular TV He added that there had to date been no confirmed cases in which customer data had been accessed via exploits designed to take advantage of the flaws. And he reiterated advice that users should apply security updates as soon as possible to protect themselves from malicious hackers. ""It's clear this is not just an Intel problem,"" said Geoff Blaber, an analyst from CCS Insight who was at the keynote. ""At least Intel and others have been able to respond in a reasonably efficient manner."" Intel, like rivals IBM and Google, has been working on a quantum computing test chip Mr Krzanich used the rest of his time on stage to explore new technologies that use Intel's products - including ""volumetric"" video capture that maps a scene or sports field in 3D, so the viewer can watch from practically any angle they choose. There was also reference to the company's work in experimental computing architectures, including quantum computing. In quantum computing, qubits - which can have a state of either zero or one simultaneously - take over from traditional bits. Intel has developed a 49-qubit chip, Mr Krzanich announced, putting the firm on a par with rivals IBM and Google, which have been working on chips at a similar scale. The Volocopter 'flying taxi' took to the air and travelled a few feet across the stage while tethered It is thought that millions of qubits will be needed for a quantum computer to offer revolutionary processing capabilities, however. There was also discussion of how Intel's tech is being built into self-driving cars. Its chip-making rival Nvidia had boasted earlier in the week that it was working with more than 320 partners on self-drive vehicles, including Uber and VW. Intel also showed off theexperimental Volocopter ""flying taxi""- which briefly flew on stage, behind a protective barrier. Finally, the keynote closed with a light show powered by 100 Shooting Star Mini drones that did not rely on GPS for navigation - something Mr Krzanich said was an official Guinness World Record. ""It's an excellent showcase for the technology and it does give the brand a boost - it's a very effective marketing exercise,"" said Mr Blaber.

Passenger drone thwarted by light drizzle,"The SureFly drone had not been waterproofed, the company said It was meant to be a bold display of a transportation utopia. Instead, it rained - ever so slightly - and the whole thing was called off. The SureFly passenger drone, due to make its maiden voyage on Monday, stayed grounded over safety concerns. The mild drizzle in the cool Nevada air apparently proved too much for the craft touted, by the company at least, as the future of commuting. The drone was given permission to fly by regulators just last week. The two-person electric-diesel hybrid is said to have a range of 70 miles (113km) and it is intended that it will one day work autonomously. More from CES:,external Disobedient robot derails LG event Samsung unveils giant modular TV HTC unveils 'Pro' virtual reality headset Bottle gadget picks wine to match Bowie Billed as one of the highlights of this year's CES trade show, press had been invited to witness the flight at nearby Boulder City Airport, but ""inclement weather"" meant it was cancelled early Monday afternoon. Asked about the weather, an employee at the airport told the BBC: ""Right now it looks like it could be sprinkling very softly."" Similar ideas have been tested in other parts of the world, most notably in Dubai, where German firm Volocopterflew its 18-rotor drone in September last year. The SureFly drone, made by the Ohio-based Workhorse Group, has four propeller arms holding a total of eight propellers. It is said to be able to carry up to 400lb (181kg). Workhorse told the BBC: ""The SureFly is a purpose-built experimental aircraft and the fuselage on the SureFly at CES has not been waterproofed, although it will be on future production models. ""To avoid potential risks associated with rain affecting the aircraftâs electrical system and the SureFlyâs rotor blades, the SureFlyâs first flight has been postponed."" Patrick Miller, fromUnmanned Aerial Systems Magazine,external, said such delays were not unusual and that the company was wise to avoid any remote risk of a malfunction. ""With an unmanned aircraft designed to carry a person,"" he said, ""why risk negative publicity by flying in rainy weather?"" Workhorse said it hoped to carry out the maiden flight soon.

Ex-Malta investigator 'fears for his life'Jonathan Ferris looked into allegations made by murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.11h11 hours agoEurope,"Jonathan Ferris has given important notes from his time in Malta's anti-money laundering agency to family and friends in case he is killed A former anti-corruption investigator in Malta has told BBC Newsnight he fears for his life after looking into allegations made by murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Jonathan Ferris is seeking full police protection amid concerns he could be targeted after looking into her claims against top political figures. Caruana Galizia was killed in a car bomb near her home on 16 October. She was known for a blog in which she accused powerful figures of corruption. Prosecutors are looking into the possibility that her murder was carried out by hitmen on the orders of someone angered by her reporting. Daphne Caruana Galizia published scathing reports alleging official corruption The Maltese government has vowed to bring her killers to justice and offered a â¬1m (Â£890,000; $1.2m) reward for information. One of the investigations Caruana Galizia was working on at the time of her death centred on allegations against the Maltese prime minister's chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and a senior minister called Konrad Mizzi. Caruana Galizia said they were both financial beneficiaries of secretive ""shell"" companies registered in Panama. Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Malta leaders barred from blogger funeral Dead journalist's sons reject cash reward 'My friend has been killed' Mr Mizzi and Mr Schembri were named in the Panama Papers, a massive data leak from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca in 2015. Both deny any wrongdoing and say their companies were never used. Mr Ferris says he was looking into the case last year while working at the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU), Malta's anti-money laundering agency. But he was sacked in June from the FIAU because, he believes, his work threatened to uncover sensitive secrets. ""We believe there was political interference,"" he told the BBC's Newsnight programme. The FIAU has denied this. The anti-money laundering agency told the BBC that Mr Ferris's dismissal was based ""solely on an objective and comprehensive performance assessment"". But Mr Ferris has now threatened to reveal information he discovered - ""should something happen to me"". ""Following 16 October, and what happened to Daphne Caruana Galizia, I divided my work and my information into six different envelopes with specific notes,"" he said. ""They are distributed to six members of family and close friends, and should something happen to me abruptly - say I'm killed - all that information will go public at once."" Jason Azzopardi, a shadow justice ministry spokesman, said Mr Ferris's fears that he could be targeted were ""realistic"". By John Sweeney, BBC Newsnight Malta is a house divided against itself. Supporters of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat applaud his economic boom while his detractors point to an enfeeblement of the rule of law - and the hard evidence for that is the assassination of his government's greatest critic, Daphne Caruana Galizia. Unease and anxiety are part of Maltese life. Former money laundering investigator Jonathan Ferris fears for his life enough to carry a gun, legally. Immediately after our interview, he offered me a ride back to my hotel. We walked through the gloom of an underground car park to his car and suddenly I felt a stab of terror - that getting blown up was not impossible. Ferris turned the ignition and the engine started normally and I found myself laughing, too loud and too long. For a second or two, I had tasted the fear that grips those people in Malta who believe they know too much for their own good. Watch:Malta's shame? The murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia - BBC Newsnight,external She alleged that a company owned by the Azerbaijani president's daughter paid $1m to a Panama company ultimately owned by the Maltese prime minister's wife, Michelle Muscat. Speaking to the BBC Newsnight's John Sweeney, Mr Muscat categorically denied that he or his wife had used secret offshore accounts to hide payments from Azerbaijan's ruling family - and hit back at Caruana Galizia's reports. ""I know I am in a quite uncomfortable situation having to criticise someone who has been killed brutally."" But he added: ""She didn't have any evidence because what she said was totally incorrect."" Mr Muscat also said Caruana Galizia's source was discredited. Caruana Galizia did not produce any documentary evidence to back up her allegation against the prime minister's wife. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat In her popular blog, the journalist also alleged that Malta's Economics Minister Chris Cardona went to a brothel while at a conference in Germany in January 2017. Mr Cardona denies any wrongdoing. He sued Caruana Galizia, saying he was in his hotel room at the time. That case is ongoing. Three brothers - George and Alfred Degiorgio, aged 55 and 53, and Vincent Muscat, 55 - have been charged with murder and pleaded not guilty. Investigators say the killers detonated the bomb using a mobile phone on a boat offshore. They are looking into whom the suspects had contact with in the run-up to the killing. Thousands mourned the journalist in a silent, candle-lit vigil near Valletta in October Friends of the journalist say they do not believe she investigated the three men charged with her killing. ""Daphne has never ever mentioned these three persons in none of her 20,000 articles,"" said Mr Azzopardi. ""It's an open secret that these are not the persons who commissioned the murder, and we will not rest until we find out who commissioned the murder and what was the motive.""

Cabinet meets as reshuffle continues,"Several new appointments were made to the government whips' office Theresa May has said her reshuffle makes the government look ""more like the country it serves"" with a ""new generation"" of ministers brought in. The PM has appointed several new faces to her ministerial team. The mostly junior ministerial appointments come after Monday's cabinet-level changes. These triggered the resignation of education secretary Justine Greening and were branded a ""lacklustre PR exercise"" by Labour. Of Tuesday's appointments, six men and eight women were new additions to government, including five from ethnic minorities and 11 who were elected in 2015. Six of the women - all elected in 2015 - have been appointed as junior whips, who will be involved with enforcing party discipline. A diverse team? Who's who guide to cabinet Sam Gyimah is new universities minister Top five questions for education new boy Damian Hinds Downing Street said that following the reshuffle there were more women attending cabinet, more female ministers and more members of the government from ethnic minorities. The number of women who are full cabinet members has remained the same as before at six. But the number of other senior female ministers also attending cabinet has risen from two to four, taking the total number of women around the table to 10. By the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Day two arguably went better for the prime minister than day one. She is able to claim, as planned, to have upped the numbers of women in government and new ministers from ethnic minorities. The talk in Downing Street is of a new ""talent pipeline"", the jargon for bringing on a new generation to be ready whenever big jobs available next time round. But there is a lot of muttering among MPs about the overall logic of the reshuffle. Some individual decisions seem puzzling - moving Rory Stewart from International Development, in which he is regarded as a proper expert - to the prisons brief for instance. Making the up-and-coming Brexiteer lawyer, Dominic Raab, the new Housing Minister, stirring controversy by promoting Esther McVey to secretary of state in a department she already controversially served in, DWP, where she was near the top of the Labour hit list. There is real anger too among some members of the government at how Justine Greening was treated on Monday night, compared to her male colleagues. Read Laura's full blog Mrs May said it would allow ""a new generation of gifted ministers to step up and make life better for people across the whole UK"". The latest changes include Jo Johnson being moved from his universities role to transport, and Suella Fernandes becoming a minister in the Department for Exiting the EU. Mr Johnson had been in the firing line over the appointment of columnist Toby Young to the board of the government's universities regulator. The brother of former London mayor Boris Johnson, he will also be the minister for London in his new role.

Simon Dudley, of the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead, said he was referring to anti-social behaviour not homelessness. Theprime minister was among those who disagreed with Mr Dudley's views. More than 100,000 people have signed a petition condemning his comments. The authority leader claimed his initial comments in aletter to the local Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC)were misconstrued. Simon Dudley said he apologised if his initial comments were not communicated clearly ""At no point have I said 'move on the homeless',"" Mr Dudley told BBC Radio Berkshire. ""The key thing is to draw the distinction between homelessness - which is an abomination in a civilised society - and anti-social behaviour, which is a very bad and deteriorating situation in Windsor."" He claimed people who were not homeless begged on the streets of Windsor with ""large quantities of unattended material and bags"" that could pose a terrorist threat.

The prime minister said she disagreed with the council leader's letter, adding that councils should ""work with police"" and ensure accommodation was provided for homeless people. The petition,external, started on 4 January by Holly Fishwick, calls for a demand on the local police force to clear the area of homeless people before the wedding to be withdrawn, and for the the council to offer a ""suitable long-term solution"" for homeless people.

"Mueller 'in talks to interview Trump'The man leading the Russia probe is poised to interview the US president, US reports say.12h12 hours agoUS & Canada","Donald Trump's lawyers are in talks with investigators who are seeking to interview the US president as part of a justice department probe, reports say. The Washington Post, quoting an unnamed person close to Mr Trump, says investigation lead Robert Mueller is likely to interview him within weeks. Mr Trump's legal team has not confirmed the reports. Mr Mueller is investigating possible collusion between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia in the US elections. Tensions between Mr Mueller, the special counsel appointed to look into alleged Russian interference, and the president have risen since the investigation led to charges against several former members of Mr Trump's campaign team. Mr Trump's administration denies working with Russia on the election, and the president has labelled the investigation ""a witch hunt"". The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House According to The Post, Mr Mueller first raised the possibility of interviewing the president in a meeting with his lawyers, John Dowd and Jay Sekulow, in late December. ""This is moving faster than anyone really realises,"" the newspaper quotes a person within the president's circle,external, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr Trump's lawyers are reluctant to allow him to sit down for open-ended questioning and are discussing whether to allow him to provide written answers to some of the questions, The Washington Post and NBC News report. According to NBC, which cited three people close to the story, the talks are ""preliminary and ongoing"". President Trump's legal team did not confirm the reports, but told both media outlets: ""The White House is continuing its full co-operation with the OSC [Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller] in order to facilitate the earliest possible resolution."" The former head of the FBI, Robert Mueller, has been heading up on the collusion probe A spokesman for Mr Mueller also declined to comment. The Post, quoting an unnamed source, says the two sides planned to meet again to continue discussions on terms and substance of any interview. Aside from the Russia angle, special counsel Robert Mueller may also look into whether the president and his inner circle sought to obstruct justice while in office following the firing of FBI director James Comey. Mr Trump in a later TV interview connected his sacking of Mr Comey with a prior investigation into Russia and the 2016 election led by the then-FBI boss. Mr Comey testified that in a private meeting prior to his dismissal, the president had asked him to show leniency in an inquiry into his top aide, Michael Flynn. President Trump has repeatedly denied accusations he pressed Mr Comey to drop his inquiries. Robert Mueller was appointed by the justice department as special counsel shortly after Mr Comey's dismissal. Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? Sitting presidents have been interviewed by prosecutors in the past, most notably when Democrat President Bill Clinton testified before a grand jury in 1998 over his sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Justice department officials quoted by NBC say Mr Mueller is unlikely to pass up on an opportunity to interview the president directly. Two of President Trump's former aides, including Mr Flynn, have already been implicated in Mr Mueller's investigation and are acting as witnesses for the probe. Last month Mr Flynn, Mr Trump's short-lived national security adviser, became the most senior official to be charged after admitting to making false statements to the FBI about meetings with Russia's ambassador. The US intelligence community has already concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump, though Russia denies this.

Ex-Malta investigator 'fears for his life',"Jonathan Ferris has given important notes from his time in Malta's anti-money laundering agency to family and friends in case he is killed A former anti-corruption investigator in Malta has told BBC Newsnight he fears for his life after looking into allegations made by murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Jonathan Ferris is seeking full police protection amid concerns he could be targeted after looking into her claims against top political figures. Caruana Galizia was killed in a car bomb near her home on 16 October. She was known for a blog in which she accused powerful figures of corruption. Prosecutors are looking into the possibility that her murder was carried out by hitmen on the orders of someone angered by her reporting. Daphne Caruana Galizia published scathing reports alleging official corruption The Maltese government has vowed to bring her killers to justice and offered a â¬1m (Â£890,000; $1.2m) reward for information. One of the investigations Caruana Galizia was working on at the time of her death centred on allegations against the Maltese prime minister's chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and a senior minister called Konrad Mizzi. Caruana Galizia said they were both financial beneficiaries of secretive ""shell"" companies registered in Panama. Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Malta leaders barred from blogger funeral Dead journalist's sons reject cash reward 'My friend has been killed' Mr Mizzi and Mr Schembri were named in the Panama Papers, a massive data leak from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca in 2015. Both deny any wrongdoing and say their companies were never used. Mr Ferris says he was looking into the case last year while working at the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU), Malta's anti-money laundering agency. But he was sacked in June from the FIAU because, he believes, his work threatened to uncover sensitive secrets. ""We believe there was political interference,"" he told the BBC's Newsnight programme. The FIAU has denied this. The anti-money laundering agency told the BBC that Mr Ferris's dismissal was based ""solely on an objective and comprehensive performance assessment"". But Mr Ferris has now threatened to reveal information he discovered - ""should something happen to me"". ""Following 16 October, and what happened to Daphne Caruana Galizia, I divided my work and my information into six different envelopes with specific notes,"" he said. ""They are distributed to six members of family and close friends, and should something happen to me abruptly - say I'm killed - all that information will go public at once."" Jason Azzopardi, a shadow justice ministry spokesman, said Mr Ferris's fears that he could be targeted were ""realistic"". By John Sweeney, BBC Newsnight Malta is a house divided against itself. Supporters of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat applaud his economic boom while his detractors point to an enfeeblement of the rule of law - and the hard evidence for that is the assassination of his government's greatest critic, Daphne Caruana Galizia. Unease and anxiety are part of Maltese life. Former money laundering investigator Jonathan Ferris fears for his life enough to carry a gun, legally. Immediately after our interview, he offered me a ride back to my hotel. We walked through the gloom of an underground car park to his car and suddenly I felt a stab of terror - that getting blown up was not impossible. Ferris turned the ignition and the engine started normally and I found myself laughing, too loud and too long. For a second or two, I had tasted the fear that grips those people in Malta who believe they know too much for their own good. Watch:Malta's shame? The murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia - BBC Newsnight,external She alleged that a company owned by the Azerbaijani president's daughter paid $1m to a Panama company ultimately owned by the Maltese prime minister's wife, Michelle Muscat. Speaking to the BBC Newsnight's John Sweeney, Mr Muscat categorically denied that he or his wife had used secret offshore accounts to hide payments from Azerbaijan's ruling family - and hit back at Caruana Galizia's reports. ""I know I am in a quite uncomfortable situation having to criticise someone who has been killed brutally."" But he added: ""She didn't have any evidence because what she said was totally incorrect."" Mr Muscat also said Caruana Galizia's source was discredited. Caruana Galizia did not produce any documentary evidence to back up her allegation against the prime minister's wife. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat In her popular blog, the journalist also alleged that Malta's Economics Minister Chris Cardona went to a brothel while at a conference in Germany in January 2017. Mr Cardona denies any wrongdoing. He sued Caruana Galizia, saying he was in his hotel room at the time. That case is ongoing. Three brothers - George and Alfred Degiorgio, aged 55 and 53, and Vincent Muscat, 55 - have been charged with murder and pleaded not guilty. Investigators say the killers detonated the bomb using a mobile phone on a boat offshore. They are looking into whom the suspects had contact with in the run-up to the killing. Thousands mourned the journalist in a silent, candle-lit vigil near Valletta in October Friends of the journalist say they do not believe she investigated the three men charged with her killing. ""Daphne has never ever mentioned these three persons in none of her 20,000 articles,"" said Mr Azzopardi. ""It's an open secret that these are not the persons who commissioned the murder, and we will not rest until we find out who commissioned the murder and what was the motive.""

Morrisons rings up higher Christmas sales,"The UK's fourth largest supermarket, Morrisons, continued to ring up growing sales over the key Christmas period. The chain sold 2.8% more in the 10 weeks to 7 January than it did for the same period a year earlier, not including new store openings. Christmas trading was particularly strong with sales for the last six weeks up 3.7% compared to a year ago. Morrisons said the increase was due to more tills being open, shorter queues, and improved stock availability. The chain said it had ""become more competitive, and despite the rising cost of many commodities the price of a basket of key Christmas items was the same as the previous year"". ""More and more customers found more things they wanted to buy at competitive prices at Morrisons this Christmas,"" said chief executive David Potts. Morrisons' shares rose 4% in early trading following the trading update. Higher inflation and squeezed incomes have resulted in consumers spending a greater proportion of their household budget on food. Figures published on Tuesday from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel show that British shoppers spent Â£1bn more in supermarkets over the last 12 weeks of last year, compared to the year before. Overall supermarket sales were up 3.8% for the 12 weeks to 31 December 2017, with sales of mince pies 13.2% higher than in 2016 and alcohol sales up 5.1%. Rising food costs hit festive spending Mothercare issues profit warning as Christmas sales sink Debenhams shares dive after weak Christmas trade Morrisons' sales figures were better than analysts' forecasts of about 1.7% for the Christmas period. The supermarket's like-for-like sales have risen for the last eight consecutive quarters as the chain focuses on expanding its home delivery services via link-ups with both Ocado and Amazon. It has also expanded its premium ""Best"" range of goods and rolled out an automated system for keeping shelves stocked. Retail sales, including in stores and online, but excluding fuel, were up 2.1% for the ten weeks to 7 January. Wholesale sales to other outlets, including the convenience shop chain, McColls, were 0.7% higher. Sales at the online arm of the supermarket, Morrisons.com, rose by more than 10%. Bernstein's retail analyst, Bruno Monteyne said: ""The strong results are driven by improvements in store, much better availability from the new ordering system, and very strong growth (25%) in their new 'Best' premium range. Morrisons customers are no longer having to shop elsewhere for their more upmarket products."" He added it was ""a good start"" for UK retailers announcing trading updates this week, which include Sainsbury's, Tesco and Marks and Spencer. Morrisons' share price has fluctuated over the last three months Kantar's figures showed that despite tightening household budgets, shoppers continued to trade up to more expensive options: a record Â£469m was spent on premium own label lines in December alone with chilled items, fresh meat and bakery featuring prominently. Molly Johnson-Jones, Senior Retail Analyst at GlobalData said Morrisons' ""Best"" range had ""resonated well with consumers"" and the chain was reaping the benefits from that and from its growing ""food to order"" service offering party food and platters.""

Greening quits cabinet in PM's reshuffle,"Justine Greening has resigned from the government after refusing a job as work and pensions secretary in Theresa May's cabinet reshuffle. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM was ""disappointed"" the ex-education secretary had quit. She has been replaced by Damian Hinds, while Esther McVey has been promoted to be the new work and pensions secretary. Brandon Lewis is Tory chairman, Matt Hancock is culture secretary and Karen Bradley is Northern Ireland secretary. She replaces James Brokenshire, who resigned for health reasons. The reshuffle continues with junior ministerial roles on Tuesday. Laura Kuenssberg: Was May foiled in reshuffle aims? Who's in the cabinet and who's out? Ms Greening's resignation comes less than a month after she launched the government's social mobility strategy. In her resignation statement she said: ""Social mobility matters to me and our country more than a ministerial career. ""I'll continue to work outside of government to do everything I can to create a country for the first time that has equality of opportunity for young people wherever they are growing up."" In Mrs May's reshuffle, Mr Lewis, the immigration minister, replaces Sir Patrick McLoughlin as Conservative Party chairman, with James Cleverly as his deputy. Justice Secretary David Lidington has been moved to the Cabinet Office. Mr Lidington, who will deputise for Mrs May at PMQs, is succeeded by David Gauke - who is switching from work and pensions, where his responsibilities included the roll-out of universal credit. Damian Hinds is new education secretary Karen Bradley named new NI secretary NI Secretary James Brokenshire resigns Mr Lewis, the Great Yarmouth MP, has been a minister since 2012 and is a qualified barrister and former local councillor. In his role as chairman he will be tasked with broadening the Conservatives' appeal after they lost their Commons majority in June's general election. He will be assisted by Mr Cleverly, the pro-Brexit backbench MP for Braintree, and a new line-up of vice chairs with responsibility for different areas has also been announced. The replacement for Mr Brokenshire, who is awaiting surgery for a lung condition, will be at the heart of attempts to end the political deadlock at Stormont. Theresa May posed with the new CCHQ team outside No 10 James Brokenshire had been Northern Ireland secretary since July 2016 Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson are staying in their jobs. Jeremy Hunt, who had been touted for a possible move, remains in his job, which has been renamed secretary of state for health and social care. Also not moving is Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, but the word ""housing"" has been added to the title of his department. Labour said Mrs May should focus on the pressures in the NHS rather than what it said was a ""desperate PR exercise"". Veteran Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames did not seem impressed: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Grant Shapps, Conservative party chairman between 2012 and 2015, said the reshuffle had not been ""brilliantly executed"" but praised plans for housing and health. ""There was some good stuff, strangely buried in a reshuffle that didn't quite go to plan,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. He said the addition of housing to the title of the communities department would give ""a lot more focus"" to government plans to build more homes - adding that plans to bring health and social care together were ""quite smart"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The government's big plan for the new year is to dodge the real issues and reshuffle the pack in a pointless and lacklustre PR exercise. ""It's simply not good enough. You can't make up for nearly eight years of failure by changing the name of a department."" Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Theresa May had mulled over her reshuffle for months. On Monday she felt daring enough to do it, after ending the tumult of 2017 with the government in better shape than for quite some time, despite the embarrassing departures of some of her colleagues. The task was not to make radical changes, the most senior jobs were never in question, but the plan was to get the right reformers into the right jobs in her view, and to plan for the future. The question of the long term will still be dealt with on Tuesday, when junior ministers are expected to be appointed, with far greater numbers of women and ethnic minority MPs, part of the Tories' effort to look more like the country they govern. Read the rest of Laura's blog The changes, which will be Mrs May's third reshuffle since becoming PM in July 2016, were triggered by her sacking of Damian Green last month as first secretary of state. Mr Green was fired from his position, a role in which he was effectively Mrs May's deputy, after making ""misleading statements"" to the press about pornography found on his office computer in 2008. Mr Lidington has replaced Mr Green in the Cabinet Office but has not been made first secretary. Downing Street confirmed he would stand in at Prime Minister's Questions and take over a ""significant"" number of the committees that Mr Green chaired. Andrea Leadsom remains as Leader of the Commons, and Liz Truss will continue her role as chief secretary to the Treasury. Social care and health - by Hugh Pym, BBC health editor There have been increasing calls for an integration of health and social care in England - the two areas are already combined in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Cuts in social care funding in England have been blamed by some as a factor in the pressures on the NHS - with delays discharging medically fit patients from hospital caused by problems finding social care provision. The Department of Health already has responsibility for social care - but it is run by local authorities, partly paid for by council tax, and the central Whitehall grant comes through the Department for Communities and Local Government. It is not clear whether that grant will now move across to the rebranded Department of Health and Social Care. A Government policy paper on social care, known as a Green Paper, is due next summer - and it seems likely that Jeremy Hunt will now play a central role in preparing that document, rather than it staying with the cabinet office.

New Tory chairman defends reshuffle,"Several new appointments were made to the government whips' office Theresa May has said her reshuffle makes the government look ""more like the country it serves"" with a ""new generation"" of ministers brought in. The PM has appointed several new faces to her ministerial team. The mostly junior ministerial appointments come after Monday's cabinet-level changes. These triggered the resignation of education secretary Justine Greening and were branded a ""lacklustre PR exercise"" by Labour. Of Tuesday's appointments, six men and eight women were new additions to government, including five from ethnic minorities and 11 who were elected in 2015. Six of the women - all elected in 2015 - have been appointed as junior whips, who will be involved with enforcing party discipline. A diverse team? Who's who guide to cabinet Sam Gyimah is new universities minister Top five questions for education new boy Damian Hinds Downing Street said that following the reshuffle there were more women attending cabinet, more female ministers and more members of the government from ethnic minorities. The number of women who are full cabinet members has remained the same as before at six. But the number of other senior female ministers also attending cabinet has risen from two to four, taking the total number of women around the table to 10. By the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Day two arguably went better for the prime minister than day one. She is able to claim, as planned, to have upped the numbers of women in government and new ministers from ethnic minorities. The talk in Downing Street is of a new ""talent pipeline"", the jargon for bringing on a new generation to be ready whenever big jobs available next time round. But there is a lot of muttering among MPs about the overall logic of the reshuffle. Some individual decisions seem puzzling - moving Rory Stewart from International Development, in which he is regarded as a proper expert - to the prisons brief for instance. Making the up-and-coming Brexiteer lawyer, Dominic Raab, the new Housing Minister, stirring controversy by promoting Esther McVey to secretary of state in a department she already controversially served in, DWP, where she was near the top of the Labour hit list. There is real anger too among some members of the government at how Justine Greening was treated on Monday night, compared to her male colleagues. Read Laura's full blog Mrs May said it would allow ""a new generation of gifted ministers to step up and make life better for people across the whole UK"". The latest changes include Jo Johnson being moved from his universities role to transport, and Suella Fernandes becoming a minister in the Department for Exiting the EU. Mr Johnson had been in the firing line over the appointment of columnist Toby Young to the board of the government's universities regulator. The brother of former London mayor Boris Johnson, he will also be the minister for London in his new role. Among the other ministerial moves announced on Tuesday: Mr Johnson was replaced by Sam Gyimah as universities minister Mark Garnier lost his job as trade minister - a source said his departure was not related to recent allegations of improper conduct John Hayes (transport), Philip Dunne (health) and Robert Goodwill (education) also left their posts Alok Sharma moved from housing to employment Dominic Raab replaced Mr Sharma as housing minister Rory Stewart replaced Mr Raab as justice minister Margot James, Harriet Baldwin and Caroline Dinenage become ministers of state at Culture, the Foreign Office and Health respectively John Glen and Robert Jenrick join the Treasury The most high-profile cabinet ministers all kept their jobs in the reshuffle, in which Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is believed to have persuaded the PM to keep him in post with a beefed-up role rather than move him to another department. The reshuffled cabinet met for the first time on Tuesday Rory Stewart move to justice surprised some commentators Sam Gyimah is the new universities minister Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, new Conservative deputy chairman James Cleverly said he was not worried about the hostile newspaper headlines generated by the reshuffle. ""Today and yesterday were about reshuffles and that always causes lots of froth and drama in the media,"" he said. ""Today's headlines are what they are - tomorrow and onwards we will be getting the really important stuff which is about what we are doing, what we are delivering in government."" Esther McVey has been made work and pensions secretary In some of the key cabinet appointments on Monday: Ms Greening was replaced as education secretary by Damian Hinds Esther McVey was promoted to work and pensions secretary Justice Secretary David Lidington was moved to the Cabinet Office, and will deputise for Mrs May at Prime Minister's Questions David Gauke replaced Mr Lidington as justice secretary Matt Hancock is culture secretary and Karen Bradley is the new Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis was made the Conservative Party chairman Two departments were renamed - housing was added to the title of the communities department while the title of Mr Hunt's health brief now includes social care. Justine Greening resigned after being offered the job of work and pensions secretary Alan Milburn, the former Labour minister who was until recently the government's social mobility tsar, said Ms Greening's departure was ""a loss as far as social mobility is concerned"", saying she had been ""actually getting on and doing something"". Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also said she was sorry to see Ms Greening leave: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lorry driver saves the day during labourA low-loader driver carries a pregnant woman's car through flood water while she is in labour.10h10 hours agoEssex,"Kelly Brinkman, Olivia, Paolo Pereira with new baby Lillie A new mother has thanked a lorry driver who carried her car over a flooded causeway while she was in labour. Kelly Brinkman was in labour and waiting for 3ft 6ins deep (1.2m) sea water to recede on The Strood Causeway from Mersea Island, Essex. Justin Tacey, 45, offered to put her car on his lorry and drive across. Mr Tacey inched through the rising tide to get her on the road to hospital, where her breech baby girl was delivered by Caesarean section. Ms Brinkman and partner Paolo Pereira had driven to different places to get off the island last Thursday but were prevented by the high tide. This video can not be played A lorry driver helped Kelly Brinkman get to hospital Ms Brinkman said: ""I am just so grateful to Justin. He probably saved the baby's life because she was in a breech position and well on her way. The only way to save her was a Caesarean section. ""We have named her Lillie. She is now fine but always hungry and joins her sister Olivia."" Mr Tacey, who works for Emmitt Plant at Diss in Norfolk, said he had been on the island making a delivery and was waiting for the coastguard to let him cross back over the causeway. ""I noticed a man looking panicky on the phone and we got chatting,"" he said. ""He said his partner was in labour and he was worried as it looked like a long wait for the tide to go down."" The view as Ms Brinkman travelled over the flooded causeway Mr Tacey said he spoke to the coastguard team and suggested he could carry the couple's Ford Kuga through the water on the back of his lorry. ""It took about five minutes to cross the half mile causeway slowly and carefully,"" he added. West Mersea Coastguard also paid tribute to Mr Tacey, calling him a ""true gentleman"".

Antiques Roadshow to review ivory policy,"The BBC said the Antiques Roadshow, presented by Fiona Bruce, rarely shows ivory items The BBC is to review its policy of allowing objects made of ivory to appear on the Antiques Roadshow. The programme has faced criticism from wildlife campaigner Virginia McKenna, who said it presented ivory as a thing of beauty, not a symbol of destruction. The UK prohibits the sale of ivory pieces produced after 1947, although the government hasproposed banning the sale of all ivoryitems. The BBC said it sought to raise awareness of the ""horrors"" of poaching. Former Born Free actress Ms McKenna said in an interview with theRadio Times,externalthat the BBC should step away from the ""parochial fascination with antiques at any price"". She said she was a regular viewer of the Antiques Roadshow, which she accused of continuing to represent ivory as a ""desirable item, a thing of beauty instead of a symbol of destruction"". She added: ""We cannot afford to put a value on bloody ivory."" Virginia McKenna said the show's inclusion of ivory was ""out of touch"" with public opinion A spokeswoman for the BBC said ivory items rarely featured on the Antiques Roadshow. ""In recent years, on the rare occasions when we have examined an object, the Antiques Roadshow has sought to raise awareness of the debate around antique ivory,"" she said. She said the programme would inform viewers about current legislation and draw attention to the ""horrors of modern-day poaching"". The government is set toprovide its response,externalto a consultation that closed in December, which proposed a more comprehensive ban - with certain exemptions for items such as musical instruments and items of cultural importance. China, one of the world's biggest markets for ivory, recently announced it wasclosing down its domestic market. There are concerns that about 20,000 elephants are slaughtered every year due to the global demand in ivory, threatening their extinction within decades in some African countries.

Consultation on smacking ban in Wales,"This video can not be played Should Wales impose a smacking ban? Plans to outlaw smacking children in Wales are going out to a three-month consultation. Ministers said removing the defence of reasonable punishment would make it clear smacking was ""no longer acceptable"". Charities including the NSPCC said this would bring Wales in line with dozens of other countries. But campaigners against the lawfear it could criminalise ordinary parents. Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, said: ""As a parent of three boys myself, I know being a parent can sometimes be a challenging experience. ""Our knowledge of what children need to grow and thrive has developed considerably over the last 20 years. We now know that physical punishment can have negative long-term impacts on a child's life chances and we also know it is an ineffective punishment."" Scotland became the first part of the UK to confirm plans tooutlaw smacking childrenlast year. Now ministers in Wales want parents to choose ""positive and more effective methods"". Smacking 'has no place in modern Wales' Hitting your child 'simply doesn't work' Smacking 'is every parent's right' Read the consultation document,externaland there is also aversion aimed at children and young people,external Comments from BBC Wales News Facebook,external The proposed law would not involve creating a new offence but would instead remove the defence to the existing offences of assault and battery. So, any adult looking after a child would no longer be able to use physical or corporal punishment against them. If prosecuted, parents or guardians could expect to face proceedings for assault in magistrates court; the consultation document said it anticipates a initial increase in cases but this ""would decline in the longer term as attitudes to corporal punishment continued to change"". 'Reign of terror' Cathryn Scott, mother of three and writer of the blog 'Cardiff Mummy Says' told BBC Wales: ""It makes me really sad, this 'oh it didn't do me any harm', which a lot of the older generations do say. My personal opinion is that I would never hit a child. ""When my children are misbehaving it's because something else is an issue and I don't think a smack is an effective way. ""For example yesterday my daughter was being very cheeky, very shouty. And it turned out some of her friends at school had been mean to her. So if I'd have smacked her she'd have never told me all of that, she actually got quite upset about what happened at school. ""She told me what had happened and now I'm in a position to do something about it. If I'd just have smacked her she'd just have internalised that and the problem wouldn't have been dealt with."" ""How can I hit my child and then tell him it's wrong to hit his brother? ""I would never want that reign of terror in my house to be honest."" Read another argument against smacking 'You've got to set boundaries' Phyllis Preece, mother of two and chairwoman of the National Pensioners Convention for Wales, disagreed: ""It didn't do my sister or I any harm to have a smack and exactly the same with my two children. There's a difference between a smack and a beating. ""What's the point of being a parent if you haven't got control over your children? ""And if you can't chastise your children then what's the point of being a parent in the first place? ""You've got to make sure you set the boundaries for the other children. ""I've known in my generation many a person have had a cane on their dresser and it's been there as a warning and you knew how far to go otherwise you'd get it across the leg.

Was PM foiled in reshuffle aims?,"Theresa May had mulled over her reshuffle for months. On Monday she felt daring enough to do it, after ending the tumult of 2017 with the government in better shape than for quite some time, despite the embarrassing departures of some of her colleagues. The task was not to make radical changes, the most senior jobs were never in question, but the plan was to get the right reformers into the right jobs in her view, and to plan for the future. The question of the long term will still be dealt with tomorrow, when junior ministers are expected to be appointed, with far greater numbers of women and ethnic minority MPs, part of the Tories' effort to look more like the country they govern. Greening quits cabinet in PM's reshuffle Damian Hinds is new education secretary New faces and potential new stars have already been despatched to Tory HQ to try to make a difference there. But in terms of the hopes Theresa May had of moving her cabinet colleagues around? Of three experienced ministers she wanted to move? One persuaded her he shouldn't have to budge, one was never even asked to shift, and the third, Justine Greening, quit in protest. In allowing Greening to walk, the PM has lost a Northern voice, who represents a London marginal constituency, who is in a same sex relationship. Even without her six years experience in the Cabinet, any one of those factors are precious commodities in the Tory Party. And while Justine Greening is a determined pragmatist - her detractors might say determination that can make her difficult - she was a strong Remain voice who could be tempted to join that powerful chorus of former ministers on the backbenches who relentlessly push the PM for answers on her Brexit plans. Even prime ministers at the peak of their powers can fall foul of reshuffles when their colleagues refuse to collaborate. One foiled move can upset the whole play. But while Monday wasn't quite Christmas panto, it was not the glorious return to the business of government planned to usher in 2018. Theresa May had enough authority to try to make her moves, but found she had not enough to deliver them all.

Who's in the cabinet and who's out?,"Theresa May has reshuffled her cabinet following the resignations of Dominic Raab and Esther McVey. Here is a guide to her new top team. Despite speculation that he would be sacked after the June 2017 General Election, Philip Hammond has remained chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. Mr Hammond was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum and is seen as one of the leading cabinet voices for a softer version of Brexit than that advocated by Leave supporting colleagues. He is known by some around Westminster as ""box office Phil"" for his perceived dull delivery. After becoming an MP in 2010, Sajid Javid has risen swiftly through the ranks of the Conservative Party and government to become the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background. Landing the job followingAmber Rudd's resignation,the son of Pakistani immigrants left behind his role as communities secretary. Mr Javid, a former executive at Deutsche Bank, has also had brief stints as business secretary and culture secretary. He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the 2016 leadership contest, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM. Jeremy Hunt became foreign secretary after Boris Johnson resigned over Brexit policy in July 2018.  It meant an end to his marathon stint as health secretary, a job he took in David Cameron's 2012 reshuffle, having previously served as culture secretary. He weathered a number of controversies including a 2015 battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes. He is thought to have resisted an attempt by Theresa May to move him to another job in her January 2018 reshuffle and succeeded in adding responsibility for social care - something previously overseen by local government - to his portfolio. A major promotion for Stephen Barclay, 46, who becomes the third Brexit secretary in six months. Mr Barclay, who was previously a junior minister in the health and social care department, replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned in protest at Theresa May's draft EU withdrawal bill. Despite being regarded as a rising star Mr Barclay, who has served as MP for North East Cambridgeshire since 2010, was reportedly not Mrs May's first choice for the role, with Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox also in the frame. And the job has essentially been downgraded to focus on domestic preparations for the UK's departure, with Theresa May personally assuming responsibility for the remaining negotiations with the EU. A close ally of Theresa May, the former chief whip ruffled a few Tory feathers when he was handed the role of defence secretary in November 2017, with some claiming he lacked the experience for such a vital role. He replaced Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned amid allegations over his past conduct. The appointment was Mr Williamson's first cabinet post. The MP for South Staffordshire was elected to parliament in 2010, and was previously an aide to David Cameron. One of the government's great survivors, Chris Grayling has been in the cabinet since 2012, when he was made Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, before going on to serve as Commons leader. A leading voice in the Leave campaign, he was made transport secretary by Theresa May in July 2016. He defied predictions he would be sacked or moved in Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle, after attracting criticism over rising rail fares, Southern Rail's disrupted services and rail franchising difficulties. The former BBC and Channel 4 TV producer has been MP for Epsom and Ewell, in Surrey, since 2001. A veteran right winger and ardent Brexiteer, Liam Fox was put in charge of the newly-created department for international trade by Theresa May after she became PM, with the job of forging post-Brexit trade deals with other nations. He was David Cameron's first defence secretary but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas. Mr Fox - who was a GP before entering politics - stood in the 2016 leadership race against Theresa May, but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs. Michael Gove's was a dramatic comeback in June 2017, when the prime minister brought him back into cabinet as environment secretary. That was just a year after his ministerial ambitions appeared to be over when he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle which followed Mrs May's arrival as prime minister. Before that stint as justice secretary he had previously served as David Cameron's education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. His longtime friendship with Mr Cameron ended as he became probably the then cabinet's biggest name to decide to campaign for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit and initially backing him, Mr Gove withdrew his support for Mr Johnson as Tory leader mid-contest, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third. A former protege of Theresa May at the Home Office, Karen Bradley was handed the role of culture secretary in Mrs May's first cabinet. Her time in that job was dominated by her decision to refer Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox's takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators, something that will be at the top of her successor's in-tray. She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010. She replaces James Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary,who resigned for health reasons David Gauke became the sixth justice secretary in six years - and the first solicitor to take the role - in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. His appointment breaks a run of four consecutive non-legally qualified MPs to hold the position of the government's chief law officer. He was previously work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury. The former City lawyer has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. Matt Hancock was promoted to become health secretary in the wake of the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson over Brexit policy. After only a few months as culture secretary, he got the call to move up the rankings to health when Jeremy Hunt was promoted from health to foreign secretary. Mr Hancock, who was close to the former chancellor George Osborne during the David Cameron years, is a former Bank of England economist has been MP for West Suffolk since 2010. He is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race, having raced to victory at Newmarket in August 2012. And his later appearances as culture secretary included attempting to moonwalk and jumping off a wall while having a go at parkour. Greg Clark is another minister who has survived the transition from the Cameron to the May years. In his case he has been business secretary since July 2016, after a year or so looking after the local government brief. It had been widely speculated that he was to be moved in the January 2018 reshuffle to make way for Jeremy Hunt - but it did not happen after the health secretary successfully argued the case to stay put. The Middlesbrough-born former business consultant, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, started his political journey as president of the Liberal Democrat student branch at Magdalene College, Cambridge. James Brokenshire returned to the cabinet following the reshuffle prompted by Amber Rudd's resignation as home secretary. The former Northern Ireland secretaryhad stepped down in Januarydue to ill health after being diagnosed with the early stages of lung cancer - but was back in Parliament a month later after ""recovering strongly"" from lung surgery. The former lawyer is a close ally of Theresa May, having served under her for five years at the Home Office. Jeremy Wright was promoted from attorney general to be the new culture secretary after Matt Hancock's promotion to health secretary in July 2018. The moves were in Theresa May's reshuffle in the wake of David Davis and Boris Johnson's Brexit resignations. A barrister specialising in criminal law, Mr Wright became an MP in 2005, serving in the whips office for the Conservatives under David Cameron from 2007 to 2012 before becoming a justice minister in 2012 and becoming attorney general in 2014. Penny Mordaunt: New International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt replaced Priti Patel in this role in November 2016, after Ms Patel resigned in the wake of disclosures that she had held a series of unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures. Ms Mordaunt was previously minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions. She was minister for the armed forces under David Cameron, and had been considered a contender to replace Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary. Penny Mordaunt, elected to parliament in 2010 as MP for Portsmouth North, is also known for her strong support of Brexit. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016 - her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation, headed by controversial journalist Toby Young, which runs the free schools programme. One of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be elected to the Commons in the June 2017 snap election. Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post of Scottish Secretary when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015. In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet minister. Amber Rudd returned to cabinet in November to replace Esther McVey as work and pensions secretary. Mrs Rudd resigned as home secretary in April amid a row over targets to remove illegal immigrants. A strong ally of Theresa May, Amber Rudd is known for her pro-EU views and has a reputation as being tough and capable. She has served as MP for Hastings and Rye since 2010 and was promoted swiftly during David Cameron's time in office. However the 2017 election saw her majority reduced to just 346, diminishing her prospects as a possible future leader. Damian Hinds got an unexpected promotion when he was drafted in to replace Justine Greening,who refused a move to the Department for Work and Pensionsin Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. The former management consultant was a Remain supporter and previously served as employment minister in the DWP and before that a junior Treasury minister and government whip. He has been MP for East Hampshire since May 2010. Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remained in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. The former banker and Welsh assembly member was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport. He became an MP in 2010. Former Commons Leader David Lidington replaced Damian Green, who resigned in December 2017 after misconduct allegations. The Remain supporter did not take on Mr Green's First Secretary of State title but will still play part of that role, standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions and chairing key cabinet Brexit committees. He is a former justice secretary and Europe minister. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto. The new Conservative Party chairman takes the title of minister without portfolio, allowing him to take a seat in the cabinet. He replaced Sir Patrick McLoughlin, who stood down as Tory chairman. The former housing minister briefly served as immigration minister before taking on the job of rebuilding the Tories' campaigning strength for the next general election. A former barrister and leader of Brentwood council, in Essex, he has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.

Safari park gorilla dies aged 56Keepers at Longleat Safari Park say Nico was one of the oldest silverback gorillas in the world.7h7 hours agoWiltshire,"Nico died in his sleep on 7 January One of the world's oldest silverback gorillas has died at Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire. Nico, 56, died in his sleep on 7 January and staff at the park say they are ""truly saddened"". A spokesman said: ""It is with deep regret and huge sadness that we have to announce the death of Nico, our much-loved western lowland gorilla."" Longleat's senior warden, Ian Turner, collected Nico, a western lowland gorilla, from Switzerland in 1989. ""My first memory was having a cup of tea with him,"" he said, explaining that it is important to build up a relationship with gorillas to gain their trust. Watched TV When Nico arrived in England he had to be quarantined in his enclosure for six months. During that time he displayed signs of boredom, so his keepers gave him a television to keep him entertained. When they tried to take the television away, Mr Turner said ""all hell broke loose,"" so it was swiftly returned. Nico kept the television for the rest of his life and particularly enjoyed watching nature documentaries, Mr Turner said.. TV company Sky even tried to make Nico a bespoke remote control, but it turned out not to be ""gorilla-proof"". Nico had a reputation for looking grumpy but his expression signified contentment, his keepers said 'Astonishing' age Nico's partner, Samba, died 10 years ago and Mr Turner said the silverback was ""sad when she went"". However, the pair had a ""brother and sister relationship"" and never bred. After Samba's death, Nico lived alone at the park, which is natural behaviour for adult male gorillas in the wild. Longleat said that attempting to mix him again would have been like putting a ""granddad with boisterous teenagers"". Silverback gorillas in the wild are used to being on their own Gorillas usually live between 30 and 40 years in the wild and Longleat said it was ""quite astonishing"" for Nico, who weighed about 170kgs and was 5'10 tall, to reach the age of 56. But he was ""slowing down"" and his keepers noticed something was wrong when he gradually stopped eating as much as usual. ""It had been a rough winter for him,"" said Mr Turner. He said losing Nico was like ""losing a member of the family"". On his 56th birthday last July, Nico's keepers gave him a cake made from bananas and courgettes with carrot candles.

Rising food costs hit festive spending,"The BRC said there was a ""stark divergence"" between food and non-food sales Consumers spent Â£1bn more on groceries in the final 12 weeks of last year  than in 2016, according to figures from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel. The average household spent a record Â£1,054, while a record Â£469m was spent on premium own label lines. Separately, a British Retail Consortium report said rising food costs meant people had less money for other items. Like-for-like retail sales, which exclude new store sales, rose 0.6% last month, down on December 2016's 1% rise. The BRC said food sales accounted for most of the rise, with spending on non-food items such as clothing down sharply. The Friday before Christmas was the busiest grocery shopping day ever recorded, according to the Kantar data. A total of Â£747m was spent that day, 22 December, and Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""Shoppers are splashing out despite fewer promotions to tempt them. ""Only 36% of spending was on items on offer this year - the lowest level of promotional activity at Christmas since 2009."" Tesco was the fastest growing of the big supermarkets over the period, with sales up by 3.1% over the 12 weeks, while Aldi and Lidl were neck and neck in the chase to be the country's fastest growing supermarket overall, with sales rises of 16.8% year-on-year. ""In some ways Christmas is a tricky time for the discounters: they tend to lose a little market share compared to earlier in the year as many shoppers return to the more traditional supermarkets in search of old favourites,"" added Mr McKevitt. ""Rising to the challenge, Aldi and Lidl collectively managed to attract nearly one million additional households during the past three months."" The BRC, which produces its data with consultancy KPMG, said shoppers' spending power ""had been absorbed by essential items"". It said this had forced shops which did not sell food to discount heavily in the lead-up to Christmas to try and encourage shoppers to spend more. Whilst this had helped boost overall sales, the BRC said it hit many retailers' profits for the period. Over the three months to December last year, sales of non-food items fell 3.7% - marking their steepest drop in five years, the BRC's figures showed. Meanwhile, food sales for the same period rose 4.2%, their biggest rise in six months. ""The divergence between growth in sales of food and non-food has never been so stark,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. Inflation is currently at a near six-year highof 3.1%, easily outpacing the growth in average earnings. The latest official data shows that food inflation in particular has picked up, with prices for fish, oil and fats such as butter and chocolate all higher. This means that many shoppers are spending more on basic essentials. Major non-food retailers have already indicated that they are feeling the strain. On Monday,baby products chain Mothercare warned that annual profitswould be substantially lower due to weak Christmas sales. Last week, department store chainDebenhams issued a profit warningafter reporting disappointing Christmas trading. It subsequently emerged that rival chainHouse of Fraser was seeking to reduce rentson some of its stores, suggesting that it too was struggling. However,sales at Next unexpectedly roseover the Christmas period, prompting the fashion retailer to raise its profit forecast. Supermarket group Morrisons is due to report its festive trading figures later with Sainsbury, Marks & Spencer, Tesco, John Lewis and Waitrose set to report later in the week.

Watchdog asks BBC for Carrie Gracie 'facts',"The UK's equality watchdog is to write to the BBC following the resignation of its former China editor Carrie Gracie amid claims of pay inequality. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would consider whether further action is required based on the corporation's response. Ms Gracie, who has alleged ""unlawful pay discrimination"", thanked the EHRC for ""demanding facts on BBC pay"". The BBC said ""fairness in pay"" was ""vital"" to the corporation. In a statement, the EHRC said: ""Women have a legal right to equal pay with men for equal work."" The watchdog said it was aware of Ms Gracie's claims and would write to the BBC, ""requiring them to provide us with information on their pay policy and the facts in this individual case"".

She said she resigned as China editor because she could not ""collude"" in a policy of ""unlawful pay discrimination"" afterdiscovering an ""enormous gap""between her Â£135,000-a-year salary and that of her male counterparts. Her actions attracted praise on social media from BBC colleagues, MPs and members of the public.

In a pay disclosure last year, North America editor Jon Sopel was listed as having a salary of between Â£200,000 and Â£249,999, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned between Â£150,000 and Â£199,999. ""When I started the China job, I said I will only do this job if I am paid equally,"" Ms Gracie told BBC News on Monday. ""And in July 2017 I discovered the enormous gap that the two men - who were international editors - were earning 50% more at least than the two women who were international editors"". She said she had refused a Â£45,000 rise as it still left a ""big gap"" between her and her male counterparts when all she wanted was to be ""made equal"". In anopen letter,,externalMs Gracie said the issue was about ""men earning more in the same jobs or jobs of equal value. It is pay discrimination and it is illegal"". The BBC has conducted a judge-led audit of the pay of most of its staff, which showed no systemic discrimination, and has commissioned accountancy firm PWC to carry out a separate review of on-air staff, which will be published ""shortly"". A BBC spokesman said: ""The BBC was one of the first to publish a gender pay report showing we are significantly better than the national average."" Speaking on BBC Two's Newsnight, employment lawyer Jennifer Millins, who represents several women taking cases against the corporation, said Ms Gracie's case may ""give some answers"" to other complainants.

Sian Kevill, the former director of BBC World News, said she was ""quite shocked"" at the pay disparity between international editors. ""When you have the same job title, it does seem to denote that you have roughly the same salary,"" she told Newsnight. But she added that pay could be ""very tricky"" if someone is hired externally, but has higher pay because they work in a competitive field or have worked in warzones, for example.

France investigates iPhone slowdown,"Consumer advocates claim a deliberate slowing down of older devices is designed to drive sales of newer models French prosecutors have launched a probe over allegations of ""planned obsolescence"" in Apple's iPhone. Under French law it is a crime to intentionally shorten lifespan of a product with the aim of making customers replace it. In December, Apple admitted that older iPhone models were deliberately slowed down through software updates. But it insisted it was because the phones' battery performance diminished over time. The French investigation is being led by the economy ministry's consumer protection agency. It follows a legal complaint filed in December by pro-consumer group Stop Planned Obsolescence (Hop). Hop said France was the third country to investigate Apple after Israel and the US, but the only one in which the alleged offence was a crime. Penalties could include up to 5% of annual turnover or even a jail term. The group alleged that Apple had both deliberately slowed down some iPhone models through a software update and timed the update to coincide with the release of the newer model, the iPhone 8. ""The slowing down of older devices seems to have the deliberate aim of pushing Apple customers towards purchasing the new model,"" the group said. Hop has previously filed legal complaints against printer manufacturers Epson, Canon, HP and Brother, alleging that the firms deliberately shorten the life of print cartridges. Apple apologises for iPhone slowdowns Is Apple getting sloppy? French President Emmanuel Macron is one of the country's many iPhone customers Buyers of the iPhone have shared anecdotes about the devices slowing down with age for many years. The company issued a public apology in December when confirmation came from users running in-depth tests on their own devices and publishing the results. Apple said the update was designed to extend the life of older phones as their batteries became less capable of providing the power for high-speed operations. ""Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands... as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components,"" the company said. It said its update was made ""to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed"". It slashed the price of replacing an aged battery by two-thirds, which it said would restore devices to their former speed, and pledged to be more transparent in future.

HTC unveils 'Pro' virtual reality headset,"This video can not be played WATCH: Hands-on with HTC headsets at CES. HTC has unveiled an enhanced version of its Vive virtual reality headset at the CES tech fair in Las Vegas. The Vive Pro has two OLED screens that have a total resolution of 2880 by 1600 pixels, which is 78% more than the current model. This is designed to make graphics and text much sharper for the wearer. One analyst said it was a step in the right direction, but VR still needed more quality content to lure gamers. As well as displays that should be more crisp than before, the Vive Pro also includes high performance headphones with a built-in amplifier to offer ""a heightened sense of presence"" and richer sound, according to the Taiwanese firm. However, the company has not yet revealed how much the new headset will cost. The reveal coincided with news that Facebook's Oculus VR division has teamed up with China's Xiaomi. The Beijing-based handset maker will be involved in the creation of Oculus Go - a forthcoming standalone headset that will not need to be plugged into a computer, which is due for release soon. The two firms also announced they would release a version of the kit to bebranded Mi VR Standalone,external. It will exclusively go on sale in China, where most  of Facebook's services are blocked. The Chinese market will get a different version of the VR headset The two firms added that both headsets would be powered by a Qualcomm processor, the Snapdragon 821. Owners of both the new and original HTC headsets will be able to use them with a wireless adapter when it becomes available later this year. HTC says it will connect either of the models to computers running a game or simulation via wi-fi, thanks toIntel's WiGig technology,external. VR fans will be able to try out VR experiences before they purchase them in the updated Viveport store. And the firm has also come up with a new way for virtual reality users to discover new content - 3D previews that they can try out before purchasing or subscribing. These will be available via a revamped version of the Viveport VR store. Viveport's president, Rikard Steiber told his CES audience that he expected the number of experiences available on the platform to rise from 2,000 to 3,000 by the end of 2018.

""It's something that's really needed to help users get over the hump of things like motion sickness [sometimes caused by blurring in VR headset displays]."" Mr Blau told the BBC that much of the hype around virtual reality devices had meant that the technology sometimes failed to live up to people's expectations - something he believes has impactedslightly sluggish sales,externalof VR hardware. The next generation of headsets might include even more advanced technologies like eye-tracking, which could allow ultra high resolution rendering of graphics at the exact point on the screen where users are looking. ""The one thing that will change the situation though is quality content,"" added Mr Blau. ""You could argue and say there are a lot of games out there, even businesses are adopting VR... but it's not nearly enough.

US police chief held in child sex sting,"Michael Diebold wrote to someone he believed was 14 ""everyone has to have a first time"", say prosecutors The stunned wife of a US police chief who was arrested for soliciting sex with a child says her family's lives ""have been completely shattered"". Michael William Diebold, who ran the three-man police force in Leechburg, Pennsylvania, was arrested on Friday. The 40-year-old allegedly sent explicit texts and photos with a person he believed was 14, but it was a police sting. His wife apologised to the public on Sunday. ""I have never hurt so bad in all my life,"" Danielle Reinke Diebold said in a statement to KDKA News. She described her husband as the ""first man ever in my life who never made me question, never gave me a gut feeling, never a bad instinct or sign and we were even in the process of planning to extend our family"". ""This is not who we knew. We knew a loving, caring father and husband and we are grieving the loss of that man,"" she added. Local media filmed the accused's wedding in the summer, which came weeks month after his hand was amputated According to Pennsylvania state prosecutors, Mr Diebold was arrested on Friday after trying to meet an undercover officer who was posing online as a teenager. The criminal complaint says that Mr Diebold had been contacted by the bogus teen after posting an advert in which he stated he was a ""full-time police officer"". Identifying himself as ""kutecop4you"", Mr Diebold wrote: ""I am a dom male that is also employed as a full time police officer. I hope that does not scare you off."" After the undercover agent claimed in the text exchange to be a 14-year-old girl, Mr Diebold allegedly responded: ""Everyone has to have a first time."" The mayor of Leechburg, a borough of about 2,000 people 35 miles (55km) north-east of Pittsburgh, said the chief has been suspended without pay. The town raised money for his prosthetic arm after the accident Over the summer, Mr Diebold was interviewed on national news, after he was maimed in a fireworks accident at the town's annual carnival. Despite the injury, which led to the amputation of an arm, he and his fiancee married 18 days later. The town raised thousands of dollars to help his recovery, and local news crews filmed his wedding. He is now charged with unlawful contact with a minor and criminal attempt to commit involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.

Travellers 'encouraged' to fake illness,"Millions of Britons are being encouraged to say they were sick while on holiday, according to the Association of British Travel Agents. A poll carried out for ABTA suggests that 19% of all holidaymakers may have been approached by a claims management company on their return home. They are told that there is money waiting for them if they file a claim. On average, successful claimants get payouts of just over Â£2,000 each. As many as nine million Britons have been approached to make such sickness claims, the poll suggests. Plans to limit holiday sickness claims Thomas Cook wins holiday sickness case In 2016 the travel industry spent more than Â£240m fighting claims, making all holiday packages more expensive. The government has already announced plans to discourage such activity, but ABTA said any new rules need to be in place before the 2018 holiday season. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it was trying to implement the changes as quickly as possible. Since 2013 the industry has reported a 500% rise in reports of sickness while customers are away, even though the hotels involved say the number of cases has remained static. The rise in claims also appears to be confined to holidaymakers who come from the UK. The poll suggests that few people know such claims can end with a prison sentence. Under existing law, those who commit such fraud can face a sentence of up to three years. Some holidaymakers are told to claim they got food poisoning on holiday In October last year, a couple from Merseyside were jailed after pretending to be sick on holiday. And last week a Derbyshire couple pleaded guilty to fraud after claiming a trip to Turkey was ruined by diarrhoea and vomiting. ""Unscrupulous claims management companies are encouraging people to make a false sickness claim which could land them with a large fine or even a prison sentence,"" said Mark Tanzer, ABTA's chief executive. The government announced a crackdown on false claims last July, and has since carried out a consultation. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is planning to introduce fixed legal costs for firms defending themselves, making the costs of claims more predictable. The payouts themselves will also be subject to stricter controls. ""We are determined to tackle the holiday sickness claims culture which is damaging the honest majority,"" an MoJ spokesperson said. ""That is why we have set out plans to bring costs under control in these cases, reducing the cash incentives to bring claims against tour operators. We are aiming to bring these changes in as quickly as possible."" It has been said that claims management companies are looking for new areas of business, following a decline in the number of PPI claims being filed.

Singing 'can help post-natal depression',"Singing could help mothers recover from post-natal depression more quickly, a study suggests. Researchers found that women who took part in group singing sessions with their babies experienced a much faster improvement in their symptoms than those who did not. The study, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, looked at 134 mothers with post-natal depression. Early recovery is seen to be crucial to limit effects on mother and baby. Post-natal depression is estimated to affect one in eight new mothers. Previous studies have indicated singing can help improve the mental health of older people and those with dementia, but this is the first controlled study of its effect on post-natal depression. The women were placed into three groups: one took part in group singing another took part in in creative play sessions a third group received their usual care, which could include family support, antidepressants or mindfulness The singing workshops saw the mothers learning lullabies and songs from around the world with their babies and creating new songs together about motherhood. And those with moderate to severe symptoms of post-natal depression reported a much faster improvement than mothers in the usual care and play groups. All the groups improved over the 10 weeks, but in the first six weeks the singing group had already reported an average 35% decrease in depressive symptoms. Principal investigator Dr Rosie Perkins said the study, although small, was significant because it was important to tackle the symptoms as quickly as possible. ""Post-natal depression is debilitating for mothers and their families, yet our research indicates that for some women something as accessible as singing with their baby could help to speed up recovery at one of the most vulnerable times of their lives,"" she said. Lead author Dr Daisy Fancourt, from University College London, said singing was another useful therapy to offer women. ""Many mothers have concerns about taking depression medication whilst breast-feeding and uptake of psychological therapies with new mothers is relatively low,"" she said. ""So these results are really exciting as they suggest that something as simple as referring mothers to community activities could support their recovery."" Dr Trudi Seneviratne, who chairs the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Perinatal Faculty, said: ""It's exciting to hear about the growing evidence base for novel psychosocial interventions such as singing to facilitate a more rapid recovery for women with post-natal depression. ""I look forward to more work in this area in the future, as it will be enjoyed by both mothers and their babies."" Since the study, Breathe Arts Health Research has started running singing workshops in partnership with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust for women with post-natal depression across the south London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark.

Trump gives Salvadoreans deadline to leave,"This video can not be played Nearly 200,000 Salvadoreans in the US who were granted Temporary Protected Status now face uncertainty Donald Trump's administration has decided to cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US. They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001. Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. The Trump administration has already removed TPS protection from tens of thousands of Haitians and Nicaraguans. Protections for Salvadoreans were set to expire on Monday, after nearly two decades of holding the humanitarian status due to the impact of the natural disaster that killed more than 1,000 people. The latest announcement comes four months after the government said it planned to scrap an Obama-era scheme, Daca (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), that protected young undocumented immigrants, mostly Latin Americans, from deportation. Lawmakers in Congress have been given until March to decide on the fate of the 800,000 so-called Dreamers affected by the Daca decision. El Salvador country profile US sets final date for Nicaraguan immigrants' protected status Their protection will not be terminated until 9 September 2019,external""to allow for an orderly transition"", the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement announcing the decision on Monday. This video can not be played What is temporary protected status - and why is El Salvador losing it? ""The original conditions caused by the 2001 earthquakes no longer exist,"" the agency said. ""Thus, under the applicable statute, the current TPS designation must be terminated."" The move will end the protected status of nearly 200,000 Salvadoreans living across America, forcing them to face possible deportation. More than 190,000 children born in the US to Salvadoreans with TPS will also be affected. While the children themselves are US citizens thanks to the practice of granting citizenship to babies born on US soil, their parents will not automatically be allowed to stay and families could be broken up. Salvadoreans with TPS are established in large numbers in California, Texas and around the US capital, Washington DC. According to the Center for Migration Studies, they represent more than 135,000 households across the country, with a quarter of them home-owners: 88% part of the labour force 10% self-employed 10% married to US citizens The programme was created in 1990 and authorises immigrants from several countries to live and work in the US lawfully, regardless of whether they entered the country legally or not. It is only granted to countries affected by armed conflict, environmental disaster, or epidemics. Ten countries, making up over 300,000 US immigrants, have been granted TPS protections since it was first signed into law by President George Bush. Special protection status for 59,000 Haitians and 5,300 Nicaraguans was terminated late last year, and also takes effect in 2019. Salvadoreans are the largest group by far to receive TPS, after two earthquakes devastated communities the country in March 2001. Over the next 15 years, the programme was re-authorised by US presidents several times. Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, hailed Monday's decision as a ""long overdue move"". ""The idea that there should be a 'temporary status' that lasts for 19 years is ridiculous,"" he told BBC News. He believed the TPS law should be scrapped and replaced with a process in which Congress would have to vote to re-authorise temporary immigration protections. Demonstrations were held in Washington against Mr Trump's decision Meanwhile, Salvadoreans with the TPS status criticised the decision. ""My life is here,"" Minda HernÃ¡ndez, a 48-year-old housekeeper from Long Island who left El Salvador 20 years ago, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. ""This is where my home is, where I pay my taxes. I am happy here - even if I work myself to death."" The Salvadorean government has been lobbying the US to extend protections for people from their country living in the US. El Salvador's Foreign Minister Hugo MartÃ­nez said his government would work with the Trump administration to find a permanent solution for Salvadoreans working in the US. Money earned and sent back to families in El Salvador also makes a valuable contribution to the country's economy, the Center for American Progress says. The think tank estimates that in 2015, remittances made up more than 15% of El Salvador's GDP. Democrats in Congress have condemned the decision, with many criticising the move for ignoring the violence in El Salvador, which has one of the world's highest murder rates. ""Thousands of families will worry about being torn apart because of this callous and irrational decision,"" Washington DC Mayor Murial Bowser said. Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto said it was ""a poignant reminder that we have an anti-immigrant president who turns his back on hardworking families and insists on governing by fear and intimidation"".

MSPs slam 'incompatible' Withdrawal Bill,"Mr Mundell had previously told MSPs the amendments would be introduced in the Commons Promised changes to the UK government's EU Withdrawal Bill that would reflect concerns over its impact on devolution will be delayed, it has been confirmed. Scottish Secretary David Mundelltold MPs last month,externalthat the amendments would happen during next week's report stage in the House of Commons. However, he has now said the changes will not happen until the bill reaches the House of Lords. He also said the government remained committed to improving the bill. Government sources said that the resignation of Damian Green - who had been leading talks with the devolved administrations - from his Cabinet Office post, coupled with the festive break, had caused the timetable to slip. Watch the Brexit debate on Holyrood Live from 14:20 Leonard predicts new election over Brexit The Scottish government has previously said it would not put the legislation to a consent vote in the Scottish Parliament unless changes are made. Mr Mundell said:  ""I can confirm today that amendments to clause 11 of the bill will be brought forward in the House of Lords, allowing for further discussions to take place between the UK government and Scottish government. ""A substantial number of powers will transfer direct to the Scottish Parliament. The two governments agree that in some areas common frameworks will be required. ""I regret that it has not been possible to bring forward amendments at the report stage but our commitment to improve the bill remains absolute. The most important thing is that the changes we bring forward command support on all sides, and talks between Scotland's two governments will continue."" A series of summits between ministers from around the UK have failed to resolve the impasse over post-Brexit powers He added: ""I remain confident we can reach a place where the Scottish Parliament will give legislative consent to this vitally important piece of legislation. ""The two governments have made good progress on how powers should be brought back from Brussels, including through the JMC(EN) meetings, and expect to make further progress in the coming weeks and months."" The Scottish government's Brexit minister, Mike Russell, told Holyrood that the UK government's failure to introduce the amendments in the House of Commons was ""very regrettable"" and ""unacceptable"", but said that talks over the bill would continue. He added: ""We have spent six months discussing bringing forward this amendment, and no amendment has been brought forward."" Lots of frustration at the announcement tonight there won't be changes to the Withdrawal Bill next week. Scottish Secretary David Mundell had promise amendments to reflect concerns over the impact the bill will have on devolution at report stage. But today he confirmed that's not happening now; there's been no agreement with Edinburgh and ministers in London don't want to bring the changes until that happens. My sources say the departure of Damian Green - who had chaired high-level meetings with the Scottish government on this - didn't help. Nor did the fact the next parliamentary stage of the bill is happening a bit earlier than most expected. It doesn't mean changes won't happen. The government says it's still committed to amendments, but they'll happen in the Lords instead. But the Scottish Tories aren't happy. This morning, Tory MPs were still expecting the changes next week. I've heard the words ""frustrated"" and ""disappointed"" from a few. They're meeting tonight as a group to discuss the next steps. The SNP are furious because it means MPs won't get to scrutinise the changes. Labour are too; they say it shows contempt for democracy. The Scottish Tories will, I believe, ultimately be happy as long as the changes do happen in the Lords. But tonight there are a lot of angry faces across the parties. Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said he too was ""deeply frustrated and disappointed"" that the amendments had not been made yet, and that he had been led to believe the bill would have been changed by now. He also said it was ""imperative"" the legislation was passed at Westminster with the Scottish Parliament's consent. The UK and Scottish governmentsare locked in a disputeover what will happen to powers which are currently not reserved to Westminster, but which are exercised from Brussels. UK ministers want them all returned to Westminster in the first instance, before some are devolved and some woven into UK-wide frameworks - butScottish and Welsh ministers term this a ""power grab"". In a report published on Tuesday, Holyrood's constitution committee - which includes Conservative MSPs - backed the Scottish government's stance, and said the bill was currently ""incompatible with devolution"". The argument over the EU Withdrawal Bill focuses on Clause 11, which deals directly with the devolved administrations and the powers coming back from Brussels post-Brexit. The clause has been attacked by groups including the Scottish government, SNP MPs at Westminster and even Scottish Conservative MPs, one of whom described it as ""not fit for purpose"". MSPs on the constitution committee unanimously added their weight to this, saying that ""Clause 11, as currently drafted, is incompatible with the devolution settlement in Scotland"". They said the committee ""will not be in a position to recommend legislative consent for the bill unless Clause 11 is replaced or removed"", adding that resolving this should be ""a matter of priority"" for the UK government. Committee convener Bruce Crawford said that in its present form, the bill ""represents a fundamental shift in the structure of devolution in Scotland"". Opposition party leaders met at Westminster to talks about Brexit on Tuesday morning - with an empty chair for Jeremy Corbyn But Mr Tomkins, the deputy convener of the committee, welcomed the ""progress that has been made"" in ""developing an approach to agreeing common UK frameworks"" for returning powers. And he said members ""welcome the UK government's commitment to respect the devolution settlement"". Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell - who welcomed the committee's report - has said the government is looking at the possibility of introducing its own ""continuity"" legislation, should it fail to come to an agreement over the UK bill. The committee said this approach would result in ""a reduced timetable for parliamentary scrutiny"", urging the government to engage in ""early discussions"" with the parliament about this. The Scottish and Welsh governments jointly put forward potential amendments to the Withdrawal Bill during the early part of its progress through Westminster, but saw them rejected by MPs. However, Mr Mundell told MPs on 6 December that ""the bill will be amended"", later clarifying that this would ""happen on report"". Meanwhile, MSPs have been debating the Brexit process and the position of the remaining EU member states on their first day back after the festive recess. They discussed evidence gathered by the culture, tourism, Europe and external relations committee on the Brexit process, which began with the triggering of Article 50 in March 2016.

North and South Korea to begin talks,"This video can not be played North and South Korea had a warm meeting in the DMZ North Korea is to send a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games taking place in South Korea in February, officials from the South say. The breakthrough announcement came as the countries met for their first high-level talks in more than two years. The delegation will include athletes, officials and a group of cheerleaders. A military hotline between the nations, suspended for nearly two years, will be reinstated from Wednesday, the South's officials said. North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy Who are North Korea's cheerleaders? They have continued all day and the developments have been conveyed by officials from the South: Vice unification minister Chun Hae-sung told journalists: ""The North side proposed dispatching a high-level delegation, National Olympic Committee delegation, athletes, supporters, art performers, observers, a taekwondo demonstration team and journalists"" to the Games The South proposed that athletes from both Koreas march together at the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang as they did at the 2006 Winter Olympics The South pushed for the reunion of family members separated by the Korean War - a highly emotional issue for both countries - to take place during the Lunar New Year holiday, which falls in the middle the Games The South also proposed resuming negotiations over military issues and the North's nuclear programme The South said it would consider temporarily lifting relevant sanctions, in co-ordination with the UN, to facilitate the North's participation in the Olympics The North's response to all of the South's proposals is not yet known. The opening remarks of head of the North Korean delegation, Ri Son-gwon, were fairly neutral. He said he hoped the talks would bring a ""good gift"" for the new year and that the North had a ""serious and sincere stance"". They are being held in the Panmunjom ""peace village"" in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the border. North Korea first expressed interest in joining the Pyeonchang Games during the New Year There are five senior officials on each side. The leaders of both nations are said to be watching the talks via a CCTV feed. In his New Year address, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had said he was considering sending a team to the Olympics. South Korea's Olympics chief had said last year that the North's athletes would be welcome. Following Mr Kim's overture, the South then proposed high-level talks to discuss the North's participation, but the North only agreed to the talks after the US and South Korea agreed to delay their joint military exercises until after the Olympics. The North sees the annual drills as a rehearsal for war. Some critics in the US see the North's move as an attempt to divide the US-South Korea alliance. Analysis: BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Seoul A little over a week ago North Korea was threatening nuclear war - this morning a delegation from Pyongyang strode across the demarcation line that divides North and South Korea and agreed a North Korean delegation would attend the Pyeongchang Games. It is a sudden and dramatic change after months of tension. But few in the South believe any of this demonstrates a fundamental shift in Pyongyang's position. Experts say North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has become increasingly fearful that the US is planning a military strike against him, and has decided he must do something to de-escalate tensions. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has been thrust in the delicate position of trying to engage the North in genuine dialogue, while not upsetting his very sceptical American ally. North Korea crisis in 300 words Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism North Korea opens new ski resort Back in 2015. Relations then broke down after Seoul suspended a joint economic project at the Kaesong Industrial complex in North Korea following a rocket launch and nuclear test by the North. The incident led to North Korea ending all communication with Seoul, including cutting off the military hotline. This video can not be played Life in a South Korean border town Tensions have risen in the years since. What we know of the Koreas' red and green phones The North's development of its nuclear programme has continued unabated and has created a huge diplomatic conflict with the US administration of President Donald Trump. Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un have conducted a personal feud, with the US leader dubbing Mr Kim ""Rocket Man"" andboasting that his nuclear button is ""much bigger"". North Korea's regular missile tests have brought a tightening of UN and US sanctions. The latest test of a ballistic missile on 28 Novembersparkedanother raft of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans, among other things.

This video can not be played North Korea's star ice-skating duo have qualified for the Winter Olympics There has been no official announcement on the make-up of the North Korean team. Only two North Korean athletes had qualified for the Games - figure skaters Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik - although even they missed the participation deadline and would need IOC clearance. There may be possible wild-card entries, perhaps in short-track speed skating and Nordic skiing, but this has not been confirmed. North Korea has participated in the Olympics before, but not in South Korea. It boycotted the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.

Safari park gorilla dies aged 56,"Nico died in his sleep on 7 January One of the world's oldest silverback gorillas has died at Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire. Nico, 56, died in his sleep on 7 January and staff at the park say they are ""truly saddened"". A spokesman said: ""It is with deep regret and huge sadness that we have to announce the death of Nico, our much-loved western lowland gorilla."" Longleat's senior warden, Ian Turner, collected Nico, a western lowland gorilla, from Switzerland in 1989. ""My first memory was having a cup of tea with him,"" he said, explaining that it is important to build up a relationship with gorillas to gain their trust. Watched TV When Nico arrived in England he had to be quarantined in his enclosure for six months. During that time he displayed signs of boredom, so his keepers gave him a television to keep him entertained. When they tried to take the television away, Mr Turner said ""all hell broke loose,"" so it was swiftly returned. Nico kept the television for the rest of his life and particularly enjoyed watching nature documentaries, Mr Turner said.. TV company Sky even tried to make Nico a bespoke remote control, but it turned out not to be ""gorilla-proof"". Nico had a reputation for looking grumpy but his expression signified contentment, his keepers said 'Astonishing' age Nico's partner, Samba, died 10 years ago and Mr Turner said the silverback was ""sad when she went"". However, the pair had a ""brother and sister relationship"" and never bred. After Samba's death, Nico lived alone at the park, which is natural behaviour for adult male gorillas in the wild. Longleat said that attempting to mix him again would have been like putting a ""granddad with boisterous teenagers"". Silverback gorillas in the wild are used to being on their own Gorillas usually live between 30 and 40 years in the wild and Longleat said it was ""quite astonishing"" for Nico, who weighed about 170kgs and was 5'10 tall, to reach the age of 56. But he was ""slowing down"" and his keepers noticed something was wrong when he gradually stopped eating as much as usual. ""It had been a rough winter for him,"" said Mr Turner. He said losing Nico was like ""losing a member of the family"". On his 56th birthday last July, Nico's keepers gave him a cake made from bananas and courgettes with carrot candles.

What took so long in No 10?,"Jeremy Hunt is staying as health secretary The reshuffle isn't over, but we already know that it was not just the prime minister who had her say today, but her ministers too. Jeremy Hunt, who has stayed as health secretary, and Greg Clark, who has stayed as business secretary, were both in No 10 for more than an hour this afternoon. I understand that rather than meekly accepting whatever was being dangled before him (at least one of the likely jobs was a move to become business secretary, possibly a job swap with Greg Clark) the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, in fact argued his case for staying at the Department for Health and expanding his role to take on planning for the future of social care in England. The risk and reward of reshuffles Lewis made Tory chairman in reshuffle It is said the situation was ""fluid"", and the PM was ""persuaded"" by his arguments, agreeing to keep him in position at the end of their conversation. Senior government sources dispute that Greg Clark also refused to move - Hunt getting his way and staying at health had clear knock on effects which meant Clark's conversation was merely about staying in his role. There's still a mystery over the potential appointment of Chris Grayling as chairman at Tory HQ. Number 10 disputes it was ever the plan, but two other sources say they had been told it was the case, and that in the end No 10 had to ""fiddle with the whiteboard"", appointing well liked Brandon Lewis in his place. But Theresa May's detractors will claim this as evidence that she didn't have the authority to move her own ministers. One senior MP said ""this reshuffle is embarrassingâ¦ far from asserting her authority, or some new found strength it's just highlighted how weak the PM is"". No 10 is promising more moves before the end of the evening and more diverse new appointments through the day tomorrow. But while this isn't the most dramatic of reshuffles, it seems to have followed the tradition of not going quite according to plan.

Was pm foiled in reshuffle aims?,"Theresa May had mulled over her reshuffle for months. On Monday she felt daring enough to do it, after ending the tumult of 2017 with the government in better shape than for quite some time, despite the embarrassing departures of some of her colleagues. The task was not to make radical changes, the most senior jobs were never in question, but the plan was to get the right reformers into the right jobs in her view, and to plan for the future. The question of the long term will still be dealt with tomorrow, when junior ministers are expected to be appointed, with far greater numbers of women and ethnic minority MPs, part of the Tories' effort to look more like the country they govern. Greening quits cabinet in PM's reshuffle Damian Hinds is new education secretary New faces and potential new stars have already been despatched to Tory HQ to try to make a difference there. But in terms of the hopes Theresa May had of moving her cabinet colleagues around? Of three experienced ministers she wanted to move? One persuaded her he shouldn't have to budge, one was never even asked to shift, and the third, Justine Greening, quit in protest. In allowing Greening to walk, the PM has lost a Northern voice, who represents a London marginal constituency, who is in a same sex relationship. Even without her six years experience in the Cabinet, any one of those factors are precious commodities in the Tory Party. And while Justine Greening is a determined pragmatist - her detractors might say determination that can make her difficult - she was a strong Remain voice who could be tempted to join that powerful chorus of former ministers on the backbenches who relentlessly push the PM for answers on her Brexit plans. Even prime ministers at the peak of their powers can fall foul of reshuffles when their colleagues refuse to collaborate. One foiled move can upset the whole play. But while Monday wasn't quite Christmas panto, it was not the glorious return to the business of government planned to usher in 2018. Theresa May had enough authority to try to make her moves, but found she had not enough to deliver them all.

Hinds takes over at education,"Damian Hinds arriving in Downing Street to meet the prime minister Damian Hinds has been announced as England's education secretary in the prime minister's cabinet reshuffle. He will replace Justine Greening, who is leaving the government. Ms Greening, the first comprehensive-educated Tory education secretary, refused a switch to the Department for Work and Pensions, the BBC understands. Mr Hinds, a former DWP minister, went to a Catholic grammar school in Altrincham and then studied at the University of Oxford. The MP for East Hampshire is a former chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility. Mr Hinds wrote on Twitter that he was ""looking forward to working with the great teachers and lecturers in our schools, colleges and universities giving people the opportunities to make the most of their lives"". Justine Greening had turned down a move to the Department for Work and Pensions The incoming education secretary will face pressures over school funding and decisions about university tuition fees. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said he was disappointed to see Ms Greening's departure. ""She has tried hard to tackle the school funding crisis, without any help from the chancellor or prime minister,"" said Mr Barton. Jules White, aWest Sussex head teacher who co-ordinated letters sent to 2.5 million parents over school funding concerns, says too often schools policy has been sidetracked by ""dubious ideological pursuits"" or ""tinkering around the edges"". Mr White said Mr Hinds would have to ""urgently address"" core problems over school funding and teacher shortages. The National Association of Head Teachers called for more stability and investment. ""Where budgets are at breaking point and recruitment is still a massive challenge, education does not need more upheaval,"" said NAHT leader Paul Whiteman. School funding proved to be an important doorstep issue in the election - and Ms Greening announced that anextra Â£1.3bn of the education department's budget would be moved to schools. The new education secretary also faces big decisions over higher education, including the future of tuition fees and university funding. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised there will be amajor review of how students pay for university- after pledges from Labour to young voters that they would scrap tuition fees. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said Mr Hinds had ""assiduously"" raised social mobility since becoming an MP in 2010. Ms Greening had madesocial mobilitythe focus of her 18 months in office and had built bridges with the teaching profession. But there had been questions about whether her approach aligned with the priorities of 10, Downing Street and whether her schools policy was connecting with the public. The Conservatives' flagship policy of bringing back grammar schools was abandoned in the wake of the election. There was said to be backbench disquiet that the push for more selection had been sidelined - and there will be scrutiny of whether Mr Hinds, a former grammar school boy, will be more sympathetic. Mr Hinds will also have to tackle the delayed decision on whether to change the rules to make it easier for faith groups to open free schools, pledged in the Conservatives' election manifesto. With the focus on Brexit, there was no education legislation in the last Queen's Speech. And the incoming education secretary will be expected to re-energise the Conservatives' plans for schools. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Ms Greening had been ""pushed out"", adding: ""The only rational explanation would be that this is an acknowledgement that the Conservatives have a failed schools policy.""
