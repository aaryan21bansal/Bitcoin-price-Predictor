Venezuela challenger accused of coup bid,"This video can not be played Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ is appealing to the military for support Venezuelan authorities say they are putting down a small coup attempt after opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ announced he was in the ""final phase"" of ending President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's rule. He appeared in a video with uniformed men, saying he had military support. Mr GuaidÃ³, who declared himself interim president in January, called for more members of the military to help him end Mr Maduro's ""usurpation"" of power. But military leaders appeared to be standing behind Mr Maduro. Venezuela's defence minister appeared on television to stress the point. However, photos from Caracas show some soldiers aligning themselves with Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro Venezuela crisis: The bridge of desperation Mr Maduro's detractors hope the military will change its allegiance as resentment grows following years of hyperinflation, power cuts, food and medicine shortages. So far, the armed forces have stood by Mr Maduro - despite dozens of countries, including the UK, the US and most of Latin America, recognising Mr GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's rightful leader. As a result, John Bolton, the US national security adviser, said what was taking place in Venezuela was not a coup, but a legitimate leader trying to take control. Protesters supporting both sides have gathered at different points in the capital, Caracas. There are running clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles. Protesters were also seen throwing rocks, but being repelled by tear gas and water cannon. Television cameras also caught the moment armoured vehicles drove into a crowd but it is unclear if there were any injuries. El Universal newspaper said that at least 37 people had been injured across Caracas. The BBC's Guillermo Olmo, in Caracas, said Tuesday marked the most violent episode of the Venezuelan political crisis so far. Juan GuaidÃ³'s supporters from the Bolivarian National Guard repel forces loyal to NicolÃ¡s Maduro Meanwhile, Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said the uprising by some members of the military had been ""partly defeated"", but warned of possible bloodshed. ""The weapons of the republic are here to defend the nation's sovereignty and independence,"" he warned. He also revealed one soldier had suffered a bullet wound. A three-minute video by Mr GuaidÃ³ was published in the early hours of Tuesday. In it, he announced he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. ""The National Armed Forces have taken the correct decision... they are guaranteed to be on the right side of history,"" he said. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. He was filmed alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who has been under house arrest since being found guilty of inciting violence during anti-government protests in 2014. Mr LÃ³pez, who leads the Popular Will party of which Mr GuaidÃ³ is a member, said he had been freed by members of the military. He went on to urge Venezuelans to join them on the streets. But later in the day, Chile's Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed he, his wife Lilian Tintori and their daughter had entered Chile's embassy in Caracas to seek protection. A timeline of Venezuela's leadership clash The bus driver who became president Mr GuaidÃ³, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has been calling on the military to back him ever since he declared himself interim president. He argues that President Maduro is a ""usurper"" because he was re-elected in polls that had been widely disputed. The video appeared to have been recorded at dawn in or near La Carlota air force base in Caracas. This video can not be played Venezuela blackout crisis: ""It's like living in the apocalypse"" Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus Events in Venezuela are uncertain and unclear but Mr GuaidÃ³ has seemingly gambled heavily in his latest bid for power. The loyalty of the military to President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's regime has been the central factor that has kept him in power. Barring a fundamental change in their allegiance or at the very least a significant split in their ranks, no amount of outside diplomatic pressure is going to push Mr Maduro from office. So are we seeing this split now? Mr GuaidÃ³ and his supporters claim parts of the military across the country have backed him, but so far there is little evidence of this. For Mr GuaidÃ³ the stakes are huge. The Venezuelan government says it is putting down a coup attempt. This is perhaps the most dramatic moment yet in Venezuela's current political saga. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? Venezuela blackout: 'Like living in the apocalypse' Venezuela crisis in nine charts The Venezuelan Information Minister, Jorge RodrÃ­guez, wrote on Twitter that the government was confronting a small group of ""military traitors"" who, according to him, were promoting a coup. Mr Maduro, meanwhile, said he had spoken to the leaders of the armed forces who had ""expressed their total loyalty to the People, the Constitution and the Fatherland"". A senior member of the governing socialist party, Diosdado Cabello,called on supporters of President Maduro to take to the streets around the presidential palace to defend him from ""the right-wing conspiracy"",external. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told Reuters news agency the ""coup attempt"" had been ""directly planned in Washington, in the Pentagon and Department of State, and by [National Security Advisor John] Bolton"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for both sides to avoid violence US Secretary of StateMike Pompeo sent a tweet backing Mr GuaidÃ³,external. ""The U.S. Government fully supports the Venezuelan people in their quest for freedom and democracy,"" he wrote Mr Bolton warned Mr Maduro not to use force against civilians Spain warned against bloodshed and said was ""not supporting any military coup"". Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro - who backs Mr GuaidÃ³ - has called an emergency meeting with his defence minister, foreign minister and vice-president. Colombian President IvÃ¡n Duque called on the Venezuelan army to back Mr GuaidÃ³ Bolivia's President Evo Morales and Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno RodrÃ­guez have sent messages of support to their ally Mr Maduro, condemning what they called the ""coup d'etat"" in Venezuela.

US: Maduro aides agreed he had to go,"This video can not be played Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ is appealing to the military for support Juan GuaidÃ³ has appealed for his supporters to take to the streets of Venezuela again on Wednesday, after a day of violent clashes on Tuesday. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, whom the opposition leader is trying to unseat, remains defiant despite the protests. In a television address he described Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters as a ""small group"" whose plan had failed. Meanwhile, the US administration alleges Mr Maduro had been ready to travel to Cuba to escape the unrest. ""They had an airplane on the tarmac. He was ready to leave this morning [Tuesday], as we understand it. Russians indicated he should stay,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN, without offering evidence. Senior US officials also claimed three prominent figures in Mr Maduro's government had agreed the president had to go, but later backtracked. US National Security Advisor John Bolton said those figures allegedly included Defence Secretary Vladimir Padrino - who has since reaffirmed his support and appeared alongside Mr Maduro in his televised address. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro Venezuela crisis: The bridge of desperation Sitting alongside military commanders, Mr Maduro vowed he would be victorious in the face of what he called a coup attempt backed by US imperialism. He also said events of Tuesday would ""not go unpunished"". ""[Prosecutors] will launch criminal prosecutions for the serious crimes that have been committed against the constitution, the rule of law and the right to peace,"" he said in his speech. This video can not be played Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro defiant in speech Meanwhile, Mr GuaidÃ³ has renewed his calls for Venezuelans to take to the streets to complete what he has said is the ""final phase"" of his effort to oust Mr Maduro. A three-minute video by Mr GuaidÃ³ was published in the early hours of Tuesday. It showed him standing alongside a number of men in military uniform, as he announced he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. ""The National Armed Forces have taken the correct decision... they are guaranteed to be on the right side of history,"" he said. He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and also appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who had been under house arrest since 2014. Supporters on both sides then gathered in different places in the capital, Caracas, throughout Tuesday. Despite Mr GuaidÃ³'s calls, it appeared most of the military stayed on the side of Mr Maduro during the clashes. This video can not be played ""This is unstoppable,"" says Carlos Vecchio, Juan Guaido's envoy to the US There were running clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles throughout the day. Protesters were also seen throwing rocks, but being repelled by tear gas and water cannon. At one stage a military vehicle was captured on video appearing to drive into protesters. Mr GuaidÃ³, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has been calling on Venezuela's military to back him ever since he declared himself interim president in January. He argues that President Maduro is a ""usurper"" because he was re-elected in polls that had been widely disputed. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? Venezuela blackout: 'Like living in the apocalypse' Venezuela crisis in nine charts Tuesday marked the most violent episode of the Venezuelan political crisis this year. Venezuelan heath officials said 69 people were injured in the clashes, including two with bullet wounds. Broadcasts from a number of news agencies, including the BBC and CNN, were apparently suspended amid the violence. Later on Tuesday, it emerged Mr LÃ³pez had sought safety in the Chilean, then the Spanish embassy, along with his family. Chilean Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero said it was Mr LÃ³pez's ""personal decision"", because he and his wife Lilian Tintori are of Spanish descent. Tuesday's events were definitely dramatic. But it's not clear where they leave Venezuela. Juan GuaidÃ³ made a bold move by saying the armed forces were on his side early in the morning. And the fact that opposition politician Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who was under house arrest, stood beside him was also a big surprise. Who had freed him and what did that say about the loyalties of the armed forces? But as the day went on, doubts began to surface - who exactly was backing the so-called uprising? We still don't have the answers. Mr GuaidÃ³'s video on Tuesday night, calling for people to come out onto the streets again on Wednesday, was a motivational pep talk that felt hollow. He claims Mr Maduro has neither the support nor the respect of the armed forces, yet clearly the generals at the top - whose support Mr GuaidÃ³ needs - aren't on the opposition's side either. This is seen by many as another failed attempt by the opposition to take power. Yet, although Mr Maduro still occupies the presidential palace, his future isn't secure either -  he summed up the day as ""intense"" in a lengthy address on state television but there's no question both sides will be feeling the heat after Tuesday. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has now issued an emergency prohibition against all US carriers flying below 26,000ft in Venezuelan airspace. It also said all US operators should leave the country within 48 hours, due to increasing political instability. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has appealed for both sides to avoid violence. The United States, who has backed Mr GuaidÃ³ since he declared himself interim leader, reiterated their support on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said he was monitoring events in Venezuela ""very closely"" and said the US stood with the Venezuelan people and their freedom. He also threatened to implement the ""highest-level sanctions"" and a ""full and complete embargo"" against the island of Cuba, unless their military immediately ceased its support of Mr Maduro. ""Hopefully, all Cuban soldiers will promptly and peacefully return to their island!"" he tweeted. John Bolton has called on Venezuelan officials to ""do what is right"" for he country Other governments who still support Mr Maduro, including Bolivia and Cuba, condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s efforts as an attempted ""coup d'etat"". The Mexican government expressed ""concern about a possible increase in violence"" in Venezuela, while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand ""on the right side of history"" against Maduro.

Threat of more ATM thefts 'very real'Police say they are not complacent about the risk posed by gangs behind the overnight robberies.Northern Ireland,"The PSNI has warned there is a ""very real"" threat of more cash machine thefts across Northern Ireland. Det Supt Rachel Shields said police were not complacent about the risk posed by several gangs behind a spate of overnight robberies. Two people were arrested on Tuesday after police foiled a bid to steal a cash machine at Nutt's Corner in County Antrim at about 03:30 BST. It was the 14th incident of its kind in Northern Ireland since 1 January 2019. Police have confirmed ""considerable policing resources"" were directed to the scene after they received a report that a digger was being used to rip the cash machine from a service station at Tully Road. The machine was recovered. The cash machine was recovered after police said they directed ""considerable resources"" to the scene Det Supt Shields said: ""We recognise there are a number of gangs carrying out these attacks on ATMs and the threat of more thefts is very real. ""Tonight again we will have local police patrolling areas which could be vulnerable to an attack and detectives remain dedicated to investigating the thefts that have taken place. This remains a key priority for police"". Det Supt Shields also asked the owners of heavy plant machinery to secure their vehicles. PSNI Det Supt Rachel Shields said police were not complacent about the risk posed by several gangs behind a spate of overnight robberies. She added: ""If criminals cannot steal diggers, they cannot tear out ATMs."" The owner of the Tully Road premises, Gordon Stewart, said he is determined to open up again as soon as possible. ""An hour after these guys have cleared up, I hope to have the place open again,"" he said. ""Just check all round; electrician wise, builder wise, just get her tidied up and we'll see what we can do."" A forensic officer examines a field across the road from the service station when the attempted theft took place What is going on with cash machine thefts? The chief executive of Retail NI, Glyn Roberts welcomed news of the arrests. Glyn Roberts said he was very concerned at reports of escalating insurance premiums He said that independent retailers who had been targeted in cash machine robberies were dealing with ""a huge personal impact"" for themselves and their staff. Mr Roberts said Retail NI recently met the Department of Finance to discuss how they might access the rates hardship fund. ""This is the very least that needs to happen to assist these small businesses getting back on their feet again,"" he said. Mr Roberts said he was also ""extremely concerned"" at reports from members with ATMs, who had not been attacked, but were nevertheless seeing insurance premiums increase dramatically.

NI pupils 'should get free fruit'A report also recommends a free meal every day for all children in the first three years of school.Northern IrelandComments,"About 85,000 children in Northern Ireland were living in relative poverty in 2017/18 Young schoolchildren in Northern Ireland should receive a free portion of fruit or vegetables every day, a new report has said. It also recommends they receive a free meal every day in the first three years of school regardless of income. Those are two of the key recommendations of the children's future food inquiry into food poverty across the UK. The inquiry report criticises Northern Ireland's ""dismal"" breastfeeding rates. Northern Ireland has the lowest breastfeeding rates in the UK. The inquiry spent a year investigating issues around children's food, especially for those aged up to 18 years old from low income homes. Its committee includes MPs, academics and 15 young people from across the UK - including two from Portadown in County Armagh. Households where the net income is less than Â£14,000 per year are entitled to free school meals The chief executive of the umbrella organisation Children in Northern Ireland, Pauline Leeson, was also on the committee. Separate figures published by the Department for Communities estimate that about 85,000 children in Northern Ireland were living in relative poverty in 2017/18. Those are children living in households with an income below 60% of the UK median income. In Northern Ireland, the median household income before housing costs in 2017/18 was Â£480 per week - a 3% increase on the previous year. Children in Northern Ireland are entitled to free school meals if they come from households where the net income is less than Â£14,000 per year or where their parents or guardians are on some benefits. Recent figures published by the Department of Education show that 99,142 pupils were entitled to free school meals in 2018/19 - 29.3% of all school children. The report said a healthy diet was ""unaffordable and unsustainable"" for many young people living in poverty The Children's Future Food Inquiry report said that the provision of free school meals to children from low-income homes was better in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK. Its authors said, for instance, that less than half of children in England living in food poverty received a free school lunch. However, they said that all children in Northern Ireland should receive a free daily meal up until the end of primary two regardless of their family's income. School dinners also offer a ""very social experience"" says one NI headteacher That echoes arrangementscurrently in place in England and Scotland. The report also calls for a scheme in Englandwhereby all children from the ages of four to six are given a free piece of fruit or vegetableeach school day to be extended to Northern Ireland, as well as to Wales and all of Scotland. Sean McNamee, the principal of St Paul's Primary and Nursery School in west Belfast, said it was a ""great idea"". ""The meal itself is obviously a very important thing for children to have access to healthy food, but it is also a very social experience,"" he said. Sean McNamee said a free school meal for all would remove any stigma ""In a lot of families children don't have a 'sit around the table' kind of dinner, so it's good to be able to provide that in schools. ""We're keen to make sure all children have access to whatever they need, breaktime or lunchtime food. ""We don't want any stigma - equality of opportunity for all children, the same social experience, the same food. It's a no brainer."" The wide-ranging inquiry also recommends action in a number of other areas, including councils taking measures to ensure fewer takeaway food outlets are opened close to schools. It calls for a more comprehensive action plan to support women who want to breastfeed across the UK, calling breastfeeding rates ""dismal"". ""By the time babies are six to eight weeks old in England only 44% of them are still being breastfed,"" the report said. ""Rates are lowest in Northern Ireland where only 27% of babies are receiving any breast milk at six weeks and only 13% at six months."" The report calls breastfeeding rates in Northern Ireland ""dismal"" The report also calls for an independent watchdog for children's food to be established in Northern Ireland and separately in each of the other nations in the UK. It said that governments should take measures to ""rebalance"" the cost of food to make sure healthy food was more affordable in comparison to unhealthy food. The report said a healthy diet was ""unaffordable and unsustainable"" for many young people living in poverty. ""We face a grave situation with children's food, which is in urgent need of systematic leadership from all four governments across the United Kingdom,"" the report concluded. The report does not, however, provide specific costings for many of the measures it recommends.

LiveLiveCan Spurs respond against Ajax in Champions League semi?Tottenham host Ajax in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium - watch 5 Live Final Score and follow live text commentary.,"Emma Sanders FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Dion DublinEx-Aston Villa striker on BBC Radio 5 Live The control and calmness to finish the way Donny van de Beek did summed up the first half.  He turned inside the area and there was no pressure on him at all. Spurs were just running around like they were in a practice match. They never really got into their stride and they were being dominated by a young side. It was a bit of a let down. Spurs have got quality players, but as a team, there was a gulf in class. Ajax played together and took their training onto the pitch whereas Spurs played like individuals in the final third. FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport:""It was professional and mature from Ajax. In the first half they played fantastic football. ""In Spurs defence, if you take 44 goals out of the side in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, any team would suffer. ""I do think they are still in it. Their away form in this tournament shows they are capable of getting a result."" FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Former Spurs manager Glenn Hoddle on BT Sport:""Very, very disappointing. No creativity, no width. It was a very lacklustre performance. ""They didn't move the ball quick enough. Yes they are missing some key players - Harry Kane and Son Heung-min - but it was still disappointing."" Well it wasn't the night Tottenham had hoped for but the tie is not over. We'll be doing this all over again next week! In the meantime, there's just a small matter of Liverpool v Barcelona. I'll be back on the live text from around 17:00 BST tomorrow night to build up to that. You can find Phil McNulty's match report from tonight's gamehereand I'll leave you with some of the best reaction... FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Speaking on BT Sport, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said:""Son Heung-Min is back for the next game and he is a real positive for Spurs. They have to use that to their advantage."" There's been plenty of action in the English football leagues tonight. Bury have beenpromoted to League Oneafter drawing at sixth-placed Tranmere Rovers, whose own hopes of winning automatic promotion were ended. AndLuton Town and Barnsleyhave secured promotion back to the Championship after Portsmouth and Sunderland lost. Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino on BT Sport:""First half we started not in a good way. Ajax showed more energy, it was difficult for us to play. It was our lack of energy. ""After we conceded the goal - 25 to 30 minutes in - we started to be in the game. Moussa Sissoko provided good energy. ""Second half we pushed them and tried to create chances. It was an even game in the second half. We are alive. It's only 1-0 down. We need to believe we can go there and win the game. On playing with a five-man defence:""Watching now of course I can accept it was a mistake the shape we used. But there were not too many options. I am not happy - you cannot guess what happens if we play in a different way. But our lack of energy... and a little sloppy. ""It was the not the shape that conceded the goal. Our approach to the game was not good. I am the manager so i have responsibility."" On Vertonghen's head injury:""We will assess him in the next few days and we will see."" We've been asking you whether the Champions
League is the best tournament. We've selected some of the best responses below, and remember, YOU can get involved in the debatehere. Jose Fernando Cuesta, Columbia:The Champions League is the best show on earth. It has the best teams from the most competitive leagues, the best players and the best venues. Nick, Maidenhead:The World Cup is by far the best. Thereâs no ocean of money involved for the teams and you canât buy and sell your players. With club football, you have a model where the teams are interchangeable playthings of anonymous billionaires.  With international football, you canât trade,  you canât just buy a solution, you have to work at it. Itâs a purer form of sport. FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Dion DublinEx-Aston Villa striker on BBC Radio 5 Live Spurs play a certain way when Son-Heung Min is in the side and they steer those balls between the centre-backs and down the side. Nicolas Tagliafico and Joel Veltman will have a harder game in the second leg because of the work Son gets through. It is an extra threat.

minutes we played really good. After that, Tottenham changed something tactical
and we had problems. 1-0 is OK and next week we have to finish it. âThe beginning was good, but after that we played not what
we can. We have to make a good plan for next week. âWe have to stay calm. I donât know what they will do in the
next game. We can do better and we have to watch for next week.â Text 81111 (UK only). Spurs's lack of summer transfer business coming back to bite. No real depth in their squad once they lose one or two first team players. Graham, Liverpool Sure, Tottenham were missing key players tonight. But they just weren't at it for most of the match were they? They need to show up next week! Ajax have won a Champions League semi-final match for the first time since 17 April 1996 (3-0 at Panathinaikos). Today's goalscorer Donny van de Beek (18 April 1997) was not even born then. FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Dion DublinEx-Aston Villa striker on BBC Radio 5 Live Spurs have got quality players, but as a team, there was a gulf in class. Ajax played together and took their training onto the pitch whereas Spurs played like individuals in the final third. Text 81111 (UK only). Stats don't lie, that was a fairly even game despite (1) Ajax having a whole weeks rest, (2) Spurs being without several key players and (3) Vertonghen (in my opinion our most important defender) being battered half to death within 40 mins. Second half of the 180 will be a different tale. Joe, London Only one of the 17 previous teams to lose the
first leg at home in a European Cup/Champions League semi-final tie has
progressed into the final - Ajax in 1995-96. FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Tottenham Hotspur Spurs midfielder Christian Eriksen on BT Sport:âWe were under-par, we didnât play our best at all.
In the first 20 minutes, we were ball-watchers. We need to change it up a lot
for the next game. âWe made them look a lot better. They are a good side, but
we helped them along the way. It was our fault. We were better in the second
half. âAt the start, the system didnât matter. The change gave us
a different way to press, to play more direct. But we were still far from where
we know we can be. âNo one wanted to play the first half we did. Everyone knew
we didnât compete. We still lost, but we were better in the second half. âWe canât keep talking about injured players. In a
semi-final it doesnât matter who plays, we have to step up. Weâre lucky they
hit the post and hopefully we can turns things around in Amsterdam.â FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Dion DublinEx-Aston Villa striker on BBC Radio 5 Live I had so much concussion during my career. You have to stay still and do exactly what you are told. Going back on the pitch was incredibly risky for Jan Vertonghen because if there was any challenge near him, it could have been terrible. If the player is saying he is OK, it is difficult for a medical professional to say 'no you cannot go back on'. FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Ajax fans are having a PARTY. Don't blame them. They will be thinking ahead to Madrid... FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport:""It was professional and mature from Ajax. In the first half they played fantastic football. ""In Spurs defence, if you take 44 goals out of the side in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, any team would suffer. ""I do think they are still in it.

Aldi accused of copying baby changing bagBabaBing says the supermarket chain copied a bag the firm worked on for two years.Leeds & West Yorkshire,"The bag sold in Aldi in January, left, with the BabaBing bag launched in March 2018 Supermarket chain Aldi has stopped selling a baby changing bag after being accused of copying another company's design. BabaBing, a Keighley-based child and baby products firm, claims a bag sold by Aldi in January has similarities to one it started selling in 2018. The BabaBing bag retails at Â£49.99, with Aldi's selling for Â£17.99. The retailer said it always listens to feedback and would be happy to meet the firm to discuss its concerns. BabaBing contacted the supermarket in early January to say its 'Mani' product was ""identical or at least very similar"" to a bag on sale in Aldi during a week-long baby-themed promotion. The company said the Aldi bag and its internal items were the ""same size and shape"" as its bag, with similar design features across the two products. Read more Yorkshire stories In response Aldi told the company its research suggested that ""similar bags have been on the market for some time"". However, it said it would not be selling the product again in a future 'Specialbuys' promotion as planned, ""without any admission of liability"". The BabaBing (left) and the Aldi bag (right) come with changing mats and bottle holders Nick Robinson, managing technical director at BabaBing, said: ""It's no coincidence, the number of features that are identical to ours - it's not them designing a bag. ""In my view they've taken our bag and blatantly copied it."" When asked about the price difference, the company said: ""They're not overpriced, they're very competitively priced and the quality is far better than Aldi."" An Aldi spokesperson said: ""We aim to provide our customers with products of a similar high quality to the leading brands, but at a fraction of the price. ""We sell a wide range of baby products that are hugely popular with parents and we will consider Mr Robinson's views when planning future ranges.""

Monkey in nappy 'bit person twice',"The RSPCA is seeking the owner, pictured with the squirrel monkey, but said he would not require a licence for the primate A monkey wearing a nappy bit a person twice at a fair in Cardiff, the RSPCA has said. The charity is seeking the squirrel monkey's owner to find out why it was among a crowd of people in Leckwith Road. RSPCA inspector Sophie Daniels said the owner would not require a licence to keep the monkey, which was also in a collar and lead. The person who was bitten went to hospital for tests. Ms Daniels said the charity wanted to find out whether people were being encouraged to handle the monkey at the fair, which was held on 13 April.

Drone owners could be charged annual fee,"Every drone and model aircraft owner in the UK could be charged Â£16.50 a year under plans by the aviation regulator. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is consulting on introducing a licence fee to cover the costs of operating the new drone registration scheme. From November, drone owners would have to register their details on a database and drone flyers would complete a free online safety test. But a drone membership organisation claimed the charge was ""far too high"". The plans would affect anyone who owns a drone that weighs more than 250 grams (8oz). Only those aged 18 would be able to register as the official drone owner. There would be no fee for ""remote pilots"" - those who fly the drones but are not registered owners. TheCAA has launched a consultation on the proposals,external, with a final decision expected by the regulator in July. The number of drone users in the UK is unknown, but the CAA estimates 170,000 people will register. New EU rules will mean each member state will have to hold a national register of drone users from next year. A similar registration scheme in France is free, in the US costs $5 (Â£3.84) and in Ireland costs â¬5 (Â£4.31). But the CAA says these schemes are part, or wholly, subsidised by the taxpayer. The government has provided funding for the development costs of the new drone registration scheme, but the CAA said it would have to recover the expense of running, maintaining and updating it. The regulator said it was keeping the charge ""as low as possible"" and that it may increase or decrease in future years, depending on the number who register. But the FPV UK Association, which represents 4,000 flyers, said it ""strongly opposes"" the charge, which it said was ""far too high"". ""Criminals aren't going to register, so the safe and compliant people are the ones listed on the database,"" the group's chief executive, Simon Dale, said. He added that the group would be calling on members to write to their MPs, the aviation minister and the CAA to oppose the plans. Six positive ways drones can be used UK to bring in drone registration Drone no-fly zone near airports extended Carys Kaiser, a photographer from the Peak District who runs the Drone Lass blog, said the fee risked discouraging people from taking up the hobby. ""From a female perspective and an education point of view, drones are a brilliant tool for getting young women, girls and boys into STEM subjects,"" she said. She welcomed the idea of a registration scheme, but said the CAA should focus on providing better guidance for drone operators. She said: ""The drone industry as a whole has always said that we need a registration process and an education programme that says 'this is where you can fly'. ""{But} when you read the rules online it's difficult to interpret."" Carys Kaiser said the fee risked discouraging people from taking up the hobby Drone enthusiast Paul Jaggers, from Twickenham in west London, believes the cost of the licence is ""extremely overpriced"". The 33-year-old, who runs a club in which members race around an indoor course, said the cost could put people off flying drones. ""If anything this fee will deter people. I think they are trying to make it not so popular because of the commercial opportunities. ""That air space is so valuable for the commercial drones, whether that's delivery, agriculture, or security, and it will be important for policing and any of the emergency services. ""By charging unjustifiable pricing they're trying to suppress it because otherwise it'll be chaos."" But Gemma Alcock, whose company SkyBound Rescuer advises emergency services on how they can best use drones for search and rescue operations and other forms of emergency response, welcomed the CAA's proposals. ""I think operator registration is vital for accountability, to hopefully deter drone operators from misuse. ""I understand and appreciate that in order for the CAA to develop and maintain this registration service, a fee from operators is needed and Â£16.50 is - in my eyes - a reasonable amount. I think it's a positive step forward."" Under the CAA's plans, a single owner would be able to register multiple drones. Four of the largest drone associations, which represent 40,000 users between them, are understood to be exploring whether they are able to act as the registered operator for all of their members' drones and model aircraft. The FPV UK Association says the move could help prevent people from the quitting the hobby. ""This would seem to meet the government's requirements and it would give the advantage of increasing the number of insured flyers, too, as all of our members are covered under our public liability insurance,"" the group said. Fishing licence: Â£30 (trout and coarse) to Â£82 (salmon and sea trout) per annum Driving licence: 10-year renewal charge, Â£14 (first provisional licence, Â£34) Passport: Â£75.50 every 10 years Light aircraft pilot licence initial issue: Â£161 Shotgun licence: Five-year renewal charge Â£49 (grant payment, Â£80) Other firearms licence: Grant payment Â£88 and five-year renewal charge of Â£62 The Association of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (Arpas UK), which represents the drone industry, welcomed the online safety tests for flyers and said it would consult members before responding to the proposals. The proposals do not affect the CAA's existing charges for commercial operation permits. A public consultation on the proposals closes on 7 June.

Two arrested over double freezer murder,"The entrance to the block has been cordoned off while investigations take place A murder inquiry is under way after two women's bodies were found inside a freezer at a flat in east London. Officers found the human remains when they were called to Vandome Close in Canning Town. The women have not been formally identified and post-mortem examinations have not yet taken place. Two men, aged 50 and 34, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Both remain in custody at London police stations. They were arrested at two separate addresses in west and east London, both of which are being searched by police. The Metropolitan Police said it was trying to identify both victims and contact their next of kin as a ""priority"". The family of 37-year-old Mary-Jane Mustafa, who has been missing since May 2018, have gathered at the scene in Canning Town. Her sister Mel Mustafa, 47, said: ""She is the most kind-hearted person you could meet and I still don't believe it's her."" Cousin Ceylan Sunda, 53, added: ""The family's upside down. We don't even know for sure yet."" Officers were called to the address at 11:45 BST on Friday following concerns for the welfare of a male resident. Det Supt Paul Monk said a ""large crime scene"" was in place and expected to remain ""for some time"". By Greg McKenzie, BBC London I've managed to get inside an adjacent block next door to the flats that have been taped off by police. In the back garden there is a blue tent and police cordons are in place. It's a quiet residential area in east London - but one person has told me they are petrified to live here. The Met has now confirmed the bodies were found in a freezer. It comes after a witness said a fridge was carried out of the property on the Friday and into the back of a police van. So far in 2019, more than 40 murder investigations have been launched in London by the Metropolitan and British Transport police forces. Det Ch Supt Richard Tucker said: ""The launch of any murder investigation is naturally of concern to the local community.

"Inequality in UK 'entrenched from birth'Problem risks getting worse as opportunities are concentrated in London, says Dame Martina Milburn.UKComments","Inequality will remain entrenched ""from birth to work"" unless the government takes urgent action, the Social Mobility Commission has warned. ItsState of the Nation report,externalcovering England, Scotland and Wales, said the situation had remained ""virtually stagnant"" since 2014. It is calling on ministers to provide additional funding for older teenagers in education and to extend free childcare to more low income families. The government said it would take the recommendations seriously. The findings will come as a setback to Theresa May who promised to tackle the ""burning injustice"" of social inequality when she entered Downing Street in 2016. However, the following year, all of the commissioners on the Social Mobility Commission - set up in 2010 to monitor and promote social mobility - resigned,saying the government was too focused on Brexit to deal with creating a fairer Britain. This video can not be played Law graduate Paris McKenzie describes the difficulty she has faced finding work Law graduate Paris McKenzie, 25, wants to be a solicitor but said there are not enough training contracts in her home city of Nottingham. ""I have barely come across any, and I constantly search for them. There are lots in London,"" she said. But the single mother said she did not ""have the means"" to move to the capital, where she said she would not have support and would struggle to pick up her son from nursery herself. ""It's a catch 22, my opportunities are very limited,"" she added. Dame Martina Milburn, who has since been appointed as the new chairwoman, said she sensed there was now ""a real commitment"" from the government. However, she said the biggest concern was not stagnation, but that the problem might actually get worse. Dame Martina Milburn says those born privileged are likely to remain privileged ""There's still a big shift - if you want to be socially mobile - towards London,"" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""I think you're three times more likely to move to London if you're from a professional background than if you're from a working class background."" Young highly sceptical of social mobility The worst places to grow up poor Almost a third of graduates 'overeducated' Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he welcomed the ""thorough"" report - the first since the new commissioners were appointed - but stopped short of saying the government would adopt all of its recommendations. The report recommends: a ""significant increase"" in funding for all 16 to 19-year-olds in education, with a special ""student premium"" for the disadvantaged extending the offer of 30 hours of free childcare a week to cover households where one parent is working eight hours a week - currently one parent must work at least 16 hours the government agreeing to pay the voluntary living wage to all of its employees and contracted workers, including cleaners and catering staff The report found those from better-off backgrounds were almost 80% more likely to be in a professional job than their working class peers. It said the proportion of people from professional backgrounds who were in professional jobs was 60% last year. In contrast, only 34% of those from working class backgrounds had professional jobs last year. And both figures had changed only slightly over the past four years. ""Being born privileged means you are likely to remain privileged,"" said Dame Martina, who is also chief executive of the Prince's Trust. ""But being born disadvantaged means you may have to overcome a series of barriers to ensure you and your children are not stuck in the same trap."" The commission said it welcomed the findings showing that Scotland and Wales were becoming more socially mobile, with a person's socio-economic status less likely to be determined by their parents' socio-economic status than in 2014. It said this was especially encouraging in light of the limited social mobility in Britain as a whole. The Social Mobility Commission said an increasing number of students from low-income families were entering university by the age of 19. That proportion has now reached 26%, compared with 43% of better-off peers. But, five years after graduating, those graduates who had been on free school meals at school were in jobs that earned 11.5% less than other graduates, the report said. It found barriers to getting a top job were there from the start - about a half (52%) of disadvantaged teenagers leave school without basic qualifications and many get stuck in low-paid work. Adult education could help to redress that, said the report, but almost all forms of adult education have been in decline since 2010. There were also longer-term concerns that divisions could worsen as low-paid and low-skilled jobs were more likely to become automated in the future. Professor Diane Reay, from the University of Cambridge told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The expansion in the labour market is at the bottom - in the low-paid casualised jobs - rather than in the high-paid, more elite jobs. ""We need to radically change the hierarchical structure of English society, not just the social class of a few individuals."" Paul Gregg, a professor of economic and social policy at the University of Bath, who resigned from the Social Mobility Commission in 2017, told the programme: ""It's still the case that Brexit is sucking all the political oxygen in government [from] any kind of social reforms."" The education secretary said employment had risen in every UK region under this government; wages were outstripping inflation; the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has narrowed; and the proportion of 16 and 17-year-olds in education or apprenticeships was at its highest ever. Career progression and better-paid work is more likely if people move regions - particularly if they go to London, the data shows. Too often provincial towns and cities don't have the employment infrastructure to ensure career progression, notably in professions like law and accountancy. Those from wealthier backgrounds are more likely to be able to make that kind of move, with the resources and support to grab opportunities wherever they may be. Some believe devolving power and prestige to local government and combined authorities is the way to ensure a more even spread of growth and new jobs - and make the country less reliant on London. In England, the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine are initiatives to achieve just that within the wider industrial strategy. But there are concerns that not enough resources are available to achieve significant structural change.

He turned inside the area and there was no pressure on him at all. Spurs were just running around like they were in a practice match. They never really got into their stride and they were being dominated by a young side. It was a bit of a let down. Spurs have got quality players, but as a team, there was a gulf in class.

No creativity, no width. It was a very lacklustre performance. ""They didn't move the ball quick enough. Yes they are missing some key players - Harry Kane and Son Heung-min - but it was still disappointing."" Well it wasn't the night Tottenham had hoped for but the tie is not over.

On playing with a five-man defence:""Watching now of course I can accept it was a mistake the shape we used. But there were not too many options. I am not happy - you cannot guess what happens if we play in a different way. But our lack of energy... and a little sloppy. ""It was the not the shape that conceded the goal.

With club football, you have a model where the teams are interchangeable playthings of anonymous billionaires.

and we had problems. 1-0 is OK and next week we have to finish it. âThe beginning was good, but after that we played not what
we can. We have to make a good plan for next week. âWe have to stay calm. I donât know what they will do in the
next game. We can do better and we have to watch for next week.â Text 81111 (UK only). Spurs's lack of summer transfer business coming back to bite. No real depth in their squad once they lose one or two first team players. Graham, Liverpool Sure, Tottenham were missing key players tonight. But they just weren't at it for most of the match were they? They need to show up next week! Ajax have won a Champions League semi-final match for the first time since 17 April 1996 (3-0 at Panathinaikos). Today's goalscorer Donny van de Beek (18 April 1997) was not even born then. FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Dion DublinEx-Aston Villa striker on BBC Radio 5 Live Spurs have got quality players, but as a team, there was a gulf in class. Ajax played together and took their training onto the pitch whereas Spurs played like individuals in the final third. Text 81111 (UK only). Stats don't lie, that was a fairly even game despite (1) Ajax having a whole weeks rest, (2) Spurs being without several key players and (3) Vertonghen (in my opinion our most important defender) being battered half to death within 40 mins. Second half of the 180 will be a different tale. Joe, London Only one of the 17 previous teams to lose the
first leg at home in a European Cup/Champions League semi-final tie has
progressed into the final - Ajax in 1995-96. FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Tottenham Hotspur Spurs midfielder Christian Eriksen on BT Sport:âWe were under-par, we didnât play our best at all.
In the first 20 minutes, we were ball-watchers. We need to change it up a lot
for the next game. âWe made them look a lot better. They are a good side, but
we helped them along the way. It was our fault. We were better in the second
half. âAt the start, the system didnât matter. The change gave us
a different way to press, to play more direct. But we were still far from where
we know we can be. âNo one wanted to play the first half we did. Everyone knew
we didnât compete. We still lost, but we were better in the second half. âWe canât keep talking about injured players. In a
semi-final it doesnât matter who plays, we have to step up. Weâre lucky they
hit the post and hopefully we can turns things around in Amsterdam.â FT: Tottenham 0-1 Ajax Dion DublinEx-Aston Villa striker on BBC Radio 5 Live I had so much concussion during my career. You have to stay still and do exactly what you are told. Going back on the pitch was incredibly risky for Jan Vertonghen because if there was any challenge near him, it could have been terrible.

Inequality in UK 'entrenched from birth',"Inequality will remain entrenched ""from birth to work"" unless the government takes urgent action, the Social Mobility Commission has warned. ItsState of the Nation report,externalcovering England, Scotland and Wales, said the situation had remained ""virtually stagnant"" since 2014. It is calling on ministers to provide additional funding for older teenagers in education and to extend free childcare to more low income families. The government said it would take the recommendations seriously. The findings will come as a setback to Theresa May who promised to tackle the ""burning injustice"" of social inequality when she entered Downing Street in 2016. However, the following year, all of the commissioners on the Social Mobility Commission - set up in 2010 to monitor and promote social mobility - resigned,saying the government was too focused on Brexit to deal with creating a fairer Britain. This video can not be played Law graduate Paris McKenzie describes the difficulty she has faced finding work Law graduate Paris McKenzie, 25, wants to be a solicitor but said there are not enough training contracts in her home city of Nottingham. ""I have barely come across any, and I constantly search for them. There are lots in London,"" she said. But the single mother said she did not ""have the means"" to move to the capital, where she said she would not have support and would struggle to pick up her son from nursery herself. ""It's a catch 22, my opportunities are very limited,"" she added. Dame Martina Milburn, who has since been appointed as the new chairwoman, said she sensed there was now ""a real commitment"" from the government. However, she said the biggest concern was not stagnation, but that the problem might actually get worse. Dame Martina Milburn says those born privileged are likely to remain privileged ""There's still a big shift - if you want to be socially mobile - towards London,"" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""I think you're three times more likely to move to London if you're from a professional background than if you're from a working class background."" Young highly sceptical of social mobility The worst places to grow up poor Almost a third of graduates 'overeducated' Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he welcomed the ""thorough"" report - the first since the new commissioners were appointed - but stopped short of saying the government would adopt all of its recommendations. The report recommends: a ""significant increase"" in funding for all 16 to 19-year-olds in education, with a special ""student premium"" for the disadvantaged extending the offer of 30 hours of free childcare a week to cover households where one parent is working eight hours a week - currently one parent must work at least 16 hours the government agreeing to pay the voluntary living wage to all of its employees and contracted workers, including cleaners and catering staff The report found those from better-off backgrounds were almost 80% more likely to be in a professional job than their working class peers. It said the proportion of people from professional backgrounds who were in professional jobs was 60% last year. In contrast, only 34% of those from working class backgrounds had professional jobs last year. And both figures had changed only slightly over the past four years. ""Being born privileged means you are likely to remain privileged,"" said Dame Martina, who is also chief executive of the Prince's Trust. ""But being born disadvantaged means you may have to overcome a series of barriers to ensure you and your children are not stuck in the same trap."" The commission said it welcomed the findings showing that Scotland and Wales were becoming more socially mobile, with a person's socio-economic status less likely to be determined by their parents' socio-economic status than in 2014. It said this was especially encouraging in light of the limited social mobility in Britain as a whole. The Social Mobility Commission said an increasing number of students from low-income families were entering university by the age of 19. That proportion has now reached 26%, compared with 43% of better-off peers. But, five years after graduating, those graduates who had been on free school meals at school were in jobs that earned 11.5% less than other graduates, the report said. It found barriers to getting a top job were there from the start - about a half (52%) of disadvantaged teenagers leave school without basic qualifications and many get stuck in low-paid work. Adult education could help to redress that, said the report, but almost all forms of adult education have been in decline since 2010. There were also longer-term concerns that divisions could worsen as low-paid and low-skilled jobs were more likely to become automated in the future. Professor Diane Reay, from the University of Cambridge told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The expansion in the labour market is at the bottom - in the low-paid casualised jobs - rather than in the high-paid, more elite jobs. ""We need to radically change the hierarchical structure of English society, not just the social class of a few individuals."" Paul Gregg, a professor of economic and social policy at the University of Bath, who resigned from the Social Mobility Commission in 2017, told the programme: ""It's still the case that Brexit is sucking all the political oxygen in government [from] any kind of social reforms."" The education secretary said employment had risen in every UK region under this government; wages were outstripping inflation; the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has narrowed; and the proportion of 16 and 17-year-olds in education or apprenticeships was at its highest ever. Career progression and better-paid work is more likely if people move regions - particularly if they go to London, the data shows. Too often provincial towns and cities don't have the employment infrastructure to ensure career progression, notably in professions like law and accountancy. Those from wealthier backgrounds are more likely to be able to make that kind of move, with the resources and support to grab opportunities wherever they may be. Some believe devolving power and prestige to local government and combined authorities is the way to ensure a more even spread of growth and new jobs - and make the country less reliant on London. In England, the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine are initiatives to achieve just that within the wider industrial strategy. But there are concerns that not enough resources are available to achieve significant structural change.

Labour agrees a Brexit referendum position,"Labour's governing body has agreed to support a further referendum on Brexit under certain circumstances. The National Executive Committee met to decide the wording of its manifesto for May's European elections. It rejected the idea of campaigning for a referendum under all circumstances - as supported by deputy leader Tom Watson and many ordinary members. But the party will demand a public vote if it cannot get changes to the government's deal or an election. The National Executive Committee (NEC) oversees the overall direction of the party and is made up of representatives including shadow cabinet members, MPs, councillors and trade unions. Labour to redraft Euro election leaflets What's the mood on the doorstep? How many Labour supporters voted Leave? A Labour source said: ""The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour's existing policy to support Labour's alternative plan and if we can't get the necessary changes to the government's deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote."" The decision was sufficiently nuanced, though, that MPs have interpreted it in different ways. Wes Streeting, who favours another referendum, tweeted,externalthat the NEC had ""made the right call and confirmed that a public vote will be in our manifesto for the European elections"". Fellow pro-referendum MP Bridget Phillipson said Labour had ""done the bare minimum needed"" and she could ""only hope"" it would be enough to win over voters who want another say on Brexit. On the other side of the party,Gloria De Piero, who is against another vote, also welcomed the decision,external, arguing it meant the manifesto would ""not contain a pledge"" to hold a referendum - only keeping it as ""an option"" if a general election could not be engineered. The UK will have to take part in European Parliamentary elections on 23 May unless a Brexit deal is accepted by MPs before then. Labour agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's withdrawal deal with the EU - which it has effectively done three times - or talks ended in no-deal, there should be a general election. But if it could not force one, conference agreed that the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". Since then, though, Labour has entered into cross-party talks with the Conservatives to see if they can reach a consensus on how to get a Brexit deal through Parliament so that Britain can leave. Many Labour members wanted the party to make its agreement to any deal conditional on it being put to a public vote - what Labour calls a ""confirmatory ballot"". Labour have not yet made clear what their proposed referendum would be on, but a party briefing paper to MPs published earlier this year said it would need to have ""a credible Leave option and Remain"" on the ballot paper. On the surface it doesn't look like Labour's position has changed - but it has a little bit. Tom Watson, along with some trade unions and some party members, wanted a full-throated commitment to a referendum under all circumstances. What they have ended up with instead is a compromise or a fudge. Labour will call for a referendum if the Conservatives don't make changes to their Brexit deal. Some pro-referendum MPs aren't too disappointed because they believe the Conservatives won't move far enough and that leaves the door open to a referendum in the end anyway. Others, though, are disappointed because they think this is a way of avoiding a clear commitment in the run-up to the European elections. In truth, it puts the ball back into the Tories' court when it comes to those cross-party Brexit talks. Jeremy Corbyn is saying to Theresa May ""if you can compromise with us, we can hold back the tide of demands in our own party for a referendum."" That's the bargain he's offering. Speaking ahead of the NEC's decision, Tom Watson, the party's deputy leader, said ""the context has changed"" since the 2018 party conference and Labour should now throw its full support behind a second referendum ""to heal the divide in the country"". Afterwards, he described the party's agreed manifesto as ""very good"" and insisted he was not ""disappointed"" with the outcome - although he said would say more when the document was published next week. Manuel Cortes, secretary of the TSSA union which has a seat on the NEC, said he was disappointed that Labour had missed the opportunity to commit to giving voters another say. The latest talks between the government and Labour on Monday were described as ""positive"" and ""productive"" by the two sides. June 2017- Labour's general election manifesto accepts referendum result 28 September 2018- Labour agrees if a general election cannot be achieved it ""must support all optionsâ¦ including campaigning for a public vote"" November 2018- Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says Labour will ""inevitably"" back a second referendum if unable to secure general election 16 January 2019- 71 Labour MPs say they support a public vote 6 February 2019- Mr Corbyn writes a letter to Mrs May seeking five changes to her Brexit policy with no mention of a ""People's Vote"" 25 February 2019- Labour says it will back a public vote if its proposed Brexit deal is rejected 14 March 2019- Labour orders its MPs to abstain on an amendment calling for a second referendum 27 March 2019- The party instructs its MPs to support Margaret Beckett's amendment which calls for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal 30 April 2019- NEC agrees that the European election manifesto will commit to a further referendum under certain circumstances Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Packham gets 'calculated' death threatTV presenter Chris Packham says he was sent a list of threats including an organised car crash or poisoning.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Chris Packham tells Victoria Derbyshire: ""They threatened to organise a car crash"" TV presenter Chris Packham has said he received a ""very calculated"" death threat against him and his family after he campaigned for measures to protect birds from being shot. It comes after Natural England revoked licences for controlling 16 species of bird. Packham said the threat outlined ""a list of things they might do"" including organising a car crash or poisoning. He also condemned Facebook for not removing posts containing his address. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation said it does ""not condone any illegal behaviour. And for people to continue to behave in such a manner is utterly unacceptable"". The presenter told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he received the threat last night, and had reported it to Hampshire Police. ""In the structure of its composition it's designed to elicit as much fear as possible,"" he said. ""They're principally just saying, 'You will never be safe, you will never be able to go out, we will always be there.'"" Packham's campaign group Wild Justice has challenged the general licences that allow farmers to shoot birds including carrion crows, wood pigeons, and magpies that damage crops or attack livestock. Individuals can still apply to Natural England - the government's adviser for the natural environment in England - for individual licences to shoot the birds. The move provoked criticism from farmers' groups and others. The National Farmers' Union has said it has ""significant concerns"" about the sudden withdrawal of general licences. ""They are absolutely necessary at this time of year when crops are particularly vulnerable to pests. For example, a flock of pigeons could decimate a farmer's field of crops,"" its deputy president Guy Smith has said. ""It is incredibly disappointing that farmers and growers find themselves in this position, particularly at this time of year."" Packham has also faced criticism from those who say failing to control the crow population could endanger some of Britain's rarest birds, because the crows raid their nests and steal eggs and chicks. Last week, two dead crows were hung on Packham's garden gate, and the presenter said charities and organisations he works with have also been ""bombarded by bullies"". But he told Victoria Derbyshire that the movement against him had been driven by ""fake news"". The aim of his campaign, he said, had been to stop those ""who go out with the sole purpose of killing [birds] for pleasure"". He said it would not ""make it any more difficult for farmers to be able to control animals that they might consider a pest"", but that they would now have to show ""they have explored every other means of control"" - such as scaring the birds or using netting - before being permitted to shoot them. Chris Packham's apparent address has been published in a social media post He said threats would not stop him from continuing his conservation work. ""People like myself are very dogged and determined,"" he said. ""I cannot allow these things to sway me. There are too few people standing up and fighting to protect our environment, our landscape, our wildlife."" Packham also criticised Facebook, on which his home address is posted alongside ""invitations to send me dead animals and all sorts of other things"". He said this amounted to ""incitement to violence"", and he had tried to have it removed. But, he added, Facebook ""are extremely resistant to these sorts of things"".

Aldi accused of copying baby changing bagBabaBing says the supermarket chain copied a bag the firm worked on for two years.,"The bag sold in Aldi in January, left, with the BabaBing bag launched in March 2018 Supermarket chain Aldi has stopped selling a baby changing bag after being accused of copying another company's design. BabaBing, a Keighley-based child and baby products firm, claims a bag sold by Aldi in January has similarities to one it started selling in 2018. The BabaBing bag retails at Â£49.99, with Aldi's selling for Â£17.99. The retailer said it always listens to feedback and would be happy to meet the firm to discuss its concerns. BabaBing contacted the supermarket in early January to say its 'Mani' product was ""identical or at least very similar"" to a bag on sale in Aldi during a week-long baby-themed promotion. The company said the Aldi bag and its internal items were the ""same size and shape"" as its bag, with similar design features across the two products. Read more Yorkshire stories In response Aldi told the company its research suggested that ""similar bags have been on the market for some time"". However, it said it would not be selling the product again in a future 'Specialbuys' promotion as planned, ""without any admission of liability"". The BabaBing (left) and the Aldi bag (right) come with changing mats and bottle holders Nick Robinson, managing technical director at BabaBing, said: ""It's no coincidence, the number of features that are identical to ours - it's not them designing a bag. ""In my view they've taken our bag and blatantly copied it."" When asked about the price difference, the company said: ""They're not overpriced, they're very competitively priced and the quality is far better than Aldi."" An Aldi spokesperson said: ""We aim to provide our customers with products of a similar high quality to the leading brands, but at a fraction of the price. ""We sell a wide range of baby products that are hugely popular with parents and we will consider Mr Robinson's views when planning future ranges.""

"New type of dementia identifiedExperts say the dementia discovery - the most important for years - could help find new, effective treatments.Health","Millions of elderly people have a form of dementia that has been misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease, according to researchers. One expert called it the most important dementia finding in years. The condition, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, or Late, shares similar symptoms to Alzheimer's, but it is a distinct disease, the journal Brain reports. It may partly explain why finding a dementia cure has failed so far. 'What my dad's dementia taught me' Dementia risks not known by half of people Dementia is not a single disease, but is the name for a group of symptoms that include problems with memory and thinking. There are lots of different types of dementia and Alzheimer's is said to be the most common and most researched. But up to a third of Alzheimer's in elderly people may instead be Late, says the international team of researchers, although both dementias can co-exist. Late appears to affect the ""oldest old"" - people over 80 - according to the work that looked at evidence from thousands of post-mortem results. One in five in this age group has it, meaning the public health impact of the disease will be large, say the researchers. Unlike Alzheimer's, it tends to cause a more gradual decline in memory, they believe. Currently, there is no specific single test for dementia.

New type of dementia identified,"Millions of elderly people have a form of dementia that has been misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease, according to researchers. One expert called it the most important dementia finding in years. The condition, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, or Late, shares similar symptoms to Alzheimer's, but it is a distinct disease, the journal Brain reports. It may partly explain why finding a dementia cure has failed so far. 'What my dad's dementia taught me' Dementia risks not known by half of people Dementia is not a single disease, but is the name for a group of symptoms that include problems with memory and thinking. There are lots of different types of dementia and Alzheimer's is said to be the most common and most researched. But up to a third of Alzheimer's in elderly people may instead be Late, says the international team of researchers, although both dementias can co-exist. Late appears to affect the ""oldest old"" - people over 80 - according to the work that looked at evidence from thousands of post-mortem results. One in five in this age group has it, meaning the public health impact of the disease will be large, say the researchers. Unlike Alzheimer's, it tends to cause a more gradual decline in memory, they believe. Currently, there is no specific single test for dementia. Signs of it can sometimes be seen in the brain after death. Late appears to be linked to the accumulation of a certain protein, TDP-43, in the brain, while Alzheimer's is linked to two other brain proteins - amyloid and tau. Scientists have been striving to find a cure for dementia, but with so many different types and causes of the disease, the goal has proved difficult.

New police probe into hospital deathsAn inquiry found more than 450 patients died after being given painkillers at Gosport hospital.Hampshire & Isle of Wight,"Ian Sandford, whose mother died in Gosport hospital, attended a meeting between police and relatives A new criminal investigation is to take place into the deaths of hundreds of patients who were given ""dangerous"" levels of painkillers at a hospital. Aninquiry found 456 patients diedafter being given opiate drugs at Gosport War Memorial Hospital between 1987 and 2001. A review has since been carried out by Kent and Essex Police to assess if there was ""sufficient new evidence"". Relatives have been told a ""full investigation"" will begin. Three previous investigations into 92 of the deaths by Hampshire Constabulary resulted in no charges being brought. This video can not be played Timeline: Concerns were first raised about the treatment of patients in 1998 Assistant Chief Constable Nick Downing, head of serious crime at Kent and Essex Police, met relatives at a meeting in Fareham. Speaking at a press conference afterwards, he promised a ""thorough and independent"" investigation with a range of offences, including murder, to be considered. He said police would not be interviewing hospital staff but meeting families individually to collect statements on their relatives' experiences of the hospital. He said a new medical expert panel would also be set up to ""prove or disprove the causational link between opioids being administered and deaths"". Assistant Chief Constable Nick Downing is leading the latest police investigation He said: ""We need to look at what is new or different to submit to the CPS. I am satisfied that there is new and different material for us to consider. ""Our investigation does not involve suspects. If we prove the causational link we will move to the next phase."" The investigation is likely to take nine months. Prescribed painkillers 'shortened 456 lives' Who is Dr Jane Barton? The numbers behind the scandal 'My father's life was ended by someone else' ACC Downing added: ""When you spend time with the families, you hear the ordeal they've gone through... you can't help but feel the pain and suffering. As you listen your heart potentially just breaks. ""I absolutely understand there is mistrust. I walk into that room and it's palpable, that mistrust in my organisation and me."" Bridget Reeves has been campaigning for justice for relatives of those who died in the hospital In a statement read on behalf of the families, Bridget Reeves, whose 88-year-old grandmotherElsie Devinedied in the hospital in 1999, said there had a been a ""cover-up culture"" surrounding previous investigations. She said: ""We challenged and we challenged when we saw the corrupt evidence that so-called experts had submitted but the CPS slammed the door shut in our faces. ""This immoral disaster was perpetuated by a club culture ... officials protected each other. ""Our loved ones were killed and our lives destroyed."" Ian Sandford, whose mother also died in Gosport, added: ""Frustration doesn't even come near. They should have sorted this out a long time ago. ""All I want to hear is a good result."" Peta Birmingham's grandmother Gladys Richards died in Gosport Peta Birmingham, whose grandmother Gladys Richards died, said her family were ""as pleased as we can be"" about the new investigation. She said: ""After all this time you can understand why the families are distrustful of the process, having already endured three police investigations. We hope it'll be different and it will reach its rightful conclusion."" Gosport MP and health minister Caroline Dinenage said she hoped families would ""get access to the truth"". She said: ""I know that some families would prefer a much faster conclusion. I also have many constituents who've worked at the War Memorial Hospital past and present, with great professionalism and integrity. ""That's why it's important that the investigation is done with the utmost care and thoroughness."" Dr Jane Barton was found guilty of serious professional misconduct in 2010 but no prosecutions were brought The Gosport Independent Review Panel report, published in June 2018, found there was a ""disregard for human life"" at the hospital. It also found an ""institutionalised regime"" of prescribing and administering amounts of opiate medication that were not clinically justified. The report said the quality of previous police investigations had been ""consistently poor"". It found whistleblowers and families were ignored as they attempted to raise concerns about the administration of medication on the wards, which wasoverseen by Dr Jane Barton. Dr Barton retired after being found guilty by a medical panel of failings in her care of 12 patients at Gosport between 1996 and 1999. In a statement last year, Dr Barton said she was a ""hard-working doctor"" who was ""doing her best"" for patients in a ""very inadequately resourced"" part of the NHS.

Blood inquiry evidence 'harrowing and chilling',"This video can not be played Derek Martindale's brother was also infected with HIV: ""He knew he was dying... I wasn't there for him"" Victims of the contaminated blood scandal have been telling a public inquiry how their lives have been ruined. The hearing is looking at how thousands of people were infected with hepatitis C and HIV from contaminated blood they were given in the 1970s and 80s. One man said he was devastated when he was told he had only a year to live after being diagnosed with HIV. Another said he was so sick that plans started to be made for his funeral. Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff praised the bravery of those giving evidence. He warned that the accounts being put forward were ""harrowing"", ""moving"" and ""chilling"". He said there would be ""more to come"" during the two-year inquiry, but pledged to make sure the victims got a chance to tell their stories. This video can not be played Martin Beard was told he was HIV positive at the age of 17 The scandal has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. About 5,000 people with haemophilia, a genetic condition that prevents blood from clotting properly, were infected when they were given blood products to help their blood clot. More than 2,000 are already thought to have died. Thousands more may have been exposed through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth. Blood inquiry seeks answers at last 'NHS scandal killed both my husbands' The secret in my blood Hundreds of victims and their families are expected to give evidence during the inquiry. One of the first people to take the stand was Derek Martindale, who has haemophilia. He said he was 23 when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1985 and was given a year to live. Mr Martindale said he had been told not to tell anyone, even his family. He added: ""When you're young you're invincible, when you're 23 you're generally fit, but then you're told you have 12 months to live - it's very hard to comprehend, so there was the fear. ""There was no future, the likelihood of getting married and having children was very unlikely."" Mr Martindale said his brother Richard, who also had haemophilia, was diagnosed with HIV too. He said his greatest regret was not being able to support his brother in the months before he died in 1990. Another victim who gave evidence was Perry Evans, 57, from Winchester. He was diagnosed with mild haemophilia as a child and regularly received blood products. He was told he had HIV in 1985 and has suffered with health problems including hepatitis C, chest infections, pneumonia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. At one point he was so ill in hospital that plans started to be made for his funeral. ""I cried when I came out because I didn't think I would come out,"" he said. Carole Anne Hill found out in January 2017 that she had hepatitis C, infected as a result of a blood transfusion she was given in 1987. She had menorrhagia at that time, suffering from heavy periods. Asked how she heard about her diagnosis, she told the inquiry: ""By letter, which was half opened and not sealed properly."" ""I was cross about that,"" she added. Su Gorman's husband, Steve Dymond, died in December A number of people have also been speaking out ahead of the start of the hearing. Su Gorman said the main thing victims and their families wanted from the inquiry was ""justice"" and people held to account. Her husband, Steve Dymond, died aged 62 on 23 December last year of organ failure - ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man. Su said: ""I want to see justice. ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would - and that's a promise I intend to keep."" About 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses over a period of more than 20 years. This was because they were injected with blood products used to help their blood clot. It was a treatment introduced in the early 1970s. Before then, patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries. Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment - known as clotting agent Factor VIII - and so supplies were imported from the US. But much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. Factor VIII was imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s The blood products were made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors and concentrating it. People who had blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth were also exposed to the contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s, the products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991. And by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk. This is the first UK-wide public inquiry that can compel witnesses to testify. It comes after decades of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was subsequently covered up. The government has been strongly criticised for dragging its heels. There have been previous inquiries. One was led by Labour peer Lord Archer of Sandwell and was privately funded. It held no official status and was unable to compel witnesses to testify or require the disclosure of documents. Meanwhile, the Penrose Inquiry, a seven-year investigation launched by the government in Scotland, was criticised as a whitewash when it was published in 2015. Greater Manchester Mayor and former health secretary Andy Burnham has repeatedly called for a probe into what happened. Mr Burnham claimed in the House of Commons in 2017 that a ""criminal cover-up on an industrial scale"" had taken place. The government announced there would be an inquiry only after it faced a possible defeat in a vote on an emergency motion. This public inquiry into the scandal was first announced in the summer of 2017. Ahead of the public hearings, the government announced more financial support for people in England affected by the tragedy, to a total of Â£75m from Â£46m, amid complaints other parts of the UK were more generous. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The contaminated blood scandal was a tragedy that should never have happened and has caused unimaginable pain and hurt for victims and their families for decades. ""I know this will be a difficult time for victims and their families - but today will begin a journey which will be dedicated to getting to the truth of what happened and in delivering justice to everyone involved."" But Jason Evans, founder of the campaign group Factor VIII, said the fund was still essentially a ""begging bowl"" and the increase, about Â£900 for each victim, represented ""virtually no change"".

Gosport: The numbers behind the scandal,"The families of those who died have campaigned for years to get justice What exactly was the ""critical turning point"" that helped reveal the scandal at Gosport War Memorial Hospital in which hundreds of patients died prematurely? In the graphics below we take an in-depth look at how investigators exposed the details of more than a decade of ""shortened"" lives at the hospital, which resulted from patients being given dangerous doses of painkilling drugs. Apanel of independent experts,externalbegan by looking at the deaths of 163 patients. What they found prompted them to examine more than 2,000 deaths between 1987 and 2001. Research revealed that 71 patients in the initial group had been given powerful painkilling drugs ""without appropriate clinical indication"".  This discovery made the panel ""deeply concerned"". One of the patients was 91-year-old Sheila Gregory. Admitted in 1999, the report says she was given diamorphine  for ""no clear reason"".  She died a day later. Sheila Gregory died a day after being given diamorphine by syringe driver. Diamorphine is the medical name for heroin. It is ordinarily reserved for patients suffering unbearable pain, sometimes in their final hours. Like 62 other members of the group, the cause of Ms Gregory's death is listed as ""bronchopneumonia"". Helena Service was the oldest patient to die. The 99-year-old was given diamorphine through a syringe driver, pumping the dose at a constant rate into her body. The inquiry judged that she was one of those given opioid painkillers without appropriate medical justification. The reason given for administering diamorphine was that she was ""restless"".  Ms Service died two days after she was admitted on 5 June 1997 from ""congestive cardiac failure"", according to hospital records. Prescribed painkillers 'shortened 456 lives' Doctor 'did best for patients' Who is Dr Jane Barton? Gosport hospital deaths: NHS closed ranks, says Norman Lamb The youngest of the group who died was 61-year-old Dennis Robert Doughty. His record simply states that he died on 13 May 2000 from bowel cancer. Most of those who died were elderly - the average age of patients who died was 81.  Almost two-thirds were women and many were frail. More than 70% (116) of the initial group had not been admitted to the hospital for terminal care - in many cases, their deaths were unexpected. Elsie Devine, 88, was admitted in October 1999 with kidney problems. No reason was given on her hospital notes for prescribing her diamorphine in combination with two other powerful painkillers - fentanyl and midazolam. Elsie Devine died after being given diamorphine. Again, she was given the drugs by syringe driver and died only two days later. Her cause of death was listed as renal failure. The panel discovered that reasons for prescribing the painkilling drugs, recorded by medical staff in patients' notes at the hospital, were not always to do with pain relief.  They were often vague and included ""restlessness"", ""agitation"" or ""deterioration"". Syringe drivers were used in more than half of the cases in the initial group. They are designed to gradually deliver a steady dose of a chosen drug or other fluid into the bloodstream of the patient. Concerns have been raised about their use, which is subject to clear hazard warnings for medical staff. The inquiry included evidence given to the police by nursing auxiliary Paulina Spilka. She told officers that she did not recall a ""single instance of a patient not dying having been put on to a driver"". Patients were injected in the back, she said, so that it was impossible for them to take out the driver. The inquiry found that continuous opioids were started at ""inappropriately high doses"". It also found that there was ""little evidence that any consideration went into assessing what combination of drugs was best for an individual patient"". Deaths occurred very quickly after painkillers were administered by syringe driver. Stanley Carby was one of those patients who died less than a day after his first dose of diamorphine.  No reason was recorded for administering such a powerful painkiller. His cause of death is listed as ""cerebrovascular accident"", or stroke. Mr Carby was 65 years old. Where diamorphine was administered continuously, 56% of patients died within two days or fewer. Of the patients who were given diamorphine combined with other drugs, midazolam and hyoscine, that figure jumped to 71%. The cause of death in 63 cases was listed as bronchopneumonia, an infection of the lungs and small airways. The inquiry team struggled to find any reason why the number of bronchopneumonia victims was so high. It did not match expectations among similar groups of elderly patients. It concluded simply that the available documents did ""not provide an explanation"". The inquiry also revealed how slow the authorities had been to act on warnings from nursing staff. In the spotlight was Dr Jane Barton who worked in the department of medicine for elderly people at Gosport War Memorial Hospital from 1 May 1988 until her resignation on 5 July 2000. During her 12 years at the hospital, Dr Barton signed 854 death certificates. Of the patients she treated, 94% received opiates. Dr Jane Barton was found guilty of serious professional misconduct. The first record of concerns being raised is of a phone call in 1991 by staff nurse Anita Tubbritt, to the local branch convenor of the Royal College of Nursing. Shortly afterwards, 10 nurses set out their worries about deaths being ""hastened unnecessarily"" and a drug regime being used ""indiscriminately"".  Meetings and correspondence ensued, but their warnings, which could have made a decisive impact, went unheeded. Most of the deaths occurred in the following seven years. In 1998, the death of Gladys Richards led to a complaint by her family. Ms Richards had been in hospital to recover from hip surgery and was given diamorphine. She died three days later. The police dismissed her family as ""troublemakers"" in their first investigation according to the inquiry, but a second followed soon afterwards, shortly before Dr Barton's resignation. It was not until 2010 that a General Medical Council investigation found Dr Barton guilty of serious professional misconduct. After looking at more than 2,000 deaths between 1987 and 2001 the inquiry estimated that a total of at least 650 patients are likely to have been given drugs which shortened their lives without medical justification. The report concluded: ""The families, and indeed the nation as a whole, are entitled to ask how these events could have happened.""

Blood inquiry seeks answers at last,"Derek Martindale was given a year to live It has been a long time coming - more than three decades to be precise. At long last a full public inquiry into the infected blood scandal has started a process which will attempt to give victims and their families some answers. Preliminary hearings last September set out the wide-ranging scope of the inquiry. Now witnesses, including those infected and affected, have begun giving evidence. In other countries where haemophiliacs and others became infected with HIV and hepatitis C through treatment by their health systems, politicians have been held to account and full compensation has been paid. The UK has not moved in the same way to try to establish who was responsible and why the biggest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS was allowed to unfold. Blood inquiry evidence 'harrowing and chilling' 'NHS scandal killed both my husbands' The secret in my blood A clotting agent, Factor VIII, was made from donated blood, some of which was infected and had come from paid foreign donors including prisoners. The big question is who at high levels of the NHS and government knew what and when. Here in the UK there has been one privately funded inquiry with no powers to compel witnesses to attend. In Scotland a judge-led inquiry under Lord Penrose reached limited conclusions. Now, under Sir Brian Langstaff, the new statutory UK-wide inquiry is under way which in his own words will be ""independent of government, and frightened of no-one in the conclusions it may draw"". He is well aware of allegations of a cover-up in Whitehall with documents destroyed. The opening day of evidence has served as a reminder of what was inflicted on patients who went to the NHS for treatment in good faith. Derek Martindale, comforted by his son John sitting beside him, described being treated with blood products for his haemophilia in the mid-1980s but with no warning about the risks of contracting HIV and hepatitis C. He asked for an HIV test and was told he was positive but was instructed not to tell anyone including his family and parents. His brother, also a haemophiliac, later died with Aids and he spoke of the devastating impact on his parents. At the end of Mr Martindale's evidence, people in the room stood and clapped. Dr Hill didn't find out for 20 years that she had hepatitis C Dr Carole Hill had a blood transfusion in 1987 but it wasn't until 2017 that she was told she had hepatitis C. It transpired clinicians had carried out a test a few months earlier after she went in for another appointment. Dr Hill said she was angry at the way she had been dealt with by the NHS in recent years. She said better communication was required and more effort should be made to contact others who had blood transfusions and might have been infected with hepatitis C. Perry Evans told the inquiry of his sadness at the impact on friends and family when he revealed his health condition. He was told he was HIV positive in 1985 following treatment for his haemophilia but it transpired doctors had known several months before and not told him. He spoke movingly about living with HIV at a time of scare stories and stigma. Victims and their campaigning groups, supported by the judge, have called for more generous financial support. The Scottish government increased payouts after the Penrose inquiry but England, Wales and Northern Ireland have lagged behind. Hours before the first inquiry, it was announced at Westminster that total annual funding would be increased from Â£46m to Â£75m for recipients in England. This video can not be played Martin Beard was told he was HIV positive at the age of 17 The authorities in Wales and Northern Ireland are likely to follow but this is subject to further discussions. Coming late in the day and without much detail, the government's financial announcement did not seem to impress many of the key participants. There has been no change to unpopular means-testing and no solid demonstration that there can be parity of payments across the UK. Compensation is another matter and could involve large sums of money. Claims could hinge on the findings of this infected blood inquiry and the extent to which it finds fault at the heart of government.

'God's gift' cricketer jailed for rape,"Alex Hepburn was found guilty earlier this month of rape following a retrial A ""foul sexist"" cricketer has been jailed for raping a sleeping woman. Ex-Worcestershire player Alex Hepburn assaulted the victim at his Worcester flat after she had consensual sex with his then teammate Joe Clarke in 2017. The 23-year-old was found guilty of rape earlier this month and sentenced to five years at Hereford Crown Court. Judge Jim Tindal told him the sexual conquest ""game"" he had set up on a WhatsApp group was ""laddish"" behaviour that ""demeaned women"". He told Hepburn he had ""arrogantly"" believed his victim would consent, during the attack. ""You thought you were God's gift to women,"" he said. ""You did see her at that moment as a piece of meat, not a woman entitled to respect."" Hepburnwas found guilty of one count of oral rape and cleared of one rape chargefollowing a retrial at Worcester Crown Court. The woman woke up after a night out on 1 April and wrongly believed she was having sex with Mr Clarke before realising it was actually Hepburn, the trial was told. Hepburn posted rules of the ""stat chat"" game about many women he and Mr Clarke could have sex with on a WhatsApp group a week before the rape. His bid to collect ""as many sexual encounters as possible"" as part of the game was ""foul sexism"", Judge Tindal said. ""It demeaned women and trivialised rape - a word you personally threw around lightly,"" the judge said. ""Only now do you realise how serious rape is."" Latest news from the West Midlands Judge Tindal described Alex Hepburn as ""immature"" In a victim impact statement, read to the court by prosecutor Miranda Moore QC, the woman said she suffered recurring nightmares in the form of ""a repeat of the rape"", which had also led to the collapse of her relationship with her then boyfriend. Describing her ordeal as evil and a ""heinous crime"", she added: ""I take off my hat to anyone who can hold down a healthy happy relationship, after being raped. ""I am flooded with guilt that I can't ever seem to escape."" The trial was told the woman met Mr Clarke in a nightclub before returning to his flat where they had sex. He left his bedroom during the night to be sick and remained passed out in his bathroom. Hepburn found the woman asleep on a mattress after arriving back at the flat ""alone, drunk and frustrated"" and he ""saw a chance"" and attacked her, the court heard, The woman only realised it wasn't Mr Clarke when Hepburn spoke in an Australian accent. Hepburn's barrister, Michelle Heeley QC, said her client had expressed ""true remorse"", adding: ""He has lost everything: his career, his good character and ultimately his liberty.""

Man jailed over plot to dump US pensioner,"A BBC Panorama investigation revealed Mr Curry's identity and that his home was in Los Angeles A man who plotted to dump a vulnerable American pensioner in England so he could be treated on the NHS has been jailed. Roger Curry, who had dementia, was discovered in a Hereford bus station car park on 5 November 2015. Worcester Crown Court was told Simon Hayes was part of the plot to ""abandon [Mr Curry] so he could receive care from local health care providers"". Hayes, 53, claimed he had found Mr Curry ""face down"" in a country lane. Mr Curry, who is in his 70s, was found without any identification, but later traced to Los Angeles after an international campaign for information. Simon Davis QC, prosecuting, said Hayes, of Henlade, Somerset, had told police a ""pack of lies"" which led them on a ""wild goose chase"". However, his motivations for getting involved in the plot remain unclear. The court heard Mr Curry was cared for in a residential home for eight months - at a cost to the NHS of up to Â£20,000 - before being flown back to the United States in July 2016. Latest news from the West Midlands Mr Davis said Hayes had exchanged a series of texts and calls with ""best mate"" Kevin Curry, the victim's son. Kevin Curry flew with his mother and father to London Gatwick in November 2015, but later left without his father. Mr Davis said it had ""clearly"" been planned to ""dump"" Mr Curry so he could receive care from local health care providers. Hayes, in a fake military uniform and putting on an American accent, took Mr Curry to Hereford bus station, close to the city's hospital, the court heard. He told a nurse and paramedics he had found Mr Curry but could not give any contact details because he was ""working with the SAS"" at their nearby camp. While appealing for information, police suspected Mr Curry had been deliberately abandoned. After he was able to provide his name, they tracked down Kevin Curry in California, but he claimed nobody called Roger lived at his address. Simon Hayes admitted perverting the course of justice in March However, for reasons unknown, Hayes subsequently called West Mercia Police, identifying himself as the man who handed in Mr Curry. But he again lied, claiming he and a ""Canadian Army serviceman"" had found Mr Curry, that he lived in Los Angeles, and at the time had been ""attending a course"" at the base, the court heard. Police spoke to his father Ken, who Hayes claimed he had been visiting in Taunton. Mr Hayes confirmed his son knew Roger and Kevin Curry. Hayes was arrested and in March admitted perverting the course of justice and a separate case of fraud, in relation to a false character reference. He was jailed for two-and-a-half years on Tuesday. Mr Davis said Mr Curry's son was under investigation in the US for elder abuse, fraud and kidnapping. Kevin Currypreviously told BBC's Panoramahis father had become unwell on a trip to the UK and he had left him with a friend to take him to hospital. Judge Daniel Pearce-Higgins QC said Hayes' false information caused ""an enormous waste of police and public resources"". ""I cannot find any case remotely similar to the facts of this case, curiously because there appears to be no apparent benefit to the defendant,"" he said.

New Land Rover to be built in SlovakiaJaguar Land Rover will build its next-generation Defender in Slovakia rather than the UK.BusinessComments,"The new Land Rover Defender is expected to go on sale early next year Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will build its next-generation Land Rover Defender 4x4 in Slovakia rather than the UK. The Defender model was built at the firm's Solihull factory near Birmingham until 2016. The firm says the new model has been designed and engineered in the UK and its new engines built in Wolverhampton. JLR also says it plans ""significant investment"" at Solihull to support the production of its next generation of Range Rover and Land Rover models. In January 2016, some 67 years of the 4x4 being made at Solihull came to an end. More than two million were made in the West Midlands since the original Land Rover Series began production in Solihull in 1948. Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts The challenges faced by Jaguar Land Rover The new Defender will be built at the company's Â£1bn plant in Nitra in Slovakia, which opened in October 2018. The new model is expected to be unveiled later this year at the Frankfurt Motor Show and to go on sale early in 2020. JLR says the 2020 Defender is now entering its final phase of testing. James Attwood is deputy editor at Autocar magazine, and says there had been little prior expectation that the new vehicle would be built in the UK. ""Reading between the lines it always looked like it would be built in Slovakia, particularly after they [JLR] had invested such a large sum in their new plant there,"" he says. ""But it is still very much a British design.  And, of the range of engines that are going to be built for the new vehicle, a number are going to be built in the UK."" He adds: ""Jaguar and Land Rover already make a number of cars in other countries and they are still very much seen as British cars.""

Mothers 'ignored' at Welsh valleys hospitals,"This video can not be played Jessica Western says she is still fighting to find out why her daughter Macie died The full extent of the problems with maternity services at two hospitals in the south Wales valleys rings out when the voices of women and families are listened to. ""Overwhelmingly"" mothers faced ""distressing experiences and poor care"", the review team found. As one said: ""I want having a baby to be a good experience. It's ruined it."" Women repeatedly stated they were not listened to and their concerns were not taken seriously or valued. They spoke of being ignored or patronisedwhile being cared for at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. Often, their suspicions and concerns were found to have reflected a genuine problem that emerged later, but at the time they were dismissed when they tried to voice their concerns. Amajor independent reviewhas found Cwm Taf health board's maternity services were ""under extreme pressure"" and the health minister has ordered them be put into special measures. It was prompted by 25 serious incidents, including eight stillbirths and four neonatal deaths, between January 2016 and last September. The independent review team has releaseda separate, damning 78-page report,,externalwhich shares the views of 140 family members, including mothers about their experiences at the hospitals. Nearly two thirds of women questioned felt they had not had good quality care during their pregnancy. Cwm Taf maternity services put in special measures Gething rejects quit call over Cwm Taf Q&A: What's the background at Cwm Taf? The review said: ""Many women had felt something was wrong with their baby or tried to convey the level of pain they were experiencing but they were ignored or patronised, and no action was taken, with tragic outcomes including stillbirth and neonatal death of their babies."" One woman said she felt worthless, adding: ""I'm broken from the whole experience, the lack of care and compassion."" On the care itself, repeatedly the review team heard from mothers who did not always believe the right level of skills and expertise were available at the right time. There was a failure to seek a second, more senior opinion, and to escalate concerns, especially with women with complex pregnancies. One mother said: ""He told me there was no point calling the consultant on a Sunday as no one would come."" Another said: ""I never saw the same consultant. They didn't know me, and they didn't want to know me. I was pushed in and out of rooms with all sorts of people."" Mothers faced too many variables in the service offered - from the time of day they used it, to staffing levels and the communication skills of the staff they met. This video can not be played 'We picked the wrong day to be ill' The case of Sarah Handy Sarah Handy's experience is highlighted in the report as illustrating a number of serious issues. In pain, she was begging to see a doctor when she arrived in hospital in April 2017 and was left for nearly three hours without examination before being told it was constipation. Ms Handy, 33, was sent back home to Merthyr Tydfil with laxatives and pain relief and that evening her baby Jennifer was delivered prematurely by her husband and mother-in-law. Despite their efforts to give CPR to save her life, Jennifer died. The review said it showed: Inadequate levels of expertise in managing high risk pregnancies Failure to listen to women and to understand the level of pain being experienced and reported Lack of response to ""red flags"" and failure to follow good practice and pathways of care Failure to call for a second, more senior, opinion Failure to support the woman after the tragic and traumatic loss of her baby. Ms Handy said after the report came out: ""Today it's been proven in black and white that we were right to highlight our concerns and push for further investigation into our Jennifer's death. ""We just wish that this report will now do what it promised and improve the quality of care so that no other family has to go the traumatic experience we went through."" On communication, although individual staff were spoken of as excellent, many women felt during their care this aspect was extremely poor. When concerns were raised, there was a ""significant dissatisfaction"" with how they were dealt with, with dismissive attitudes. Many women were not listened to or taken seriously, one saying she was ""laughed at"" when she expressed concern. Other responses included: ""I was never asked, never believed. ""If only they had asked the right questions. ""Most importantly, we were not listened to. By the time we were it was too late."" The review said women reported an ""almost callous and brutal use of language"" and disregard for feelings. Cwm Taf told to 'get back on track' 26 baby deaths in maternity probe When one mother was concerned that she may be losing her baby she was told to ""prepare for the worst - it could be a miscarriage"" and then told to go home as ""there wasn't a lot she could do."" Younger mothers in particular often felt their concerns were dismissed, which became an ""emerging theme"" for the review team. There were failures to apologise, lack of access to notes and comprehensive investigations over concerns. With high risk pregnancies, one woman interviewed believed that there was a lack of expertise and that ""anything different from the norm, they didn't seem set up to deal with it"". Another described the antenatal clinic as being ""like a cattle-market"". When babies were lost, ""many women and families received no bereavement counselling or support and continue to experience emotional distress"". But staffing shortages were recognised. One mother talking about the demand on midwives and doctors in the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, said it was ""no way a reflection on them"". ""They would always spend as much time as possible with me but unfortunately when needs must I was left with some questions but again this was due to staff shortages,"" she said. Another said: ""There were so many jobs for one midwife to do and then people wonder why mistakes get made. They are human and are exhausted"". The review published two parallel reports into Cwm Taf maternity services and the experiences of mothers The review team said it was disappointing that lessons had not been learnt from a review of Furness General Hospital services four years ago. Prof Jean White, chief nursing officer, said: ""It should be a joyous occasion giving birth to a child. Many of the women who shared their stories had care well below the standards we expect and that's not right. ""I think over time there appears to be a culture that has developed rather than an open culture where people are encouraged to say what's gone wrong, there is a blame culture."" In the words of another parent: ""Listen to women and families and believe what they tell you when they are in pain."" The review team concludes: ""The strong message heard from women and families in Cwm Taf is that they don't want their experiences to happen to anyone else and the importance to them that the organisation learns from these experiences to ensure that improvement and change occurs."" Cwm Taf chief executive Allison Williams said she was deeply sorry, is taking the findings very seriously but recognised ""significant work"" was still needed. ""Some of the feedback we have received from patients is extremely distressing and their experience in our maternity service has been totally unacceptable,"" she added.

Nothing found after plane security alertAn EasyJet flight was at the centre of a security scare after it landed at Glasgow Airport from Gatwick.Scotland,"Passengers who were on the flight were moved to a holding room area at Glasgow Airport A plane at the centre of a security alert at Glasgow Airport was found to have nothing suspicious on board. All flights were suspended to and from Glasgow Airport after the crew on the aircraft, which had just landed from Gatwick, raised the alarm at 10:25. Initial reports suggested the incident, which shut the runway for 30 minutes, was linked to a suspect package. Police later confirmed a search of the aircraft delivered a ""negative result"" but inquiries are ongoing. Passenger James Gale said he was not aware of any problem on board until he checked Twitter. The 21-year-old, from Brighton, told BBC Scotland: ""No one seemed aware of anything, not visibly to me anyway. ""The captain just said that we were waiting for a stand. ""It was only from looking in Twitter that I found out."" Police Scotland officers responded to the alert on the Easyjet flight When the plane stopped there was an announcement to say there was an incident on board. Mr Gale added: ""The captain said there was a security incident but not on our plane, and then when we were stopped, he announced that it was our plane, and that we needed to get onto the buses and head to where we are still at now."" He said the passengers were then taken off the plane and escorted to what one person later described on social media as a ""survivor evacuation room"". Mr Gale said he did not see anyone being arrested and confirmed police were taking personal details from passengers before they were permitted to go on their way. A spokesman from Glasgow Airport confirmed that the incident had ended and the runway reopened just before 11:00. Police Scotland said officers were made aware of a security incident by the flight crew. A force spokeswoman said: ""All passengers from the affected flight have been spoken to by officers and able to continue their journeys. ""The plane has been searched with a negative result and nothing has been found. ""The circumstances surrounding the nature of the security alert will continue to be investigated."" Emergency services surrounded the plane An EasyJet spokeswoman said: ""EasyJet can confirm that passengers on flight EZY883 from London Gatwick to Glasgow were delayed disembarking on arrival in Glasgow, purely as a precaution, due to additional security checks. ""The passengers have been disembarked and taken into the terminal. ""The safety and security of its passengers and crew is always EasyJet's highest priority and we would like to thank passengers for their understanding.""

Care home group goes into administration,"One of Britain's largest care home groups, Four Seasons Health Care, has gone into administration. Two of the holding companies behind the firm appointed administrators on Tuesday after struggling to repay their debts. The group serves about 17,000 residents and patients and employs some 20,000 staff. Four Seasons said the move would not affect care arrangements or lead to the closure of homes. Group medical director Dr Claire Royston commented: ""Today's news does not change the way we operate or how our homes are run or prompt any change for residents, families, employees and indeed suppliers. ""It marks the latest stage in the group's restructuring process and allows us to move ahead with an orderly, independent sales process."" It is the biggest care home group to have gone into administration since Southern Cross in 2011. Care home operator to withdraw services Brexit: Hospital suppliers stockpiling food Four Seasons has struggled with cuts to local authority care fees and rising costs, and has repeatedly warned about its long-term stability. The GMB union said the government needed to step in urgently to reassure Four Seasons staff and residents. Rehana Azam, GMB national secretary, said: ""The possible collapse of Four Seasons shows our care system is in crisis, it is crumbling beneath us because the funding isn't there."" Four Seasons said it had appointed professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) to handle the administration. While the holding companies - Elli Finance (UK) and Elli Investments - are in administration, the operating companies that run Four Season homes are not. The group said it had secured funding to ensure continuity of care while it seeks a new owner. Four Seasons, which has 322 residential and nursing care homes, has been struggling to restructure its debt pile of more than Â£500m. Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm led by Guy Hands, bought the group in 2012 for Â£825m but has since seen a Â£450m writedown on its investment. It has also ceded control of the group to US hedge fund H/2 Capital Partners, which holds a large amount of its debt. A number of care businesses have run into trouble recently, raising questions about the current funding model for social care. Last year, Allied Healthcare, which supports 13,000 people, said it was struggling with debts, blaming low fees paid by councils. The Care Quality Commission, a regulator,later issued a notice saying it had serious doubts about Allied Healthcare's future. A majority of Four Seasons' operations are funded by the state, with about a fifth of them funded privately. Colletta Smith, consumer affairs correspondent If you live in a Four Seasons care home, the first thing to say is don't panic. It's the job of the administrator to keep things running and try and find a buyer for all the care homes - nothing will change immediately. If your care home is eventually earmarked for closure, your council is responsible for making sure everyone is cared for without any interruptions - you won't be left out on the street. If the local authority pays for some or all of your care bill, it is responsible for finding new accommodation. You can choose another care home yourself, though, as long as it suits your needs and doesn't cost more than the council has agreed to spend. If you pay your own bills, then you'll need to find a new home yourself. But the council may give suggestions and should do a care assessment to make sure you get something suitable. It's also worth knowing that if several residents from the same home want to move together, then the council must try to help them do this, so it's worth asking. If you're not happy with your care during the administration or under a new owner, you should tell the care regulator.

Climate group disappointed by Gove meeting,"Extinction Rebellion members speak after the meeting with Michael Gove Extinction Rebellion says a meeting with Environment Secretary Michael Gove was ""very disappointing"" because he refused to declare a climate emergency. The group -who carried out 10 days of climate change protests across London- met Mr Gove on Tuesday for talks. But its youth representative, 14-year-old Felix Ottaway O'Mahony, said: ""The rebellion has to continue because... our futures are not safe."" Mr Gove said he ""shared their high ideals"" to tackle climate change. Earlier, the group also met shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who promised to engage with the group's demands, but activists said Labour needed to be ""more ambitious"" with its targets. TheWelshandScottishgovernments have both declared a climate emergency, along with dozens of towns and cities, including Manchester and London. There is no single definition of what that means, but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030, and proponents say the situation amounts to an emergency becausethe United Nations has warnedthe world could have just 12 years left to limit a climate change catastrophe. Extinction Rebellion has three main demands: For the government to ""tell the truth"" about the scale of the environmental crisis the world faces For the UK to enact legally binding policies to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 For the government to form a Citizens' Assembly to oversee the changes needed to achieve this Following its large scale protests, a number of the group's representatives went to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to meet Mr Gove, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Robert Jenrick and the prime minister's environmental advisor Lord Randall. Extinction Rebellion: What happened? Can the group's plan work? What is climate change? Mr Gove said the group's first demand was ""on the money"" and agreed there needed to be a deeper level of public understanding over climate change. He also said he was ""open-minded"" about the possibility of citizens' assemblies. But the environment secretary said, while he believed the state of carbon emissions was a ""grave"" one, there were questions around the timescale to reduce them and whether declaring a climate emergency was necessary. ""There is an open question to what the date should be and I am open to a higher level of ambition for this government than we have seen in the past,"" he said. ""We have got to take action and what I would like this government to be judged by is, not what it proclaims, but what it achieves, and there is much more that we need to do."" This video can not be played Environment Secretary Michael Gove says he is ""not a fan of direct action"" Afterwards, Clare Farrell, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, welcomed the ""unexpected levels of interest"" in the idea of citizens' assemblies, but said ultimately the meeting ""resulted in no concrete outcome"". Climate change lawyer Farhana Yamin also praised a pledge by Mr Gove to discuss citizens' assemblies with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and a promise to raise the group's demands with other members of the cabinet. But Sam Knights, who works on Extinction Rebellion's strategy team, said the refusal to declare a climate emergency was ""not only a political failure, but a moral failure"". He added: ""It is important to stress how out of step the current political class is with ordinary people. ""We see this in the democratic deficit we have in this country and it is why we have had to be out on the street in force. It is not something any of us have done lightly but feel is a political necessity. "" This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion: 'No concrete outcome' from talks Following the meeting with Labour, Extinction Rebellion said Mr McDonnell ""acknowledged the failure"" of previous policies to tackle climate change. The group also said he would request a meeting with the entire shadow cabinet for the demands to be presented. However, it said the shadow chancellor did not commit to changing the proposed date in Labour's climate change policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 -  although he agreed to consider a new, more ambitious target of 2030.

Cricketer jailed for raping sleeping woman,"Alex Hepburn was found guilty earlier this month of rape following a retrial A ""foul sexist"" cricketer has been jailed for raping a sleeping woman. Ex-Worcestershire player Alex Hepburn assaulted the victim at his Worcester flat after she had consensual sex with his then teammate Joe Clarke in 2017. The 23-year-old was found guilty of rape earlier this month and sentenced to five years at Hereford Crown Court. Judge Jim Tindal told him the sexual conquest ""game"" he had set up on a WhatsApp group was ""laddish"" behaviour that ""demeaned women"". He told Hepburn he had ""arrogantly"" believed his victim would consent, during the attack. ""You thought you were God's gift to women,"" he said. ""You did see her at that moment as a piece of meat, not a woman entitled to respect."" Hepburnwas found guilty of one count of oral rape and cleared of one rape chargefollowing a retrial at Worcester Crown Court. The woman woke up after a night out on 1 April and wrongly believed she was having sex with Mr Clarke before realising it was actually Hepburn, the trial was told. Hepburn posted rules of the ""stat chat"" game about many women he and Mr Clarke could have sex with on a WhatsApp group a week before the rape. His bid to collect ""as many sexual encounters as possible"" as part of the game was ""foul sexism"", Judge Tindal said. ""It demeaned women and trivialised rape - a word you personally threw around lightly,"" the judge said. ""Only now do you realise how serious rape is."" Latest news from the West Midlands Judge Tindal described Alex Hepburn as ""immature"" In a victim impact statement, read to the court by prosecutor Miranda Moore QC, the woman said she suffered recurring nightmares in the form of ""a repeat of the rape"", which had also led to the collapse of her relationship with her then boyfriend. Describing her ordeal as evil and a ""heinous crime"", she added: ""I take off my hat to anyone who can hold down a healthy happy relationship, after being raped. ""I am flooded with guilt that I can't ever seem to escape."" The trial was told the woman met Mr Clarke in a nightclub before returning to his flat where they had sex. He left his bedroom during the night to be sick and remained passed out in his bathroom. Hepburn found the woman asleep on a mattress after arriving back at the flat ""alone, drunk and frustrated"" and he ""saw a chance"" and attacked her, the court heard, The woman only realised it wasn't Mr Clarke when Hepburn spoke in an Australian accent. Hepburn's barrister, Michelle Heeley QC, said her client had expressed ""true remorse"", adding: ""He has lost everything: his career, his good character and ultimately his liberty.""

Labour's Brexit meeting: What's at stake?,"Tom Watson arrives for a meeting of Labour's National Executive Committee After a meeting of the shadow cabinet and of the party's National Executive Committee, Labour's policy this evening may turn out to be exactly, or almost exactly, the same as it was this morning. But don't assume today's deliberations aren't significant. Allies of Jeremy Corbyn interpret Labour's current policy policy - agreed at the 2018 conference - to mean the party would keep open the option of a ""public vote"" (i.e. a referendum) to avoid ""a bad Tory deal"" or ""no deal"". But Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson is campaigning for a vote on any deal - including one that Jeremy Corbyn might negotiate. An ally of the party leader on the NEC, Claudia Webbe, has denounced Tom Watson as ""divisive"". But, in truth, he is merely highlighting the divisions which are already there. Labour to discuss public vote on Brexit Some Labour MPs in Leave-supporting areas want no mention of a second referendum - a view shared by some of the leader's shadow cabinet allies. Others can live with the current formulation of a heavily caveated commitment to a referendum as a last resort. But the need to fight European elections - taking place on 23 May - has led 34 of the party's candidates to say that this ambiguity is no longer sustainable. Around 100 MPs from across the party agree with them. They want a clear commitment to a referendum under all circumstances. How many Labour supporters voted Leave? What are the Brexit sticking points? For opponents of Jeremy Corbyn there is a bonus too. Polling suggests an overwhelming number of party members back a referendum and want to remain. If Mr Corbyn stands in the way of this, the hope is that some of the newer members on the left will become disillusioned with his leadership. And that hope for his opponents is a fear for some of his backers. Groups such as Love Socialism, Hate Brexit have as their driving force members of the left-wing group Momentum. They believe the project of enthusing younger left-wing voters will stall unless the leadership shifts position on a referendum. From Tom Watson's perspective, even if he loses the argument at the left-dominated NEC, he will have been seen as a champion of the party's grassroots and will have gained the support of some significant trade unions. Labour shadow cabinet ministers have been taking part in cross-party talks with the government over Brexit Some of Jeremy Corbyn's allies, meanwhile, are keen to defeat the position favoured by the party's deputy not just to put him in his box. They believe that defeating a call for a referendum on any deal would allow them to reach agreement with the government in the current Brexit talks. If they can get commitments to workers' rights and something that looks like a customs union, then this would no longer be deemed a ""bad Tory Brexit"" and there would be no need to have a second referendum - which they feel could alienate working class Leave voters. It would also get Brexit settled before the party conference season (and the October deadline set by the EU) and allow the party to relaunch on a platform of ""healing divisions"". There would, of course, be a big rebellion in Labour's ranks but as no option at this stage is a good option, then this might be seen as a price worth paying. Or it might provoke a challenge to the Corbyn leadership. But the last time the party leader was challenged - for what was seen as his lacklustre support for Remain in the 2016 referendum - his supporters rallied round and his opponent, pro-EU Owen Smith, was defeated. So although there may be a wedge between Jeremy Corbyn and some of his left-wing supporters on Europe right now, they may return to his fold if they believe his leadership is seriously in danger. So far though, Brexit has had a range of unintended political consequences so don't rule out the possibility of further dramatic developments. How many Labour supporters voted Leave?

His bid to collect ""as many sexual encounters as possible"" as part of the game was ""foul sexism"", Judge Tindal said. ""It demeaned women and trivialised rape - a word you personally threw around lightly,"" the judge said. ""Only now do you realise how serious rape is."" Latest news from the West Midlands Judge Tindal described Alex Hepburn as ""immature"" In a victim impact statement, read to the court by prosecutor Miranda Moore QC, the woman said she suffered recurring nightmares in the form of ""a repeat of the rape"", which had also led to the collapse of her relationship with her then boyfriend. Describing her ordeal as evil and a ""heinous crime"", she added: ""I take off my hat to anyone who can hold down a healthy happy relationship, after being raped. ""I am flooded with guilt that I can't ever seem to escape."" The trial was told the woman met Mr Clarke in a nightclub before returning to his flat where they had sex. He left his bedroom during the night to be sick and remained passed out in his bathroom. Hepburn found the woman asleep on a mattress after arriving back at the flat ""alone, drunk and frustrated"" and he ""saw a chance"" and attacked her, the court heard, The woman only realised it wasn't Mr Clarke when Hepburn spoke in an Australian accent. Hepburn's barrister, Michelle Heeley QC, said her client had expressed ""true remorse"", adding: ""He has lost everything: his career, his good character and ultimately his liberty.""

Labour's Brexit meeting: What's at stake?What is the significance for Brexit of Labour's meeting of the National Executive Committee?UK Politics,"Tom Watson arrives for a meeting of Labour's National Executive Committee After a meeting of the shadow cabinet and of the party's National Executive Committee, Labour's policy this evening may turn out to be exactly, or almost exactly, the same as it was this morning. But don't assume today's deliberations aren't significant. Allies of Jeremy Corbyn interpret Labour's current policy policy - agreed at the 2018 conference - to mean the party would keep open the option of a ""public vote"" (i.e. a referendum) to avoid ""a bad Tory deal"" or ""no deal"". But Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson is campaigning for a vote on any deal - including one that Jeremy Corbyn might negotiate. An ally of the party leader on the NEC, Claudia Webbe, has denounced Tom Watson as ""divisive"". But, in truth, he is merely highlighting the divisions which are already there. Labour to discuss public vote on Brexit Some Labour MPs in Leave-supporting areas want no mention of a second referendum - a view shared by some of the leader's shadow cabinet allies. Others can live with the current formulation of a heavily caveated commitment to a referendum as a last resort. But the need to fight European elections - taking place on 23 May - has led 34 of the party's candidates to say that this ambiguity is no longer sustainable. Around 100 MPs from across the party agree with them. They want a clear commitment to a referendum under all circumstances. How many Labour supporters voted Leave? What are the Brexit sticking points? For opponents of Jeremy Corbyn there is a bonus too. Polling suggests an overwhelming number of party members back a referendum and want to remain. If Mr Corbyn stands in the way of this, the hope is that some of the newer members on the left will become disillusioned with his leadership. And that hope for his opponents is a fear for some of his backers. Groups such as Love Socialism, Hate Brexit have as their driving force members of the left-wing group Momentum. They believe the project of enthusing younger left-wing voters will stall unless the leadership shifts position on a referendum. From Tom Watson's perspective, even if he loses the argument at the left-dominated NEC, he will have been seen as a champion of the party's grassroots and will have gained the support of some significant trade unions. Labour shadow cabinet ministers have been taking part in cross-party talks with the government over Brexit Some of Jeremy Corbyn's allies, meanwhile, are keen to defeat the position favoured by the party's deputy not just to put him in his box. They believe that defeating a call for a referendum on any deal would allow them to reach agreement with the government in the current Brexit talks. If they can get commitments to workers' rights and something that looks like a customs union, then this would no longer be deemed a ""bad Tory Brexit"" and there would be no need to have a second referendum - which they feel could alienate working class Leave voters. It would also get Brexit settled before the party conference season (and the October deadline set by the EU) and allow the party to relaunch on a platform of ""healing divisions"". There would, of course, be a big rebellion in Labour's ranks but as no option at this stage is a good option, then this might be seen as a price worth paying. Or it might provoke a challenge to the Corbyn leadership. But the last time the party leader was challenged - for what was seen as his lacklustre support for Remain in the 2016 referendum - his supporters rallied round and his opponent, pro-EU Owen Smith, was defeated. So although there may be a wedge between Jeremy Corbyn and some of his left-wing supporters on Europe right now, they may return to his fold if they believe his leadership is seriously in danger. So far though, Brexit has had a range of unintended political consequences so don't rule out the possibility of further dramatic developments. How many Labour supporters voted Leave?

I just ended up broken - Christie,"This video can not be played From April 2019: Christie opens up about anxiety and depression British short track speed skater Elise Christie says she ""ended up broken"" from ""debilitating"" anxiety and depression, but has now recovered. The 28-year-old also revealed she resorted to self-harming as a way of coping with her emotions. In a BBC Sport interview, Christie explained how she is excited about the future having come off antidepressants. ""I want to show people it's OK to feel that way and that it's OK to use medication,"" said the Scot. Last week, Christie used social media to announceshe had taken antidepressants for two yearsbut had since stopped the medication. The three-time Winter Olympian said she developed anxiety afterreceiving death threats at the 2014 Games,and that over the course of the next couple of years various personal issues and injury problems led to depression. ""It was quite debilitating,"" said the triple world champion. ""I was in bed a lot. I was struggling to keep up with normal life. I couldn't get things done. ""I hit a massive low when I got injured in [the last] Olympic season and I just ended up broken."" It was in the summer of 2017 that, after a conversation with a psychologist, she decided to seek further help and was prescribed antidepressants. ""People are scared to say they're on medication. I don't know why but I was the same,"" Christie added. ""But people are on them because they need it. I couldn't function without them at that point. ""People were saying how strong I was the way I handled both Olympics - but I actually wasn't coping and I didn't want to admit that because of how people perceived me. ""Some people feel weak to admit it. But depression is an illness, not just sadness, and I want people to think it is OK to speak about it."" Christie says medication helped her to manage ""dramatic emotions"" in the run-up to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. At the Games in South Korea, she fell in the500m finaland1500m semi-finals,and raced with an injured ankle in the 1,000m heats, whereshe was disqualified. She separated from her boyfriend - Hungarian skater Shaolin Sandor Liu - after the competition and said she reached her lowest ebb. ""At my lowest moment I did self-harm - not badly, but I was still doing it because I didn't know how to cope without it,"" said Christie. ""After everything that had happened - and I was on my own - I just couldn't deal with how I felt any more. ""Because you have a physical pain, I guess it just takes away the emotional pain. I would never have shared that, I wouldn't have wanted anyone to know. ""And that's the point: you can get to these points and you can get out of it - because I have."" Christie says that by speaking out she hopes more people can be more open about mental health and dispel any stigma around the use of medication. ""There is a lot of other athletes going through this. There's a lot of normal, day-to-day people going through the same thing,"" she added. ""It's fine to be on the medication. I felt at times I was never going to get off them or feel better. But I just knew when I was ready to come off the medication, because I was ready to accept the emotions and accept that I was going to feel up and down at points. ""I'm going to feel sad emotions but I told myself I was going to try to focus on the good emotions. And now here I am. ""I'm excited about skating; I'm excited about life. I'm not scared any more."" Self-harm is when somebody intentionally damages or injures their body. It is usually a way of coping with or expressing overwhelming emotional distress. Sometimes when people self-harm, they feel on some level that they intend to die. More than half of people who die by suicide have a history of self-harm. But the intention is more often to punish themselves, express their distress, or relieve unbearable tension. Sometimes it's a mixture of all three. Self-harm can also be a cry for help.

"Japan's Emperor Akihito abdicatesAkihito wishes ""peace and prosperity"" to Japan and the world in his final address as emperor.Asia","This video can not be played The day began with private rituals in the Imperial Palace Japan's Emperor Akihito has declared his abdication in a historic ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. In his last public address as emperor, Akihito handed over the symbols of power and thanked the public for their support during his 30-year reign. The 85-year-old was given permission to abdicate after saying he felt unable to fulfil his role because of his age and declining health. He is the first Japanese monarch to stand down in more than 200 years. Akihito technically remained emperor until midnight (15:00 GMT on Tuesday). His eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, formally ascends the throne later on Wednesday. A new era - called Reiwa, meaning order and harmony - will begin in Japan's unique calendar. The life and reign of Akihito - the human emperor The prince who will take Japan into a new era The abdication in pictures While the emperor holds no political power, he serves as a national figurehead. Akihito has endeared himself to many Japanese people during his reign as he has interacted with those suffering from disease and disaster. In the morning, the emperor took part in a Shinto ceremony to report his plans to the mythological ancestors of Japan's imperial family. The emperor took part in private Shinto ceremonies to start the day The main ""Ceremony of the Abdication"" took place in a state room of the Imperial Palace in front of about 300 people including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Crown Prince Naruhito, and Crown Princess Masako. Imperial chamberlains carried the state and privy seals into the hall, along with a sacred sword and a jewel which are considered symbols of the imperial family. In a short ceremony, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addressed the emperor, saying: ""While keeping in our hearts the path that the emperor has walked, we will make utmost efforts to create a bright future for a proud Japan that is full of peace and hope."" Then, in his final speech as emperor, Akihito, wearing a Western-style morning coat, said he ""wished Japan and the world peace and happiness"". Akihito is the first Japanese emperor to step down in more than 200 years ""I am deeply grateful for the people that accepted me as a symbol and supported me,"" he said. ""I sincerely wish, together with the empress, that the Reiwa era which begins tomorrow will be a stable and fruitful one,"" he added. ""I pray, with all my heart, for peace and happiness for all the people in Japan and around the world."" The Imperial Treasures that make a man an emperor Reiwa: Naming a new era in Japan After helping his wife, Empress Michiko, down the steps of the ceremonial platform, the emperor bowed towards the gathered officials, then left the room. The 85-year-old had surgery for prostate cancer in 2003 and a heart bypass operation in 2012. In a rare speech in 2016, he said that he feared his age would make it hard for him to carry out his duties and strongly hinted that he wanted to stand down. Emperor Akihito's 2016 address to the nation Opinion polls showed that the vast majority of Japan sympathised with him, and a year later parliament enacted a law that made his abdication possible. Prince Naruhito will become Japan's 126th emperor - and will officially lead the country into the new Reiwa era. It will mark the end of the current Heisei era, which began when Akihito ascended the throne in 1989. The 59-year-old crown prince will lead the country into a new era The 59-year-old Oxford University graduate is married to Crown Princess Masako. Their only child, Princess Aiko, was born in 2001. Japan's current law prohibits women from inheriting the throne, so Princess Aiko's uncle Prince Fumihito is now first in line, followed by her cousin, 12-year-old Prince Hisahito. This video can not be played Princess Aiko, the only child of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, will not ascend the throne because she is female The princess, the palace and the shrinking royal line It's the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. Legends date it back to about 600 BC. The emperors used to be seen as gods, but Hirohito - the father of Akihito - publicly renounced his divinity as part of Japan's surrender at the end of World War Two. It was Emperor Akihito who helped repair Japan's post-war reputation. Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko meeting with evacuees after a tsunami in 2011 Previous emperors rarely interacted with the public, but Akihito redefined the role - and has come to be known for his compassion. In 1991, two years after he ascended the throne, Akihito and the empress broke with norms and knelt down to speak to people affected by a volcanic eruption in Nagasaki. Akihito also took up the role of a diplomat, becoming an unofficial ambassador for Japan and travelling abroad extensively. While Tuesday's was the first Japanese abdication in 200 years, it wasn't so rare historically. According to Japan's state broadcaster NHK, about half the country's emperors or empresses have done the same, and it happened frequently from the 8th Century to the 19th Century. The Golden Week break - Japan's annual spring holiday - has been extended to a record 10 days to mark the occasion. When Emperor Akihito succeeded his late father, the country was in mourning, but this time people will be going on holidays, to cinemas, or staying at home to watch the events on TV. Many said they would miss the departing emperor, who will now hold the title ""Joko"", which means ""grand emperor"" or  ""Emperor Emeritus"". ""I think the emperor is loved by the people,"" Morio Miyamoto told Reuters news agency. ""His image is one of encouraging the people, such as after disasters, and being close to the people."" ""The emperor worked very hard for 30 years so I hope the handing over of the baton to the new emperor will go smoothly,"" Mikiko Fujii told the agency. ""I'm sad but also hopeful about the next era. I hope it will be a peaceful, gentle period for the second half of my life,"" said Masatoshi Kujirai, on his way to a Shinto shrine to mark the day. Watch: Akihito leaves the throne.

Japan's current law prohibits women from inheriting the throne, so Princess Aiko's uncle Prince Fumihito is now first in line, followed by her cousin, 12-year-old Prince Hisahito. This video can not be played Princess Aiko, the only child of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, will not ascend the throne because she is female The princess, the palace and the shrinking royal line It's the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. Legends date it back to about 600 BC. The emperors used to be seen as gods, but Hirohito - the father of Akihito - publicly renounced his divinity as part of Japan's surrender at the end of World War Two. It was Emperor Akihito who helped repair Japan's post-war reputation. Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko meeting with evacuees after a tsunami in 2011 Previous emperors rarely interacted with the public, but Akihito redefined the role - and has come to be known for his compassion. In 1991, two years after he ascended the throne, Akihito and the empress broke with norms and knelt down to speak to people affected by a volcanic eruption in Nagasaki. Akihito also took up the role of a diplomat, becoming an unofficial ambassador for Japan and travelling abroad extensively. While Tuesday's was the first Japanese abdication in 200 years, it wasn't so rare historically. According to Japan's state broadcaster NHK, about half the country's emperors or empresses have done the same, and it happened frequently from the 8th Century to the 19th Century. The Golden Week break - Japan's annual spring holiday - has been extended to a record 10 days to mark the occasion. When Emperor Akihito succeeded his late father, the country was in mourning, but this time people will be going on holidays, to cinemas, or staying at home to watch the events on TV. Many said they would miss the departing emperor, who will now hold the title ""Joko"", which means ""grand emperor"" or  ""Emperor Emeritus"". ""I think the emperor is loved by the people,"" Morio Miyamoto told Reuters news agency. ""His image is one of encouraging the people, such as after disasters, and being close to the people."" ""The emperor worked very hard for 30 years so I hope the handing over of the baton to the new emperor will go smoothly,"" Mikiko Fujii told the agency. ""I'm sad but also hopeful about the next era. I hope it will be a peaceful, gentle period for the second half of my life,"" said Masatoshi Kujirai, on his way to a Shinto shrine to mark the day. Watch: Akihito leaves the throne.

"Mothers 'ignored' at Welsh valleys hospitalsMothers speaking to the Cwm Taf maternity review ""overwhelmingly"" had distressing experiences.","This video can not be played Jessica Western says she is still fighting to find out why her daughter Macie died The full extent of the problems with maternity services at two hospitals in the south Wales valleys rings out when the voices of women and families are listened to. ""Overwhelmingly"" mothers faced ""distressing experiences and poor care"", the review team found. As one said: ""I want having a baby to be a good experience. It's ruined it."" Women repeatedly stated they were not listened to and their concerns were not taken seriously or valued. They spoke of being ignored or patronisedwhile being cared for at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. Often, their suspicions and concerns were found to have reflected a genuine problem that emerged later, but at the time they were dismissed when they tried to voice their concerns. Amajor independent reviewhas found Cwm Taf health board's maternity services were ""under extreme pressure"" and the health minister has ordered them be put into special measures. It was prompted by 25 serious incidents, including eight stillbirths and four neonatal deaths, between January 2016 and last September. The independent review team has releaseda separate, damning 78-page report,,externalwhich shares the views of 140 family members, including mothers about their experiences at the hospitals. Nearly two thirds of women questioned felt they had not had good quality care during their pregnancy. Cwm Taf maternity services put in special measures Gething rejects quit call over Cwm Taf Q&A: What's the background at Cwm Taf? The review said: ""Many women had felt something was wrong with their baby or tried to convey the level of pain they were experiencing but they were ignored or patronised, and no action was taken, with tragic outcomes including stillbirth and neonatal death of their babies."" One woman said she felt worthless, adding: ""I'm broken from the whole experience, the lack of care and compassion."" On the care itself, repeatedly the review team heard from mothers who did not always believe the right level of skills and expertise were available at the right time. There was a failure to seek a second, more senior opinion, and to escalate concerns, especially with women with complex pregnancies. One mother said: ""He told me there was no point calling the consultant on a Sunday as no one would come."" Another said: ""I never saw the same consultant. They didn't know me, and they didn't want to know me. I was pushed in and out of rooms with all sorts of people."" Mothers faced too many variables in the service offered - from the time of day they used it, to staffing levels and the communication skills of the staff they met. This video can not be played 'We picked the wrong day to be ill' The case of Sarah Handy Sarah Handy's experience is highlighted in the report as illustrating a number of serious issues. In pain, she was begging to see a doctor when she arrived in hospital in April 2017 and was left for nearly three hours without examination before being told it was constipation. Ms Handy, 33, was sent back home to Merthyr Tydfil with laxatives and pain relief and that evening her baby Jennifer was delivered prematurely by her husband and mother-in-law. Despite their efforts to give CPR to save her life, Jennifer died. The review said it showed: Inadequate levels of expertise in managing high risk pregnancies Failure to listen to women and to understand the level of pain being experienced and reported Lack of response to ""red flags"" and failure to follow good practice and pathways of care Failure to call for a second, more senior, opinion Failure to support the woman after the tragic and traumatic loss of her baby. Ms Handy said after the report came out: ""Today it's been proven in black and white that we were right to highlight our concerns and push for further investigation into our Jennifer's death. ""We just wish that this report will now do what it promised and improve the quality of care so that no other family has to go the traumatic experience we went through."" On communication, although individual staff were spoken of as excellent, many women felt during their care this aspect was extremely poor. When concerns were raised, there was a ""significant dissatisfaction"" with how they were dealt with, with dismissive attitudes. Many women were not listened to or taken seriously, one saying she was ""laughed at"" when she expressed concern. Other responses included: ""I was never asked, never believed. ""If only they had asked the right questions. ""Most importantly, we were not listened to. By the time we were it was too late."" The review said women reported an ""almost callous and brutal use of language"" and disregard for feelings. Cwm Taf told to 'get back on track' 26 baby deaths in maternity probe When one mother was concerned that she may be losing her baby she was told to ""prepare for the worst - it could be a miscarriage"" and then told to go home as ""there wasn't a lot she could do."" Younger mothers in particular often felt their concerns were dismissed, which became an ""emerging theme"" for the review team. There were failures to apologise, lack of access to notes and comprehensive investigations over concerns. With high risk pregnancies, one woman interviewed believed that there was a lack of expertise and that ""anything different from the norm, they didn't seem set up to deal with it"". Another described the antenatal clinic as being ""like a cattle-market"". When babies were lost, ""many women and families received no bereavement counselling or support and continue to experience emotional distress"". But staffing shortages were recognised. One mother talking about the demand on midwives and doctors in the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, said it was ""no way a reflection on them"". ""They would always spend as much time as possible with me but unfortunately when needs must I was left with some questions but again this was due to staff shortages,"" she said. Another said: ""There were so many jobs for one midwife to do and then people wonder why mistakes get made. They are human and are exhausted"". The review published two parallel reports into Cwm Taf maternity services and the experiences of mothers The review team said it was disappointing that lessons had not been learnt from a review of Furness General Hospital services four years ago. Prof Jean White, chief nursing officer, said: ""It should be a joyous occasion giving birth to a child. Many of the women who shared their stories had care well below the standards we expect and that's not right. ""I think over time there appears to be a culture that has developed rather than an open culture where people are encouraged to say what's gone wrong, there is a blame culture."" In the words of another parent: ""Listen to women and families and believe what they tell you when they are in pain."" The review team concludes: ""The strong message heard from women and families in Cwm Taf is that they don't want their experiences to happen to anyone else and the importance to them that the organisation learns from these experiences to ensure that improvement and change occurs."" Cwm Taf chief executive Allison Williams said she was deeply sorry, is taking the findings very seriously but recognised ""significant work"" was still needed.

Venezuela's GuaidÃ³ in 'attempted coup',"This video can not be played Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ is appealing to the military for support Venezuelan authorities say they are putting down a small coup attempt after opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ announced he was in the ""final phase"" of ending President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's rule. He appeared in a video with uniformed men, saying he had military support. Mr GuaidÃ³, who declared himself interim president in January, called for more members of the military to help him end Mr Maduro's ""usurpation"" of power. But military leaders appeared to be standing behind Mr Maduro. Venezuela's defence minister appeared on television to stress the point. However, photos from Caracas show some soldiers aligning themselves with Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro Venezuela crisis: The bridge of desperation Mr Maduro's detractors hope the military will change its allegiance as resentment grows following years of hyperinflation, power cuts, food and medicine shortages. So far, the armed forces have stood by Mr Maduro - despite dozens of countries, including the UK, the US and most of Latin America, recognising Mr GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's rightful leader. As a result, John Bolton, the US national security adviser, said what was taking place in Venezuela was not a coup, but a legitimate leader trying to take control. Protesters supporting both sides have gathered at different points in the capital, Caracas. There are running clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles. Protesters were also seen throwing rocks, but being repelled by tear gas and water cannon. Television cameras also caught the moment armoured vehicles drove into a crowd but it is unclear if there were any injuries. El Universal newspaper said that at least 37 people had been injured across Caracas. The BBC's Guillermo Olmo, in Caracas, said Tuesday marked the most violent episode of the Venezuelan political crisis so far. Juan GuaidÃ³'s supporters from the Bolivarian National Guard repel forces loyal to NicolÃ¡s Maduro Meanwhile, Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said the uprising by some members of the military had been ""partly defeated"", but warned of possible bloodshed. ""The weapons of the republic are here to defend the nation's sovereignty and independence,"" he warned. He also revealed one soldier had suffered a bullet wound. A three-minute video by Mr GuaidÃ³ was published in the early hours of Tuesday. In it, he announced he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. ""The National Armed Forces have taken the correct decision... they are guaranteed to be on the right side of history,"" he said. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. He was filmed alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who has been under house arrest since being found guilty of inciting violence during anti-government protests in 2014. Mr LÃ³pez, who leads the Popular Will party of which Mr GuaidÃ³ is a member, said he had been freed by members of the military. He went on to urge Venezuelans to join them on the streets. But later in the day, Chile's Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed he, his wife Lilian Tintori and their daughter had entered Chile's embassy in Caracas to seek protection. A timeline of Venezuela's leadership clash The bus driver who became president Mr GuaidÃ³, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has been calling on the military to back him ever since he declared himself interim president. He argues that President Maduro is a ""usurper"" because he was re-elected in polls that had been widely disputed. The video appeared to have been recorded at dawn in or near La Carlota air force base in Caracas. This video can not be played Venezuela blackout crisis: ""It's like living in the apocalypse"" Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus Events in Venezuela are uncertain and unclear but Mr GuaidÃ³ has seemingly gambled heavily in his latest bid for power. The loyalty of the military to President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's regime has been the central factor that has kept him in power. Barring a fundamental change in their allegiance or at the very least a significant split in their ranks, no amount of outside diplomatic pressure is going to push Mr Maduro from office. So are we seeing this split now? Mr GuaidÃ³ and his supporters claim parts of the military across the country have backed him, but so far there is little evidence of this. For Mr GuaidÃ³ the stakes are huge. The Venezuelan government says it is putting down a coup attempt. This is perhaps the most dramatic moment yet in Venezuela's current political saga. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? Venezuela blackout: 'Like living in the apocalypse' Venezuela crisis in nine charts The Venezuelan Information Minister, Jorge RodrÃ­guez, wrote on Twitter that the government was confronting a small group of ""military traitors"" who, according to him, were promoting a coup. Mr Maduro, meanwhile, said he had spoken to the leaders of the armed forces who had ""expressed their total loyalty to the People, the Constitution and the Fatherland"". A senior member of the governing socialist party, Diosdado Cabello,called on supporters of President Maduro to take to the streets around the presidential palace to defend him from ""the right-wing conspiracy"",external. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told Reuters news agency the ""coup attempt"" had been ""directly planned in Washington, in the Pentagon and Department of State, and by [National Security Advisor John] Bolton"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for both sides to avoid violence US Secretary of StateMike Pompeo sent a tweet backing Mr GuaidÃ³,external. ""The U.S. Government fully supports the Venezuelan people in their quest for freedom and democracy,"" he wrote Mr Bolton warned Mr Maduro not to use force against civilians Spain warned against bloodshed and said was ""not supporting any military coup"". Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro - who backs Mr GuaidÃ³ - has called an emergency meeting with his defence minister, foreign minister and vice-president. Colombian President IvÃ¡n Duque called on the Venezuelan army to back Mr GuaidÃ³ Bolivia's President Evo Morales and Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno RodrÃ­guez have sent messages of support to their ally Mr Maduro, condemning what they called the ""coup d'etat"" in Venezuela.

Infected blood inquiry hearings begin,"This video can not be played ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would"" A public inquiry into what has been called ""the worst treatment scandal in the history of the NHS"" is to start taking evidence on Tuesday. Some 4,800 people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. More than 2,000 are thought to have died. Thousands more may have been exposed through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth. One victim's widow says she wants ""justice"" and people held to account. Su Gorman's husband, Steve Dymond, died aged 62 on 23 December last year of organ failure - ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man. Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme in April 2018, Steve said: ""It's not the life I imagined in terms of dreams, in terms of ambitions. ""It's become a life of sickness, illness, worry, anxiety. ""When I talk about my wife, I talk about her as my widow in waiting."" Aged eight, Matt (pictured) was given blood products contaminated with HIV -when he found out, he couldn't tell a soul Liz married twice -the same NHS scandal killed both her husbands Steve was born in 1956 with a mild form of haemophilia, a genetic condition that prevents blood from clotting properly. He played rugby at school and studied Russian at university where he met his wife, Su, waiting on a train platform. ""He had a massive bruise on his thigh the size of a postcard and it worried me,"" she remembers. ""Steve was not in the habit of getting treatment, so he said he would get it checked out. That was the first time they injected him with a 'wonder drug' called Factor VIII."" Steve and Su on their wedding day At the time that new drug was made from the pooled blood plasma of tens of thousands of donors. In the 1970s and 1980s, the NHS was importing Factor VIII from the US, where high-risk groups like prisoners were paid to give blood. The first sign that something was very wrong came in about 1983. Reports of a new form of cancer started to emerge, first in the gay community then among other groups like haemophiliacs. Around this time, Steve had a minor accident and went to the local hospital to get it checked out. Factor VIII was imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s ""The young registrar took a packet off the shelf and treated him with Factor VIII. The bruise disappeared after an hour, so it was totally unnecessary,"" said Su. ""Shortly after, they called him back and said he had been exposed to HIV."" The testing process took 18 months - an ""absolutely terrifying"" period. Some 1,200 British haemophiliacs were infected with HIV in this way, including many young children of primary school age. Only 250 are still alive today. Steve was one of the lucky ones. ""It was a huge relief. He was told he was clear of the HIV but no mention was made of the Hepatitis C at that point,"" says Su. Hepatitis C is a virus now thought to affect more than 150 million people, some 2% of the world population. Yet it was not discovered and named until 1989. It was not until 1993, then living and working in France, that Steve was told he had the condition. At the time the couple were trying again for a baby. They were immediately taken off the IVF programme. Steve Dymond died in December of organ failure, ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man ""Steve was told bluntly that the [possible] consequences were liver cirrhosis, cancer, a transplant, premature death,"" says Su. ""Within 24 hours [of diagnosis] we found out we would never have children and that he was going to die early."" It was only in 2013 that a new drug was approved that could successfully eliminate the Hepatitis C virus from Steve's body. By then, though, the damage was already done. Scans showed his liver was cirrhotic and a bunch of cells showed the early signs of cancer. His health declined quickly in the last 18 months of his life. This video can not be played Steve Dymond speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in April last year In late December 2018 he woke at home coughing up blood. ""They took him to intensive care. He knew I was there and he said to me, 'I love you',"" says Su. ""The last thing he said was he wanted those who had done this to him to repent. Then at one in the morning, as he was holding my hand, he left me."" A public inquiry into the scandal was first announced in July 2017. Since then, campaign groups estimate that more than 150 infected haemophiliacs like Steve have died. The inquiry will consider evidence from approximately 2,500 people, most of whom were infected with, or affected by, contaminated blood products such as Factor VIII or IX. Victims and relatives want to know why warnings about the safety of the medicine may have been ignored, why plans to make the UK self-sufficient in blood products were scrapped, and why many documents and patient records appear to have been lost or destroyed. The inquiry, led by retired judge Sir Brian Langstaff, could last for more than two years. Ahead of the public hearings, the government announced more financial support for people in England affected by the tragedy, to a total of Â£75m from Â£46m. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The contaminated blood scandal was a tragedy that should never have happened and has caused unimaginable pain and hurt for victims and their families for decades. ""I know this will be a difficult time for victims and their families - but today will begin a journey which will be dedicated to getting to the truth of what happened and in delivering justice to everyone involved."" ""I want to see justice,"" says Su. ""I want to see people called to account, I want to see anybody found to have behaved inappropriately, criminally or negligently made to explain themselves. ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would, and that's a promise I intend to keep.""

Trump sues banks amid finance inquiry,"Mr Trump's three eldest children. Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr, also joined the lawsuit US President Donald Trump has sued two banks in a bid to stop them handing over his financial records to Congress. The lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One was filed after Democrat-led committees issued subpoenas for information on his finances. His three eldest children and the Trump Organisation joined the lawsuit, which argues there are no legitimate grounds for investigating his business affairs. Leading Democrats said they would not be deterred by the blocking attempt. A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman told the New York Times: ""We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations,external"" There was no immediate comment from Capital One. The lawsuit was filed in New York on Monday and aims to block the banks from complying with the subpoenas issued by the Democrat-controlled Congress, which is investigating the Trump family's financial dealings. Both banks are involved with Mr Trump's real estate projects. Trump financial disclosure: What did we learn? Eight legal headaches for Trump What happened to fears over Trump's business? The filing says the subpoenas ""have no legitimate or lawful purpose"". ""[They] were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the president and his family,"" it alleges. It adds: ""No grounds exist to establish any purpose other than a political one."" The filing also says that Democrats are hoping ""they will stumble upon something they can expose publicly and use as a political tool against the President"". The House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees issued subpoenas to Germany's Deutsche Bank, which is one of the Trump Organisation's major lenders, and a number of other financial institutions earlier this month. The committees are reportedly seeking documents and materials relating to the bank's longstanding relationship with Mr Trump and his family. Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the subpoenas were part of an investigation ""into allegations of potential foreign influence on the US political process"". Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly ordered Deutsche Bank to provide records of Mr Trump's accounts Mr Schiff and fellow Democrat Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the Financial Services Commission,  described the lawsuit as ""meritless"". ""[It shows] the depths to which President Trump will go to obstruct Congress's constitutional oversight authority,"" they said in a joint statement. ""He will find that Congress will not be deterred from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities,"" it adds. In 2017, the bank rejected requests by Democrats in the House of Representatives to provide details of the president's finances, citing privacy laws. That year it was also reported that special counsel Robert Mueller, who ledthe investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, had ordered Deutsche Bank to provide records of Mr Trump's accounts.

Face and genitals 'not for donation',"Some body parts - such as the face, ovaries and testicles - should be excluded from the new presumed consent organ donation system coming into force in England next year, proposals say. From 2020, adults will be considered to be in favour of donating after death unless they have opted out. A new consultation document lists which organs and tissues are allowed to be taken under this system. People have until 22 July togive their views on the proposals,external. Organs and tissues that can be taken without extra consent under the new system include: â¢ heart (whole organ or for heart valves) â¢ lungs â¢ liver â¢ kidneys â¢ pancreas â¢ intestinal organs (small bowel, stomach, abdominal wall, colon, spleen) â¢ eye â¢ nervous tissue â¢ arteries/veins/blood vessels â¢ bone â¢ muscle â¢ tendon â¢ skin â¢ rectus fascia (tissue that encases abdominal muscles) Ones that would need explicit permission include: â¢ brain â¢ spinal cord â¢ face â¢ nose â¢ mouth â¢ trachea (windpipe) â¢ arm â¢ upper arm â¢ forearm â¢ hand â¢ finger â¢ leg â¢ thigh â¢ lower leg â¢ foot â¢ toe â¢ ovary â¢ uterus â¢ penis â¢ testicle â¢ foetus â¢ placenta â¢ umbilical cord â¢ embryo (inside the body) â¢ eye cells that will be used to make medicinal products â¢ liver cells that will be used to make medicinal products â¢ pancreatic cells that will be used to make medicinal products Currently, in England, there is a voluntary opt-in scheme. Presumed consent has been operating in Wales since December 2015. When the new system starts in England, the family of the deceased will always be consulted first and they will still be able to provide information on their loved one's wishes. If they have information that their loved one would not have wanted to donate their organs or tissues, organ donation will not go ahead. You can register your choices on theNHS Organ Donor Register.,external From spring 2020, presumed consent will happen unless: an individual has said they don't want to donate their organs by ""opting out"" of the system they have appointed a representative to decide for them after their death they are in one of the excluded groups - under the age of 18, ordinarily resident in England for less than 12 months before their death, or lacking mental capacity for a significant period before their death If you don't opt out, it doesn't mean your tissues and organs will automatically be used. Organ donation can happen in only a small number of cases - when there is a good match between the donor and the recipient. You shouldn't opt out if you consent to donate some of your organs or tissue. If you opt out, you will be recording that you do not want to donate any of your organs or tissue, and opting out of donation completely. Every day, across the UK, three people who could have benefited from a transplant die because there aren't enough donors, while 6,000 are still waiting, NHS Blood and Transplant says. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Our priority is to improve the number of life-saving organ transplants that can take place - and we expect Max and Keira's law, which comes into effect next year, to save hundreds of lives each year. ""As set out in our consultation, we are proposing that the system for rare or experimental transplants - which requires express consent from relatives - remains the same under the new legislation.""

Passenger heard about plane alert on Twitter,"Passengers who were on the flight were moved to a holding room area at Glasgow Airport A plane at the centre of a security alert at Glasgow Airport was found to have nothing suspicious on board. All flights were suspended to and from Glasgow Airport after the crew on the aircraft, which had just landed from Gatwick, raised the alarm at 10:25. Initial reports suggested the incident, which shut the runway for 30 minutes, was linked to a suspect package. Police later confirmed a search of the aircraft delivered a ""negative result"" but inquiries are ongoing. Passenger James Gale said he was not aware of any problem on board until he checked Twitter. The 21-year-old, from Brighton, told BBC Scotland: ""No one seemed aware of anything, not visibly to me anyway. ""The captain just said that we were waiting for a stand. ""It was only from looking in Twitter that I found out."" Police Scotland officers responded to the alert on the Easyjet flight When the plane stopped there was an announcement to say there was an incident on board. Mr Gale added: ""The captain said there was a security incident but not on our plane, and then when we were stopped, he announced that it was our plane, and that we needed to get onto the buses and head to where we are still at now."" He said the passengers were then taken off the plane and escorted to what one person later described on social media as a ""survivor evacuation room"". Mr Gale said he did not see anyone being arrested and confirmed police were taking personal details from passengers before they were permitted to go on their way. A spokesman from Glasgow Airport confirmed that the incident had ended and the runway reopened just before 11:00. Police Scotland said officers were made aware of a security incident by the flight crew. A force spokeswoman said: ""All passengers from the affected flight have been spoken to by officers and able to continue their journeys. ""The plane has been searched with a negative result and nothing has been found. ""The circumstances surrounding the nature of the security alert will continue to be investigated."" Emergency services surrounded the plane An EasyJet spokeswoman said: ""EasyJet can confirm that passengers on flight EZY883 from London Gatwick to Glasgow were delayed disembarking on arrival in Glasgow, purely as a precaution, due to additional security checks. ""The passengers have been disembarked and taken into the terminal. ""The safety and security of its passengers and crew is always EasyJet's highest priority and we would like to thank passengers for their understanding.""

Man arrested over double freezer murder,"The entrance to the block has been cordoned off while investigations take place A murder inquiry is under way after two women's bodies were found inside a freezer at a flat in east London. Officers found the human remains when they were called to Vandome Close in Canning Town. The women have not been formally identified and post-mortem examinations have not yet taken place. Two men, aged 50 and 34, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Both remain in custody at London police stations. They were arrested at two separate addresses in west and east London, both of which are being searched by police. The Metropolitan Police said it was trying to identify both victims and contact their next of kin as a ""priority"". The family of 37-year-old Mary-Jane Mustafa, who has been missing since May 2018, have gathered at the scene in Canning Town. Her sister Mel Mustafa, 47, said: ""She is the most kind-hearted person you could meet and I still don't believe it's her."" Cousin Ceylan Sunda, 53, added: ""The family's upside down. We don't even know for sure yet."" Officers were called to the address at 11:45 BST on Friday following concerns for the welfare of a male resident. Det Supt Paul Monk said a ""large crime scene"" was in place and expected to remain ""for some time"".

Church pays ÃÂ£1m to three abused siblings,"Ian Samson attacked the children at the Lord and Lady Polwarth Children's Home in Edinburgh Three siblings sexually abused by a care home worker have secured Â£1m in damages from the Church of Scotland. The two men and one woman were targeted by paedophile Ian Samson at Lord and Lady Polwarth Children's Home in Edinburgh. A court previously heard the victims were assaulted during a campaign of abuse that spanned three decades The Church expressed ""deep and sincere regret"" for the trauma experienced by the children. Samson was later jailed for 14 years after being found guilty of 22 serious sexual assaults. Samson was jailed for 14 years After raising a legal action last year with Digby Brown Solicitors, the woman - who was forced to undergo an abortion when she became pregnant after being raped - secured Â£500,000 from the Kirk. Her two brothers each received Â£250,000. The compensation is the most ever known to have been recovered from a religious body in Scotland. In a joint statement, the siblings said: ""Samson was evil and robbed us of our childhood and our future. ""Our case has never been about the money - raising a civil action in the courts was the only way we could get any sort of acknowledgement from the Church of Scotland. ""It's a shame that an organisation which promotes 'goodness and morals' can't do the right thing themselves and hold their hands up and apologise rather than force victims to go endure further legal proceedings. ""We nearly gave up so many times in getting the Kirk to accept responsibility so we're delighted this is now over and have the justice and closure we need to get on with life as best we can."" The statement concluded with a message for fellow victims. It said: ""To anyone else affected by abuse - be strong and step forward. You can get closure and together we can all make a difference."" Samson worked at Lord and Lady Polwarth as a superintendent alongside his wife, who was a matron. His offending was carried out between the 1970s and 1990s. Lawyers said some victims hid in cupboards or dog baskets to avoid the abuse and those who could not escape Samson were subjected to violent physical and sexual attacks. In 2013 he was jailed for 14 years at the High Court in Edinburgh after being found guilty of offences involving sexual abuse and the rape of 12 children. Eight of these offences happened at the Kirk-run care home with others occurring at different locations across Edinburgh and the Lothians. Kim Leslie, specialist abuse lawyer and partner at Digby Brown Solicitors, led the civil action against the Kirk on the grounds of vicarious liability. She said: ""Ian Samson was rightly jailed for abuse he inflicted upon children after exploiting his position with the Church of Scotland. ""The significant sum secured for our clients also gives you an idea of just how extreme Ian Samson was and how horrifically our clients suffered - in terms of settlements made public against religious groups, this is certainly the highest value I'm aware of in the 20 years I've practised law. ""Sadly, there will be other brave survivors who have fallen victim to similar campaigns of abuse and to them I would say stay strong, keep going and when you're ready to talk or take action then there's a wealth of support for you when the time is right."" A Church of Scotland spokeswoman said: ""The abuses perpetrated by Ian Samson at Lord and Lady Polwarth Home in the 1970s are matters which have been examined by the criminal courts and by the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry and for which we have expressed our deep and sincere regret. ""We became aware of the full facts in 2013 at which point we offered our full support to the victims. ""While Samson's abuse of children was wider than his activity in Lord and Lady Polwarth Home, it felt important to us that there was full acknowledgment of the harm which did occur in our care at the time, and the longer-term consequences for three siblings involved."" The spokeswoman said the Church had carried out a full independent review of the circumstances so it could learn lessons for its safeguarding practices today. The statement concluded: ""Whilst this settlement can never undo what has been done, we hope that it finally brings a sense of justice to the individuals affected and provides some small redress for the trauma which they experienced while in our care."" The sum recovered from the Kirk emerged following the opening last week of a Â£10mredress scheme for abuse survivors. It will be available to people who have a terminal illness or are aged 70 or over and has been introduced ahead of a wider payment scheme that is due to open in 2021. Janine Rennie, chief executive of Wellbeing Scotland, said she hopes the compensation opens the floodgates for survivors to come forward but acknowledged money cannot compensate for a life of abuse. She told BBC Scotland: ""I think there should be multi-millions for every survivor who's been abused in a care setting. ""For many of the people we're working with, they're unable to work and that can be through physical health issues or mental health issues. ""Many suffer from complex PTSD and that means a lot are unable to leave their house."" Ms Rennie said around two thirds have been unable to achieve any kind of employment at all and many didn't have an education. She added: ""How do you compensate for that and how do you compensate for a survivor who from morning to night in their life wants to complete suicide? ""For many of the survivors in this situation it'll be too late because many of them will have already completed suicide or many will have died natural causes."" Ms Rennie said she has worked with 2,500 people who were abused in care but stressed that is only the people who have come forward. She described the true scale of the problem as ""potentially massive"".

Packham gets 'calculated' death threatTV presenter Chris Packham says he was sent a list of threats including an organised car crash or poisoning.,"This video can not be played Chris Packham tells Victoria Derbyshire: ""They threatened to organise a car crash"" TV presenter Chris Packham has said he received a ""very calculated"" death threat against him and his family after he campaigned for measures to protect birds from being shot. It comes after Natural England revoked licences for controlling 16 species of bird. Packham said the threat outlined ""a list of things they might do"" including organising a car crash or poisoning. He also condemned Facebook for not removing posts containing his address. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation said it does ""not condone any illegal behaviour. And for people to continue to behave in such a manner is utterly unacceptable"". The presenter told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he received the threat last night, and had reported it to Hampshire Police. ""In the structure of its composition it's designed to elicit as much fear as possible,"" he said. ""They're principally just saying, 'You will never be safe, you will never be able to go out, we will always be there.'"" Packham's campaign group Wild Justice has challenged the general licences that allow farmers to shoot birds including carrion crows, wood pigeons, and magpies that damage crops or attack livestock. Individuals can still apply to Natural England - the government's adviser for the natural environment in England - for individual licences to shoot the birds. The move provoked criticism from farmers' groups and others. The National Farmers' Union has said it has ""significant concerns"" about the sudden withdrawal of general licences. ""They are absolutely necessary at this time of year when crops are particularly vulnerable to pests. For example, a flock of pigeons could decimate a farmer's field of crops,"" its deputy president Guy Smith has said. ""It is incredibly disappointing that farmers and growers find themselves in this position, particularly at this time of year."" Packham has also faced criticism from those who say failing to control the crow population could endanger some of Britain's rarest birds, because the crows raid their nests and steal eggs and chicks. Last week, two dead crows were hung on Packham's garden gate, and the presenter said charities and organisations he works with have also been ""bombarded by bullies"". But he told Victoria Derbyshire that the movement against him had been driven by ""fake news"". The aim of his campaign, he said, had been to stop those ""who go out with the sole purpose of killing [birds] for pleasure"". He said it would not ""make it any more difficult for farmers to be able to control animals that they might consider a pest"", but that they would now have to show ""they have explored every other means of control"" - such as scaring the birds or using netting - before being permitted to shoot them. Chris Packham's apparent address has been published in a social media post He said threats would not stop him from continuing his conservation work. ""People like myself are very dogged and determined,"" he said. ""I cannot allow these things to sway me. There are too few people standing up and fighting to protect our environment, our landscape, our wildlife."" Packham also criticised Facebook, on which his home address is posted alongside ""invitations to send me dead animals and all sorts of other things"". He said this amounted to ""incitement to violence"", and he had tried to have it removed. But, he added, Facebook ""are extremely resistant to these sorts of things"". Facebook said in a statement: ""There is absolutely no place on Facebook for threatening behaviour which includes disclosing someone's personal information. ""We have investigated and removed several posts for breaking our community standards and sharing Mr Packham's address.""

Glasgow Airport reopens after security alertThe runway was closed for 30 minutes after a suspicious package was reported on an Easyjet flight which landed from Gatwick.Scotland,"Passengers who were on the flight were moved to a holding room area at Glasgow Airport A plane at the centre of a security alert at Glasgow Airport was found to have nothing suspicious on board. All flights were suspended to and from Glasgow Airport after the crew on the aircraft, which had just landed from Gatwick, raised the alarm at 10:25. Initial reports suggested the incident, which shut the runway for 30 minutes, was linked to a suspect package. Police later confirmed a search of the aircraft delivered a ""negative result"" but inquiries are ongoing. Passenger James Gale said he was not aware of any problem on board until he checked Twitter. The 21-year-old, from Brighton, told BBC Scotland: ""No one seemed aware of anything, not visibly to me anyway. ""The captain just said that we were waiting for a stand. ""It was only from looking in Twitter that I found out."" Police Scotland officers responded to the alert on the Easyjet flight When the plane stopped there was an announcement to say there was an incident on board. Mr Gale added: ""The captain said there was a security incident but not on our plane, and then when we were stopped, he announced that it was our plane, and that we needed to get onto the buses and head to where we are still at now."" He said the passengers were then taken off the plane and escorted to what one person later described on social media as a ""survivor evacuation room"". Mr Gale said he did not see anyone being arrested and confirmed police were taking personal details from passengers before they were permitted to go on their way. A spokesman from Glasgow Airport confirmed that the incident had ended and the runway reopened just before 11:00. Police Scotland said officers were made aware of a security incident by the flight crew. A force spokeswoman said: ""All passengers from the affected flight have been spoken to by officers and able to continue their journeys. ""The plane has been searched with a negative result and nothing has been found. ""The circumstances surrounding the nature of the security alert will continue to be investigated."" Emergency services surrounded the plane An EasyJet spokeswoman said: ""EasyJet can confirm that passengers on flight EZY883 from London Gatwick to Glasgow were delayed disembarking on arrival in Glasgow, purely as a precaution, due to additional security checks. ""The passengers have been disembarked and taken into the terminal. ""The safety and security of its passengers and crew is always EasyJet's highest priority and we would like to thank passengers for their understanding.""

Born in LA, Singleton was considered a trailblazer for African-American directors in the 1990s. In 1992, he became the first African-American filmmaker to be nominated for the best director Oscar with his debut feature Boyz N The Hood. Fresh out of college, he also became the youngest ever director to be nominated for the accolade. He received a second nomination for best original screenplay for the film. Early on Monday, the director's family announced they had taken the ""agonising decision"" to remove him from life-support. ""We are grateful to his fans, friends and colleagues for the outpour of love and prayers during this incredibly difficult time,"" they said. ""We want to thank all the doctors at Cedars Sinai for the impeccable care he received."" Boyz N The Hood starred Ice Cube (left) and focused on inner-city violence in Los Angeles Later, a spokesperson for the family confirmed the father-of-seven had died surrounded by friends and family. In their statements, the family also took the opportunity to raise awareness around hypertension, or high blood pressure, in the African-American community. They said the director had ""silently struggled"" with the condition, and urged people to familiarise themselves with symptoms. Filmmaker Jordan Peele, who is behind titles like Get Out and Us, was among those who reacted to the news of Singleton's death. ""John was a brave artist and a true inspiration. His vision changed everything,"" he said in a tweet. Spike Lee posted a touching Instagram tribute to the late director, in which he recalled meeting him while he was a film student. ""With His Passion, His Heart, The Way He Talked About His Love For Cinema And Black Folks I Could See John Would Make It Happen, And He Did,"" the post said. Allow Instagram content?

Singleton was born in 1968 and grew up in South Central Los Angeles.He told the Hollywood Reporter in 2014 his upbringing had made him ""more of a fighter,,externalmore of a hustler, and it made me really appreciate life in a different way as a storyteller"". After studying at a high school in Pasadena, Singleton went on to get a place at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Less than a month after graduation, he was making his formative Boyz N the Hood alongside producer Steve Nicolaides. The film, partly inspired by his childhood, explored themes of youth and friendship with the backdrop of inner-city violence in Los Angeles. The film was met with high-praise on its Cannes debut and went on to become a box-office success. It offered breakout roles for actors including Angela Bassett, Nia Long and Cuba Gooding Jr. It also offered rapper Ice Cube his acting debut. Alongside the Shaft remake in 2000, Singleton's other credits include Higher Learning and the aforementioned Poetic Justice, starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur. Singleton was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003 He also directed 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious and Michael Jackson's video for Remember the Time. More recently, he had focused on TV projects, directing episodes of Empire and American Crime Story, as well as acting as creator and executive producer on 2017's Snowfall. In interviews, Singleton has accused Hollywood of trying to ""homogenise"" black film-making. ""They want black people to be who they want them to be, as opposed to what they are. The black films now - so-called black films now - they're great. They're great films. But they're just product,"" he said in 2014. ""They're not moving the bar forward creatively â¦ when you try to make it homogenised, when you try to make it appeal to everybody, then you don't have anything that's special.""

Double rape and abduction suspect hunted,"Joseph McCann, 33, is said to have links to Watford, Aylesbury and Ipswich A man wanted over the abduction and rape of two women in London has been linked to a third attack. Joseph McCann is wanted bydetectives investigating the abductionof two women in Chingford and Edgware on 25 April. Hertfordshire Constabulary said he was also linked to the rape of a 21-year-old in Watford on 21 April. Officers believe McCann, who is also wanted on recall to prison, could be using disguises. A Â£20,000 reward has been offered by the Metropolitan Police for information about his whereabouts that leads to his arrest and prosecution. The BBC has been told he was originally jailed in 2008 for aggravated burglary after admitting breaking into the home of an 85-year-old man on 27 December 2007. He was released on licence by the Parole Board in 2017 but had been recalled for breaching his licence. Joseph McCann is known to use false names, most recently Joel, the Met said During the attack in Watford, the victim was approached by a man holding a knife in Hagden Lane at about 03:30 BST. She was forced into a blue Ford Mondeo and driven around the town for six hours before being raped. The Hertfordshire force said the suspect had been identified after the attack was reported to them on 22 April. ""A significant amount of work was done to try and locate and arrest him, which proved unsuccessful,"" it said. Police previously released a CCTV image of the attacker The next victim was abducted the following Friday in Chingford, north London, at about 00:30, with the third targeted at 12:15 in Edgware. Both women, aged in their 20s, were raped before being driven to a hotel in Watford, where the suspect attempted to book a room but left when one was unavailable. They both then escaped following a struggle in Osborne Road at about 14:30. The Met said 33-year-old McCann, who has connections in Watford, Aylesbury and Ipswich, is known to use false names. Det Ch Insp Katherine Goodwin said: ""We would ask anyone with any information about McCann's whereabouts to contact us immediately. ""McCann is considered extremely dangerous and a risk to the public and we ask people not to approach him, but instead call 999."" McCann is described as white, with a muscular build, a bald head or shaved blond hair and a light-coloured short beard. He is said to have a distinctive tattoo of the name ""Bobbie"" on his stomach. A man, aged 33, has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rape and released as inquiries continue.

Labour to discuss public vote on BrexitThe party's governing body will decide whether to back a second referendum on the terms of any deal.UK PoliticsComments,"Labour's governing body has agreed to support a further referendum on Brexit under certain circumstances. The National Executive Committee met to decide the wording of its manifesto for May's European elections. It rejected the idea of campaigning for a referendum under all circumstances - as supported by deputy leader Tom Watson and many ordinary members. But the party will demand a public vote if it cannot get changes to the government's deal or an election. The National Executive Committee (NEC) oversees the overall direction of the party and is made up of representatives including shadow cabinet members, MPs, councillors and trade unions. Labour to redraft Euro election leaflets What's the mood on the doorstep? How many Labour supporters voted Leave? A Labour source said: ""The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour's existing policy to support Labour's alternative plan and if we can't get the necessary changes to the government's deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote."" The decision was sufficiently nuanced, though, that MPs have interpreted it in different ways. Wes Streeting, who favours another referendum, tweeted,externalthat the NEC had ""made the right call and confirmed that a public vote will be in our manifesto for the European elections"". Fellow pro-referendum MP Bridget Phillipson said Labour had ""done the bare minimum needed"" and she could ""only hope"" it would be enough to win over voters who want another say on Brexit. On the other side of the party,Gloria De Piero, who is against another vote, also welcomed the decision,external, arguing it meant the manifesto would ""not contain a pledge"" to hold a referendum - only keeping it as ""an option"" if a general election could not be engineered. The UK will have to take part in European Parliamentary elections on 23 May unless a Brexit deal is accepted by MPs before then. Labour agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's withdrawal deal with the EU - which it has effectively done three times - or talks ended in no-deal, there should be a general election. But if it could not force one, conference agreed that the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". Since then, though, Labour has entered into cross-party talks with the Conservatives to see if they can reach a consensus on how to get a Brexit deal through Parliament so that Britain can leave. Many Labour members wanted the party to make its agreement to any deal conditional on it being put to a public vote - what Labour calls a ""confirmatory ballot"". Labour have not yet made clear what their proposed referendum would be on, but a party briefing paper to MPs published earlier this year said it would need to have ""a credible Leave option and Remain"" on the ballot paper. On the surface it doesn't look like Labour's position has changed - but it has a little bit. Tom Watson, along with some trade unions and some party members, wanted a full-throated commitment to a referendum under all circumstances. What they have ended up with instead is a compromise or a fudge. Labour will call for a referendum if the Conservatives don't make changes to their Brexit deal. Some pro-referendum MPs aren't too disappointed because they believe the Conservatives won't move far enough and that leaves the door open to a referendum in the end anyway. Others, though, are disappointed because they think this is a way of avoiding a clear commitment in the run-up to the European elections. In truth, it puts the ball back into the Tories' court when it comes to those cross-party Brexit talks. Jeremy Corbyn is saying to Theresa May ""if you can compromise with us, we can hold back the tide of demands in our own party for a referendum."" That's the bargain he's offering. Speaking ahead of the NEC's decision, Tom Watson, the party's deputy leader, said ""the context has changed"" since the 2018 party conference and Labour should now throw its full support behind a second referendum ""to heal the divide in the country"". Afterwards, he described the party's agreed manifesto as ""very good"" and insisted he was not ""disappointed"" with the outcome - although he said would say more when the document was published next week. Manuel Cortes, secretary of the TSSA union which has a seat on the NEC, said he was disappointed that Labour had missed the opportunity to commit to giving voters another say. The latest talks between the government and Labour on Monday were described as ""positive"" and ""productive"" by the two sides.

Glasgow Airport reopens after security alert,"Passengers who were on the flight were moved to a holding room area at Glasgow Airport A plane at the centre of a security alert at Glasgow Airport was found to have nothing suspicious on board. All flights were suspended to and from Glasgow Airport after the crew on the aircraft, which had just landed from Gatwick, raised the alarm at 10:25. Initial reports suggested the incident, which shut the runway for 30 minutes, was linked to a suspect package. Police later confirmed a search of the aircraft delivered a ""negative result"" but inquiries are ongoing. Passenger James Gale said he was not aware of any problem on board until he checked Twitter. The 21-year-old, from Brighton, told BBC Scotland: ""No one seemed aware of anything, not visibly to me anyway. ""The captain just said that we were waiting for a stand. ""It was only from looking in Twitter that I found out."" Police Scotland officers responded to the alert on the Easyjet flight When the plane stopped there was an announcement to say there was an incident on board. Mr Gale added: ""The captain said there was a security incident but not on our plane, and then when we were stopped, he announced that it was our plane, and that we needed to get onto the buses and head to where we are still at now."" He said the passengers were then taken off the plane and escorted to what one person later described on social media as a ""survivor evacuation room"". Mr Gale said he did not see anyone being arrested and confirmed police were taking personal details from passengers before they were permitted to go on their way. A spokesman from Glasgow Airport confirmed that the incident had ended and the runway reopened just before 11:00. Police Scotland said officers were made aware of a security incident by the flight crew. A force spokeswoman said: ""All passengers from the affected flight have been spoken to by officers and able to continue their journeys. ""The plane has been searched with a negative result and nothing has been found. ""The circumstances surrounding the nature of the security alert will continue to be investigated."" Emergency services surrounded the plane An EasyJet spokeswoman said: ""EasyJet can confirm that passengers on flight EZY883 from London Gatwick to Glasgow were delayed disembarking on arrival in Glasgow, purely as a precaution, due to additional security checks. ""The passengers have been disembarked and taken into the terminal. ""The safety and security of its passengers and crew is always EasyJet's highest priority and we would like to thank passengers for their understanding.""

Cambridge investigates its slavery links,"The University of Cambridge is to investigate its own historical links with slavery and will examine how it might have gained financially. It has launched a two-year study that will examine its archives to see whether it gained from the slave trade. Universities have faced questions about the legacy of links to slavery. ""It is only right that Cambridge should look into its own exposure to the profits of coerced labour,"" said vice-chancellor Stephen Toope. Cambridge is to hold a two-year investigation into its links to slavery ""We cannot change the past, but nor should we seek to hide from it,"" said Prof Toope, who wants the process to help the university ""acknowledge its role during that dark phase of human history"". An advisory group has been appointed, chaired by Prof Martin Millett and based in the Centre of African Studies, which will examine the university's archives, libraries and museums to find connections with slavery. ""We cannot know at this stage what exactly it will find but it is reasonable to assume that, like many large British institutions during the colonial era, the university will have benefited directly or indirectly,"" said Prof Millett. Oxford University faced a dispute over its statue of Cecil Rhodes ""The benefits may have been financial or through other gifts. ""But the panel is just as interested in the way scholars at the university helped shape public and political opinion, supporting, reinforcing and sometimes contesting racial attitudes which are repugnant in the 21st Century."" It will also consider how the university might make reparation for any links to the legacy of the slave trade - whether in symbolic terms, such as monuments or re-naming buildings, or in funding bursaries or foundations. Prof Millett highlighted that the University of Glasgow is setting up a centre for the study of slavery, after it found that it had received donations in the 18th and 19th Century, derived from slave trade profits, which could be worth up to Â£198m in present day value. Universities in the UK and the United States have faced scrutiny about whether they had benefited from slavery and coerced labour, particularly during the 18th and 19th Century. British merchants were among the main participants in the Atlantic slave trade, transporting about 3.1 million Africans (of whom 2.7 million survived the journey) to the colonies in the Caribbean, North and South America and to other countries. The three most important ports for British slave traders were London, Bristol and Liverpool. Their ships sailed to the west coast of Africa, where they traded manufactured goods for captured African people. In 1807, the British government passed an act of Parliament abolishing the slave trade throughout the British Empire - but slavery itself would persist in the British colonies until its final abolition, in 1838. There have been questions about whether such connections are still visible, such as in statues and the names of buildings, and how such legacies should be acknowledged. Georgetown University has sought to help individual descendants of its former slaves At the University of Oxford, there was a long-running dispute overa statue to Cecil Rhodes, a controversial 19th Century colonial politician. At Harvard University, in the US,the word ""master"" was removed from academic titlesbecause of concerns that it had echoes of slavery. Harvard's law school alsochanged its official sealbecause it included the crest of a brutal 18th Century slave trader. Georgetown University, also in the US,agreed to offer support to the descendants of more than 200 slaves that the university had soldin the 19th Century. The chair of governors of the University of East London has called for any universities in the UK that have a link to slavery tocontribute to a Â£100m reparation fund, which would support ethnic minority students. Another UK university, Newcastle, also recently made a discovery that showed how recent the connections with slavery could be. Researcher Hannah Durkin found the identity ofthe last known survivor of the transatlantic slave ships. The former slave, Sally Smith, had been brought from West Africa to the US in 1860, and lived until 1937 in Alabama, staying for more than 70 years on the plantation where she had been enslaved.

"Infected blood inquiry hearings beginA public inquiry starts to hear evidence as families call for ""justice"" for people affected.","This video can not be played ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would"" A public inquiry into what has been called ""the worst treatment scandal in the history of the NHS"" is to start taking evidence on Tuesday. Some 4,800 people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. More than 2,000 are thought to have died. Thousands more may have been exposed through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth. One victim's widow says she wants ""justice"" and people held to account. Su Gorman's husband, Steve Dymond, died aged 62 on 23 December last year of organ failure - ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man. Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme in April 2018, Steve said: ""It's not the life I imagined in terms of dreams, in terms of ambitions. ""It's become a life of sickness, illness, worry, anxiety. ""When I talk about my wife, I talk about her as my widow in waiting."" Aged eight, Matt (pictured) was given blood products contaminated with HIV -when he found out, he couldn't tell a soul Liz married twice -the same NHS scandal killed both her husbands Steve was born in 1956 with a mild form of haemophilia, a genetic condition that prevents blood from clotting properly. He played rugby at school and studied Russian at university where he met his wife, Su, waiting on a train platform. ""He had a massive bruise on his thigh the size of a postcard and it worried me,"" she remembers. ""Steve was not in the habit of getting treatment, so he said he would get it checked out. That was the first time they injected him with a 'wonder drug' called Factor VIII."" Steve and Su on their wedding day At the time that new drug was made from the pooled blood plasma of tens of thousands of donors. In the 1970s and 1980s, the NHS was importing Factor VIII from the US, where high-risk groups like prisoners were paid to give blood. The first sign that something was very wrong came in about 1983. Reports of a new form of cancer started to emerge, first in the gay community then among other groups like haemophiliacs. Around this time, Steve had a minor accident and went to the local hospital to get it checked out. Factor VIII was imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s ""The young registrar took a packet off the shelf and treated him with Factor VIII. The bruise disappeared after an hour, so it was totally unnecessary,"" said Su. ""Shortly after, they called him back and said he had been exposed to HIV."" The testing process took 18 months - an ""absolutely terrifying"" period. Some 1,200 British haemophiliacs were infected with HIV in this way, including many young children of primary school age. Only 250 are still alive today. Steve was one of the lucky ones. ""It was a huge relief. He was told he was clear of the HIV but no mention was made of the Hepatitis C at that point,"" says Su. Hepatitis C is a virus now thought to affect more than 150 million people, some 2% of the world population. Yet it was not discovered and named until 1989. It was not until 1993, then living and working in France, that Steve was told he had the condition. At the time the couple were trying again for a baby. They were immediately taken off the IVF programme. Steve Dymond died in December of organ failure, ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man ""Steve was told bluntly that the [possible] consequences were liver cirrhosis, cancer, a transplant, premature death,"" says Su. ""Within 24 hours [of diagnosis] we found out we would never have children and that he was going to die early."" It was only in 2013 that a new drug was approved that could successfully eliminate the Hepatitis C virus from Steve's body. By then, though, the damage was already done. Scans showed his liver was cirrhotic and a bunch of cells showed the early signs of cancer. His health declined quickly in the last 18 months of his life. This video can not be played Steve Dymond speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in April last year In late December 2018 he woke at home coughing up blood. ""They took him to intensive care. He knew I was there and he said to me, 'I love you',"" says Su. ""The last thing he said was he wanted those who had done this to him to repent. Then at one in the morning, as he was holding my hand, he left me."" A public inquiry into the scandal was first announced in July 2017. Since then, campaign groups estimate that more than 150 infected haemophiliacs like Steve have died. The inquiry will consider evidence from approximately 2,500 people, most of whom were infected with, or affected by, contaminated blood products such as Factor VIII or IX. Victims and relatives want to know why warnings about the safety of the medicine may have been ignored, why plans to make the UK self-sufficient in blood products were scrapped, and why many documents and patient records appear to have been lost or destroyed. The inquiry, led by retired judge Sir Brian Langstaff, could last for more than two years. Ahead of the public hearings, the government announced more financial support for people in England affected by the tragedy, to a total of Â£75m from Â£46m. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The contaminated blood scandal was a tragedy that should never have happened and has caused unimaginable pain and hurt for victims and their families for decades. ""I know this will be a difficult time for victims and their families - but today will begin a journey which will be dedicated to getting to the truth of what happened and in delivering justice to everyone involved."" ""I want to see justice,"" says Su. ""I want to see people called to account, I want to see anybody found to have behaved inappropriately, criminally or negligently made to explain themselves. ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would, and that's a promise I intend to keep.""

"'I gave birth, and got Hepatitis C'","Jackie describes the effects of having hepatitis C as ""trauma after trauma"" When Jackie Britton was given a blood transfusion after childbirth, she thought it was saving her life. But the infected blood could have killed her. There are thought to be thousands like her. They often feel overlooked in the wider NHS contaminated blood scandal. ""There are still people dying, not knowing they are infected,"" Jackie Britton, from Portsmouth, tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She gave birth in 1983. Her baby daughter was fine but when Jackie started haemorrhaging she needed a blood transfusion. It would be another 29 years before she realised that that blood had been contaminated with hepatitis C, for which there was no blood screening at the time. The virus went undetected for years, slowly damaging Jackie's liver. As she puts it: ""The four units of blood that had saved my life was killing me."" Jackie had her daughter in 1983 Jackie started noticing something might be wrong only in her 50s, when she was experiencing ""absolute fatigue"". ""I would feel physically sick. I would start retching just stood up trying to cook a meal, because of the effort and the energy it was taking out of me. ""Hep C is just trauma after trauma."" A new generation of drugs means Jackie has now cleared the virus itself from her body - but the damage has already been done. She has cirrhosis of the liver and needs checks every six month to make sure it has not led to cancer or liver disease. The contaminated blood scandal of the 1970s and 1980s is often called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Almost 5,000 people with the blood disorder haemophilia were given a treatment contaminated with hepatitis and in many cases HIV. Then there is a second group of people who like Jackie received a blood transfusion after childbirth or an operation. There are no solid figures available on exactly how many transfusion patients were infected before 1992. But estimates range from about 5,000 - the same number of people with haemophilia affected - to up to 28,000, the figure suggested by a Department of Health analysis of the scandal. It is thought there will still be some people living today with hepatitis C, contracted by blood transfusion, who have not yet been diagnosed. Bob Leary was infected following an operation for a burst intestine For Bob Leary, now 72, it all started in 1986 with a burst intestine. Admitted to hospital and given a transfusion, he didn't think much more of it until he had a blood test four years later. He was told he had hepatitis C and could expect to live for another 10 to 15 years. ""As you can imagine, it was a very severe shock,"" he says. By 2012, Bob's liver had started to fail. He became jaundiced and lost weight dramatically. The following year, having been told he had just weeks left to live, a liver transplant saved his life. He will be on medication until he dies. ""I don't want to get into the blame culture, I could be bitter all my life,"" he says, ""but we need to make sure nothing like this happens again."" His hope is that a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal, set to begin on Monday, will provide some answers. It comes after years of campaigning from victims and their families. Key issues include: whether the government could have moved faster and introduced blood screening for hepatitis C before 1991 whether officials knew about the risks of contamination but decided not to tell the public whether enough was done to find and test patients who were given a transfusion before 1992 For Jackie, it is about far more than her own health. Last year, her friend and fellow campaigner Sally Vickers died from cancer caused by the hepatitis C she contracted in 1982 following an operation. ""She loved living. I mean she fought and fought,"" says Sally's husband, Alan. He remembers the moment she was given less than a month to live. ""The specialist came down and said, 'I'm sorry, it's not only severe cancer in your liver but it has spread to your lungs. ""We simply wanted to come home so that she could be with me."" Sally Vickers contracted hepatitis C from contaminated blood The anger Alan and Sally felt, however, was not directed at doctors, or the NHS, but at the people responsible for the whole blood donation system at the time in the Department of Health. ""I want somebody held accountable for it,"" Alan says. ""Somebody has got to be accountable for this."" The Cabinet Office said in a statement: ""The Infected Blood Inquiry is a priority for the government. ""It is extremely important that all those that have suffered so terribly can get the answers they have spent decades waiting for and lessons can be learnt so that a tragedy of this scale can never happen again. ""Government is committed to providing the inquiry with all the support it needs.""

Anti-social behaviour 'nightmare' ignoredVictims' commissioner says authorities are downplaying the harm caused by crimes such as vandalism.UK,"Anti-social behaviour that leaves victims ""living a nightmare"" is being ignored by authorities across England and Wales, a report warns. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove said police, local councils and housing providers were downplaying the harm caused by crimes such as vandalism. Victims being repeatedly targeted were left to ""suffer in silence"", she said. Police chiefs and the Local Government Association said they took anti-social behaviour seriously. But their resources were under strain and they needed more funding to tackle the problem, they said. People 'scared to be in their homes' Syringes buried in children's sand pit Huge increase in 'petty' council fines Launching the report, called Anti-Social Behaviour: Living a Nightmare, Baroness Newlove said ""depressingly little"" had changed sinceher husband Garry was kicked to death outside their homeafter confronting vandals in 2007. ""It seems implausible that, 12 years later, here I am still raising the issue of anti-social behaviour,"" she said. ""The feedback from victims is that, all too often, they feel they are being persistently targeted by their perpetrators, and yet persistently ignored by those with the power to prevent and intervene."" Anti-social behaviour is conduct that can cause harassment, alarm or distress. It includes vandalism, street drinking, prostitution-related activity, and nuisance neighbours,according to the police.uk website,external. Baroness Newlove, the Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, says victims are being left to ""suffer in silence"" Baroness Newlove said it was ""infuriating"" that anti-social behaviour was sometimes referred to as ""low-level crime"". ""That description illustrates very neatly how [anti-social behaviour] is often treated as a series of isolated incidents, rather than taking into account the cumulative effect that it has on its victims."" Her report says anti-social behaviour can cause ""immense distress and suffering"" to victims, having negative aspects on their mental health, sleep, work, and relationships. Sarah (not her real name), from Newport in south Wales, says residents in her area ""fear for their own safety"" after a big increase in prostitution-related activity in recent years. She describes how pimps and kerb-crawlers have become highly visible during the day - and says that on one occasion a client of a sex worker made ""obscene gestures"" towards her at 9.30am. Prostitutes and their clients have also been seen in the playground of a local primary school, she says. Sarah says she has ""lost count"" of the number of times she has complained to police and the local council, to no avail. ""It's around the clock. I'm an adult, but when you've got a young girl standing there, she's vulnerable,"" she said. ""The drugs problem is open. Police drive straight past, unless they have a short-term [anti-crime] drive. ""It's just lawless. I think we're in a containment area."" Residents 'afraid' of street drinkers 'Universal Credit forced me into sex work' GP picking up sex trade condoms 'daily' Police 101 call delays 'unacceptable' Written in partnership with Nottingham Trent University and charity ASB Help, the commissioner's report says victims of anti-social behaviour are passed between agencies and face lengthy delays when calling the 101 police non-emergency number. It also found that a mechanism known as the ""community trigger"", which allows victims to require agencies to review the response to the anti-social behaviour they reported, was ""largely unknown"". Jenny Herrera, from ASB Help, said there were fundamental problems with the mechanism and called for central government to intervene to ensure it was ""fit for purpose"". The Crime Survey for England and Wales estimated 37% of adult respondents experienced or witnessed anti-social behaviour in their local area last year, the highest proportion since the question was first asked in 2011-12. But separate figures show around 1.4 million incidents of anti-social behaviour were recorded by police in 2018, a 16% fall on the previous 12 months. The Home Office welcomed the Victims' Commissioner's report and said it would consider the recommendations ""carefully"". ""The government is committed to tackling anti-social behaviour and ensuring victims get the response they deserve,"" it said. A graph showing the overall changes in offences and charges in England and Wales National Police Chiefs' Council lead for Anti-Social Behaviour, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, said the police were ""only one part of the solution"" and they were working with local authorities and other agencies to tackle anti-social behaviour. ""Forces are under increasing strain as they deal with rising crime, demand that is more complex and a raised terror threat with fewer officers,"" he continued. ""Further long-term funding is needed and we are working with the Home Office and police and crime commissioners to make the case at the next spending review."" The Local Government Association said: ""Councils know people look to them to tackle the anti-social behaviour, which can make a law-abiding resident's life hell or blight an entire neighbourhood. ""It's a role they take extremely seriously but one which is being made increasingly challenging as a result of losing 60p out of every Â£1 they had from government to spend on services in the past decade.""

Japan's emperor declares his abdication,"This video can not be played The day began with private rituals in the Imperial Palace Japan's Emperor Akihito has declared his abdication in a historic ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. In his last public address as emperor, Akihito handed over the symbols of power and thanked the public for their support during his 30-year reign. The 85-year-old was given permission to abdicate after saying he felt unable to fulfil his role because of his age and declining health. He is the first Japanese monarch to stand down in more than 200 years. Akihito technically remained emperor until midnight (15:00 GMT on Tuesday). His eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, formally ascends the throne later on Wednesday. A new era - called Reiwa, meaning order and harmony - will begin in Japan's unique calendar. The life and reign of Akihito - the human emperor The prince who will take Japan into a new era The abdication in pictures While the emperor holds no political power, he serves as a national figurehead. Akihito has endeared himself to many Japanese people during his reign as he has interacted with those suffering from disease and disaster. In the morning, the emperor took part in a Shinto ceremony to report his plans to the mythological ancestors of Japan's imperial family. The emperor took part in private Shinto ceremonies to start the day The main ""Ceremony of the Abdication"" took place in a state room of the Imperial Palace in front of about 300 people including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Crown Prince Naruhito, and Crown Princess Masako. Imperial chamberlains carried the state and privy seals into the hall, along with a sacred sword and a jewel which are considered symbols of the imperial family. In a short ceremony, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addressed the emperor, saying: ""While keeping in our hearts the path that the emperor has walked, we will make utmost efforts to create a bright future for a proud Japan that is full of peace and hope."" Then, in his final speech as emperor, Akihito, wearing a Western-style morning coat, said he ""wished Japan and the world peace and happiness"". Akihito is the first Japanese emperor to step down in more than 200 years ""I am deeply grateful for the people that accepted me as a symbol and supported me,"" he said. ""I sincerely wish, together with the empress, that the Reiwa era which begins tomorrow will be a stable and fruitful one,"" he added. ""I pray, with all my heart, for peace and happiness for all the people in Japan and around the world."" The Imperial Treasures that make a man an emperor Reiwa: Naming a new era in Japan After helping his wife, Empress Michiko, down the steps of the ceremonial platform, the emperor bowed towards the gathered officials, then left the room. The 85-year-old had surgery for prostate cancer in 2003 and a heart bypass operation in 2012. In a rare speech in 2016, he said that he feared his age would make it hard for him to carry out his duties and strongly hinted that he wanted to stand down. Emperor Akihito's 2016 address to the nation Opinion polls showed that the vast majority of Japan sympathised with him, and a year later parliament enacted a law that made his abdication possible. Prince Naruhito will become Japan's 126th emperor - and will officially lead the country into the new Reiwa era. It will mark the end of the current Heisei era, which began when Akihito ascended the throne in 1989. The 59-year-old crown prince will lead the country into a new era The 59-year-old Oxford University graduate is married to Crown Princess Masako. Their only child, Princess Aiko, was born in 2001. Japan's current law prohibits women from inheriting the throne, so Princess Aiko's uncle Prince Fumihito is now first in line, followed by her cousin, 12-year-old Prince Hisahito. This video can not be played Princess Aiko, the only child of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, will not ascend the throne because she is female The princess, the palace and the shrinking royal line It's the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. Legends date it back to about 600 BC. The emperors used to be seen as gods, but Hirohito - the father of Akihito - publicly renounced his divinity as part of Japan's surrender at the end of World War Two. It was Emperor Akihito who helped repair Japan's post-war reputation. Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko meeting with evacuees after a tsunami in 2011 Previous emperors rarely interacted with the public, but Akihito redefined the role - and has come to be known for his compassion. In 1991, two years after he ascended the throne, Akihito and the empress broke with norms and knelt down to speak to people affected by a volcanic eruption in Nagasaki. Akihito also took up the role of a diplomat, becoming an unofficial ambassador for Japan and travelling abroad extensively. While Tuesday's was the first Japanese abdication in 200 years, it wasn't so rare historically. According to Japan's state broadcaster NHK, about half the country's emperors or empresses have done the same, and it happened frequently from the 8th Century to the 19th Century. The Golden Week break - Japan's annual spring holiday - has been extended to a record 10 days to mark the occasion. When Emperor Akihito succeeded his late father, the country was in mourning, but this time people will be going on holidays, to cinemas, or staying at home to watch the events on TV. Many said they would miss the departing emperor, who will now hold the title ""Joko"", which means ""grand emperor"" or  ""Emperor Emeritus"". ""I think the emperor is loved by the people,"" Morio Miyamoto told Reuters news agency. ""His image is one of encouraging the people, such as after disasters, and being close to the people."" ""The emperor worked very hard for 30 years so I hope the handing over of the baton to the new emperor will go smoothly,"" Mikiko Fujii told the agency. ""I'm sad but also hopeful about the next era. I hope it will be a peaceful, gentle period for the second half of my life,"" said Masatoshi Kujirai, on his way to a Shinto shrine to mark the day. Watch: Akihito leaves the throne.

Social mobility in UK 'virtually stagnant',"Inequality will remain entrenched ""from birth to work"" unless the government takes urgent action, the Social Mobility Commission has warned. ItsState of the Nation report,externalcovering England, Scotland and Wales, said the situation had remained ""virtually stagnant"" since 2014. It is calling on ministers to provide additional funding for older teenagers in education and to extend free childcare to more low income families. The government said it would take the recommendations seriously. The findings will come as a setback to Theresa May who promised to tackle the ""burning injustice"" of social inequality when she entered Downing Street in 2016. However, the following year, all of the commissioners on the Social Mobility Commission - set up in 2010 to monitor and promote social mobility - resigned,saying the government was too focused on Brexit to deal with creating a fairer Britain. This video can not be played Law graduate Paris McKenzie describes the difficulty she has faced finding work Law graduate Paris McKenzie, 25, wants to be a solicitor but said there are not enough training contracts in her home city of Nottingham. ""I have barely come across any, and I constantly search for them. There are lots in London,"" she said. But the single mother said she did not ""have the means"" to move to the capital, where she said she would not have support and would struggle to pick up her son from nursery herself. ""It's a catch 22, my opportunities are very limited,"" she added. Dame Martina Milburn, who has since been appointed as the new chairwoman, said she sensed there was now ""a real commitment"" from the government. However, she said the biggest concern was not stagnation, but that the problem might actually get worse. Dame Martina Milburn says those born privileged are likely to remain privileged ""There's still a big shift - if you want to be socially mobile - towards London,"" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""I think you're three times more likely to move to London if you're from a professional background than if you're from a working class background."" Young highly sceptical of social mobility The worst places to grow up poor Almost a third of graduates 'overeducated' Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he welcomed the ""thorough"" report - the first since the new commissioners were appointed - but stopped short of saying the government would adopt all of its recommendations. The report recommends: a ""significant increase"" in funding for all 16 to 19-year-olds in education, with a special ""student premium"" for the disadvantaged extending the offer of 30 hours of free childcare a week to cover households where one parent is working eight hours a week - currently one parent must work at least 16 hours the government agreeing to pay the voluntary living wage to all of its employees and contracted workers, including cleaners and catering staff The report found those from better-off backgrounds were almost 80% more likely to be in a professional job than their working class peers. It said the proportion of people from professional backgrounds who were in professional jobs was 60% last year. In contrast, only 34% of those from working class backgrounds had professional jobs last year. And both figures had changed only slightly over the past four years. ""Being born privileged means you are likely to remain privileged,"" said Dame Martina, who is also chief executive of the Prince's Trust. ""But being born disadvantaged means you may have to overcome a series of barriers to ensure you and your children are not stuck in the same trap."" The commission said it welcomed the findings showing that Scotland and Wales were becoming more socially mobile, with a person's socio-economic status less likely to be determined by their parents' socio-economic status than in 2014. It said this was especially encouraging in light of the limited social mobility in Britain as a whole. The Social Mobility Commission said an increasing number of students from low-income families were entering university by the age of 19. That proportion has now reached 26%, compared with 43% of better-off peers. But, five years after graduating, those graduates who had been on free school meals at school were in jobs that earned 11.5% less than other graduates, the report said. It found barriers to getting a top job were there from the start - about a half (52%) of disadvantaged teenagers leave school without basic qualifications and many get stuck in low-paid work. Adult education could help to redress that, said the report, but almost all forms of adult education have been in decline since 2010. There were also longer-term concerns that divisions could worsen as low-paid and low-skilled jobs were more likely to become automated in the future. Professor Diane Reay, from the University of Cambridge told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The expansion in the labour market is at the bottom - in the low-paid casualised jobs - rather than in the high-paid, more elite jobs. ""We need to radically change the hierarchical structure of English society, not just the social class of a few individuals."" Paul Gregg, a professor of economic and social policy at the University of Bath, who resigned from the Social Mobility Commission in 2017, told the programme: ""It's still the case that Brexit is sucking all the political oxygen in government [from] any kind of social reforms."" The education secretary said employment had risen in every UK region under this government; wages were outstripping inflation; the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has narrowed; and the proportion of 16 and 17-year-olds in education or apprenticeships was at its highest ever. Career progression and better-paid work is more likely if people move regions - particularly if they go to London, the data shows. Too often provincial towns and cities don't have the employment infrastructure to ensure career progression, notably in professions like law and accountancy. Those from wealthier backgrounds are more likely to be able to make that kind of move, with the resources and support to grab opportunities wherever they may be. Some believe devolving power and prestige to local government and combined authorities is the way to ensure a more even spread of growth and new jobs - and make the country less reliant on London. In England, the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine are initiatives to achieve just that within the wider industrial strategy. But there are concerns that not enough resources are available to achieve significant structural change.

Care home group facing administration,"One of Britain's largest care home groups, Four Seasons Health Care, has gone into administration. Two of the holding companies behind the firm appointed administrators on Tuesday after struggling to repay their debts. The group serves about 17,000 residents and patients and employs some 20,000 staff. Four Seasons said the move would not affect care arrangements or lead to the closure of homes. Group medical director Dr Claire Royston commented: ""Today's news does not change the way we operate or how our homes are run or prompt any change for residents, families, employees and indeed suppliers. ""It marks the latest stage in the group's restructuring process and allows us to move ahead with an orderly, independent sales process."" It is the biggest care home group to have gone into administration since Southern Cross in 2011. Care home operator to withdraw services Brexit: Hospital suppliers stockpiling food Four Seasons has struggled with cuts to local authority care fees and rising costs, and has repeatedly warned about its long-term stability. The GMB union said the government needed to step in urgently to reassure Four Seasons staff and residents. Rehana Azam, GMB national secretary, said: ""The possible collapse of Four Seasons shows our care system is in crisis, it is crumbling beneath us because the funding isn't there."" Four Seasons said it had appointed professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) to handle the administration. While the holding companies - Elli Finance (UK) and Elli Investments - are in administration, the operating companies that run Four Season homes are not. The group said it had secured funding to ensure continuity of care while it seeks a new owner. Four Seasons, which has 322 residential and nursing care homes, has been struggling to restructure its debt pile of more than Â£500m. Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm led by Guy Hands, bought the group in 2012 for Â£825m but has since seen a Â£450m writedown on its investment. It has also ceded control of the group to US hedge fund H/2 Capital Partners, which holds a large amount of its debt. A number of care businesses have run into trouble recently, raising questions about the current funding model for social care. Last year, Allied Healthcare, which supports 13,000 people, said it was struggling with debts, blaming low fees paid by councils. The Care Quality Commission, a regulator,later issued a notice saying it had serious doubts about Allied Healthcare's future. A majority of Four Seasons' operations are funded by the state, with about a fifth of them funded privately. Colletta Smith, consumer affairs correspondent If you live in a Four Seasons care home, the first thing to say is don't panic. It's the job of the administrator to keep things running and try and find a buyer for all the care homes - nothing will change immediately. If your care home is eventually earmarked for closure, your council is responsible for making sure everyone is cared for without any interruptions - you won't be left out on the street. If the local authority pays for some or all of your care bill, it is responsible for finding new accommodation. You can choose another care home yourself, though, as long as it suits your needs and doesn't cost more than the council has agreed to spend. If you pay your own bills, then you'll need to find a new home yourself. But the council may give suggestions and should do a care assessment to make sure you get something suitable. It's also worth knowing that if several residents from the same home want to move together, then the council must try to help them do this, so it's worth asking. If you're not happy with your care during the administration or under a new owner, you should tell the care regulator.

Labour to discuss public vote on Brexit,"Labour's governing body has agreed to support a further referendum on Brexit under certain circumstances. The National Executive Committee met to decide the wording of its manifesto for May's European elections. It rejected the idea of campaigning for a referendum under all circumstances - as supported by deputy leader Tom Watson and many ordinary members. But the party will demand a public vote if it cannot get changes to the government's deal or an election. The National Executive Committee (NEC) oversees the overall direction of the party and is made up of representatives including shadow cabinet members, MPs, councillors and trade unions.

A Labour source said: ""The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour's existing policy to support Labour's alternative plan and if we can't get the necessary changes to the government's deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote."" The decision was sufficiently nuanced, though, that MPs have interpreted it in different ways. Wes Streeting, who favours another referendum, tweeted,externalthat the NEC had ""made the right call and confirmed that a public vote will be in our manifesto for the European elections"". Fellow pro-referendum MP Bridget Phillipson said Labour had ""done the bare minimum needed"" and she could ""only hope"" it would be enough to win over voters who want another say on Brexit. On the other side of the party,Gloria De Piero, who is against another vote, also welcomed the decision,external, arguing it meant the manifesto would ""not contain a pledge"" to hold a referendum - only keeping it as ""an option"" if a general election could not be engineered. The UK will have to take part in European Parliamentary elections on 23 May unless a Brexit deal is accepted by MPs before then. Labour agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's withdrawal deal with the EU - which it has effectively done three times - or talks ended in no-deal, there should be a general election. But if it could not force one, conference agreed that the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". Since then, though, Labour has entered into cross-party talks with the Conservatives to see if they can reach a consensus on how to get a Brexit deal through Parliament so that Britain can leave. Many Labour members wanted the party to make its agreement to any deal conditional on it being put to a public vote - what Labour calls a ""confirmatory ballot"". Labour have not yet made clear what their proposed referendum would be on, but a party briefing paper to MPs published earlier this year said it would need to have ""a credible Leave option and Remain"" on the ballot paper. On the surface it doesn't look like Labour's position has changed - but it has a little bit. Tom Watson, along with some trade unions and some party members, wanted a full-throated commitment to a referendum under all circumstances. What they have ended up with instead is a compromise or a fudge. Labour will call for a referendum if the Conservatives don't make changes to their Brexit deal. Some pro-referendum MPs aren't too disappointed because they believe the Conservatives won't move far enough and that leaves the door open to a referendum in the end anyway. Others, though, are disappointed because they think this is a way of avoiding a clear commitment in the run-up to the European elections. In truth, it puts the ball back into the Tories' court when it comes to those cross-party Brexit talks. Jeremy Corbyn is saying to Theresa May ""if you can compromise with us, we can hold back the tide of demands in our own party for a referendum."" That's the bargain he's offering. Speaking ahead of the NEC's decision, Tom Watson, the party's deputy leader, said ""the context has changed"" since the 2018 party conference and Labour should now throw its full support behind a second referendum ""to heal the divide in the country"". Afterwards, he described the party's agreed manifesto as ""very good"" and insisted he was not ""disappointed"" with the outcome - although he said would say more when the document was published next week. Manuel Cortes, secretary of the TSSA union which has a seat on the NEC, said he was disappointed that Labour had missed the opportunity to commit to giving voters another say. The latest talks between the government and Labour on Monday were described as ""positive"" and ""productive"" by the two sides.

Man arrested over double freezer murderPolice found the two women dead at flats in east London after responding to welfare concerns.London,"The entrance to the block has been cordoned off while investigations take place A murder inquiry is under way after two women's bodies were found inside a freezer at a flat in east London. Officers found the human remains when they were called to Vandome Close in Canning Town. The women have not been formally identified and post-mortem examinations have not yet taken place. Two men, aged 50 and 34, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Both remain in custody at London police stations. They were arrested at two separate addresses in west and east London, both of which are being searched by police. The Metropolitan Police said it was trying to identify both victims and contact their next of kin as a ""priority"". The family of 37-year-old Mary-Jane Mustafa, who has been missing since May 2018, have gathered at the scene in Canning Town. Her sister Mel Mustafa, 47, said: ""She is the most kind-hearted person you could meet and I still don't believe it's her."" Cousin Ceylan Sunda, 53, added: ""The family's upside down. We don't even know for sure yet."" Officers were called to the address at 11:45 BST on Friday following concerns for the welfare of a male resident. Det Supt Paul Monk said a ""large crime scene"" was in place and expected to remain ""for some time"". By Greg McKenzie, BBC London I've managed to get inside an adjacent block next door to the flats that have been taped off by police. In the back garden there is a blue tent and police cordons are in place. It's a quiet residential area in east London - but one person has told me they are petrified to live here. The Met has now confirmed the bodies were found in a freezer. It comes after a witness said a fridge was carried out of the property on the Friday and into the back of a police van. So far in 2019, more than 40 murder investigations have been launched in London by the Metropolitan and British Transport police forces. Det Ch Supt Richard Tucker said: ""The launch of any murder investigation is naturally of concern to the local community.

NI pupils 'should get free fruit',"About 85,000 children in Northern Ireland were living in relative poverty in 2017/18 Young schoolchildren in Northern Ireland should receive a free portion of fruit or vegetables every day, a new report has said. It also recommends they receive a free meal every day in the first three years of school regardless of income. Those are two of the key recommendations of the children's future food inquiry into food poverty across the UK. The inquiry report criticises Northern Ireland's ""dismal"" breastfeeding rates. Northern Ireland has the lowest breastfeeding rates in the UK. The inquiry spent a year investigating issues around children's food, especially for those aged up to 18 years old from low income homes. Its committee includes MPs, academics and 15 young people from across the UK - including two from Portadown in County Armagh. Households where the net income is less than Â£14,000 per year are entitled to free school meals The chief executive of the umbrella organisation Children in Northern Ireland, Pauline Leeson, was also on the committee. Separate figures published by the Department for Communities estimate that about 85,000 children in Northern Ireland were living in relative poverty in 2017/18. Those are children living in households with an income below 60% of the UK median income. In Northern Ireland, the median household income before housing costs in 2017/18 was Â£480 per week - a 3% increase on the previous year. Children in Northern Ireland are entitled to free school meals if they come from households where the net income is less than Â£14,000 per year or where their parents or guardians are on some benefits. Recent figures published by the Department of Education show that 99,142 pupils were entitled to free school meals in 2018/19 - 29.3% of all school children. The report said a healthy diet was ""unaffordable and unsustainable"" for many young people living in poverty The Children's Future Food Inquiry report said that the provision of free school meals to children from low-income homes was better in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK. Its authors said, for instance, that less than half of children in England living in food poverty received a free school lunch. However, they said that all children in Northern Ireland should receive a free daily meal up until the end of primary two regardless of their family's income. School dinners also offer a ""very social experience"" says one NI headteacher That echoes arrangementscurrently in place in England and Scotland. The report also calls for a scheme in Englandwhereby all children from the ages of four to six are given a free piece of fruit or vegetableeach school day to be extended to Northern Ireland, as well as to Wales and all of Scotland. Sean McNamee, the principal of St Paul's Primary and Nursery School in west Belfast, said it was a ""great idea"". ""The meal itself is obviously a very important thing for children to have access to healthy food, but it is also a very social experience,"" he said. Sean McNamee said a free school meal for all would remove any stigma ""In a lot of families children don't have a 'sit around the table' kind of dinner, so it's good to be able to provide that in schools. ""We're keen to make sure all children have access to whatever they need, breaktime or lunchtime food. ""We don't want any stigma - equality of opportunity for all children, the same social experience, the same food. It's a no brainer."" The wide-ranging inquiry also recommends action in a number of other areas, including councils taking measures to ensure fewer takeaway food outlets are opened close to schools. It calls for a more comprehensive action plan to support women who want to breastfeed across the UK, calling breastfeeding rates ""dismal"". ""By the time babies are six to eight weeks old in England only 44% of them are still being breastfed,"" the report said. ""Rates are lowest in Northern Ireland where only 27% of babies are receiving any breast milk at six weeks and only 13% at six months."" The report calls breastfeeding rates in Northern Ireland ""dismal"" The report also calls for an independent watchdog for children's food to be established in Northern Ireland and separately in each of the other nations in the UK. It said that governments should take measures to ""rebalance"" the cost of food to make sure healthy food was more affordable in comparison to unhealthy food. The report said a healthy diet was ""unaffordable and unsustainable"" for many young people living in poverty. ""We face a grave situation with children's food, which is in urgent need of systematic leadership from all four governments across the United Kingdom,"" the report concluded. The report does not, however, provide specific costings for many of the measures it recommends.

Two arrested as police foil ATM theft,"The PSNI has warned there is a ""very real"" threat of more cash machine thefts across Northern Ireland. Det Supt Rachel Shields said police were not complacent about the risk posed by several gangs behind a spate of overnight robberies. Two people were arrested on Tuesday after police foiled a bid to steal a cash machine at Nutt's Corner in County Antrim at about 03:30 BST. It was the 14th incident of its kind in Northern Ireland since 1 January 2019. Police have confirmed ""considerable policing resources"" were directed to the scene after they received a report that a digger was being used to rip the cash machine from a service station at Tully Road. The machine was recovered. The cash machine was recovered after police said they directed ""considerable resources"" to the scene Det Supt Shields said: ""We recognise there are a number of gangs carrying out these attacks on ATMs and the threat of more thefts is very real. ""Tonight again we will have local police patrolling areas which could be vulnerable to an attack and detectives remain dedicated to investigating the thefts that have taken place. This remains a key priority for police"". Det Supt Shields also asked the owners of heavy plant machinery to secure their vehicles. PSNI Det Supt Rachel Shields said police were not complacent about the risk posed by several gangs behind a spate of overnight robberies. She added: ""If criminals cannot steal diggers, they cannot tear out ATMs."" The owner of the Tully Road premises, Gordon Stewart, said he is determined to open up again as soon as possible. ""An hour after these guys have cleared up, I hope to have the place open again,"" he said. ""Just check all round; electrician wise, builder wise, just get her tidied up and we'll see what we can do."" A forensic officer examines a field across the road from the service station when the attempted theft took place What is going on with cash machine thefts? The chief executive of Retail NI, Glyn Roberts welcomed news of the arrests. Glyn Roberts said he was very concerned at reports of escalating insurance premiums He said that independent retailers who had been targeted in cash machine robberies were dealing with ""a huge personal impact"" for themselves and their staff. Mr Roberts said Retail NI recently met the Department of Finance to discuss how they might access the rates hardship fund. ""This is the very least that needs to happen to assist these small businesses getting back on their feet again,"" he said. Mr Roberts said he was also ""extremely concerned"" at reports from members with ATMs, who had not been attacked, but were nevertheless seeing insurance premiums increase dramatically. ""This adds another burden on an already difficult situation,"" he said. 14 incidents involving 15 machines. 6 January - Supermarket, Old Mountfield Road, Omagh, (Attempt - machine not removed from wall) 1 February - Supermarket, Ballymena Road, Antrim (Two cash machines removed). 2 February - Supermarket, Glenavy Road, Moira. 15 February - Service Station, Killyclogher Road, Omagh. 10 March - Service Station, Ballygawley Road, Dungannon. 22 March - Bank, Mallusk Road, Newtownabbey. 24 March - Service station, Dromore Road, Irvinestown. 1 April - Shop, Brook Street, Ahoghill. 7 April - Service Station, Feeney Road, Dungiven. 16 April - Coffee shop, Main Street, Bushmills. 16 April - Supermarket, Main Street, Crumlin (Two cash machines removed). 16 April - Shops, Drumgor, Craigavon, (Attempt - machine not removed from wall) 26 April - Tesco, Larne Link Road, Ballymena (Two cash machines removed). 30 April - Service Station, Tully Road, Nutt's Corner.

Housing crisis: Are cities unaffordable?,"This video can not be played In cities around the world, like Berlin and Edinburgh, housing costs are soaring Joy Rentoul is sitting beside a bunk bed in the living room of her two-bedroom flat in Leith, Edinburgh, the room drenched in sunlight. Her children - a girl, 12, and boy aged nine - are at their dad's house for the day and Joy is reflecting on her living arrangements, which are not ideal. ""I am sleeping in the living room in a bunk bed so that my son and daughter can have a bedroom each,"" she tellsBBC Scotland's The Nine. ""My baby girl is becoming a young woman and really needs her own privacy - so I am sacrificing my own privacy. ""There's absolutely no way in the world that I could afford to move to a flat that has three bedrooms,"" she says. Worse, she fears being driven out of her existing property by rising rent, which her landlord says is necessary to pay for improvements to the ailing block in which she lives. Joy Rentoul fears she will be driven out of her property in Edinburgh due to rising rent Joy's story, and her fears, are typical. Across the city, across the country, across much of the world in fact, housing costs are soaring. Between 2010 and 2018 the Lothian region, including Edinburgh, saw a 39.8% rise in the average private rent for a one-bedroom property; a 42.3% increase for two-bedrooms; and 46.6% for three-bedrooms,according to the Scottish government,external. At the same timethe average wage, adjusted for inflation, fell,external. For critics of capitalism's effect on housing, such as the writer and broadcaster Vonny LeClerc, Scotland's capital is becoming unaffordable, ""even on a professional salary"". We take a stroll down Cockburn Street at the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, once edgy, now chic. Vonny LeClerc says she is being ""pushed out"" of her Edinburgh where she moved to as a student in 2005 ""It's lost all of its edges,"" says Vonny. ""The gentrification has just swallowed up everything that was unique."" Vonny rented a flat here when she moved to the city as a student in 2005 but she says there is no way she could have done so had prices been as high as they are now. Even now, she is struggling to afford a home and is preparing to leave Edinburgh altogether. ""I don't want to go. This has been my home for 14 years...We're being pushed out because we cannot find anywhere that is affordable for us to rent."" The housing shortage has been exacerbated by a rise in holiday lets, especially here in the medieval Old Town, a tourist hot spot. The city councilestimates that there are 240,000 properties in Edinburgh,externaland recent research for BBC News suggests that 12,000 are listed on the Airbnb website - that is one in 20. Airbnb says its properties represent less than 0.6% of Scotland's available housing stock and boost the nation's economy by Â£1.5m per day. Effect of Airbnb surge on UK cities revealed Scotland's housing market in four charts Where can I afford to live? Kate Campbell, the council's housing and economy convener and a member of the Scottish National Party, insists the administration, which is run by an SNP/Labour coalition, is taking action. ""We're looking at rent pressure zones. We're looking at how to regulate short-term lets,"" she says. ""We're building a lot of affordable homes and particularly social homes, there's an enormous focus for us on social housing."" A law enacted in December 2017 allows councils to apply to the Scottish government to introduce rent controls in specific ""pressure zones"" but so far no such zones have been declared. ""The legislation is at a very early stage and it's very much about building the case and gathering the evidence and gathering the data,"" says the councillor. In the meantime there is anecdotal evidence that the housing shortage is beginning to affect vital services. Trainee advanced nurse practitioner Liam Shields says key workers like him are struggling to compete for city homes Liam Shields, a trainee advanced nurse practitioner points to what he says are 60 nursing and midwifery vacancies at the Western General Hospital where he works. The nurse, who has himself struggled to find affordable housing since moving to Edinburgh from Dundee, reckons the tight housing market is stifling recruitment. A city needs nurses, police and firefighters to operate, he says, but they find it hard to compete for homes against highly-paid workers in financial services and the law. ""There certainly needs to be a stronger approach to what qualifies as a key worker and how you bring key workers to your city,"" he argues. Berlin faces similar issues to Edinburgh in terms of housing And it's not just Edinburgh. Around the worldcities are grappling with the same problem,external- the richer they get, the more desirable property becomes, the harder it can be to find a home. In recent weeks places as far apart as Dublin, Venice and Johannesburg have seen protests about a lack of affordable housing. And in the German capital, Berlin, Joy Rentoul's story sounds very familiar to Marja MÃ¼eller, a single mother in a similar apartment block. Last October, Marja says, she received a notice that the block was to be modernised and her rent would go up - by 76%. ""I'm actually one of the lucky ones,"" she adds. ""Most people have about 80/85% more rent to pay."" Can she afford it? ""No I can't. I mean I don't know what I'm going to do then."" A study suggests rents in Berlin have more than doubled in a decade For many years after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the reunification of Germany, the city had a reputation for cheap rents. A supply of large Soviet-style housing blocks in what was East Berlin helped. But those days are well and truly over. Last yeara study for real estate IT firm Immowelt found monthly rents in Berlin had more than doubled in a decade,external. Solutions are being proposed. For one thing,holiday letting is more regulated here,externalthan in Edinburgh, for another residents are rising up to demand action from the city government. Marja's property is owned by Berlin's largest landlord, Deutsche Wohnen, which has around 115,000 flats. Earlier this month, thousands of Berliners took to the streets to call for some 200,000 properties, including Deutsche Wohnen's, to be nationalised. If the campaigners can gather a total of 190,000 signatures by February they will be able to put the proposal to city voters in a referendum which will force the municipal government to act. Polls suggest they have a good chance of victory. Thomas McGath says housing is now treated as a commodity rather than a utility Thomas McGath, an American who lives in Berlin, is one of the protest leaders. ""What we're seeing right now is actually an existential moment for Berlin,"" he says. ""People are afraid of not being able to stay in their neighbourhoods. People are really questioning whether the city is for them anymore."" The core problem, he argues, is that housing is now treated not as a utility but as a commodity, bought up on mass by giant corporations to extract ever-increasing profits, regardless of the effect on tenants or cities. It is a trend which took off after the global financial crisis a decade ago, argues Saskia Sassen, a professor of sociology at Columbia University in the US. She has described the process as""a systemic transformation in the pattern of land ownership in cities"" with ""deep and significant implications for equity, democracy and rights."",external Like other big landlords, Deutsche Wohnen defends its investments, insisting its apartments are both affordable and being improved for the good of its tenants. Chief executive Michael Zahn says any vote for citizens to buy back housing would be a big mistake. ""Expropriation brings no relief for the drastically-tight housing market in the capital,"" he insists. The Social Democrats who lead the coalition which governs the city are sceptical too, arguing that it would take billions to purchase the properties (which the city is accused of selling off cheaply in the first place) and that it would be better to invest in new housing and rent freezes. Marja MÃ¼eller was told her apartment block in Berlin was being modernised and her rent would go up by 76% Marja is not convinced. ""It's not working,"" she says, of the existing economic system in Berlin, Edinburgh and the west in general. ""The rich get richer and the poor get poorer...I think it's really at a critical point right now because people are getting so angry. ""Everyone went to school and had some history lessons and we all know where that's going to end,"" she says. Asked to explain specifically what she means, Marja says discontent about a lack of affordable housing is fuelling a rise of the far right. In Germany that sounds like a wake-up call from history.

Glasgow Airport suspends all flights,"Passengers who were on the flight were moved to a holding room area at Glasgow Airport A plane at the centre of a security alert at Glasgow Airport was found to have nothing suspicious on board. All flights were suspended to and from Glasgow Airport after the crew on the aircraft, which had just landed from Gatwick, raised the alarm at 10:25. Initial reports suggested the incident, which shut the runway for 30 minutes, was linked to a suspect package. Police later confirmed a search of the aircraft delivered a ""negative result"" but inquiries are ongoing. Passenger James Gale said he was not aware of any problem on board until he checked Twitter. The 21-year-old, from Brighton, told BBC Scotland: ""No one seemed aware of anything, not visibly to me anyway. ""The captain just said that we were waiting for a stand. ""It was only from looking in Twitter that I found out."" Police Scotland officers responded to the alert on the Easyjet flight When the plane stopped there was an announcement to say there was an incident on board. Mr Gale added: ""The captain said there was a security incident but not on our plane, and then when we were stopped, he announced that it was our plane, and that we needed to get onto the buses and head to where we are still at now."" He said the passengers were then taken off the plane and escorted to what one person later described on social media as a ""survivor evacuation room"". Mr Gale said he did not see anyone being arrested and confirmed police were taking personal details from passengers before they were permitted to go on their way. A spokesman from Glasgow Airport confirmed that the incident had ended and the runway reopened just before 11:00. Police Scotland said officers were made aware of a security incident by the flight crew. A force spokeswoman said: ""All passengers from the affected flight have been spoken to by officers and able to continue their journeys. ""The plane has been searched with a negative result and nothing has been found. ""The circumstances surrounding the nature of the security alert will continue to be investigated."" Emergency services surrounded the plane An EasyJet spokeswoman said: ""EasyJet can confirm that passengers on flight EZY883 from London Gatwick to Glasgow were delayed disembarking on arrival in Glasgow, purely as a precaution, due to additional security checks. ""The passengers have been disembarked and taken into the terminal.

Church pays Â£1m to three abused siblings,"Ian Samson attacked the children at the Lord and Lady Polwarth Children's Home in Edinburgh Three siblings sexually abused by a care home worker have secured Â£1m in damages from the Church of Scotland. The two men and one woman were targeted by paedophile Ian Samson at Lord and Lady Polwarth Children's Home in Edinburgh. A court previously heard the victims were assaulted during a campaign of abuse that spanned three decades The Church expressed ""deep and sincere regret"" for the trauma experienced by the children. Samson was later jailed for 14 years after being found guilty of 22 serious sexual assaults. Samson was jailed for 14 years After raising a legal action last year with Digby Brown Solicitors, the woman - who was forced to undergo an abortion when she became pregnant after being raped - secured Â£500,000 from the Kirk. Her two brothers each received Â£250,000. The compensation is the most ever known to have been recovered from a religious body in Scotland. In a joint statement, the siblings said: ""Samson was evil and robbed us of our childhood and our future. ""Our case has never been about the money - raising a civil action in the courts was the only way we could get any sort of acknowledgement from the Church of Scotland. ""It's a shame that an organisation which promotes 'goodness and morals' can't do the right thing themselves and hold their hands up and apologise rather than force victims to go endure further legal proceedings. ""We nearly gave up so many times in getting the Kirk to accept responsibility so we're delighted this is now over and have the justice and closure we need to get on with life as best we can."" The statement concluded with a message for fellow victims. It said: ""To anyone else affected by abuse - be strong and step forward. You can get closure and together we can all make a difference."" Samson worked at Lord and Lady Polwarth as a superintendent alongside his wife, who was a matron. His offending was carried out between the 1970s and 1990s. Lawyers said some victims hid in cupboards or dog baskets to avoid the abuse and those who could not escape Samson were subjected to violent physical and sexual attacks. In 2013 he was jailed for 14 years at the High Court in Edinburgh after being found guilty of offences involving sexual abuse and the rape of 12 children. Eight of these offences happened at the Kirk-run care home with others occurring at different locations across Edinburgh and the Lothians. Kim Leslie, specialist abuse lawyer and partner at Digby Brown Solicitors, led the civil action against the Kirk on the grounds of vicarious liability. She said: ""Ian Samson was rightly jailed for abuse he inflicted upon children after exploiting his position with the Church of Scotland. ""The significant sum secured for our clients also gives you an idea of just how extreme Ian Samson was and how horrifically our clients suffered - in terms of settlements made public against religious groups, this is certainly the highest value I'm aware of in the 20 years I've practised law. ""Sadly, there will be other brave survivors who have fallen victim to similar campaigns of abuse and to them I would say stay strong, keep going and when you're ready to talk or take action then there's a wealth of support for you when the time is right."" A Church of Scotland spokeswoman said: ""The abuses perpetrated by Ian Samson at Lord and Lady Polwarth Home in the 1970s are matters which have been examined by the criminal courts and by the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry and for which we have expressed our deep and sincere regret. ""We became aware of the full facts in 2013 at which point we offered our full support to the victims. ""While Samson's abuse of children was wider than his activity in Lord and Lady Polwarth Home, it felt important to us that there was full acknowledgment of the harm which did occur in our care at the time, and the longer-term consequences for three siblings involved."" The spokeswoman said the Church had carried out a full independent review of the circumstances so it could learn lessons for its safeguarding practices today. The statement concluded: ""Whilst this settlement can never undo what has been done, we hope that it finally brings a sense of justice to the individuals affected and provides some small redress for the trauma which they experienced while in our care."" The sum recovered from the Kirk emerged following the opening last week of a Â£10mredress scheme for abuse survivors. It will be available to people who have a terminal illness or are aged 70 or over and has been introduced ahead of a wider payment scheme that is due to open in 2021. Janine Rennie, chief executive of Wellbeing Scotland, said she hopes the compensation opens the floodgates for survivors to come forward but acknowledged money cannot compensate for a life of abuse. She told BBC Scotland: ""I think there should be multi-millions for every survivor who's been abused in a care setting. ""For many of the people we're working with, they're unable to work and that can be through physical health issues or mental health issues. ""Many suffer from complex PTSD and that means a lot are unable to leave their house."" Ms Rennie said around two thirds have been unable to achieve any kind of employment at all and many didn't have an education. She added: ""How do you compensate for that and how do you compensate for a survivor who from morning to night in their life wants to complete suicide? ""For many of the survivors in this situation it'll be too late because many of them will have already completed suicide or many will have died natural causes."" Ms Rennie said she has worked with 2,500 people who were abused in care but stressed that is only the people who have come forward. She described the true scale of the problem as ""potentially massive"".

Anti-social behaviour 'nightmare' ignored,"Anti-social behaviour that leaves victims ""living a nightmare"" is being ignored by authorities across England and Wales, a report warns. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove said police, local councils and housing providers were downplaying the harm caused by crimes such as vandalism. Victims being repeatedly targeted were left to ""suffer in silence"", she said. Police chiefs and the Local Government Association said they took anti-social behaviour seriously. But their resources were under strain and they needed more funding to tackle the problem, they said. People 'scared to be in their homes' Syringes buried in children's sand pit Huge increase in 'petty' council fines Launching the report, called Anti-Social Behaviour: Living a Nightmare, Baroness Newlove said ""depressingly little"" had changed sinceher husband Garry was kicked to death outside their homeafter confronting vandals in 2007. ""It seems implausible that, 12 years later, here I am still raising the issue of anti-social behaviour,"" she said. ""The feedback from victims is that, all too often, they feel they are being persistently targeted by their perpetrators, and yet persistently ignored by those with the power to prevent and intervene."" Anti-social behaviour is conduct that can cause harassment, alarm or distress. It includes vandalism, street drinking, prostitution-related activity, and nuisance neighbours,according to the police.uk website,external. Baroness Newlove, the Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, says victims are being left to ""suffer in silence"" Baroness Newlove said it was ""infuriating"" that anti-social behaviour was sometimes referred to as ""low-level crime"". ""That description illustrates very neatly how [anti-social behaviour] is often treated as a series of isolated incidents, rather than taking into account the cumulative effect that it has on its victims."" Her report says anti-social behaviour can cause ""immense distress and suffering"" to victims, having negative aspects on their mental health, sleep, work, and relationships. Sarah (not her real name), from Newport in south Wales, says residents in her area ""fear for their own safety"" after a big increase in prostitution-related activity in recent years. She describes how pimps and kerb-crawlers have become highly visible during the day - and says that on one occasion a client of a sex worker made ""obscene gestures"" towards her at 9.30am. Prostitutes and their clients have also been seen in the playground of a local primary school, she says. Sarah says she has ""lost count"" of the number of times she has complained to police and the local council, to no avail. ""It's around the clock. I'm an adult, but when you've got a young girl standing there, she's vulnerable,"" she said. ""The drugs problem is open. Police drive straight past, unless they have a short-term [anti-crime] drive. ""It's just lawless. I think we're in a containment area."" Residents 'afraid' of street drinkers 'Universal Credit forced me into sex work' GP picking up sex trade condoms 'daily' Police 101 call delays 'unacceptable' Written in partnership with Nottingham Trent University and charity ASB Help, the commissioner's report says victims of anti-social behaviour are passed between agencies and face lengthy delays when calling the 101 police non-emergency number. It also found that a mechanism known as the ""community trigger"", which allows victims to require agencies to review the response to the anti-social behaviour they reported, was ""largely unknown"". Jenny Herrera, from ASB Help, said there were fundamental problems with the mechanism and called for central government to intervene to ensure it was ""fit for purpose"". The Crime Survey for England and Wales estimated 37% of adult respondents experienced or witnessed anti-social behaviour in their local area last year, the highest proportion since the question was first asked in 2011-12. But separate figures show around 1.4 million incidents of anti-social behaviour were recorded by police in 2018, a 16% fall on the previous 12 months. The Home Office welcomed the Victims' Commissioner's report and said it would consider the recommendations ""carefully"". ""The government is committed to tackling anti-social behaviour and ensuring victims get the response they deserve,"" it said. A graph showing the overall changes in offences and charges in England and Wales National Police Chiefs' Council lead for Anti-Social Behaviour, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, said the police were ""only one part of the solution"" and they were working with local authorities and other agencies to tackle anti-social behaviour. ""Forces are under increasing strain as they deal with rising crime, demand that is more complex and a raised terror threat with fewer officers,"" he continued. ""Further long-term funding is needed and we are working with the Home Office and police and crime commissioners to make the case at the next spending review."" The Local Government Association said: ""Councils know people look to them to tackle the anti-social behaviour, which can make a law-abiding resident's life hell or blight an entire neighbourhood. ""It's a role they take extremely seriously but one which is being made increasingly challenging as a result of losing 60p out of every Â£1 they had from government to spend on services in the past decade.""

Deputy attorney general tells Trump he quits,"Rod Rosenstein: ""We enforce the law without fear or favour"" Rod Rosenstein, the US deputy attorney general who oversaw the special counsel inquiry into President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia, has resigned. Mr Rosenstein, who had a fraught working relationship with Mr Trump, will step down on 11 May in a departure that had been expected for months. In his letter, he paid tribute to Mr Trump, even praising the president's ""courtesy and humour"". Mr Trump once tweeted an image showing Mr Rosenstein jailed for treason. Mr Rosenstein - who was originally appointed by Republican President George W Bush - had been expected to resign in March following the appointment of William Barr as attorney general. But the justice department second-in-command stayed in the job a while longer to help Mr Barr manage a redacted public release of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. The report cleared the Trump campaign of conspiring with Russia to sway the 2016 election, but did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds In his letter, Mr Rosenstein praises some of what he calls the Department of Justice's achievements and its employees' ""devotion to duty"". ""I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humour you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity,"" he wrote, addressing the president directly. ""The Department of Justice pursues those goals while operating in accordance with the rule of law. The rule of law is the foundation of America. It secures our freedom, allows our citizens to flourish, and enables our nation to serve as a model of liberty and justice for all."" He goes on to say that ""truth is not determined by opinion polls"". ""We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle."" In his conclusion, he echoes one of Mr Trump's campaign slogans: ""We keep the faith, we follow the rules, and we always put America first."" The White House said Mr Trump had already nominated Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen to replace Mr Rosenstein. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Rod Rosenstein is leaving the justice department, and he's doing it on his own terms. Not too long ago, such a dignified exit would have come as a real surprise to most observers. Donald Trump frequently seemed to view Mr Rosenstein as an internal threat. It got so bad that Mr Rosenstein reportedly expressed fear that he would be unceremoniously sacked via presidential tweet. Rosenstein managed to navigate the hazardous terrain of the Trump administration, however, seeing the special counsel investigation that he initiated to its conclusion. It is that Russia inquiry, with its no-Trump-conspiracy conclusion and open question on presidential obstruction, that will be Mr Rosenstein's legacy. Mr Rosenstein announced his departure with a six-paragraph mini-lecture on the importance of respect for the rule of law, and of a justice department free from political influence. That could be viewed as a not-so-subtle rebuke of the president's near-constant badgering of justice department officials, although it will almost certainly fall on deaf ears. Perhaps, however, it will allow the long-time government lawyer a measure of satisfaction, believing he had the last word. In this administration, that is a not unremarkable achievement. In May 2017, Mr Rosenstein was left in charge of appointing someone to oversee the Russia investigation after Mr Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Jeff Sessions, who was attorney general at the time, had already recused himself, meaning that his deputy had to take on the responsibility. Mr Rosenstein surprised the White House by appointing Mr Mueller, a former FBI director. The deputy attorney general spent the past two years overseeing Mr Mueller's work and defending the inquiry from attacks by Mr Trump, who continually condemned the probe as a ""witch hunt"". Mr Rosenstein's departure seemed imminent after the New York Times last September reported that he had discussed ousting Mr Trump. Citing anonymous sources, the newspaper said Mr Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording the president in order to prove he was dysfunctional. He had supposedly cited the 25th amendment of the constitution, which allows for the removal of a president if deemed unfit for office. Mr Rosenstein dismissed the claims as ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"", and a justice department source told the BBC at the time that the comment had been sarcastic. But former acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe said in a TV interview that Mr Rosenstein was serious when he suggested wearing a wire inside the White House to covertly tape the president. Mr Trump accused Mr Rosenstein on Twitter of ""illegal and treasonous"" activity. While the deputy attorney general managed to weather that controversy, Mr Trump in November retweeted an image of the deputy attorney general behind prison bars. The Mueller report - in 60 seconds.

Care home group facing administrationFour Seasons Health Care is expected to appoint administrators after struggling with its debts.Business,"One of Britain's largest care home groups, Four Seasons Health Care, has gone into administration. Two of the holding companies behind the firm appointed administrators on Tuesday after struggling to repay their debts. The group serves about 17,000 residents and patients and employs some 20,000 staff. Four Seasons said the move would not affect care arrangements or lead to the closure of homes. Group medical director Dr Claire Royston commented: ""Today's news does not change the way we operate or how our homes are run or prompt any change for residents, families, employees and indeed suppliers. ""It marks the latest stage in the group's restructuring process and allows us to move ahead with an orderly, independent sales process."" It is the biggest care home group to have gone into administration since Southern Cross in 2011. Care home operator to withdraw services Brexit: Hospital suppliers stockpiling food Four Seasons has struggled with cuts to local authority care fees and rising costs, and has repeatedly warned about its long-term stability. The GMB union said the government needed to step in urgently to reassure Four Seasons staff and residents. Rehana Azam, GMB national secretary, said: ""The possible collapse of Four Seasons shows our care system is in crisis, it is crumbling beneath us because the funding isn't there."" Four Seasons said it had appointed professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) to handle the administration. While the holding companies - Elli Finance (UK) and Elli Investments - are in administration, the operating companies that run Four Season homes are not. The group said it had secured funding to ensure continuity of care while it seeks a new owner. Four Seasons, which has 322 residential and nursing care homes, has been struggling to restructure its debt pile of more than Â£500m. Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm led by Guy Hands, bought the group in 2012 for Â£825m but has since seen a Â£450m writedown on its investment. It has also ceded control of the group to US hedge fund H/2 Capital Partners, which holds a large amount of its debt. A number of care businesses have run into trouble recently, raising questions about the current funding model for social care. Last year, Allied Healthcare, which supports 13,000 people, said it was struggling with debts, blaming low fees paid by councils. The Care Quality Commission, a regulator,later issued a notice saying it had serious doubts about Allied Healthcare's future. A majority of Four Seasons' operations are funded by the state, with about a fifth of them funded privately. Colletta Smith, consumer affairs correspondent If you live in a Four Seasons care home, the first thing to say is don't panic. It's the job of the administrator to keep things running and try and find a buyer for all the care homes - nothing will change immediately. If your care home is eventually earmarked for closure, your council is responsible for making sure everyone is cared for without any interruptions - you won't be left out on the street. If the local authority pays for some or all of your care bill, it is responsible for finding new accommodation. You can choose another care home yourself, though, as long as it suits your needs and doesn't cost more than the council has agreed to spend. If you pay your own bills, then you'll need to find a new home yourself. But the council may give suggestions and should do a care assessment to make sure you get something suitable. It's also worth knowing that if several residents from the same home want to move together, then the council must try to help them do this, so it's worth asking. If you're not happy with your care during the administration or under a new owner, you should tell the care regulator.

"Instagram helps top artists boost earningsBut there are claims that ""a lot of songwriters are making less than minimum wage"".","Steve Mac - who co-wrote Ed Sheeran's Shape of You - and Ed himself were some of the top earners The money that artists receive when their tracks get played has just hit a record high. In 2018 Â£746 million was collected - a rise of 4% on 2017. PRS for music, which gathers the royalties for artists, counted songs used on Facebook and Instagram Stories for the first time. But according to singer-songwriter Ruth-Anne Cunningham, ""a lot of songwriters are making less than minimum wage"". Ruth-Anne, who's worked with Avicii, JoJo and John Legend, says ""it's great everything is starting to get monetised"" but adds, ""unless you have a top 40 radio hit you don't make a substantial income"". ""It's not like you have one song that's a hit and you're good for life - not anymore"" The boss of PRS says the rise of streaming has made it harder for them to monitor what's being played - and agrees that those trying to earn a living from music are losing out. ""The very successful people are doing extremely well,"" Robert Ashcroft tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""The challenge is, if you're trying to make a living and you're not a performer it's getting more difficult."" Ruth-Anne says that despite performing as well as writing, that's something she's got experience of: ""I've had that where I've had massive hits and made money, but then had to be a vocal coach too. ""Back in the day you could make money from being on an album, now people see streams and people see 10 million and think that's a lot - but a songwriter might make Â£400 from that."" This video can not be played Songwriter Ed Drewett: How I write songs for 1D and Little Mix PRS doesn't have exact figures on how much money comes directly from music being played on Facebook and Instagram, but it says tracks being played online now make Â£146m a year, up nearly 20% on the year before. Robert says that with more and more streams, and songs seemingly having a shorter shelf life, more money ""gravitates to the top"". ""We have 135,000 members, and somewhere around 25,000 out of them make a real living out of songwriting. ""If you're in the middle or at the lower end of the earning spectrum it's getting harder and harder. ""In the old days if you sold a CD or a song on a CD you got money - now of course you actually have to have people actually listen to your song. ""The subscription services are the ones that actually pay, but you pay a flat fee per month so you can listen as much as you like. The more people listen, the lower the value per stream."" There are still places PRS doesn't collect money from. One area that isn't yet licensed for music use is gaming. ""Audiences are not necessarily playing the game - they're watching other game play and music is being streamed alongside the action. ""We're now looking at whether we can licence that footage. ""The more we have then the more variety there is - the more variety there is, the more of a chance the people in the middle have got of making a living out of it.""

Bodies found in freezer spark murder hunt,"The entrance to the block has been cordoned off while investigations take place A murder inquiry is under way after two women's bodies were found inside a freezer at a flat in east London. Officers found the human remains when they were called to Vandome Close in Canning Town. The women have not been formally identified and post-mortem examinations have not yet taken place. Two men, aged 50 and 34, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Both remain in custody at London police stations. They were arrested at two separate addresses in west and east London, both of which are being searched by police. The Metropolitan Police said it was trying to identify both victims and contact their next of kin as a ""priority"". The family of 37-year-old Mary-Jane Mustafa, who has been missing since May 2018, have gathered at the scene in Canning Town. Her sister Mel Mustafa, 47, said: ""She is the most kind-hearted person you could meet and I still don't believe it's her."" Cousin Ceylan Sunda, 53, added: ""The family's upside down. We don't even know for sure yet."" Officers were called to the address at 11:45 BST on Friday following concerns for the welfare of a male resident. Det Supt Paul Monk said a ""large crime scene"" was in place and expected to remain ""for some time"". By Greg McKenzie, BBC London I've managed to get inside an adjacent block next door to the flats that have been taped off by police. In the back garden there is a blue tent and police cordons are in place. It's a quiet residential area in east London - but one person has told me they are petrified to live here. The Met has now confirmed the bodies were found in a freezer. It comes after a witness said a fridge was carried out of the property on the Friday and into the back of a police van. So far in 2019, more than 40 murder investigations have been launched in London by the Metropolitan and British Transport police forces.

Cwm Taf maternity in special measures,"The review looked into services at hospitals in the south Wales valleys A health board's maternity services are ""under extreme pressure"" and ""dysfunctional"", according to a damning independent review. The health minister has put services into special measures after failings were uncovered at the Royal Glamorgan and Prince Charles hospitals in the south Wales valleys. It was prompted by concerns about the deaths of a number of babies. The review heard women had""distressing experiences and poor care"". It was prompted by 25 serious incidents, including eight stillbirths and five neonatal deaths, between January 2016 and last September. Health Minister Vaughan Gething orderedthe separate independent review into the Cwm Taf health board services,external, which was published on Tuesday. It found that the suspicions and concerns raised by women were not taken seriously, while there was ""little evidence of effective clinical leadership at any level"". This video can not be played Jessica Western says she is still fighting to find out why her daughter Macie died ""Many women had felt something was wrong with their baby or tried to convey the level of pain they were experiencing but they were ignored or patronised, and no action was taken, with tragic outcomes including stillbirth and neonatal death of their babies,"" the report said. One woman said she felt worthless, adding: ""I'm broken from the whole experience, the lack of care and compassion."" Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity problems Mothers ignored and made to feel worthless Gething rejects quit call over Cwm Taf 'My baby is buried 4,000 miles away' The review also suggested that further cases should be looked at - going back to 2010 - to ""determine the extent of the under-reporting"" of issues and to provide assurance to the health board. Dr Frank Atherton, Wales' chief medical officer, said there had been a ""systemic failure to report incidents"", adding: ""The level of patient care has fallen far short of what we would expect."" The review, led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology, and the Royal College of Midwives, found 11 areas of immediate concern at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles in Merthyr Tydfil, including: Often no consultant obstetrician on the labour ward, and difficult to contact Not enough midwives, putting them under ""extreme pressure"" Consultants were not always available out of hours - and would take 45 minutes to get in ""Fragmented"" consultant cover while their roster arrangements were ""complex and inflexible"" High numbers of locum staff at all levels Staff not aware of guidelines, protocols, triggers and escalations ""Punitive culture"" within the service and staff felt senior management did not listen to their concerns, which they had ""voiced repeatedly over a long period of time"" The review said it was ""dismayed"" that an internal report, written by a consultant midwife, highlighting many safety concerns last September was not acted upon, ""thereby continuing to expose women to unacceptable risks"". There was an under-reporting of serious incidents for at least four years but senior midwives said there was a reluctance to engage with the process because of a ""fear of blame"". There had also been 67 stillbirths going back to 2010 which had not been reported for inclusion in statistics for a national database. Cwm Taf's chief executive Allison Williams offered a public apology saying she was ""deeply sorry for the failings"" identified. She said the health board fully accepted the findings and putting things right was now the organisation's utmost priority. ""Some of the feedback we have received from patients is extremely distressing,"" she added. ""I would also like to say sorry to our staff who have felt that their concerns have not been listened to."" Prince Charles Hospital now has an expanded special care baby unit and six en-suite delivery rooms Mr Gething apologised to the women and families affected buthas rejected calls to resignand said the failings was not ""a simple one person, one group is responsible"". He called the findings ""serious and concerning"" and said they would be ""difficult and upsetting to read for both families and staff working within the service"". ""I am determined that the actions I am announcing today will drive the changes necessary in Cwm Taf,"" he added. ""It is vitally important that this work provides reassurance for families currently receiving care in their hospitals."" Cwm Taf told to 'get back on track' 26 baby deaths in maternity probe Maternity staff 'overwhelmed' by demand The minister has put the maternity services into special measures - the Welsh Government's highest level of intervention. Cwm Taf as a whole has also had its status escalated from enhanced monitoring to targeted intervention. An independent panel will now oversee those services to drive improvements at the hospitals - which handle 3,700 births each year. It will be led by the former chairman of the Welsh Ambulance Service and ex-Gwent chief constable Mick Giannasi. It will look into 43 cases and Dr Atherton said within that group ""there will have been avoidable harm"". The review suggested further cases dating back to 2010 should now be looked at We heard rumours before publication that this report would be ""bad"" but few perhaps expected it to be as damning and damaging. Each page highlights one failing after another. Certainly it's one of the most critical reports ever published about healthcare in Wales It talks of a dysfunctional service, badly led, with mistakes not being reported due to a fear of blame. And consultants were not able to respond to life-threatening cases out-of-hours for 45 minutes. Some behaviour was also unacceptable, with midwives discussing colleagues on a Whatsapp group, as being either ""naughty"" or ""nice"". All of this, at a health board up until recently considered one of the best performing in Wales. There will be questions from the health board but also questions about the Welsh Government's oversight. Senior officials saying we can only act on what we're told will ring hollow with families. The review casts a doubt on the credibility of the health board's own ongoing investigation into 43 cases. They want to take it over and will take a look at cases back to 2010. Yes, the health board's maternity services are now in special measures but families will ask whether any individuals will be held to account. In January theinvestigators demanded immediate action- including more cover by senior doctors on the labour wards. Cwm Taf health board had already been planning changes and since March, specialist neonatal care is now only provided on one site - Prince Charles Hospital. The Royal Glamorgan still has a midwife-led unit for less complicated births. The health board was renamed Cwm Taf Morgannwg at the start of April, when it also became responsible for services in the Bridgend area.

Rail firms want new body to run network,"An independent body should oversee the rail network, according to Britain's railway companies. In submissions made to a government-appointed review into rail, the firms also said long-distance routes should be serviced by more than one company. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) added that control of commuter routes could be handed over to local authorities. It suggested commuter routes could be organised in a similar way to Transport for London in the capital. Local government oversees timetables and organisation in London, with private operators subcontracted to provide the services. ""We are suggesting replacing the current franchise system as it stands at the moment,"" RDG regional director Robert Nisbettold BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""These proposals would result in a much more joined-up railway and greater accountability to passengers. ""We believe that would be best done by a system of dynamic contracts around the country. ""There would be an overarching apolitical body that would be in charge of this system, dealing with the trade-offs, but also policing it and issuing rules that bind and fines that bite. ""We are putting forward what we think is a compelling vision for both the public and private sectors working together in partnership, underpinned by an easier fare system which would deliver the best fare for any passenger whenever they took their journey."" The Strategic Rail Authority, which was established in 2000, used to carry out this role, but it was abolished in 2004. Cable thefts lead to more train delays, says Network Rail Operators say government should lose oversight of rail Rail regulator orders Network Rail to improve performance Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said: ""In the major northern cities, and across the Northern Powerhouse, this devolution would make it possible to integrate transport better. ""This is already being worked towards, with more touch-in-and-out travel within - and in between - our towns and cities in the North. ""This would be used by more of us as passengers if the government supports the fare system being reformed more quickly."" If you found the plot of Avengers: Endgame hard to follow - constant jumps backward and forward in time and endless reprises of old plots - then you can give up now on trying to understand what is happening on the reshaping of the railways. There has been constant discussion of the best structure for the industry since privatisation in the late 1990s. There is a well-established pattern: pressure for change gradually builds up to a reorganisation, which is given a short period of grace before the cycle begins again. We are at the late stages of a cycle, with Keith Williams, the former British Airways chief executive, in charge of delivering the new structural plan. The Rail Delivery Group's plans follow the Avengers: Endgame model - there are blasts from the past and missed ideas that have been tried before. The idea for a new central, non-political rail authority is both. There was a Strategic Rail Authority, which did some good - and along the way, trod on many important people's toes - which might have played a part in its eventual disbanding in 2004. Handing control of commuter routes to local authorities is an extension of what has already happened on some London commuter routes, with the creation of the London Overground, while the idea for competition between inter-city operators is straight out of Sir John Major's original privatisation blueprint. Mr Williams' task is to make sense of this convoluted plot and produce a plan that survives beyond the normal cycle of change. Currently, most UK rail services are operated by fixed-term franchises, which involve the Department for Transport (DfT) setting out a specification covering areas such as service levels, upgrades and performance. Train companies then submit bids to run the franchise and the DfT selects one of the applicants. Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash said the RDG was proposing a ""deregulated free-for-all"" that would lead to fare rises for customers. The RDG's vision is likely to be seen as an attempt to stave off nationalisation, as proposed by Labour. But the government has said privatisation has helped ""transform"" the industry. The UK's rail network has been beset by problems, with the East Coast Mainline brought back under government control in May - for the third time in a decade. Last year, hundreds of trains were cancelled amid a huge timetable reorganisation on services including Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern. This month, Stagecoach was barred from three rail franchise bids, including one in partnership with Virgin Group. The DfT disallowed the bids because they did not meet pensions rules. Virgin was bidding to renew the West Coast franchise in partnership with Stagecoach and France's SNCF. Stagecoach had also applied for the East Midlands and South Eastern franchises, both of which have been rejected. Keith Williams, former chief executive of British Airways, is due to deliver a report on the future of the industry this autumn.

Bodies found in freezer sparks murder hunt,"The entrance to the block has been cordoned off while investigations take place A murder inquiry is under way after two women's bodies were found inside a freezer at a flat in east London. Officers found the human remains when they were called to Vandome Close in Canning Town. The women have not been formally identified and post-mortem examinations have not yet taken place. Two men, aged 50 and 34, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Both remain in custody at London police stations. They were arrested at two separate addresses in west and east London, both of which are being searched by police. The Metropolitan Police said it was trying to identify both victims and contact their next of kin as a ""priority"". The family of 37-year-old Mary-Jane Mustafa, who has been missing since May 2018, have gathered at the scene in Canning Town. Her sister Mel Mustafa, 47, said: ""She is the most kind-hearted person you could meet and I still don't believe it's her."" Cousin Ceylan Sunda, 53, added: ""The family's upside down. We don't even know for sure yet."" Officers were called to the address at 11:45 BST on Friday following concerns for the welfare of a male resident. Det Supt Paul Monk said a ""large crime scene"" was in place and expected to remain ""for some time"". By Greg McKenzie, BBC London I've managed to get inside an adjacent block next door to the flats that have been taped off by police. In the back garden there is a blue tent and police cordons are in place. It's a quiet residential area in east London - but one person has told me they are petrified to live here. The Met has now confirmed the bodies were found in a freezer. It comes after a witness said a fridge was carried out of the property on the Friday and into the back of a police van. So far in 2019, more than 40 murder investigations have been launched in London by the Metropolitan and British Transport police forces.

IS leader in first video for five years,"This video can not be played Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has not been seen on video for five years The Islamic State group has released a video of a man it says is its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, vowing to seek revenge for its loss of territory. He has not been seen since 2014, when he proclaimed from Mosul the creation of a ""caliphate"" across parts of Syria and Iraq. In this new footage, Baghdadi acknowledges defeat at Baghuz, the group's last stronghold in the region. It is not clear when the video was recorded. IS says it was shot in April. The footage was posted on the militant group's al-Furqan media network. A US State Department spokesman said the tapes would be inspected by analysts to ascertain their authenticity, adding that the US-led coalition remains committed to ensuring any IS ""leaders who remain are delivered the justice that they deserve"". Baghdadi says that he has had pledges of allegiance from militants in Burkina Faso and Mali, and talks about the protests in Sudan and Algeria - saying jihad is the only solution to ""tyrants"". Both countries have seen their long-term rulers overthrown this month. Where is IS still active around the world? Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat This video can not be played Journalist Michael Weiss: 'Baghdadi is sending a message he is still in charge' Baghdadi's image disappears towards the end of the video and an audio recording of him discussing the Sri Lanka Easter Sunday attacks is played instead, suggesting that this part was recorded after the main video was filmed. Baghdadi says the Sri Lanka attacks were carried out as revenge for the fall of the Syrian town of Baghuz. BBC Monitoring analystMina al-Lami points out initial IS claims regarding the Sri Lanka attacks,externalmake no reference to the town. Baghdadi has not been seen in public since this appearance in Mosul, Iraq in 2014 Baghdadi - an Iraqi whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri - was last heard from in an audio recording last August. At the time, he appeared to be trying to shift attention away from his group's crippling losses, BBC Middle East correspondent Martin Patience says. But this latest 18-minute video addresses the losses head on. ""The battle for Baghuz is over,"" he says, before adding:  ""There will be more to come after this battle."" He also reportedly says the group is fighting a ""battle of attrition"". Analysis by BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner For his hardcore followers, there is almost as much symbolism in this video as there is content. The underlying message is not just one of survival against the odds. The optics here are vintage Osama Bin Laden: the jihadist leader squatting cross-legged in an anonymous room beside a short, personalised, paratrooper version of an AK assault rifle, the quasi-military fishing waistcoat, the attentive companions calmly discussing plans, and the long, prematurely ageing grey beard (he is only 47). Over the last five years, Islamic State has largely eclipsed al-Qaeda on the media front. At the same time, IS has been reaching out to potential jihadist affiliates in areas of Africa and Asia that have previously looked to al-Qaeda for support. The overriding aim of this video is clear: to show that despite its resounding military defeat IS has survived and that its leader, with a $25m bounty on his head, is still at large. At its peak, IS ruled over 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) stretching across the Iraq-Syria border. Militants carried out widespread and systematic attacks that the UN has said may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The atrocities included massacres of troops and civilians, and the abduction and sexual enslavement of thousands of women and girls from Iraq's Yazidi religious minority. But by 2016 IS was in retreat. The next year, it lost Mosul in Iraq, depriving Baghdadi and his followers of the city where they had declared the caliphate's creation. In October 2017,they were driven from the Syrian city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the caliphate. They continued to lose territory throughout 2018, culminating in the group retreating to Baghuz. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared they had taken control of the town, announcing the end of the ""caliphate"" in March 2019. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was born in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq. As a child he is said to have had a passion for Koranic recitation and religious law, chastising members of his own family for falling short of his stringent religious standards. But it was during his time in graduate school, when he was completing a Master's and PhD in Koranic Studies at Iraq's Saddam University for Islamic Studies, that he became involved with hardline Islamist groups. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? By the end of 2000 he had embraced Salafist jihadism, and would go on to become involved with al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) - from which the Islamic State militant group was born. Since his 2014 public appearance he has remained silent for long periods, punctuated only by unconfirmed reports of his death and a few unverified audio recordings.

"Social mobility in UK 'virtually stagnant'Inequality will remain entrenched in the UK ""from birth to work"" unless ministers act, a report warns.UK","Inequality will remain entrenched ""from birth to work"" unless the government takes urgent action, the Social Mobility Commission has warned. ItsState of the Nation report,externalcovering England, Scotland and Wales, said the situation had remained ""virtually stagnant"" since 2014. It is calling on ministers to provide additional funding for older teenagers in education and to extend free childcare to more low income families. The government said it would take the recommendations seriously. The findings will come as a setback to Theresa May who promised to tackle the ""burning injustice"" of social inequality when she entered Downing Street in 2016. However, the following year, all of the commissioners on the Social Mobility Commission - set up in 2010 to monitor and promote social mobility - resigned,saying the government was too focused on Brexit to deal with creating a fairer Britain. This video can not be played Law graduate Paris McKenzie describes the difficulty she has faced finding work Law graduate Paris McKenzie, 25, wants to be a solicitor but said there are not enough training contracts in her home city of Nottingham. ""I have barely come across any, and I constantly search for them. There are lots in London,"" she said. But the single mother said she did not ""have the means"" to move to the capital, where she said she would not have support and would struggle to pick up her son from nursery herself. ""It's a catch 22, my opportunities are very limited,"" she added. Dame Martina Milburn, who has since been appointed as the new chairwoman, said she sensed there was now ""a real commitment"" from the government. However, she said the biggest concern was not stagnation, but that the problem might actually get worse. Dame Martina Milburn says those born privileged are likely to remain privileged ""There's still a big shift - if you want to be socially mobile - towards London,"" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""I think you're three times more likely to move to London if you're from a professional background than if you're from a working class background."" Young highly sceptical of social mobility The worst places to grow up poor Almost a third of graduates 'overeducated' Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he welcomed the ""thorough"" report - the first since the new commissioners were appointed - but stopped short of saying the government would adopt all of its recommendations. The report recommends: a ""significant increase"" in funding for all 16 to 19-year-olds in education, with a special ""student premium"" for the disadvantaged extending the offer of 30 hours of free childcare a week to cover households where one parent is working eight hours a week - currently one parent must work at least 16 hours the government agreeing to pay the voluntary living wage to all of its employees and contracted workers, including cleaners and catering staff The report found those from better-off backgrounds were almost 80% more likely to be in a professional job than their working class peers. It said the proportion of people from professional backgrounds who were in professional jobs was 60% last year. In contrast, only 34% of those from working class backgrounds had professional jobs last year. And both figures had changed only slightly over the past four years. ""Being born privileged means you are likely to remain privileged,"" said Dame Martina, who is also chief executive of the Prince's Trust. ""But being born disadvantaged means you may have to overcome a series of barriers to ensure you and your children are not stuck in the same trap."" The commission said it welcomed the findings showing that Scotland and Wales were becoming more socially mobile, with a person's socio-economic status less likely to be determined by their parents' socio-economic status than in 2014. It said this was especially encouraging in light of the limited social mobility in Britain as a whole. The Social Mobility Commission said an increasing number of students from low-income families were entering university by the age of 19. That proportion has now reached 26%, compared with 43% of better-off peers. But, five years after graduating, those graduates who had been on free school meals at school were in jobs that earned 11.5% less than other graduates, the report said. It found barriers to getting a top job were there from the start - about a half (52%) of disadvantaged teenagers leave school without basic qualifications and many get stuck in low-paid work. Adult education could help to redress that, said the report, but almost all forms of adult education have been in decline since 2010. There were also longer-term concerns that divisions could worsen as low-paid and low-skilled jobs were more likely to become automated in the future. Professor Diane Reay, from the University of Cambridge told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The expansion in the labour market is at the bottom - in the low-paid casualised jobs - rather than in the high-paid, more elite jobs. ""We need to radically change the hierarchical structure of English society, not just the social class of a few individuals."" Paul Gregg, a professor of economic and social policy at the University of Bath, who resigned from the Social Mobility Commission in 2017, told the programme: ""It's still the case that Brexit is sucking all the political oxygen in government [from] any kind of social reforms."" The education secretary said employment had risen in every UK region under this government; wages were outstripping inflation; the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has narrowed; and the proportion of 16 and 17-year-olds in education or apprenticeships was at its highest ever. Career progression and better-paid work is more likely if people move regions - particularly if they go to London, the data shows. Too often provincial towns and cities don't have the employment infrastructure to ensure career progression, notably in professions like law and accountancy. Those from wealthier backgrounds are more likely to be able to make that kind of move, with the resources and support to grab opportunities wherever they may be. Some believe devolving power and prestige to local government and combined authorities is the way to ensure a more even spread of growth and new jobs - and make the country less reliant on London. In England, the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine are initiatives to achieve just that within the wider industrial strategy. But there are concerns that not enough resources are available to achieve significant structural change.

Firms want new body to oversee railways,"An independent body should oversee the rail network, according to Britain's railway companies. In submissions made to a government-appointed review into rail, the firms also said long-distance routes should be serviced by more than one company. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) added that control of commuter routes could be handed over to local authorities. It suggested commuter routes could be organised in a similar way to Transport for London in the capital. Local government oversees timetables and organisation in London, with private operators subcontracted to provide the services. ""We are suggesting replacing the current franchise system as it stands at the moment,"" RDG regional director Robert Nisbettold BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""These proposals would result in a much more joined-up railway and greater accountability to passengers. ""We believe that would be best done by a system of dynamic contracts around the country. ""There would be an overarching apolitical body that would be in charge of this system, dealing with the trade-offs, but also policing it and issuing rules that bind and fines that bite. ""We are putting forward what we think is a compelling vision for both the public and private sectors working together in partnership, underpinned by an easier fare system which would deliver the best fare for any passenger whenever they took their journey."" The Strategic Rail Authority, which was established in 2000, used to carry out this role, but it was abolished in 2004. Cable thefts lead to more train delays, says Network Rail Operators say government should lose oversight of rail Rail regulator orders Network Rail to improve performance Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said: ""In the major northern cities, and across the Northern Powerhouse, this devolution would make it possible to integrate transport better. ""This is already being worked towards, with more touch-in-and-out travel within - and in between - our towns and cities in the North. ""This would be used by more of us as passengers if the government supports the fare system being reformed more quickly."" If you found the plot of Avengers: Endgame hard to follow - constant jumps backward and forward in time and endless reprises of old plots - then you can give up now on trying to understand what is happening on the reshaping of the railways. There has been constant discussion of the best structure for the industry since privatisation in the late 1990s. There is a well-established pattern: pressure for change gradually builds up to a reorganisation, which is given a short period of grace before the cycle begins again. We are at the late stages of a cycle, with Keith Williams, the former British Airways chief executive, in charge of delivering the new structural plan. The Rail Delivery Group's plans follow the Avengers: Endgame model - there are blasts from the past and missed ideas that have been tried before. The idea for a new central, non-political rail authority is both. There was a Strategic Rail Authority, which did some good - and along the way, trod on many important people's toes - which might have played a part in its eventual disbanding in 2004. Handing control of commuter routes to local authorities is an extension of what has already happened on some London commuter routes, with the creation of the London Overground, while the idea for competition between inter-city operators is straight out of Sir John Major's original privatisation blueprint. Mr Williams' task is to make sense of this convoluted plot and produce a plan that survives beyond the normal cycle of change. Currently, most UK rail services are operated by fixed-term franchises, which involve the Department for Transport (DfT) setting out a specification covering areas such as service levels, upgrades and performance. Train companies then submit bids to run the franchise and the DfT selects one of the applicants. Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash said the RDG was proposing a ""deregulated free-for-all"" that would lead to fare rises for customers. The RDG's vision is likely to be seen as an attempt to stave off nationalisation, as proposed by Labour. But the government has said privatisation has helped ""transform"" the industry. The UK's rail network has been beset by problems, with the East Coast Mainline brought back under government control in May - for the third time in a decade. Last year, hundreds of trains were cancelled amid a huge timetable reorganisation on services including Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern. This month, Stagecoach was barred from three rail franchise bids, including one in partnership with Virgin Group. The DfT disallowed the bids because they did not meet pensions rules. Virgin was bidding to renew the West Coast franchise in partnership with Stagecoach and France's SNCF. Stagecoach had also applied for the East Midlands and South Eastern franchises, both of which have been rejected. Keith Williams, former chief executive of British Airways, is due to deliver a report on the future of the industry this autumn.

Born in LA, Singleton was considered a trailblazer for African-American directors in the 1990s. In 1992, he became the first African-American filmmaker to be nominated for the best director Oscar with his debut feature Boyz N The Hood. Fresh out of college, he also became the youngest ever director to be nominated for the accolade. He received a second nomination for best original screenplay for the film. Early on Monday, the director's family announced they had taken the ""agonising decision"" to remove him from life-support. ""We are grateful to his fans, friends and colleagues for the outpour of love and prayers during this incredibly difficult time,"" they said.

Singleton was born in 1968 and grew up in South Central Los Angeles.He told the Hollywood Reporter in 2014 his upbringing had made him ""more of a fighter,,externalmore of a hustler, and it made me really appreciate life in a different way as a storyteller"". After studying at a high school in Pasadena, Singleton went on to get a place at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Less than a month after graduation, he was making his formative Boyz N the Hood alongside producer Steve Nicolaides. The film, partly inspired by his childhood, explored themes of youth and friendship with the backdrop of inner-city violence in Los Angeles. The film was met with high-praise on its Cannes debut and went on to become a box-office success. It offered breakout roles for actors including Angela Bassett, Nia Long and Cuba Gooding Jr. It also offered rapper Ice Cube his acting debut. Alongside the Shaft remake in 2000, Singleton's other credits include Higher Learning and the aforementioned Poetic Justice, starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur. Singleton was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003 He also directed 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious and Michael Jackson's video for Remember the Time. More recently, he had focused on TV projects, directing episodes of Empire and American Crime Story, as well as acting as creator and executive producer on 2017's Snowfall. In interviews, Singleton has accused Hollywood of trying to ""homogenise"" black film-making. ""They want black people to be who they want them to be, as opposed to what they are. The black films now - so-called black films now - they're great. They're great films. But they're just product,"" he said in 2014.

Japan's emperor begins historic abdication,"This video can not be played The day began with private rituals in the Imperial Palace Japan's Emperor Akihito has declared his abdication in a historic ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. In his last public address as emperor, Akihito handed over the symbols of power and thanked the public for their support during his 30-year reign. The 85-year-old was given permission to abdicate after saying he felt unable to fulfil his role because of his age and declining health. He is the first Japanese monarch to stand down in more than 200 years. Akihito technically remained emperor until midnight (15:00 GMT on Tuesday). His eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, formally ascends the throne later on Wednesday. A new era - called Reiwa, meaning order and harmony - will begin in Japan's unique calendar. The life and reign of Akihito - the human emperor The prince who will take Japan into a new era The abdication in pictures While the emperor holds no political power, he serves as a national figurehead. Akihito has endeared himself to many Japanese people during his reign as he has interacted with those suffering from disease and disaster. In the morning, the emperor took part in a Shinto ceremony to report his plans to the mythological ancestors of Japan's imperial family. The emperor took part in private Shinto ceremonies to start the day The main ""Ceremony of the Abdication"" took place in a state room of the Imperial Palace in front of about 300 people including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Crown Prince Naruhito, and Crown Princess Masako. Imperial chamberlains carried the state and privy seals into the hall, along with a sacred sword and a jewel which are considered symbols of the imperial family. In a short ceremony, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addressed the emperor, saying: ""While keeping in our hearts the path that the emperor has walked, we will make utmost efforts to create a bright future for a proud Japan that is full of peace and hope."" Then, in his final speech as emperor, Akihito, wearing a Western-style morning coat, said he ""wished Japan and the world peace and happiness"". Akihito is the first Japanese emperor to step down in more than 200 years ""I am deeply grateful for the people that accepted me as a symbol and supported me,"" he said. ""I sincerely wish, together with the empress, that the Reiwa era which begins tomorrow will be a stable and fruitful one,"" he added. ""I pray, with all my heart, for peace and happiness for all the people in Japan and around the world."" The Imperial Treasures that make a man an emperor Reiwa: Naming a new era in Japan After helping his wife, Empress Michiko, down the steps of the ceremonial platform, the emperor bowed towards the gathered officials, then left the room. The 85-year-old had surgery for prostate cancer in 2003 and a heart bypass operation in 2012. In a rare speech in 2016, he said that he feared his age would make it hard for him to carry out his duties and strongly hinted that he wanted to stand down. Emperor Akihito's 2016 address to the nation Opinion polls showed that the vast majority of Japan sympathised with him, and a year later parliament enacted a law that made his abdication possible. Prince Naruhito will become Japan's 126th emperor - and will officially lead the country into the new Reiwa era. It will mark the end of the current Heisei era, which began when Akihito ascended the throne in 1989. The 59-year-old crown prince will lead the country into a new era The 59-year-old Oxford University graduate is married to Crown Princess Masako. Their only child, Princess Aiko, was born in 2001. Japan's current law prohibits women from inheriting the throne, so Princess Aiko's uncle Prince Fumihito is now first in line, followed by her cousin, 12-year-old Prince Hisahito. This video can not be played Princess Aiko, the only child of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, will not ascend the throne because she is female The princess, the palace and the shrinking royal line It's the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. Legends date it back to about 600 BC. The emperors used to be seen as gods, but Hirohito - the father of Akihito - publicly renounced his divinity as part of Japan's surrender at the end of World War Two. It was Emperor Akihito who helped repair Japan's post-war reputation. Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko meeting with evacuees after a tsunami in 2011 Previous emperors rarely interacted with the public, but Akihito redefined the role - and has come to be known for his compassion. In 1991, two years after he ascended the throne, Akihito and the empress broke with norms and knelt down to speak to people affected by a volcanic eruption in Nagasaki. Akihito also took up the role of a diplomat, becoming an unofficial ambassador for Japan and travelling abroad extensively. While Tuesday's was the first Japanese abdication in 200 years, it wasn't so rare historically. According to Japan's state broadcaster NHK, about half the country's emperors or empresses have done the same, and it happened frequently from the 8th Century to the 19th Century. The Golden Week break - Japan's annual spring holiday - has been extended to a record 10 days to mark the occasion. When Emperor Akihito succeeded his late father, the country was in mourning, but this time people will be going on holidays, to cinemas, or staying at home to watch the events on TV. Many said they would miss the departing emperor, who will now hold the title ""Joko"", which means ""grand emperor"" or  ""Emperor Emeritus"". ""I think the emperor is loved by the people,"" Morio Miyamoto told Reuters news agency. ""His image is one of encouraging the people, such as after disasters, and being close to the people."" ""The emperor worked very hard for 30 years so I hope the handing over of the baton to the new emperor will go smoothly,"" Mikiko Fujii told the agency. ""I'm sad but also hopeful about the next era. I hope it will be a peaceful, gentle period for the second half of my life,"" said Masatoshi Kujirai, on his way to a Shinto shrine to mark the day. Watch: Akihito leaves the throne.

The prince taking Japan into a new era,"Emperor Naruhitoâs coronation will usher in Japanâs Reiwa era Japan officially began a new era on 1 May when Crown Prince Naruhito ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne as the new emperor. The day before, his father Emperor Akihito became the first Japanese emperor in more than 200 years to abdicate, bringing the Heisei imperial era to an end. Naruhito, 59, differs in many ways from his more tradition-bound predecessors, and has consistently challenged expectations by prioritising his family and academic life. In his first speech as emperor, he said he felt the solemn weight of his position, but vowed to be a symbol of unity for the nation. Unlike his father, Emperor Naruhito had the opportunity to pursue his own education and dreams when he was young. After graduating with a degree in history from Tokyo's prestigious Gakushuin University, he studied from 1983 to 1985 at Oxford University's Merton College. The emperor spoke of world peace in his first speech in his new role His chosen area of study was the history of transport on the River Thames, highlighting an interest in waterways that continued with doctoral research at Gakushuin. His Oxford years left a strong mark on the young Prince Naruhito. In his 1993 memoir, ""The Thames and I"", he described the period as the happiest time of his life. After his father ascended the throne in 1989 and he became crown prince, Naruhito maintained his passion for academia and global water issues. He was honorary president of the United Nations' Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation from 2007 to 2015. Prince Naruhito lived with his family until the age of 30, a departure from imperial tradition requiring future emperors to be raised by their subjects. The practice aimed to instil consideration for people in place of personal attachments, but by the time the crown prince was born family life was considered equally important. Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako are reported to have met at a tea party The importance of family to Crown Prince Naruhito would later come to the fore as his wife struggled with a stress-related ""adjustment disorder"". Crown Princess Masako, a former diplomat, was diagnosed with the disorder in 2004 due to the strain of imperial life and the pressure to produce a son. Princess Masako opens up on insecurities and health The princess, the palace and the shrinking royal line The prince took on an active part in raising their child, Princess Aiko, and staunchly defended his wife from criticism that she was neglecting public duties. Princess Aiko has herself been the subject of a wider debate on imperial succession. Under the Imperial Household Law of 1947, only men can ascend to the throne. In 2004, then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi proposed a revision to allow for an empress, potentially making Princess Aiko a future ruler. These plans stalled after the birth of her cousin Prince Hisahito in 2006, however, with the presence of a male heir negating the previous urgency. Midnight on 1 May marked both the change of emperor and the dawn of a new era in the imperial calendar. The name of the new imperial era, meaning ""beautiful harmony"", was taken from Japan's oldest poetry anthology Manyoshu. New emperor, new era: How a single word defines Japan It's a departure from the tradition of deriving imperial era names from Chinese classics, a practice that lasted more than 1,300 years. More than 70% of Japanese citizens approve of the name, according to polls, while the reaction to the incoming emperor himself is largely favourable. This video can not be played Reiwa: Naming a new era in Japan Despite the public's approval, there remain questions about the role Emperor Naruhito will play in a changing Japan. The emperor's role is largely ceremonial, focusing on public engagement with citizens and meeting foreign dignitaries. But Naruhito, the first emperor born after World War Two, may be expected to push for change. ""The world is changing and we are wondering how he will adjust his position and responsibilities to this new landscape,"" an editorial in leading business daily Nikkei said. In his accession speech, Emperor Naruhito recognised the heavy burden his father had carried in the role, and said he would ""bear in mind the path trodden by past emperors"". ""I sincerely hope for the happiness of the people and further progress of the country, and for world peace,"" he said. The law barring Princess Aiko from becoming empress is of particular relevance. All eyes will be on whether the new emperor pushes for a revision to the law, but he has thus far avoided the subject of change.

US-China trade talks to begin in Beijing,"The US and China are due to begin a fresh round of talks in Beijing on Tuesday as they edge closer to resolving their damaging trade dispute. The discussions will be led by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. Talks have dragged on for months, with both sides struggling to agree on key issues. The trade war has hurt the economy and challenged the multilateral system that has governed world trade for decades. There has been cautious optimism surrounding the talks in recent months but also a sense that both sides remain divided on some points. The next US-China battleground Grappling with China's growing power US-China trade war in 300 words The US, which accuses China of unfair trading practices,imposed tariffs on $250bn (Â£193.2bn) worthof Chinese products last year. Beijing has retaliated with duties on $110bn worth of American products. Tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods were due to more than double at the start of the year, rising from 10% to 25%. But both countries agreed to suspend tit-for-tat tariffs after theystruck a truce in December, and began negotiations to work towards a deal. US President Donald Trump recently saidthe US and China had agreedon ""a lot of the most difficult points"" but that ""we have some ways to go"". Sticking points in negotiations in recent months have included how a deal would be enforced, issues around intellectual property protection, and how fast to roll back tariffs. Gary Hufbauer from the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington said enforcement was a crucial issue, but remained optimistic about the prospect of a deal. ""China will make lots of promises, the US remains sceptical on implementation,"" he said. Still, he expects a deal to be announced by mid-May. Thelatest round of talks,externalare expected to be followed by further negotiations in Washington on 8 May. The US accuses China of stealing intellectual property and wants Beijing to make changes to its economic policies, which it says unfairly favour domestic companies through subsidies. It also wants China to buy more US goods to rein in a lofty trade deficit. Mr Xiaddressed some of these concerns last weekat the Belt and Road forum in Beijing ahead of the trade talks. He said China would boost efforts to secure intellectual property protection, increase imports of goods and services and ensure a fair trading environment for firms. But what makes trade negotiations particularly difficult to resolve is the fact they are part of a broader power struggle between the world's two largest economies. China's growing influence has put many Western governments - and particularly the USon the defensive. Some in China see the trade war as part of US efforts to curb its rise. Against this backdrop, there is a view thatthe trade deal will not put an end to a US-China rivalry, which is already playing out in the technology sector. The trade war is already having an impact on the world economy. International Monetary Fund chief economist Gita Gopinathsaid the escalation of US-China trade tensions,externalwas one factor that had contributed to a ""significantly weakened global expansion, especially in the second half of 2018.""  The IMF cut its growth forecast for this year by 0.2 percentage points to 3.3%. TheOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also said,externaltariffs imposed by the US and China last year had slowed economic growth in the world's two largest economies. Beyond the tangible economic fallout, some fearthe trade war is challenging the multilateral systemwhich has governed global trade for decades, including through the World Trade Organisation (WTO). ""The system is already fragile. An all out trade war, in which both sides break their WTO commitments, will be very damaging,"" Mr Hufbauer said.

Kirk agrees Â£1m payout for abuse victims,"Ian Samson attacked the children at the Lord and Lady Polwarth Children's Home in Edinburgh Three siblings sexually abused by a care home worker have secured Â£1m in damages from the Church of Scotland. The two men and one woman were targeted by paedophile Ian Samson at Lord and Lady Polwarth Children's Home in Edinburgh. A court previously heard the victims were assaulted during a campaign of abuse that spanned three decades The Church expressed ""deep and sincere regret"" for the trauma experienced by the children. Samson was later jailed for 14 years after being found guilty of 22 serious sexual assaults. Samson was jailed for 14 years After raising a legal action last year with Digby Brown Solicitors, the woman - who was forced to undergo an abortion when she became pregnant after being raped - secured Â£500,000 from the Kirk. Her two brothers each received Â£250,000. The compensation is the most ever known to have been recovered from a religious body in Scotland. In a joint statement, the siblings said: ""Samson was evil and robbed us of our childhood and our future. ""Our case has never been about the money - raising a civil action in the courts was the only way we could get any sort of acknowledgement from the Church of Scotland. ""It's a shame that an organisation which promotes 'goodness and morals' can't do the right thing themselves and hold their hands up and apologise rather than force victims to go endure further legal proceedings. ""We nearly gave up so many times in getting the Kirk to accept responsibility so we're delighted this is now over and have the justice and closure we need to get on with life as best we can."" The statement concluded with a message for fellow victims. It said: ""To anyone else affected by abuse - be strong and step forward. You can get closure and together we can all make a difference."" Samson worked at Lord and Lady Polwarth as a superintendent alongside his wife, who was a matron. His offending was carried out between the 1970s and 1990s. Lawyers said some victims hid in cupboards or dog baskets to avoid the abuse and those who could not escape Samson were subjected to violent physical and sexual attacks. In 2013 he was jailed for 14 years at the High Court in Edinburgh after being found guilty of offences involving sexual abuse and the rape of 12 children. Eight of these offences happened at the Kirk-run care home with others occurring at different locations across Edinburgh and the Lothians. Kim Leslie, specialist abuse lawyer and partner at Digby Brown Solicitors, led the civil action against the Kirk on the grounds of vicarious liability. She said: ""Ian Samson was rightly jailed for abuse he inflicted upon children after exploiting his position with the Church of Scotland. ""The significant sum secured for our clients also gives you an idea of just how extreme Ian Samson was and how horrifically our clients suffered - in terms of settlements made public against religious groups, this is certainly the highest value I'm aware of in the 20 years I've practised law. ""Sadly, there will be other brave survivors who have fallen victim to similar campaigns of abuse and to them I would say stay strong, keep going and when you're ready to talk or take action then there's a wealth of support for you when the time is right."" A Church of Scotland spokeswoman said: ""The abuses perpetrated by Ian Samson at Lord and Lady Polwarth Home in the 1970s are matters which have been examined by the criminal courts and by the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry and for which we have expressed our deep and sincere regret. ""We became aware of the full facts in 2013 at which point we offered our full support to the victims. ""While Samson's abuse of children was wider than his activity in Lord and Lady Polwarth Home, it felt important to us that there was full acknowledgment of the harm which did occur in our care at the time, and the longer-term consequences for three siblings involved."" The spokeswoman said the Church had carried out a full independent review of the circumstances so it could learn lessons for its safeguarding practices today. The statement concluded: ""Whilst this settlement can never undo what has been done, we hope that it finally brings a sense of justice to the individuals affected and provides some small redress for the trauma which they experienced while in our care."" The sum recovered from the Kirk emerged following the opening last week of a Â£10mredress scheme for abuse survivors. It will be available to people who have a terminal illness or are aged 70 or over and has been introduced ahead of a wider payment scheme that is due to open in 2021. Janine Rennie, chief executive of Wellbeing Scotland, said she hopes the compensation opens the floodgates for survivors to come forward but acknowledged money cannot compensate for a life of abuse. She told BBC Scotland: ""I think there should be multi-millions for every survivor who's been abused in a care setting. ""For many of the people we're working with, they're unable to work and that can be through physical health issues or mental health issues. ""Many suffer from complex PTSD and that means a lot are unable to leave their house."" Ms Rennie said around two thirds have been unable to achieve any kind of employment at all and many didn't have an education. She added: ""How do you compensate for that and how do you compensate for a survivor who from morning to night in their life wants to complete suicide? ""For many of the survivors in this situation it'll be too late because many of them will have already completed suicide or many will have died natural causes."" Ms Rennie said she has worked with 2,500 people who were abused in care but stressed that is only the people who have come forward. She described the true scale of the problem as ""potentially massive"".

US-China trade talks to begin in BeijingTalks appear to be reaching the final stretch though both sides remain divided on several key issues.Business,"The US and China are due to begin a fresh round of talks in Beijing on Tuesday as they edge closer to resolving their damaging trade dispute. The discussions will be led by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. Talks have dragged on for months, with both sides struggling to agree on key issues. The trade war has hurt the economy and challenged the multilateral system that has governed world trade for decades. There has been cautious optimism surrounding the talks in recent months but also a sense that both sides remain divided on some points. The next US-China battleground Grappling with China's growing power US-China trade war in 300 words The US, which accuses China of unfair trading practices,imposed tariffs on $250bn (Â£193.2bn) worthof Chinese products last year. Beijing has retaliated with duties on $110bn worth of American products. Tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods were due to more than double at the start of the year, rising from 10% to 25%. But both countries agreed to suspend tit-for-tat tariffs after theystruck a truce in December, and began negotiations to work towards a deal. US President Donald Trump recently saidthe US and China had agreedon ""a lot of the most difficult points"" but that ""we have some ways to go"". Sticking points in negotiations in recent months have included how a deal would be enforced, issues around intellectual property protection, and how fast to roll back tariffs. Gary Hufbauer from the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington said enforcement was a crucial issue, but remained optimistic about the prospect of a deal. ""China will make lots of promises, the US remains sceptical on implementation,"" he said. Still, he expects a deal to be announced by mid-May. Thelatest round of talks,externalare expected to be followed by further negotiations in Washington on 8 May. The US accuses China of stealing intellectual property and wants Beijing to make changes to its economic policies, which it says unfairly favour domestic companies through subsidies. It also wants China to buy more US goods to rein in a lofty trade deficit. Mr Xiaddressed some of these concerns last weekat the Belt and Road forum in Beijing ahead of the trade talks. He said China would boost efforts to secure intellectual property protection, increase imports of goods and services and ensure a fair trading environment for firms. But what makes trade negotiations particularly difficult to resolve is the fact they are part of a broader power struggle between the world's two largest economies. China's growing influence has put many Western governments - and particularly the USon the defensive. Some in China see the trade war as part of US efforts to curb its rise. Against this backdrop, there is a view thatthe trade deal will not put an end to a US-China rivalry, which is already playing out in the technology sector. The trade war is already having an impact on the world economy. International Monetary Fund chief economist Gita Gopinathsaid the escalation of US-China trade tensions,externalwas one factor that had contributed to a ""significantly weakened global expansion, especially in the second half of 2018.""  The IMF cut its growth forecast for this year by 0.2 percentage points to 3.3%. TheOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also said,externaltariffs imposed by the US and China last year had slowed economic growth in the world's two largest economies. Beyond the tangible economic fallout, some fearthe trade war is challenging the multilateral systemwhich has governed global trade for decades, including through the World Trade Organisation (WTO). ""The system is already fragile. An all out trade war, in which both sides break their WTO commitments, will be very damaging,"" Mr Hufbauer said.

"Boeing system not at fault, says bossDennis Muilenburg says a safety mechanism was only one factor in two fatal Boeing plane crashes.","Boeing chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg Boeing's boss has refused to admit that a system introduced in its 737 Max 8 aircraft was flawed following two fatal plane crashes. Appearing in front of investors and the media, Dennis Muilenburg maintained the system was only one factor in a chain of events that led to the disasters. But new reports have raised fresh questions about the plane's safety. It has emerged that whistleblowers connected to Boeing contacted the US airline regulator about the system. Meanwhile,the Wall Street Journal revealed,externalthat Boeing failed to activate a safety feature linked to sensors on 737 Max planes bought by its biggest customer, Southwest Airlines. The 737 Max is grounded worldwide after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed near Addis Ababa in March, killing all 157 people on board. It follows a crash by Lion Air in Indonesia five months earlier, which claimed 189 lives. How can Boeing regain trust? Pilot explains the Boeing 737 Max's anti-stall system Airlines count the cost of Boeing 737 Max grounding Facing shareholders and the media for the first time since the Ethiopian Airlines tragedy, Mr Muilenburg acknowledged that a common factor in both accidents was faulty data from a sensor triggering the plane's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) at the wrong time. The system is designed to improve the handling characteristics of the aircraft and improve stability when the nose is pitched up at a high angle. It was a new addition to the 737 Max when the aircraft was launched in 2017, and was designed to make the aircraft more like the previous generation of 737 to fly. It works by trimming the nose of the plane downwards. In both accidents, it appears to have activated when the pilots were trying to gain height, depriving them of control. However, Mr Muilenburg said that the MCAS system met its ""design and certification criteria"" and pointed to a number of other scenarios that may have contributed to the fatal accidents including actions taken or not taken by pilots. He added: ""As in most accidents, there are a chain of events that occur. It is not correct to attribute that to any single item."" A preliminary report into the Ethiopian Airlines flight found that the plane nosedived several times before hitting the ground. In the case of the Lion Air flight, a report suggested that the system malfunctioned and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it plummeted into the sea. Boeing has developed and is testing a software update for MCAS. Mr Muilenburg's comments came after it emerged that several whistleblowers had contacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after the Ethiopian Airlines crash to voice concerns about the company's manufacturing processes. One of them reported having seen damage to wiring used by a vital sensor aboard the aircraft - the same sensor that has been implicated in both crashes. An FAA spokesman said the allegations were under investigation and had not been officially substantiated. Boeing has also come under pressure over the information available to pilots aboard the aircraft, after one of its major customers, Southwest Airlines, told US media it had not been informed that a warning feature previously offered as standard on the 737 had become a paid-for option on the new model. The feature was a so-called ""AOA Disagree"" alert, meant to inform pilots of significant discrepancies between the information provided by two angle-of-attack sensors in the nose of the aircraft. This would provide a warning if one of them was faulty. The angle of attack sensors are used to determine the angle at which an aircraft encounters the airflow over it. On the 737 Max, the flight computers relied on data from a single one of them to decide when to activate the MCAS system, and a sensor failure is believed to have been a factor in both crashes. Southwest told the Wall Street Journal it had not been made aware that the warning feature was not available as a standard item until after the Lion Air crash in October. Mr Muilenburg maintained early on Monday: ""We don't make safety features optional."" A family member of the Ethiopian Airlines crash victims mourns at the fenced-off accident site In a later statement, Boeing then said: ""The disagree alert was intended to be a standard, stand-alone feature on Max airplanes. However, the disagree alert was not operable on all airplanes because the feature was not activated as intended. ""The disagree alert was tied or linked into the angle of attack indicator, which is an optional feature on the Max. Unless an airline opted for the angle of attack indicator, the disagree alert was not operable."" It said that once the 737 Max 8 returned to the skies, it would have ""an activated and operable disagree alert and an optional angle of attack indicator"". The angle of attack indicator is another instrument available to pilots, designed to warn of a possible aerodynamic stall. Boeinghas already seen a $1bn (Â£773m) drop in revenuesrelated to the 737 Max crisis, while somecustomers have reviewed their orders. On Tuesday, Virgin Australia saidit had reached an agreement,externalwith Boeing to defer deliveries of 737 Max aircraft. In a statement, the company said it would delay first deliveries of Boeing Max 737 jets from November 2019 to July 2021. ""We will not introduce any new aircraft to the fleet unless we are completely satisfied with its safety,"" Virgin Australia Chief Executive Paul Scurrah said.

Tainted blood inquiry hearings begin,"This video can not be played ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would"" A public inquiry into what has been called ""the worst treatment scandal in the history of the NHS"" is to start taking evidence on Tuesday. Some 4,800 people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. More than 2,000 are thought to have died. Thousands more may have been exposed through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth. One victim's widow says she wants ""justice"" and people held to account. Su Gorman's husband, Steve Dymond, died aged 62 on 23 December last year of organ failure - ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man. Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme in April 2018, Steve said: ""It's not the life I imagined in terms of dreams, in terms of ambitions. ""It's become a life of sickness, illness, worry, anxiety. ""When I talk about my wife, I talk about her as my widow in waiting."" Aged eight, Matt (pictured) was given blood products contaminated with HIV -when he found out, he couldn't tell a soul Liz married twice -the same NHS scandal killed both her husbands Steve was born in 1956 with a mild form of haemophilia, a genetic condition that prevents blood from clotting properly. He played rugby at school and studied Russian at university where he met his wife, Su, waiting on a train platform. ""He had a massive bruise on his thigh the size of a postcard and it worried me,"" she remembers. ""Steve was not in the habit of getting treatment, so he said he would get it checked out. That was the first time they injected him with a 'wonder drug' called Factor VIII."" Steve and Su on their wedding day At the time that new drug was made from the pooled blood plasma of tens of thousands of donors. In the 1970s and 1980s, the NHS was importing Factor VIII from the US, where high-risk groups like prisoners were paid to give blood. The first sign that something was very wrong came in about 1983. Reports of a new form of cancer started to emerge, first in the gay community then among other groups like haemophiliacs. Around this time, Steve had a minor accident and went to the local hospital to get it checked out. Factor VIII was imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s ""The young registrar took a packet off the shelf and treated him with Factor VIII. The bruise disappeared after an hour, so it was totally unnecessary,"" said Su. ""Shortly after, they called him back and said he had been exposed to HIV."" The testing process took 18 months - an ""absolutely terrifying"" period. Some 1,200 British haemophiliacs were infected with HIV in this way, including many young children of primary school age. Only 250 are still alive today. Steve was one of the lucky ones. ""It was a huge relief. He was told he was clear of the HIV but no mention was made of the Hepatitis C at that point,"" says Su. Hepatitis C is a virus now thought to affect more than 150 million people, some 2% of the world population. Yet it was not discovered and named until 1989. It was not until 1993, then living and working in France, that Steve was told he had the condition. At the time the couple were trying again for a baby. They were immediately taken off the IVF programme. Steve Dymond died in December of organ failure, ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man ""Steve was told bluntly that the [possible] consequences were liver cirrhosis, cancer, a transplant, premature death,"" says Su. ""Within 24 hours [of diagnosis] we found out we would never have children and that he was going to die early."" It was only in 2013 that a new drug was approved that could successfully eliminate the Hepatitis C virus from Steve's body. By then, though, the damage was already done. Scans showed his liver was cirrhotic and a bunch of cells showed the early signs of cancer. His health declined quickly in the last 18 months of his life. This video can not be played Steve Dymond speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in April last year In late December 2018 he woke at home coughing up blood. ""They took him to intensive care. He knew I was there and he said to me, 'I love you',"" says Su. ""The last thing he said was he wanted those who had done this to him to repent. Then at one in the morning, as he was holding my hand, he left me."" A public inquiry into the scandal was first announced in July 2017. Since then, campaign groups estimate that more than 150 infected haemophiliacs like Steve have died. The inquiry will consider evidence from approximately 2,500 people, most of whom were infected with, or affected by, contaminated blood products such as Factor VIII or IX. Victims and relatives want to know why warnings about the safety of the medicine may have been ignored, why plans to make the UK self-sufficient in blood products were scrapped, and why many documents and patient records appear to have been lost or destroyed. The inquiry, led by retired judge Sir Brian Langstaff, could last for more than two years. Ahead of the public hearings, the government announced more financial support for people in England affected by the tragedy, to a total of Â£75m from Â£46m. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The contaminated blood scandal was a tragedy that should never have happened and has caused unimaginable pain and hurt for victims and their families for decades. ""I know this will be a difficult time for victims and their families - but today will begin a journey which will be dedicated to getting to the truth of what happened and in delivering justice to everyone involved."" ""I want to see justice,"" says Su. ""I want to see people called to account, I want to see anybody found to have behaved inappropriately, criminally or negligently made to explain themselves. ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would, and that's a promise I intend to keep.""

The rise and fall of Islamic State,"Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul. ""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'"" The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of  panicked civilians. This video can not be played Video footage from Mosul after its capture by Isis shows militants driving through the streets It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil). Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize. Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch. ""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'"" The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening. As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed. Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west. Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015 Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed. Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants. In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming. After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds. That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics. Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014 Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate. Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014. IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley. In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings. Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word. Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"". IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming. The theology of murder The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD. Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East. ""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk. ""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies."" As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers. For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price. The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.  Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus. These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors). They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula. A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most  puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power. In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah. But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both. Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment. The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times.   Jihad  means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war. But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow. Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought"" Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder. Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such. For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him. Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions,  and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader. Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"". 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith."" And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb."" The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle. Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both. Rise of al-Qaeda The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahideen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam. Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980 There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand. Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists. It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it. By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001. The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today. Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists. After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase. But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir. ""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates. The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004. The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists ""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was  referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved. Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the West into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy. The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan. Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008. Iraq fiasco The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda. Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies. Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it. Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true. Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003 By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in. Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials came to call the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region. Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran. The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in. They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community. Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such. Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism with Baathist organisation at its core. His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists. Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military. As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq. But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion. Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of. The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions. But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security. By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq. They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"". Territorial takeover Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad. Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader. All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad. The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him. 29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? What has happened to Baghdadi? But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its Sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004. Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies. Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership. The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk. Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public. By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"". But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam. Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas. Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships. Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born. IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it. After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter But Jawlani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise. It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office. Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis. Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next? Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry. An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015 When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover. With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army holding large stretches of territory, ruling millions of people, and not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world. The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of al-Nuri, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him. By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global. Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism. A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north. The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258. Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924. So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion. For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad. Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria. It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule. To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts. Satellite images show Palmyra's once majestic Temple of Bel before and after its destruction by Islamic State militants Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including themagnificent temples of Beland Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq. It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion. All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves. A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers. And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issued printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and took a percentage of the proceeds. That was just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled into its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done. Captured documentspublished by Der Spiegel in 2015,externalgive some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security. Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014. At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper. ""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later. ""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders.""

If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated. ""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident, speaking when IS still controlled the city.

School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu. ""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident after IS took over. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta [knowing the right people and pulling strings]. They are totally convinced they are on the right track."" Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire One story tells a lot about IS and its ways. As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi in early 2016, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too. Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint. As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander]."" The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders. ""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police. ""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who were still inside the city when it was held by IS. Taking on the world Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains. But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers. Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army. Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 ) Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended. The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad. In the three years following the declaration of the ""caliphate"" in 2014, at least 150 attacks in 29 countries across the globe were either carried out or inspired by IS, with well over 2,000 victims killed. The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach. At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief. The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October 2015 and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria. The lone-wolf massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, while apparently inspired rather than organised by IS, would undoubtedly further stiffen the US's already steely resolve to finish the organisation. Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates went as low as half that). A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015 Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or would President Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump be able to fulfil Mr Obama's pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation? Final showdown If there seemed to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there was. When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq. A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to theend of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq."" Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad. That could help explain why the organisation seemed to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily. It's been one of the elements that made IS a formidable fighting force hard to destroy even in strictly military terms. Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated. What made IS so formidable? The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just 10 minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!"" ""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them."" Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic. Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose. Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank. ""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business."" ""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation."" The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, was clearly a vital component in IS success. But that did not mean its fighters were invincible on the battlefield, even in the early days of stunningly rapid expansion. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes. In December 2015, for example, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month alone. Pentagon officials said coalition air strikes killed some 50,000 IS militants in Iraq and Syria between August 2014 and the end of 2016. But IS initially seemed to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on, in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting was done locally. Clearly, had it remained in place, there would soon have been anew generation of young militants,externaldrawn from local sources. This video can not be played Quentin Sommerville: ""They witnessed killing close at hand"" ""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits. Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike. He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets. Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative ""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s."" ""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?'  They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family."" Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. Since we spoke, he has in fact been given two death sentences. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed. ""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now."" Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets. A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds. ""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles."" ""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me."" Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant Rising to the challenge Just as the 9/11 Twin Towers atrocity in 2001 had left the US and its allies with no alternative but to strike back with extreme force, the challenge mounted by IS through its numerous provocative outrages in the region and around the world could not be ignored - nor was it meant to be. But rooting out the militants from Iraq and Syria was always going to be much more complex than the campaign unleashed more than a decade earlier against al-Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan. There was never any real question of a wholesale Coalition invasion of either country. Air strikes were one thing, but putting in vast numbers of troops on the ground would be something else. Syria was embroiled in a bewilderingly complicated civil war. Iraq was also in turmoil. US forces had only pulled out three years earlier. There was no appetite for a repeat of an invasion which was almost universally seen as a disastrous blunder with lasting consequences. But uprooting the militants could not be done by air power alone. Reliable, motivated partner forces on the ground would be needed. In both countries, they were in short supply. In Syria, the US and its allies were already engaged with some of the motley array of Syrian rebel groups. But they never amounted to the kind of focused, cohesive forces that the Coalition was looking for - they were fragmented, fractious, increasingly Islamist in tone, and largely bent on overthrowing the Assad regime rather than turning on IS. In Iraq, the regular armed forces were in disarray after collapsing like a house of cards in the face of the onslaught on Mosul by a few hundred IS militants. Much work would have to be done to weld them into a motivated and competent fighting force. In both countries it was to the Kurds in the north that the Americans and their Coalition partners first turned as their most hopeful immediate allies. The Syrian Democratic Forces emerged as a reliable partner for the US in the fight against IS The Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq had a long relationship with the Western Coalition powers. In 2003, US special forces fought alongside them to clear Islamist militants from mountain positions near the Iranian border just before the invasion against Saddam Hussein, in which they were partners. Humiliated by the loss of vast areas of territory to the lightning IS assault in early August 2014, the Peshmerga needed no encouragement to hit back. Less than two weeks later, with Coalition air support, they recaptured the strategic Mosul dam. In the months that followed, they slowly clawed back much of the ground they had lost, including Sinjar in November 2015, in operations closely co-ordinated with Coalition air strikes. But in the rest of Iraq, the picture was much messier. Iraqi government forces were able to halt the IS thrust southwards towards the capital, Baghdad, but made little early progress pushing back into the mainly Sunni areas where the militants had dug in. It was Iranian-backed Shia militias, whose emergence was consolidated under the IS threat, that made the running in the initial phases of the campaign to oust the militants, driving them out of areas north-east of Baghdad near the Iranian border and pursuing them westwards until the eventual recapture of Saddam Hussein's hometown Tikrit in the Tigris river valley in March 2015. ""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" said Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups, known as the Hashd al-Shaabi or Popular Mobilisation (PM), that rose in defence of Baghdad and the south. ""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Irbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq."" But in the Sunni heartlands of Anbar province to the west of Baghdad the Iraqi state forces were struggling. In May 2015, IS militants captured the provincial capital, Ramadi. At the same time, they spread their grip in Syria, taking the iconic city of Palmyra (Tadmur) in the desert east of Homs. It was a clear signal that while the organisation may have been dealt some setbacks it was still at the height of its powers and capable of exploiting any weaknesses it found. But the Americans were quietly busy preparing for the real war on IS. They had poured billions into rebuilding the Iraqi army after 2003, only to see much of it go to pieces under pressure because so much was wrong with its foundations. Now, putting in several thousand advisers, they focused on training and equipping the key Iraqi special forces - the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), otherwise known as the Golden Division - that was to play a crucial role spearheading the drive against the militants. The systematic lashback began with Anbar province and the eventual recapture of Ramadi at the end of 2015 and early 2016, a grinding and costly operation with close Coalition air support. There was huge destruction and the displacement of most of the city's largely Sunni population. There were also tensions over the deployment of Iranian-backed, mainly Shia militias in core Sunni areas, though they were largely kept out of the city itself. Pro-government forces patrol Ramadi The recapture of Ramadi tightened the noose around the even more iconic centre of Sunni sentiment at nearby Falluja, where militants had fought two major battles with the Americans in 2004. Government and PM forces began closing in around the city in early 2016, soon after taking Ramadi. By now, after a lot of testing and assessing, the Americans and their allies, working closely with local forces, were clearly embarked on a comprehensive strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS wherever it could be found. The broad lines were spelled out in February 2016 by Lt Gen Sean McFarland, then the commanding general of the Coalition's Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve. ""The campaign has three objectives: to destroy the ISIL parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack."" Next step on the road to Mosul, the battle for Falluja was joined in late May 2016 and took just over a month of assaults, bombardments and air strikes to complete, with civilians again paying a heavy price. IS fighters deployed their full range of battle tactics, with snipers, booby-traps and suicide bombers making advance difficult and dangerous for the attacking forces. Despite the attrition suffered by the Iraqi forces, especially the elite CTS forces, it was not long before eyes turned to the big prize - Mosul. With President Obama due to bow out early in the new year, the Americans were getting impatient. In peacetime roughly 10 times the size of either Falluja or indeed the IS ""capital"" Raqqa, Mosul was never going to be an easy nut to crack. It had fallen to the militants in a matter of hours in 2014. By the time the government and Coalition campaign to dislodge them was finally launched in mid-October 2016, IS had had nearly two-and-a-half years to dig in and prepare its defences. There is a moment in the journey into Raqqa when you leave the real world behind. After the bombed-out Samra bridge, any signs of normal life vanish. Turn right at the shop that once sold gravestones - its owner is long gone - and you are inside the city. Ahead lies nothing but destruction and grey dust and rubble. This is a place drained of colour, of life, and of people. In six days inside Raqqa, I didn't see a single civilian. The city fit for no-one Marshalled against a band of militants variously estimated at between 2,000 and 12,000 with a hard core probably closer to 4,000 or 5,000, was a vast assembly of government and auxiliary forces, estimated at around 100,000, counting regular army and federal police units, Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and the Popular Mobilisation, including some Sunni and minority volunteers as well as Shia militias. It was an epic battle that was to last nine months. Government forces slowly battered their way in around the city through dozens of outlying villages and finally into Mosul's eastern half, which was declared ""liberated"" towards the end of January 2017. Then it was on to the western side of the river and the old city, with its dense warren of narrow streets. The area around theancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdad had made his only public appearance as the newly-anointed ""caliph"", was the last to fall. The mosque was blown up, almost exactly three years after the declaration of the IS ""caliphate"". The evidence was that IS itself had destroyed it, rather than let it fall into ""infidel"" hands. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, saw this as ""official recognition of defeat"" by the militants. It signalled, he said, ""the collapse of the IS caliphate and a grand military victory"". This video can not be played The Iraqi military circulated a video it says shows the destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri. It was indeed a monumental achievement, a massive body-blow to the IS state project. The city had been, as a senior Western official in northern Iraq put it, ""the beating heart of IS"", in real terms much more important than Raqqa in Syria. But it came at huge cost. The years of preparation and months of battering that it took to dislodge a few thousand militants stood in stark contrast to the ease with which they had rolled into the city virtually unopposed in June 2014. Some estimates put the number of civilians killed at more than 40,000. At least 1,200 Iraqi security personnel also died in battle. The damage was estimated at $50bn. Hundreds thousands of mainly Sunni inhabitants were displaced, and there were widespread allegations of abuses. The weeks that followed saw a further rapid erosion of the group's territorial position in Iraq. By the end of August 2017, it had been driven out of Tal Afar, an important town controlling the main road from Mosul towards Syria. A month later, another long-standing IS pocket in and around the mainly Sunni town of Hawija, west of Kirkuk, was also largely overrun by government and auxiliary forces. In Iraq, that left IS in control only of the area in and around the town of al-Qaim, on the River Euphrates by the Syrian border in the far west of Anbar province. Its presence in the country had been very radically degraded. But the organisation was still far from destroyed. Across in Syria, the overall picture by the autumn of 2017 was roughly the same, despite the country's very different, extremely complex and fast-moving situation. In 2014 and 2015, IS had substantial holdings in Syria - it looked as though someone had spilled a bottle of black ink on its map. They controlled virtually the whole of Syria's stretch of the Euphrates, from Albu Kamal on the Iraqi border, up through Deir al-Zour and Raqqa, the Tabqa dam, and on to Jarablus on the border with Turkey, one of several crossings that were lifelines for the militants. They held towns and villages to the east and north of Aleppo (including the near-mythical Dabiq) and other pockets further south, including Palmyra and nearby oilfields. But this heyday did not last. In Syria, IS found itself facing, not one motley coalition of enemies as in Iraq, but three. The Americans, despairing of Syrian rebel groups whose interests lay elsewhere, adopted the experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters of the YPG, the Popular Protection Units, as their main on-the-ground partners. They added on as many Arab and minority fighters as they could find to produce the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), their favoured vehicle against IS in Syria. A cruise missile is fired from Russian ship in the Mediterranean Sea (Russian Defence Ministry handout) This did not go down at all well with the US's Nato ally Turkey, which sees the YPG and their parent political body, the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), as terrorists because of their affiliation to Turkey's own Kurdish rebels, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Often seeming to be working at cross-purposes to the Americans, Ankara set up its own coalition from among the Syrian opposition groups it had been backing and facilitating for years. IS also received attention from a third coalition, grouping Syrian government forces, Iran and Russia. The Russians carried out air strikes against IS positions partly with the same kind of motivation as the Western Coalition - revenge for the downing by IS of the Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015 - but their real strategic interest was different. The Russians and Iranians were bent on securing their investment in the Assad regime, helping it restore its authority in the country, and pre-empting any move by the Americans and their allies to block a link-up between eastern Syria and western Iraq that would give Tehran a direct land connection from Iran all the way to Lebanon. That thought may have been somewhere in Washington's head, but its primary concern was hitting and destroying IS. Turkey for its part had a different overriding preoccupation: to prevent the Syrian Kurds from expanding and joining up the areas they controlled along the southern side of the Turkey-Syria border. Despite these conflicting motivations, for IS the result was the same - pressure on many fronts. The US-backed SDF made the most headway, systematically whittling away IS assets step-by-step, but Turkey and Syrian government forces were also on the march. As early as September 2014, US air strikes had helped prevent IS taking over the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the border with Turkey. After that, the SDF were pushing forward. By October 2016, IS had lost all access to the Turkish border, a huge logistical setback - virtually all foreign jihadists bound for both Syria and Iraq had come that way, apart from other advantages. Smoke rises from a bombed building in Deir al-Zour The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels also played their part, taking over IS-held areas north and east of Aleppo - including Dabiq, which fell in a mundane enough manner with none of the apocalyptic ""burning of the Crusader armies"" heralded in IS mythology. Gradually the militants' tide receded further and further down the Euphrates valley, with the SDF, backed by perhaps 2,000 US special forces with artillery and air power, doing most of the pushing. By November 2016, the SDF were in a position to launch a campaign to isolate and eventually attack the IS ""capital"", Raqqa. The assault on the city itself began in early June 2017. By then, much of the population and many IS fighters had already fled, with most of the militants heading further downstream to the final major city largely under their control - another provincial capital, Deir al-Zour. But before the recapture of Raqqa had been completed, Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces were already thrusting towards Deir al-Zour, where a military base and airport had held out against the IS militants for almost three years. To get there, the government forces had recaptured Palmyra (for the second time) in March and pushed eastwards along the road to take Sukhna in August before reaching Deir al-Zour itself in September. US-backed SDF forces had already bypassed the yet-to-fall Raqqa and moved into oil-rich areas to the east of Deir al-Zour, laying claim to oil and gasfields that would greatly bolster the Kurds' ambitions to run their own area in the north of the country - or at least strengthen their hand in eventual negotiations with Damascus. So as 2017 moved into its final months, IS territorial control in Syria seemed to be as doomed as it was in Iraq - bottled up in a small patch straddling the border around al-Qaim in western Iraq and Albu Kamal in Syria. Rooting the militants out from there would not necessarily be a simple task in a fiercely tribal area prone to defying governments. But to all intents and purposes, the IS dream of administering and expanding a thriving Islamic state in the two countries as the core of a growing global caliphate had crashed in flames. So had IS been virtually destroyed as well as severely degraded? Was it time to celebrate its demise? It had certainly been dealt crippling blows in terms of functioning as a territorial state. That project lay in ruins. The administrative structures it had set up had been swept away. Major sources of finance had been cut off - from the oilfields it had controlled, taxes imposed on the millions of Iraqis and Syrians it had ruled, and cash coming in across the border with Turkey. It could no longer attract thousands of foreign jihadists or recruit locals to replace the 60,000 IS fighters the Americans believe have died since the heady days of June 2014. With virtually all of their urban holdings lost, the militants were shrinking back into the shadows and deserts. Many of their leaders had also been killed, although Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself apparently eluded the hunt, issuing adefiant audio statementin September 2017. Among the known dead were Mohammed Emwazi, ""Jihadi John"", killed by a drone strike in Syria in late 2015. But all of this had been long foreseen by the leadership. In May 2016, the man regarded as the organisation's real Number Two, spokesman and head of external operations Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, made a lengthy statement already foreshadowing the next phase of IS existence. ""You will never be victorious. You will be defeated,"" he told the Americans. ""Do you think that victory comes by killing one leader or another? That would be a fake victory!"" ""Or do you consider defeat to be the loss of a city or the loss of territory? Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq [in 2007-8] and were in the desert without any city or land? And would we be defeated, and you victorious, if you were to take Mosul or Sirte or Raqqa, or even all the cities, and we were to return to our previous situation? Absolutely not! True defeat is the loss of will and desire to fight."" Abu Muhammad al-Adnani Adnani, who as spokesman had announced the birth of ""Islamic State"" and the caliphate in June 2014, may not have lost the will and desire to fight. But he did lose his life. He was killed by an American air strike near Aleppo in August 2016. He was right to suggest that the targeted killing of militant leaders has in general had little discernible impact on the course of movements, psychologically important though it may be. But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes the case of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi might be different. The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015. ""IS's future depends on Baghdadi,"" Hashemi said, speaking at a time when IS still controlled huge swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest."" ""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation."" Baghdadi's death might not have such an impact in the new situation. But his special talents could come into their own again should conditions in either or both of those countries, or elsewhere, once again favour a comeback by the militants. That is not so fanciful, even amid the smoking wreckage of the IS above-ground infrastructure. In Iraq, the burning Sunni grievances against the Shia-dominated Baghdad government that allowed IS to make its astonishing advances in 2014 have not been seriously addressed. American officials are already referring to the danger of an ""AQI-2"" emerging - a second al-Qaeda in Iraq. It has happened before. The wholesale destruction of Sunni towns and cities in the drive against IS and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Sunnis may even have aggravated those grievances, providing fertile ground for militants to infiltrate back. There is an optimistic argument that the united cross-sectarian effort that it took to drive the militants out may have sown the seeds of a new Iraqi nationalism. But the fact remains that the Sunni community has been crushed, and the Shia majority dominates both politically and through the proliferation of its powerful militias. Political leaderships in Baghdad have signally failed to promote any serious national reconciliation since 2003. ""IS was essentially an Iraqi creation,"" said a senior Western intelligence official, speaking shortly before the militants were ousted from Mosul. ""The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population."" Thousands of IS cases are being tried in courts like Nineveh Criminal Court in Qaraqosh (above) A young man wearing a shabby, brown prisoner's outfit stands before three black-robed judges in a tiny, provincial courtroom, shaking nervously. After sipping some water, he confirms his name: Abdullah Hussein. He is accused of fighting for so-called Islamic State (IS). ""The decision of the court has been taken according to articles 2 and 3 of the 2005 Counterterrorism Law,"" states the judge. ""Death by hanging."" And then Hussein - who, like many suspects here, was picked up on the Mosul frontline - breaks down crying. Inside the Iraqi courts sentencing IS suspects to death Much work remains to be done if that sobering assessment is to be reversed. And Baghdad meanwhile faces multiple challenges that might help tip it back into the state of chaos in which the militants could thrive. The state's coffers are empty at a time when the reconstruction bill is estimated conservatively at $100bn. Corruption is endemic. Apart from the Sunni issue, Baghdad politics is in turmoil, with deep rivalries between Shia factions with greater or lesser attachment to Iran. And the threat of secession by the Kurds in the north, after the September 2017 independence referendum, could bring further instability. The very least that could be expected post-Mosul was an indefinite period of low-level insurgency, with bomb blasts and suicide attacks in different parts of the country, especially aimed, as before, at mainly Shia areas. It was already happening. The US military's Combating Terrorism Center reported that by mid-2017 there was already an average of 130 insurgent attacks taking place monthly in the ""liberated"" eastern half of Mosul. And it was already happening next door in Syria too, with IS carrying out random deadly explosions in Damascus and elsewhere despite its stark loss of territory. Although it was obvious by late 2017 that the Assad government with its Russian and Iranian backers were prevailing, the final pattern of control and governance country-wide remained uncertain. There were many ways in which further turmoil could ensue, not least the fact that, with US support, Kurdish forces had spread well beyond their own demographic comfort zone, causing huge resentment among some Sunni elements. As in Iraq, many Syrian Sunnis were bound to feel aggrieved by everything that had happened since the civil war broke out in 2011. And where there were grievances, IS or its successors would surely be there to build on them. Capitalising on chaos IS had in any case been busy spreading its bets and developing other territorial possibilities beyond the ""parent tumour"" of Iraq and Syria. Libya initially proved the most promising. It had just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the state of ""savagery"", that left room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime of Muammar Gaddafi, just as they had done in Iraq. IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""Crusader"" European countries on the other side of the sea that radical Islam was on the way. The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck in Paris, 13 November 2015. A Libyan security official at a site used by so-called Islamic State near Sirte The militants took over a big stretch of the coast and the central city of Sirte, which was to Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia. But the IS presence in Libya soon came under pressure, with militias loyal to the Government of National Accord, which been born out of UN efforts, dislodging the militants from Sirte in the second half of 2016. But they did not disappear. The Americans launched an air strike on IS elements south of Sirte in October 2017, their first such action in Libya since President Trump took over. The militants were undoubtedly on the defensive in Libya. But it remained a deeply fragmented country, and its new government far from powerful or universally accepted. There would likely continue to be pockets of chaos there for the jihadists to exploit. And there was no shortage of other possibilities being actively explored and developed - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria... wherever there were dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there would be opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted. Long before IS lost almost all its territorial gains in Iraq and Syria, it was clear that the organisation, while trying its best to hold ground wherever it could, was trying to stay alive and assert itself (""Remaining and Expanding"") in other ways - renewed insurgency in the lost lands, constant propaganda and proselytising on the internet, and above all, a revitalised push to carry out acts of terror in the West, the more shocking the better. As early as September 2014, just as IS was embarking on its provocative confrontation with the West, spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani urged the movement's followers in graphic detail to kill the hated infidels. ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other of the unbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, slaughter him with a knife, run him over with your car, throw him down from a high place, choke him or poison him."" In his statement in May 2016, al-Adnani signalled the organisation's new stress on attacks inside Western countries in response to the drive against it in Iraq and Syria. ""Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them... Know that your targeting those who are called ""civilians"" is more beloved to us and more effective, as it is more harmful, painful, and a greater deterrent to them."" Attacks in Europe and elsewhere intensified almost in direct proportion to IS' loss of terrain in Iraq and Syria. Among the more notable were the truck assault in Nice, France, in July 2016 (at least 86 killed) and a similar attack in Berlin in December (12 killed), the Istanbul nightclub bombing in January 2017 (39 killed), and two vehicle and knife attacks in London in March and June 2017 (15 killed). The attacks in London broke new ground for IS, and even more so the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena in May 2017 in which more than 20 people died. A van attack in Barcelona in August in which 13 people were killed was also seen as an advance for the militants. Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester bombing in 2017 These kinds of attacks, often carried out by ""lone wolves"" and involving everyday implements that are impossible to control, were clearly a nightmare for security services. Their job was made all the more challenging by studies showing that fewer than 20% of  ""successful"" attacks in Europe and North America were carried out by jihadists who had gone to Syria or Iraq, and that most were perpetrated by citizens of the countries under attack. While IS had managed to plant a small number of activists in the crowds of refugees and asylum seekers besieging the gates of Europe and the West, simply vetting them carefully would obviously not be enough. Clearly, IS internet messaging was still powerful, resonating among the disaffected, the resentful, the alienated and disempowered. The Americans, focusing largely on the military defeat of the militants, seemed taken aback by IS's ability to keep up and even expand the challenge. ""When I consider how much damage we've inflicted and they're still operational, they're still capable of pulling off things like some of these attacks we've seen internationally, we have to conclude that we do not yet fully appreciate the scale or strength of this phenomenon,"" said Lt Gen Michael Nagata, one of the top US Special Operations officers, quoted by the Combating Terrorism Center. ""We spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,"" added Thomas P Bossert, President Trump's adviser on homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser. ""They're proselytizing. It's troubling."" Clearly, tackling such a vague, ethereal and pervasive threat was a far cry from the clear-cut task of confronting IS fighters on the battlefield. The threat was not going to go away. Cyber-inspired lone wolf attacks could materialise at almost any time, any place. The price of relative safety would be eternal vigilance. Battle for minds The US and its allies were starting to come to grips with the cyber dimension of the challenge - and giving much less priority to the crucial problem of poor governance in the countries whose dysfunctionalities provided opportunities for the radicals to take root. But there were other parts of IS' complicated root system that were even harder to get at. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that more than half of the 27,000 foreign jihadists making their way to Syria and Iraq in the first 18 months of the ""Islamic State"" were from the Middle East and North Africa. Clearly, the ""Caliphate"" had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases, because of - its graphically publicised brutality. While vowing to degrade and destroy the organisation, President Obama put his finger on the real challenge: ""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said. On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life. Fishing and ultraviolence The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions. They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly. The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the sinister ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, less so in the case of Tunisia. While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed. Unidentified IS fighter Mohammed is giddy with excitement as he films the discovery of three IS fighters on his mobile phone. ""Shoot him,"" he shouts, gesturing at one of them. His nervousness gives him away as the unit's cook. He's unarmed, but his fellow soldiers from the Iraqi police special forces - known as the Emergency Response Division - are armed to the teeth and are not taking any chances. The secret lives of young IS fighters One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, wherea detailed survey,externalin the poorest suburbs of the capital Tunis showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless. IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, which caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers. In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century: the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing  a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals.... The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam. ""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many Western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"". But it has. ""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis."" Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees. ""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily."" Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty. Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten  corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed. ""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli. He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama wanted to see. ""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013. ""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it."" Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups. But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true ""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says. ""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics."" Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path. More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme. This video can not be played Saudi Arabia's 'creative' approach to de-radicalisation But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for a hard-to-achieve reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups. The winds of change do now seem to be starting to blow through the desert kingdom, with cautious reforms behind which the young Crown Prince, Muhammad Bin Salman, is seen as the driving force. Although the 2017 decree allowing women to drive caused a stir, it remains to be seen how deep such changes can go in a country where the grip of the ultra-conservative clergy is still strong, and where official primary schoolbooks still teach that all religions apart from Islam are ""false"". Changing some of the fundamental interpretations of religion is a monumental undertaking that could take generations. But it cannot come fast enough for a senior Sunni politician in Iraq. ""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" he says. ""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo]."" ""You can't kill all the Muslims. You need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money has been blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world - too much oil, too much money."" Sunni Axis v Shia Crescent The demise of the IS as a ""state"" straddling Iraq and Syria has huge geo-strategic implications, few of them positive for the US and its regional allies. While President Trump railed and tweeted against the evil of Iran and its sponsorship of terrorism, Tehran was quietly benefitting from everything the Americans were doing against IS. They were non-speaking, arms-length partners in the campaign against the militants in Iraq. US air power, training and hardware directly helped the official Iraqi forces. But the Iranian-backed Shia militias played their part in a series of campaigns ending in a victory which greatly expanded their presence. The rise and fall of the IS phenomenon in Iraq left Iran's influence there stronger than ever. While the distance between the American and Iranian roles in Syria was even bigger, with Iran on the side of the regime and the US originally backing the rebels, both were fighting IS, and its defeat would ultimately benefit the Assad regime and its Iranian backers. The Americans and their Coalition allies will not be around forever. Iran and its local allies will. Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups The US had little choice but to do what it did. The superpower could not allow itself to be goaded and provoked with impunity. But it had earlier opened the floodgates to Iranian influence through a war that was purely elective, a war of choice and ambition rather than necessity: the invasion of Iraq in 2003, launched on pretexts (Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his support for terrorism) that turned out to be totally spurious. By dismantling the Iraqi state in 2003, the US-led coalition was breaking down the bulwark that had contained Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics. For years, it had been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Now they came home to rule the roost. The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian influence, through the arming, training and directing of the burgeoning Iraqi Shia militias. For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction, Hezbollah. From the outset of the war in Syria in 2011, the regional Sunni powers - the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey - backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule. A north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would split the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it. That is essentially what IS did in 2014, when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity that straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria. Now that Sunni stake through the heart of the Shia crescent has been removed by the military defeat of IS and the failure of the Saudis, Turks and others - all American allies - to bring about regime change in Damascus. It's intriguing to wonder what would have happened had IS halted its advances and provocations after the seizure of Mosul in 2014, toned down its rhetoric, perhaps made some local compromises and accommodations. Just after the fall of Mosul, I asked the Iraqi Kurdistan President, Masoud Barzani, whether he could live with his new neighbours. ""You don't choose your neighbours,"" was his reply. But five weeks later, IS attacked and overran his areas, threatening the Kurdistan capital Irbil, and inflicting genocide on the Yazidis. ""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli. We may never fully understand why IS did it. Perhaps its virulent strain of Salafism just had to keep pushing outwards: ""Remaining and Expanding"". The Islamic State in its original form has been smashed. But for all the reasons that brought it about, IS and everything it represented will still be around in one form or another for a very long time to come.

Who is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?,"Baghdadi emerged from the shadows, appearing in Mosul in June 2014 Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri, otherwise known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was born in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq, to a lower-middle class Sunni family. His family was known for its piety and his tribe claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad. As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him ""the Believer,external"" because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Baghdadi pursued his religious interests at university. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad in 1996, and a Master's and PhD in Koranic studies from Iraq's Saddam University for Islamic Studies in 1999 and 2007 respectively. Until 2004, Baghdadi spent his graduate school years living in the Tobchi neighbourhood of Baghdad with his two wives and six children. He taught Koranic recitation to neighbourhood children at the local mosque, where he was also the star of its football club. During Baghdadi's time in graduate school, his uncle persuaded him to join the Muslim Brotherhood. Baghdadi quickly gravitated towards the few violent ultra-conservatives in the Islamist movement and by 2000, under their tutelage, had embraced Salafist jihadism. Within months of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, Baghdadi helped found the insurgent group Jaysh Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamaah (Army of the People of the Sunnah and Communal Solidarity). In February 2004, US forces arrested Baghdadi in Falluja and sent him to a detention facility at Camp Bucca, where he remained for 10 months. While in detention, Baghdadi devoted himself to religious matters, leading prayers, preaching Friday sermons, and conducting classes for prisoners. The US held Baghdadi at a detention centre in Iraq for 10 months According to a fellow inmate, Baghdadi was taciturn but had a knack for moving between the rival factions at the facility, where former Saddam loyalists and jihadists mingled. Baghdadi formed alliances with many of them and stayed in touch when he was freed in December 2004. After his release, Baghdadi contacted a spokesman for al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), a local al-Qaeda affiliate run by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Impressed with Baghdadi's religious scholarship, the spokesman convinced Baghdadi to go to Damascus, where he was to ensure AQI's propaganda adhered to the principles of ultra-conservative Islam. Zarqawi was killed in June 2006 by a US air strike and was succeeded by an Egyptian, Abu Ayyub al-Masri. That October, Masri dissolved AQI and founded the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI). The group continued to privately pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda. Because of Baghdadi's religious credentials and his ability to bridge the divide between the foreigners who founded ISI and the local Iraqis who later joined the group, Baghdadi steadily rose through the ranks. He was appointed supervisor of the Sharia Committee and named to the 11-member Shura Council that advised ISI's emir, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi. Baghdadi exploited the chaos in Syria to gain a foothold there for Islamic State Baghdadi was later appointed to ISI's Co-ordination Committee, which oversaw communication with the group's commanders in Iraq. After the deaths of ISI's founder and its emir in April 2010, the Shura Council chose Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to be the new emir. Baghdadi set about rebuilding the organisation, which had been decimated by US special operations forces. Hoping to capitalise on growing unrest in Syria in 2011, Baghdadi ordered one of his Syrian operatives to establish a secret branch of ISI in the country, later known as al-Nusra Front. Baghdadi soon fell out with the leader of al-Nusra, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, who wanted to collaborate with the mainstream Sunni rebels fighting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. But Baghdadi wanted to establish his own state through brute force before going after Assad. In the spring of 2013, Baghdadi announced that al-Nusra was part of ISI, which he renamed ""Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant"" (Isis/Isil). So-called Islamic State was formed in defiance of the al-Qaeda leadership When al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to grant al-Nusra its independence, Baghdadi refused. In February 2014, Zawahiri expelled Isis from al-Qaeda. Isis responded by fighting al-Nusra and consolidating its hold on eastern Syria, where Baghdadi imposed harsh religious laws. Its stronghold secure, Baghdadi ordered his men to expand into western Iraq. In June 2014, Isis captured Iraqi's second largest city, Mosul, and soon after, the group's spokesman proclaimed the return of the caliphate, renaming Isis ""Islamic State"". Days later, Baghdadi delivered a Friday sermon in Mosul and declared himself caliph. The media has wrongly reported Baghdadi's demise several times. But if he dies, the organisation will lose a skilled mediator, a ruthless politician, a religious scholar, and a man of noble lineage - an unusual combination for the leader of a global militant organisation, much less a proto-state.

Japan emperor set for abdication ceremony,"This video can not be played The day began with private rituals in the Imperial Palace Japan's Emperor Akihito has declared his abdication in a historic ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. In his last public address as emperor, Akihito handed over the symbols of power and thanked the public for their support during his 30-year reign. The 85-year-old was given permission to abdicate after saying he felt unable to fulfil his role because of his age and declining health. He is the first Japanese monarch to stand down in more than 200 years. Akihito technically remained emperor until midnight (15:00 GMT on Tuesday). His eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, formally ascends the throne later on Wednesday. A new era - called Reiwa, meaning order and harmony - will begin in Japan's unique calendar. The life and reign of Akihito - the human emperor The prince who will take Japan into a new era The abdication in pictures While the emperor holds no political power, he serves as a national figurehead. Akihito has endeared himself to many Japanese people during his reign as he has interacted with those suffering from disease and disaster. In the morning, the emperor took part in a Shinto ceremony to report his plans to the mythological ancestors of Japan's imperial family. The emperor took part in private Shinto ceremonies to start the day The main ""Ceremony of the Abdication"" took place in a state room of the Imperial Palace in front of about 300 people including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Crown Prince Naruhito, and Crown Princess Masako. Imperial chamberlains carried the state and privy seals into the hall, along with a sacred sword and a jewel which are considered symbols of the imperial family. In a short ceremony, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addressed the emperor, saying: ""While keeping in our hearts the path that the emperor has walked, we will make utmost efforts to create a bright future for a proud Japan that is full of peace and hope."" Then, in his final speech as emperor, Akihito, wearing a Western-style morning coat, said he ""wished Japan and the world peace and happiness"". Akihito is the first Japanese emperor to step down in more than 200 years ""I am deeply grateful for the people that accepted me as a symbol and supported me,"" he said. ""I sincerely wish, together with the empress, that the Reiwa era which begins tomorrow will be a stable and fruitful one,"" he added. ""I pray, with all my heart, for peace and happiness for all the people in Japan and around the world."" The Imperial Treasures that make a man an emperor Reiwa: Naming a new era in Japan After helping his wife, Empress Michiko, down the steps of the ceremonial platform, the emperor bowed towards the gathered officials, then left the room. The 85-year-old had surgery for prostate cancer in 2003 and a heart bypass operation in 2012. In a rare speech in 2016, he said that he feared his age would make it hard for him to carry out his duties and strongly hinted that he wanted to stand down. Emperor Akihito's 2016 address to the nation Opinion polls showed that the vast majority of Japan sympathised with him, and a year later parliament enacted a law that made his abdication possible. Prince Naruhito will become Japan's 126th emperor - and will officially lead the country into the new Reiwa era. It will mark the end of the current Heisei era, which began when Akihito ascended the throne in 1989. The 59-year-old crown prince will lead the country into a new era The 59-year-old Oxford University graduate is married to Crown Princess Masako. Their only child, Princess Aiko, was born in 2001. Japan's current law prohibits women from inheriting the throne, so Princess Aiko's uncle Prince Fumihito is now first in line, followed by her cousin, 12-year-old Prince Hisahito. This video can not be played Princess Aiko, the only child of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, will not ascend the throne because she is female The princess, the palace and the shrinking royal line It's the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. Legends date it back to about 600 BC. The emperors used to be seen as gods, but Hirohito - the father of Akihito - publicly renounced his divinity as part of Japan's surrender at the end of World War Two. It was Emperor Akihito who helped repair Japan's post-war reputation. Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko meeting with evacuees after a tsunami in 2011 Previous emperors rarely interacted with the public, but Akihito redefined the role - and has come to be known for his compassion. In 1991, two years after he ascended the throne, Akihito and the empress broke with norms and knelt down to speak to people affected by a volcanic eruption in Nagasaki. Akihito also took up the role of a diplomat, becoming an unofficial ambassador for Japan and travelling abroad extensively. While Tuesday's was the first Japanese abdication in 200 years, it wasn't so rare historically. According to Japan's state broadcaster NHK, about half the country's emperors or empresses have done the same, and it happened frequently from the 8th Century to the 19th Century. The Golden Week break - Japan's annual spring holiday - has been extended to a record 10 days to mark the occasion. When Emperor Akihito succeeded his late father, the country was in mourning, but this time people will be going on holidays, to cinemas, or staying at home to watch the events on TV. Many said they would miss the departing emperor, who will now hold the title ""Joko"", which means ""grand emperor"" or  ""Emperor Emeritus"". ""I think the emperor is loved by the people,"" Morio Miyamoto told Reuters news agency. ""His image is one of encouraging the people, such as after disasters, and being close to the people."" ""The emperor worked very hard for 30 years so I hope the handing over of the baton to the new emperor will go smoothly,"" Mikiko Fujii told the agency. ""I'm sad but also hopeful about the next era. I hope it will be a peaceful, gentle period for the second half of my life,"" said Masatoshi Kujirai, on his way to a Shinto shrine to mark the day. Watch: Akihito leaves the throne.

Cambridge investigates its slavery linksThe University of Cambridge is to investigate whether it gained financially from the slave trade.,"The University of Cambridge is to investigate its own historical links with slavery and will examine how it might have gained financially. It has launched a two-year study that will examine its archives to see whether it gained from the slave trade. Universities have faced questions about the legacy of links to slavery. ""It is only right that Cambridge should look into its own exposure to the profits of coerced labour,"" said vice-chancellor Stephen Toope. Cambridge is to hold a two-year investigation into its links to slavery ""We cannot change the past, but nor should we seek to hide from it,"" said Prof Toope, who wants the process to help the university ""acknowledge its role during that dark phase of human history"". An advisory group has been appointed, chaired by Prof Martin Millett and based in the Centre of African Studies, which will examine the university's archives, libraries and museums to find connections with slavery. ""We cannot know at this stage what exactly it will find but it is reasonable to assume that, like many large British institutions during the colonial era, the university will have benefited directly or indirectly,"" said Prof Millett. Oxford University faced a dispute over its statue of Cecil Rhodes ""The benefits may have been financial or through other gifts. ""But the panel is just as interested in the way scholars at the university helped shape public and political opinion, supporting, reinforcing and sometimes contesting racial attitudes which are repugnant in the 21st Century."" It will also consider how the university might make reparation for any links to the legacy of the slave trade - whether in symbolic terms, such as monuments or re-naming buildings, or in funding bursaries or foundations. Prof Millett highlighted that the University of Glasgow is setting up a centre for the study of slavery, after it found that it had received donations in the 18th and 19th Century, derived from slave trade profits, which could be worth up to Â£198m in present day value. Universities in the UK and the United States have faced scrutiny about whether they had benefited from slavery and coerced labour, particularly during the 18th and 19th Century. British merchants were among the main participants in the Atlantic slave trade, transporting about 3.1 million Africans (of whom 2.7 million survived the journey) to the colonies in the Caribbean, North and South America and to other countries. The three most important ports for British slave traders were London, Bristol and Liverpool. Their ships sailed to the west coast of Africa, where they traded manufactured goods for captured African people. In 1807, the British government passed an act of Parliament abolishing the slave trade throughout the British Empire - but slavery itself would persist in the British colonies until its final abolition, in 1838. There have been questions about whether such connections are still visible, such as in statues and the names of buildings, and how such legacies should be acknowledged. Georgetown University has sought to help individual descendants of its former slaves At the University of Oxford, there was a long-running dispute overa statue to Cecil Rhodes, a controversial 19th Century colonial politician. At Harvard University, in the US,the word ""master"" was removed from academic titlesbecause of concerns that it had echoes of slavery. Harvard's law school alsochanged its official sealbecause it included the crest of a brutal 18th Century slave trader. Georgetown University, also in the US,agreed to offer support to the descendants of more than 200 slaves that the university had soldin the 19th Century. The chair of governors of the University of East London has called for any universities in the UK that have a link to slavery tocontribute to a Â£100m reparation fund, which would support ethnic minority students. Another UK university, Newcastle, also recently made a discovery that showed how recent the connections with slavery could be. Researcher Hannah Durkin found the identity ofthe last known survivor of the transatlantic slave ships. The former slave, Sally Smith, had been brought from West Africa to the US in 1860, and lived until 1937 in Alabama, staying for more than 70 years on the plantation where she had been enslaved.
