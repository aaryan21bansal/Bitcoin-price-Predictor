Although pints and haircuts led the headlines in England today as lockdown measures were eased, people were also able to enjoy some other familiar activities that had been out of reach since March.

Brazil is one of the countries where new infections are on the rise There has been a record daily increase in new coronavirus cases across the globe, according to figures compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO said on Saturday that the number of cases recorded within the previous 24 hours was 212,326 - considerably higher than the previous daily record of 189,077 recorded on 28 June. The US, Brazil and India accounted for most of the new cases. Deaths remained steady at about 5,000 a day, according to the WHO tally. Chris MasonPolitical correspondent This video can not be played The other day, the prime minister's dad, Stanley Johnson,was criticised for going to Greece, despite his son's government advising against all but essential foreign travel. Mr Johnson Snr defended his trip on the grounds he was ""on essential business"" to ensure a property he rents out was ""Covid-proof"" before holidays restart. When asked about his dad's behaviour yesterday, the prime minister said: ""I think you really ought to raise that with him."" Well, set reporters a challenge and we'll often do our best to rise to it. And Stanley Johnson has been tracked down in Greece. He said ""let's open up this air bridge as quick as we can"", adding: ""People are longing to get here. This is a country that's got everything. I'm not going to say whether my actions were correct or not"". Mr Johnson said he planned to return to the UK on 10 July, the day from which it will no longer be necessary for those returning from Greece to quarantine for a fortnight on arrival back into England. The World Health Organization (WHO) is suspending its trials of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. Some early studies suggested that the drug might be able to shorten the duration of symptoms experienced by coronavirus patients and it was praised by US President Donald Trump and Brazil's leader, Jair Bolsonaro, who both said they took it as a preventative measure. However,the WHO said in a statement released on Saturday that its trials showed that hydroxychloroquine ""produced little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized Covid-19 patients"",external. The WHO said its decision would not affect trials of the drug on patients who are not in hospital, but that investigators would stop those on hospitalised patients ""with immediate effect"".

Here's what you may have missed if you're only joining us now. Roads in Soho were closed to traffic so people could stand outside A police officer stands at an elevated position to watch over the crowds Across the river at Borough Market, by London Bridge, the street was also busy Visitors drink at The Terrace beer garden at Alexandra Palace in north London And at Camden Town Brewery's pop-up beer garden, also in north London, a group waves a flag to get the bartender's attention Pubs in England reopened on Saturday - with precautions - as lockdown restrictions are eased People living in Scotland - where pubs are staying closed - have been warned to ""think carefully"" before crossing the border to visit newly-reopened pubs in England. Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said there was no law against it, but ""that seems to me like maybe not the right thing to do"". He urged Scots to wait until beer gardens opened in Scotland on Monday. One pub across the border in England, in Berwick-upon-Tweed, claimed 70% of its bookings were from Scotland. Publican Marc McDonald told BBC Scotland people had travelled from as far afield as Glasgow and Edinburgh to drink at The Meadow House. Read the full story here. The BBC's Reality Check team has examined dodgy information circulating on social media. Here are just two of the claims it found to be fake or misleading:  Read more about the claims making the rounds on social media here.  Street artists perform outside the Golden Lion pub in Todmorden, West Yorkshire We've been hearing and seeing a lot today from the pubs in England that have reopened, in the latest step to ease lockdown rules. But many stayed shut - although exactly how many is uncertain. The Night-Time Industries Association said earlier that a third of all bars, pubs and restaurants would remain closed. And now, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale said he's ""seen figures of up to 50% of pubs actually not opening today"". Nik Antona said pubs were ""opening up under uncertain circumstances. They don't know if they're going to get their customers back"". ""What you are finding is, some of the pubs haven't even bothered opening today - they want to see what's going to happen,"" he added, Meanwhile, official figures yesterday showed just one in three pubs, bars and restaurants in Newcastle City Council planned to reopen today. That goes down to one in five in Sunderland, according to the city's council. At a pub in Newcastle, punters were enjoying their first ""proper pint"" in more than three months. ""The atmosphere is a bit different... that was expected. But everyone's having a good time,"" one customer told the BBC's Fiona Trott. ""The regulations are good and everyone is sticking with them, by the looks of things,"" said his companion. ""I think everyone's just happy to be socialising again and getting out of the house."" It's a very different sort of Saturday evening from pre-lockdown expectations. Customers are expected to book a table in advance, to register their details on arrival and to stay no more than three hours. And with only a third of the city's licensed premises currently open, many are fully booked and turning customers away.  Many pubs reopened across England on Saturday, as the government eased lockdown measures Katie Prescott, Business correspondent âI feel a bit
lost,â one lady told us. âIâve had my own company for such a long time - itâs
just strange to be out even with this small number of people.â The general consensus here at
Chessington World of Adventures is that the new restrictions havenât really spoiled the experience. Kids bounce with excitement as
they munch burgers and chips, and the whoosh of the rollercoasters provide a
rattling metronome to the scene. A lot is closed. The queues are long because of
the new restrictions, but the crowds arenât here. As the company predicted this
morning, they are at a quarter of their usual capacity. The company says it is
happy with that at this stage. It will be waiting to see over the coming months
- hoping that number changes. I had a go on the runaway mine
train. Socially distanced, with gaps between carriages, but nonetheless it did
feel like the fun has started to come back. Sir Keir said the lockdown easing was ""a big test"" for the government The leader of the opposition has attacked the UK government for having its messaging ""all over the place"" as the coronavirus lockdown measures in England are relaxed. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Boris Johnson's government of sending out conflicting signals, as many hospitality venues, as well as hairdressers, theme parks and cinemas, work to reopen safely. ""You have had some government messaging saying go out and have a drink - other messaging saying be responsible, be cautious,"" Sir Keir told TimesRadio. ""The messaging, I think, has been very poor over the last few weeks."" Sir Keir added: ""Today is a massive day, and it is a real test. ""My message, really, to the government is, this is a big test for you. ""We are supporting you in easing restrictions, but you absolutely have to be on top of the risks. ""And that means that things like test, track and trace really have to work. And there has to be a much better way of dealing with local outbreaks."" Tammy McAllisterBBC News As venues like pubs and bars reopen, it's not just police who will be patrolling the streets. In Cheltenham, street pastor Maria Perry will also be on hand to help pub-goers get home safely. She said: ""You don't know how people will react, whether they will be over-keen to get back and celebrate because the pubs are open or if other people wouldn't think it was the right time. ""As a street pastor, myself and the rest of the team will be only too happy to meet anyone who would want to talk to us - we are happy to listen. ""We are non-judgemental, because who am I to judge people? We would love to see people to come up and greet us."" She added that normally people would often come up for a hug on their night out, but due to social distancing this was one thing they would be unable to do. Ms Perry and her team will be in the town centre for two hours, from 20:00 BST. A further 67 people have died in the UK after testing positive for the virus, the Department of Health and Social Care has said.

However,the WHO said in a statement released on Saturday that its trials showed that hydroxychloroquine ""produced little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized Covid-19 patients"",external. The WHO said its decision would not affect trials of the drug on patients who are not in hospital, but that investigators would stop those on hospitalised patients ""with immediate effect"".

Here's what you may have missed if you're only joining us now. Roads in Soho were closed to traffic so people could stand outside A police officer stands at an elevated position to watch over the crowds Across the river at Borough Market, by London Bridge, the street was also busy Visitors drink at The Terrace beer garden at Alexandra Palace in north London And at Camden Town Brewery's pop-up beer garden, also in north London, a group waves a flag to get the bartender's attention Pubs in England reopened on Saturday - with precautions - as lockdown restrictions are eased People living in Scotland - where pubs are staying closed - have been warned to ""think carefully"" before crossing the border to visit newly-reopened pubs in England. Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said there was no law against it, but ""that seems to me like maybe not the right thing to do"". He urged Scots to wait until beer gardens opened in Scotland on Monday. One pub across the border in England, in Berwick-upon-Tweed, claimed 70% of its bookings were from Scotland. Publican Marc McDonald told BBC Scotland people had travelled from as far afield as Glasgow and Edinburgh to drink at The Meadow House. Read the full story here. The BBC's Reality Check team has examined dodgy information circulating on social media. Here are just two of the claims it found to be fake or misleading:  Read more about the claims making the rounds on social media here.  Street artists perform outside the Golden Lion pub in Todmorden, West Yorkshire We've been hearing and seeing a lot today from the pubs in England that have reopened, in the latest step to ease lockdown rules. But many stayed shut - although exactly how many is uncertain. The Night-Time Industries Association said earlier that a third of all bars, pubs and restaurants would remain closed. And now, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale said he's ""seen figures of up to 50% of pubs actually not opening today"". Nik Antona said pubs were ""opening up under uncertain circumstances. They don't know if they're going to get their customers back"". ""What you are finding is, some of the pubs haven't even bothered opening today - they want to see what's going to happen,"" he added, Meanwhile, official figures yesterday showed just one in three pubs, bars and restaurants in Newcastle City Council planned to reopen today. That goes down to one in five in Sunderland, according to the city's council. At a pub in Newcastle, punters were enjoying their first ""proper pint"" in more than three months. ""The atmosphere is a bit different... that was expected. But everyone's having a good time,"" one customer told the BBC's Fiona Trott. ""The regulations are good and everyone is sticking with them, by the looks of things,"" said his companion. ""I think everyone's just happy to be socialising again and getting out of the house."" It's a very different sort of Saturday evening from pre-lockdown expectations. Customers are expected to book a table in advance, to register their details on arrival and to stay no more than three hours. And with only a third of the city's licensed premises currently open, many are fully booked and turning customers away.  Many pubs reopened across England on Saturday, as the government eased lockdown measures Katie Prescott, Business correspondent âI feel a bit
lost,â one lady told us. âIâve had my own company for such a long time - itâs
just strange to be out even with this small number of people.â The general consensus here at
Chessington World of Adventures is that the new restrictions havenât really spoiled the experience. Kids bounce with excitement as
they munch burgers and chips, and the whoosh of the rollercoasters provide a
rattling metronome to the scene. A lot is closed. The queues are long because of
the new restrictions, but the crowds arenât here. As the company predicted this
morning, they are at a quarter of their usual capacity. The company says it is
happy with that at this stage. It will be waiting to see over the coming months
- hoping that number changes. I had a go on the runaway mine
train. Socially distanced, with gaps between carriages, but nonetheless it did
feel like the fun has started to come back. Sir Keir said the lockdown easing was ""a big test"" for the government The leader of the opposition has attacked the UK government for having its messaging ""all over the place"" as the coronavirus lockdown measures in England are relaxed. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Boris Johnson's government of sending out conflicting signals, as many hospitality venues, as well as hairdressers, theme parks and cinemas, work to reopen safely. ""You have had some government messaging saying go out and have a drink - other messaging saying be responsible, be cautious,"" Sir Keir told TimesRadio. ""The messaging, I think, has been very poor over the last few weeks."" Sir Keir added: ""Today is a massive day, and it is a real test. ""My message, really, to the government is, this is a big test for you. ""We are supporting you in easing restrictions, but you absolutely have to be on top of the risks. ""And that means that things like test, track and trace really have to work. And there has to be a much better way of dealing with local outbreaks."" Tammy McAllisterBBC News As venues like pubs and bars reopen, it's not just police who will be patrolling the streets. In Cheltenham, street pastor Maria Perry will also be on hand to help pub-goers get home safely. She said: ""You don't know how people will react, whether they will be over-keen to get back and celebrate because the pubs are open or if other people wouldn't think it was the right time. ""As a street pastor, myself and the rest of the team will be only too happy to meet anyone who would want to talk to us - we are happy to listen. ""We are non-judgemental, because who am I to judge people? We would love to see people to come up and greet us."" She added that normally people would often come up for a hug on their night out, but due to social distancing this was one thing they would be unable to do. Ms Perry and her team will be in the town centre for two hours, from 20:00 BST. A further 67 people have died in the UK after testing positive for the virus, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. It takes the total number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community to 44,198. The DoH added that from today it will no longer be tweeting out a table showing the figures, but will instead direct people toits website.,external Â© 2025 BBC.

"Trump 4 July message: We're beating 'China plague'The president says the US is on its way to ""victory"" over Covid-19, despite a soaring infection rate.US & Canada","This video can not be played President Trump: ""We are now in the process of defeating the radical left"" US President Donald Trump has used an Independence Day address to vow to defeat the ""radical left"" as protests sweep the country. Striking a combative tone, Mr Trump said he would ""fight... to preserve American way of life"", while railing at ""mobs"" targeting historical monuments. Ahead of his speech, Black Lives Matter protesters gathered nearby. Mr Trump's 2020 election rival Joe Biden said everyone deserved ""a full share of the American dream"". The 4 July holiday marks the nation's declaration of independence from Britain in 1776 and is one of the most important days in the national calendar. Historically presidents have used the occasion to deliver speeches extolling the virtues of unity. Last year Mr Trump spoke of the ""extraordinary heritage"" of the country at an event with a militaristic theme that involved Air Force flyovers and tanks parked on display. This year, Mr Trump's address was again followed by a flyover involving various aircraft, including B-52 bombers and F-35 fighter jets. President Trump and First Lady Melania watched military aircraft soar past the White House Speaking from the White House lawn on Saturday, Mr Trump took aim at protesters that he sees as anti-patriotic who have taken to the streets in the wake of the death in police custody in May of African-American George Floyd. ""We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and the people who, in many instances, have absolutely no clue what they are doing,"" he said. ""We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children."" Statues and monuments of historical figures associated with racism or slavery have been pulled down or removed amid the wave of protests - drawing Mr Trump's ire. ""Their goal is demolition,"" he declared. Elaborating onhis plan to create a ""National Garden of American Heroes""featuring statues of renowned Americans, Mr Trump said the country's rich heritage belonged to citizens of all races. ""The patriots who built our country were not villains,"" he said. ""They were heroes."" After he spoke, protesters in Baltimore, about 40 miles (65km) north of the capital, pulled down a statue of explorer Christopher Columbus - whom Mr Trump had mentioned in his speech - and rolled it into a harbour. Protesters tied ropes to the statue of Columbus before pulling it down Many people in the US celebrate the memory of Columbus, who in textbooks is credited with discovering ""the New World"", the Americas, in the 15th Century. But Native Americans have long objected to honouring Columbus, saying that his expeditions to the Americas led to the colonisation and genocide of their ancestors. Meanwhile, in a videotaped address for 4 July, Mr Trump's Democrat challenger for the presidency in November, Joe Biden, said Americans ""have a chance now to give the marginalised, the demonised, the isolated, the oppressed a full share of American dream"". Mr Biden, who has accused Mr Trump of fuelling racial tensions, said: ""We have a chance to rip the roots of systemic racism out of this country."" Flanked by his wife Melania, President Trump spoke to a crowd at the White House that included US soldiers and frontline medical staff. Despite a nationwide spike in coronavirus cases, Mr Trump touted the country's ""progress"" against the Covid-19 disease. President Trump invited medical staff and soldiers to the 4 July event at the White House Amid criticism of his handling of the pandemic, he said China - where the virus originated - must be ""held fully accountable"". US-China battle over coronavirus Where do statues go when they die? What makes a gathering a âsuperspreaderâ event?

The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned in June that scientists may never be able to create an effective vaccine against the coronavirus. ""The estimate is we may have a vaccine within one year,"" the WHO said. ""If accelerated, it could be even less than that, but by a couple of months. That's what scientists are saying."" The US has the world's highest number of coronavirus deaths and infections, and confirmed more than 43,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours on Saturday, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Florida, where the outbreak is especially acute, saw 11,458 new cases. The president made no reference to the nearly 130,000 US deaths linked to the pandemic. He said the US had tested almost 40 million people, adding that 99% of coronavirus cases were ""totally harmless"" - a claim for which he gave no evidence. Many 4 July events were cancelled on public health grounds, with beaches in Florida and California closed, city parades cancelled and firework displays curtailed. Joe Biden tweeted that ""this Fourth of July, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask"".

"Spanish region renews strict Covid controls on 210,000","A field hospital has been erected in Lleida The government in Spain's Catalonia region has re-imposed coronavirus controls on an area of 210,000 people after a sharp rise in infections. President Quim Torra said no-one would be allowed to enter or leave SegriÃ , an agricultural area west of Barcelona which includes the city of Lleida. The local lockdown began on Saturday afternoon with provisions made to allow non-residents to leave. Catalonia is one of the Spanish regions worst affected by coronavirus. Waiting for tourists on Spain's Costa del Sol Spain welcomes tourists back as emergency ends Where can I now go on holiday in the UK? As of Friday,the region of 7.5 million people had recorded 72,860 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 12,586 deaths,external, the regional government's news agency reports. Two more deaths and 400 new cases were reported, with 155 of the new infections detected in Lleida alone. Overall, Spain has recorded more than a quarter of a million cases and at least 28,385 deaths. The country has been reopening its borders to other EU states, as well as the UK, in anticipation of summer holiday traffic. President Torra took the decision after meeting his ministers and civil defence officials. ""We are taking a step back to protect ourselves and control the outbreak,"" he said. Non-residents were given until 12:00 (10:00 GMT) on Saturday to leave and residents were advised not to travel between towns within SegriÃ . Barcelona's famous Sagrada Familia basilica was open on Saturday for key workers and their families to visit Absent residents were being allowed to return by 16:00, with exceptions to be allowed, for instance, for people returning from work.

A field hospital was set up outside LLeida's Arnau de Vilanova hospital on Friday with capacity to treat up to 105 patients if required. Sara Canals, a journalist in the region, told BBC News that, according to recent figures, 21 people were being treated in hospitals and six people were in intensive care units. ""Some might consider [this] maybe too drastic,"" she said, ""but there's a willingness here to find a right balance between reopening the economy but also to ensure safety. So the Catalan authorities have decided to lock down the region and see how this new outbreak evolves.""

Streets deserted in lockdown city,"Police patrol the streets next to the city's clock tower Restaurants, shops and pubs remain closed in Leicester's deserted centre,as the city stays in lockdown despite a relaxation of the rules elsewhere in England. Police patrolled the streets and the city's railway station, leading to an atmosphere described as ""very eerie"". The only shoppers were found in the city's market, which remains open. Leicester became subject to the UK's first local lockdown on Monday following a spike in Covid-19 cases. The city is the subject of the UK's first local lockdown Anthony Worley, who lives in the city centre, said the city had felt as if it was ""coming back to life"" following the relaxing of the initial legislation but now felt ""empty again"". ""It's very eerie,"" he said. He had booked the week off to go and visit his mother in Plymouth, whom he has not seen since Christmas. ""It was hard to tell her I wasn't coming. It's just not fair,"" he said. Anthony Worley said the streets felt ""very eerie"" The only sign of activity in the streets was around the city's open-air market, which remained open. Dhansukh Rana, 79, was shopping for some fruit and vegetables at a stall with his wife. ""It's really sad this is happening to Leicester,"" he said. ""A lot of people are suffering. ""We have to get out for our walk and exercise because, at my age, I have to keep moving but it is sad they have left out Leicester when the rest of the UK is moving on."" Dhansukh Rana said many people in the city were suffering Jessica Stone, 35, who lives in the city, said she was heading to the bank before returning home. ""Normally on a Saturday, the city would be heaving by now,"" she said. Jessica Stone wondered if other cities would follow Leicester into lockdown She added she wondered if it was ""too soon"" for the government to be relaxing lockdown across the rest of England. ""It was too soon for us in Leicester and I wonder if other areas will have similar problems after the weekend and will be shutting back down,"" she said. ""We definitely opened up too quickly so these local lockdowns could happen elsewhere."" One officer at Leicester railway station said hardly anyone was attempting an unnecessary journey. ""Most people are adhering to [the lockdown],"" he said. By Sandish Shoker, BBC News Online I'm standing on the high street which, on a normal Saturday, would have been bustling. There are no restaurants or cafes open - except for takeaways - and even the newsagents is shut. It almost seems like a ghost town, which is what one lady called it when I spoke to her.

Queues at barbers and pubs open doors in England,"This video can not be played Some salons opened their doors in the dead of night Rollercoaster rides, early morning pints and long barber shop queues - this is how England is emerging after three months of coronavirus lockdown. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, cinemas and theme parks have reopened with strict social distancing rules. But ministers have urged caution and England's chief medical officer saidthe latest step was not ""risk-free"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak welcomed the reopening of businesses, saying it was ""good news"" people are working again. On a visit to The Bell and Crown in Chiswick, west London, Mr Sunak said the almost half a million people who worked in Britain's pubs and bars were ""helping us all to enjoy summer safely"". Follow live updates as England's lockdown eases 'We cannot in good conscience open the pub' What are the new rules in pubs? Overnight stays are also allowed for the first time since lockdown started, with campsites and holiday accommodation allowed to reopen. Restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas were allowed to reopen just after midnight, with some hair salons welcoming clients in the early hours. But pubs were made to wait until 06:00 BST. Among those heading for an early drink was Frank Green, who said he was looking forward to ""the banter with everyone"" at his local, The Shropshire Arms in Chester. ""I felt a bit anxious coming in for the first time today. I think it will be fine, the landlord is very good - he doesn't stand for any nonsense,"" he said. Social distancing measures have been introduced at The Rocket pub, in Rainhill, Merseyside There were long queues outside a barbers in Clapham, south London But some 31% of bars, pubs and restaurants are not opening yet, according to the Night-Time Industries Association, amid fears for safety and warnings while the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said as many as half of England's pubs might stay shut this weekend. Camra national chairman Nik Antona said: ""The government have not really been helpful with their guidance, leaving it to the last minute in a lot of cases."" He added some pubs ""want to see what's going to happen"" before opening their doors. The Tollington pub in north London, where some staff members had been ""at death's door"" with Covid-19, is one of those staying shut. Manager Martin Whelan, said hecould not ""in good conscience open the pub when contracting a deadly virus is still possible under these guidelines"". Sandra Jacobs booked a midnight appointment at Carole Rickaby's hair salon Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the government's messaging as ""all over the place"". He told TimesRadio: ""You have had some government messaging saying go out and have a drink, other messaging saying be responsible, be cautious - the messaging, I think, has been very poor over the last few weeks."" Meanwhile, queues have been forming outside hairdressers and barbers. Sandra Jacobs was one of the first people through the door at her local hairdressers in Camden, north London, after midnight, describing it as ""such a relief"" to be back in the salon chair. ""My hair was everywhere. I'd been wearing hats to hide it,"" she said, adding that her new haircut made her feel ""normal again"". What to expect now hairdressers have reopened Her hairdresser, Carole Rickaby, said it was great to pick up the scissors again. ""We're being very cautious with aprons and facemasks, but it can be a bit of a problem,"" she said. Members of the public wear face masks on The Smiler rollercoaster at Alton Towers Other places now allowed to reopen in England include: Outdoor gyms, children's playgrounds and other outdoor spaces Libraries, community centres, bingo halls, cinemas, museums and galleries Funfairs, amusement arcades, outdoor skating rinks, social clubs and model villages Places of worship can openfor prayers and services and weddings are allowed to take place Allow Twitter content?

Two households are now able to meet indoors or outside, including for overnight stays - although they have to maintain social distancing - and campsites and hotels are allowed to reopen. People in England are still urged to stay 2m apart, but the new""one metre plus"" guidancemeans they can get closer if they use ""mitigation"" measures, such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face. All you need to know about the new measures In pictures: England enjoys lockdown easing There was heavy traffic on the M5 near Exeter and long queues on the A303 near Stonehenge, as hundreds of families headed for their first weekend away since lockdown began. Devon and Cornwall Police have warned driversthat roads are wet and ""very busy""after tourism bosses in Cornwall said 80,000 visitors were expected this weekend. Cinema-goers at Showcase Cinema in Bluewater Shopping Centre, Dartford Despite the easing of restrictions, public health experts are continuing to warn people to be cautious to avoid a second UK wave of the epidemic. Prof Robert West, an epidemiologist from University College London, told BBC Breakfast: ""The virus still is with us. We are looking at around 20,000 new infections a week and around 1,000 deaths a week and the rates aren't coming down very fast."" The latest figures, released on Saturday, showed a further 67 people died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 44,198. This video can not be played Prince William enjoyed cider and chips in a Norfolk beer garden as it prepared to reopen This is a big moment. Hospitality chiefs have described it as an important development for the national psyche. But it's also a moment when health and economic concerns collide. Trade body Hospitality UK estimates that 53% of pubs and bars and 47% of restaurants will reopen this weekend generating a total - they hope - of nine million visits. But while a sector that employs three million people is keen to reopen, many are anxious. Will too many customers return to manage venues safely or too few to make it economically worthwhile? Social distancing measures will both reduce capacity and increase front-line costs. Three-quarters of businesses expect to run their businesses at a loss this year and the industry estimates that even if this weekend goes well, the sector could lose 320,000 jobs. It is a high-stakes gamble and the government will be watching nervously to see how the public responds and behaves. That will ultimately determine whether we are getting a sufficient economic bang for the health risk buck that medical experts say we are inevitably spending this weekend.

Can more be done to combat flooding?,"Storm Dennis damaged this bridge in Crickhowell, Powys There have been calls for better leadership to bring together efforts to combat extreme flooding in Wales. The chairwoman of an independent group advising Welsh Water said bodies needed to work together on longer-term solutions but feared leadership was ""missing"". It comes as the Welsh Government announced up to Â£10m to help 800 households hit by Storm Dennis. Data shows water reached record levels on eight rivers at the storm's peak. This graph shows the River Rhondda breaking records at Tynewydd near Treherbert Records have been broken at monitoring stations measuring the levels of eight rivers in south Wales - from Swansea to Crickhowell: TheWyereached 7.14m (23ft) at Monmouth on Tuesday morning, breaking the previous record set 18 years ago. TheUskat Crickhowell also hit unprecedented levels. TheTaweat Morfa in Swansea reached nearly 6m (20ft). TheNeathat Glynneath at its peak was well over 4m (13ft), a metre above its previous highest level four years ago. TheCynonnormally runs through Aberdare at a level of around half a metre - at its peak during Storm Dennis it was around 2.2m (7ft), breaking a record set in 1998. TheRhymneyat Machen, Caerphilly county, also broke a record set 15 years before. TheRhonddawas four times its usual level at the Tynewydd monitoring station, while theTaffat Pontypridd at its peak was at a new record of over 5m (16ft). Rhondda Cynon Taf council has announced it is to spend Â£1m from reserves to help with the clean-up. The Cardiff Bay Barrage helps control water movements Cardiff Bayhas had record flows along the Taff and Ely rivers - with water travelling at 803 cubic metres per second on Sunday morning. The barrage was used to help manage water through its sluice gates. This also helps protect lower parts of inner city Cardiff where 3,000 homes were flooded in 1979. The barrage's highest recorded water level in its 20-year history was 6.3m (21ft) - at the weekend, it reached 5.4m (18ft). Water levels are normally kept at 4.4m (14ft) so operators said it managed to deal with all the water that came its way. Mark Drakeford said they had found the money to bring immediate assistance to families Woman rescued by MP she 'bad mouthed' Flood hits drinking water supply in Monmouth How dangerous is floodwater? Fears for Severn towns amid fresh flood warnings Between Â£5m and Â£10m has been announced to help all 800 flooded households,according to First Minister Mark Drakeford. ButPlaid Cymru said the flooding raised ""serious questions""about the Welsh Government's response. Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths, on a visit to Tylorstown, Rhondda, defended funding for NRW and Â£350m allocated towards flood defences. She said defences seemed to be holding up but there would be lessons learned to ensure there was full capacity to deal with climate change. ""We've put significant funding into our flood alleviation schemes over this term of government,"" she said. ""Before Storm Dennis I'd already asked for a rapid review of schemes in the pipeline. ""But it's really important local authorities and NRW have the capacity to deliver them."" Climate change 'blueprint' for Wales launched 'Our village is drowning', councillor says Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan said he wanted to hear from residents and local businesses as the council set up a major incident recovery board. ""The severity of the impact on our communities means that identifying funding to repair the damage to roads, parks, bridges, flood defences and community buildings will need to be a key financial priority for the foreseeable future,"" he said. Debris on a footbridge in Pontypridd after the flooding Mari Arthur, a member of sustainability organisation Afallen Cymru and chairwoman of Welsh Water's independent advisory panel, said: ""It's a shame we've not acted sooner. ""We've known about climate change and weather, we're having more extreme weather and there are things we can do to prevent the effect on communities."" She said there were good examples of flood defences but there needed to be longer term solutions, by working with nature ""upstream"". Ms Arthur said more sustainable water management plans and urban drainage was needed. ""But we need to deal with things upstream - plant the right trees in the right places, biodiversity with the right plants to suck up water."" She said the Welsh Government, Welsh Water and Natural Resources Wales needed to come together and has suggested creating the role of a ""commissioner for flooding"". ""No one body can do it on their own. We're missing that leadership, I feel, at the top to bring that together. That's why things aren't happening.""

Rush to convert student flats due to pandemic,"The 25-storey Zenith development has 675 rooms, but managers say the crisis could result in many beds remaining empty A fall in international students due to the coronavirus pandemic could leave Cardiff with a surplus of empty student flats, developers have warned. Universities are predicting fewerstudents will start in September. Managers of a number of private student developments have now said they will be in financial difficulty unless they can let to non-students. One property expert said there was an ""oversupply of high-end student rooms"" and some could go into administration. In recent years, a number of purpose-built student accommodation blocks (PBSAs) have been granted permission to be built in the city, with many aimed at international students and marketed as investment opportunities, including for pension schemes. Before the pandemic hit,there were claims developers were exploiting the planning system, after a number were allowed to let to non-students. This video can not be played Student flats: Are there too many in Cardiff's skyline? Since the start of the pandemic, managers of three PBSAs in the city have applied to temporarily let rooms to non-students. The Zenith development, granted temporary change of use to let 401 beds as serviced apartments in 2018, has applied to let to non-students again. Property managers Fusion Students said coronavirus had caused an ""unprecedented degree of disruption"" in the sector. Managing director Adam Cohen said there could be ""markedly fewer students arriving for the new term"" and the company would be under ""substantial financial strain"" if beds were left empty. Collegiate, which has applied for change of use at both the PBSAs it manages in Cardiff, said ""booking had virtually ground to a halt"" since universities closed in March. It said with Chinese students making up 30% of the market, any restrictions on travel and immigration ""could result in a significant shortfall in applications"". The planned tallest building in Wales, housing hundreds of students, is yet to be built despite having permission Since 2017, plans to create about7,500 new privately managed student rooms have been approved by Cardiff council. Property advisor David Feeney, of Cushman and Wakefield, said while the market was lucrative, the city was already struggling with an oversupply of ""very high-end flats"". ""If we are going to see a one-year hit to international recruitment, then that demand supply ratio becomes even more difficult, even if for just one year,"" he said, adding some schemes may go into administration due to the shortfall. ""Long term, we are very positive about a bounce back, the fundamentals show that the sector is still very attractive to international students."" But he said the situation was changing constantly and the true picture would not be seen until September.â Student housing could be turned into homeless accommodation Cardiff council has applied to its own planning committee to change one student development into homeless accommodation for the next five years to help in the aftermath of the pandemic. The block, on Newport Road, Adamsdown, is currently run by Pobl housing association, and would be leased by the authority to provide rooms for 46 rough sleepers. A report showed the council had concerns over where to house a growing number of homeless people - due to early prison releases, and being unable to ""sofa surf"" during the pandemic. It had paid an estimated Â£917,287 for 130 rooms,externalin two hotels to get people in off the streets and keep them safe during lockdown, but hopes to get the cash from the Welsh Government. The council said the use of the student accommodation would ""help alleviate the immediate impact of the crisis and form part of the recovery to close the hotels"". 'I don't even know when I'm moving to university' Cardiff students take final exams from home Students with no relatives 'may have to drop out' PBSAs are classed as ""sui generis"" in planning terms, meaning they are treated differently from other types of accommodation and standards for space are often lower. It means it can be costly for developers to turn them into long-term residential accommodation, leading to fears last year they may end up empty or have to be demolished. The Welsh Government had been due to consult on changing building regulations so all new builds,including student homes, would have to be big enough to turn into social housing. This has been delayed due to coronavirus. The British Property Federation (BPF) has called for changes to planning policy to allow student flats to be changed quickly to avoid financial difficulties and to house key workers during the pandemic. It said some private landlords were struggling financially,external, after many waived fees for students who had returned home during the pandemic, but faced picking up the council tax bills for the empty rooms. While students are exempt from council tax, when a room becomes empty, the management company must pay. The BPF said this could see companies ""punished further"" for waiving fees. BPF vice president Stewart Moore said while PBSAs were seeing more bookings as lockdown began to be eased and students made decisions, the industry had a ""hard 12 months"" ahead. Mr Moore, chief executive of CRM Students, which manages blocks in Cardiff, said 20% of staff had been furloughed and many schemes would need to make tough choices if international students chose to defer this year. But he said with students concerned about living in traditional house shares due to the virus, self-contained flats could be the solution for many.

"Action call on reopening schools in SeptemberThere is a ""serious risk"" schools will not be ready unless plans are published soon, a union claims.Wales","Marlborough Primary School in Cardiff welcomed back 95 pupils on Monday There is a ""serious risk"" schools will not be ready to reopen in September if the Welsh Government does not publish plans by Monday, according to a teaching union. The National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) Cymru said its members were frustrated they do not yet have details of what ministers expect. The Welsh Government said an update will be given in the ""coming days"". Schools reopened this weekfor a short return before the summer holidays. The NAHT said school staff cannot be expected to work through that summer break as many have ""worked continually since February"", and if plans for September were not published by Monday there would not be enough time to implement them. Education Minister Kirsty Williams has said she expects ""blended learning"" - a mix of school time and online work at home - to continue for some time, but has not ruled out a full return to school in September. What was it like as school gates reopened? 'Scenarios' drawn up for schools' September return In aletter,externalto Ms Williams, NAHT Cymru director Laura Doel said it was ""unacceptable"" that schools, parents and pupils did not know ""at this late stage"" what to plan for in the autumn term. ""Without immediate publication of your expectations of schools and your detailed advice in support of those expectations, it will be impossible for leaders to plan and implement effectively,"" Ms Doel wrote. ""Up until now, the clarity provided by the Welsh Government regarding schools has enabled school leaders to plan and deliver effectively. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Pupils back in Welsh schools after three months ""But a lack of clarity now, at this most sensitive moment, risks putting children in Wales at a serious and unnecessary disadvantage when they return in September."" In the absence of fresh guidance, the NAHT wants the education minister to confirm: That the Welsh Government will require the current social distancing guidance of two metres to be maintained in schools That the Welsh Government will continue to work with trade unions and other stakeholders throughout the summer on catch-up plans when schools return That the Welsh Government will delay any announcement that restrictions will ease in schools until after the summer break as staff will not be available to implement those changes The letter adds that head teachers fear a ""failed September return"" would do ""more harm to education than continuing with the current arrangement"". Child's play... pupils returned to Roath Primary School this week Dylan Saer, head teacher at Crwys Primary School, Gower, said: ""I don't think people realise how hard schools have had to work even though they aren't open, and school staff are shattered. ""I think it's slightly unfair to expect staff to go back to school over the summer holidays to prepare for September,"" he told BBC Radio Cymru'sPost Cyntafprogramme. ""It's only fair on school staff, and also for parents, to have time to prepare for September if we are to see changes."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Wales is the only UK nation where all pupils have been given the opportunity to attend school before the summer holidays, to see their teachers and classmates and to 'check in, catch up and prepare' for summer and September. ""Good practice and evidence from this current period is helping inform school operations for the future. ""Wales is in a unique position in having this opportunity, and that is thanks to the efforts of heads, teachers and wider school staff. ""Health and scientific advice is evolving, and having to look ahead a further two months is an added challenge. ""The education minister is looking at that advice and evidence and will provide a further update in the coming days.""

Denver police fired for photos mocking man's death,"The images showed the officers grinning as they re-enacted the chokehold Three US police officers in Colorado have been sacked after they shared photos re-enacting a chokehold used on a black man who later died. Elijah McClain, 23, died in August last year after being stopped by police. Another officer resigned over the matter. A local police chief called the images ""beyond comprehension"". Mr McClain's case attracted renewed focus in the wake of the death of George Floyd, another unarmed African-American who died in police custody. The officers who were fired were named as Jason Rosenblatt, Erica Marrero and Kyle Dittrich. The fourth, Jaron Jones, resigned on Tuesday. Vanessa Wilson, the acting police chief in Aurora, where the incident took place, called the images a crime against humanity and decency. ""We are ashamed, we are sickened, and we are angry about what I have to share,"" she told a news conference. ""While the allegations of this internal affairs case are not criminal, they are a crime against humanity and decency. To even think about doing such a thing is beyond comprehension and it is reprehensible."" This video can not be played Four numbers that explain impact of George Floyd One of the pictures shows former officers Dittrich and Jones imitating a neck hold, while Marrero smiles to their left. Jason Rosenblatt was sent the photos by text and responded ""ha ha"". Chief Wilson said she held off releasing the photos until she could share them with Mr McClain's family. Their lawyer called the images ""appalling"". Mr McClain was walking in Aurora on 24 August last year when he was stopped by three police officers. A district attorney report,externallater said there had been an emergency call about a ""suspicious person"" matching his description. There was a struggle after Mr McClain resisted contact with the officers, who wanted to search him to see if he was armed, the report says. On body cam footage Mr McClain can be heard saying, ""I'm an introvert, please respect my boundaries that I am speaking."" One of the officers then says ""he is going for your gun"", and they wrestle him to the ground and put him in a chokehold. The report says Mr McClain lost consciousness, was released from the chokehold, and began to struggle again. The officers called for assistance, with fire fighters and an ambulance responding. A medic injected Mr McClain with ketamine to sedate him. Mr McClain was then put in ""soft restraints"" on a stretcher and put inside the ambulance. The medic who had administered the drug then noticed that Mr McClain's chest ""was not rising on its own, and he did not have a pulse"". He was declared brain dead on 27 August. Demonstrators have marched in Denver to protest against the death of Mr McClain Mr McClain's family allege that the officers used excessive force for about 15 minutes as Mr McClain vomited, begged for them to stop and repeatedly told them he could not breathe. The officers also threatened to set a police dog on him, the family said. An coroner's autopsy found the cause of death to be undetermined. Colorado Governor Jared Polis has appointed a special prosecutor to review the case. Earlier this month, Aurora police banned the chokehold used on Mr McClain. New rules also say officers must intervene if they see a colleague using excessive force. This video can not be played George Floyd protests: Have the police changed?

Open for drinks - but only outdoors,"Restaurant owner Shibber Ahmed says he faces the ""heartbreaking"" prospect of closing The Blue Elephant for good if he can't reopen within a month. Some pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants in Wales will be able to reopen outdoors from 13 July, under new Welsh Government plans. Venues will be able to open in spaces they own and have licences for - as long as coronavirus cases continue to fall. But indoor services will remain closed for now, despite industry pressure. Pub chain Wetherspoon said it would not reopen its beer gardens ahead of pubs being able to open fully. Meanwhile the date for reopening self-contained accommodation has been brought forward to Saturday 11 July. The change from Monday 13 July means accommodation owners can let Saturday to Saturday, but it depends on the state of the pandemic. Outdoor attractions may also be able to open from Monday 6 July, international relations minister Eluned Morgan told the daily Welsh Government press conference. Wales is the only part of the UK without a restart date for indoor hospitality. Drinkers will be expected to book, and Baroness Morgan admitted that it would be ""difficult"" for some pubs to keep to the two-metre social distancing rules. Beer gardens in pubs will be able to open where the premises owns the space Officials are planning a phased reopening, with outdoor spaces owned by businesses and subject to existing licences opening first. A Welsh Government spokesman said that would happen ""if conditions continue to be favourable and subject to the outcome of next week's review of the regulations"". Ministers will consider the reopening of ""indoor services"" later: Depending on the success of outdoor opening The ongoing coronavirus situation in Wales Other measures businesses put in place to reduce the risk of transmission, such as booking, table service only, and even the use of apps. The move will come a week after theplanned end of Wales' travel restrictions- due to happen on Monday 6 July. The Wales TUC said it welcomed the decision, adding: ""Workers' health and safety is paramount, a worker's health cannot be put above a company's profits."" A spokesman said: ""We will continue pushing for bosses to pay proper sick pay should a worker need to self isolate, as statutory sick pay of Â£95 per week is not a viable option, particularly in an industry where fair work and low pay remains a real problem."" Prince William opened the new Brains Brewery in Cardiff Bay in 2019 Shibber Ahmed, owner of The Blue Elephant restaurant in Llandudno, Conwy, said: ""All we see is TBC, that's it. I don't think I can carry on more than a month."" He added he faces the ""heart-breaking"" prospect of going out of business if he is not able to reopen within a month. ""For the last 13 years I've been doing business in this town. If I have to shut down the doors then it will be very, very distressing for me."" Alex Di Iulio, of the Castellamare restaurant in Mumbles, Swansea, said the weather would be a deciding factor. ""If it rains from 13 July on, then I've bought Â£5,000 worth of food - what do I do with it? What do I do with my staff? What do I tell them?"" Gwyn Davies, who runs the Fountain Inn in Builth Wells, Powys, said he had doubts over whether customers would stick to social distancing - and whether they would come at all. ""I don't think it's going to be a perfect scenario. Most beer gardens aren't covered and most Welsh summers are very wet. I don't see how we're going to have the customers,"" he said. ""Most beer gardens are too small for social distancing guidelines and will we see the public come back for drinks anyway? ""Once people have had a few beers will they still care about social distancing?"" He added that he fears ""some people are quite blasÃ© to the virus."" Alistair Darby, chief executive of Brains, Wales' largest domestic pub chain, said it was only likely to open ""one or two"" of its 104 pubs managed by the brewery from 13 July. Brains owns a further 60 premises which are run independently by tenants. ""Many will want to open if they can,"" said Mr Darby, ""but at the very most I would say 30 to 40 will do so"". He said that while many pubs did have outdoor spaces ""no-one wants to go down the road and expense"" of things like marquees and portable toilets. Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ""We are looking forward to opening all of our pubs in Wales as and when the Welsh Government gives the go-ahead. ""We will not be opening our beer gardens in advance of that."" Shumana Palit, co-founder of the Ultracomida Group - behind two deli-restaurants in Narberth and Aberystwyth, as well as Curado Bar and Vermut in Cardiff, said: ""As the furlough schemes, grants and loans that have helped us to survive are already running out, our main feeling at this point is that this is all too little, too late. ""The news today that it's only outdoor spaces that will be allowed to open from the middle of July is heart-breaking for us, as we don't have much outdoor space at all."" International Relations Minister Eluned Morgan defended the cautious approach at the daily Welsh Government briefing. ""If we open too quickly, as we have seen in some parts of the world, we'll just simply have to go back into lockdown and that's not a place we want to be. A group of restaurant owners, the Wales Independent Restaurant Collective, warned fewer than 50% of independent pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to open outside from 13 July and those that do only expect to get 25% of their usual turnover. It gave a ""conservative estimate"" that 10,000 jobs would be lost before the end of summer. Baroness Morgan said she was ""intensely aware"" of the numbers who worked in the hospitality sector and the numbers of people who feel ""very pressurised"" at the moment. The landlord of the Fountain Inn is concerned about people social distancing Ministers were ""working closely"" with Public Health Wales ""to make sure that we can trace people who have attended different hospitality areas"", with names of drinkers taken,"" she said. ""There will be an expectation that people will need to pre-book, and that those names will be taken so all of those measures will be put in place,"" she said. The minister acknowledged it would be ""difficult"" for the hospitality sector to stick to the two-metre social distancing rule and said government and the sector were ""working on putting additional protection measures in place"". Sarah John set up Boss Brewing in her garage Sarah John, who owns Boss Brewery in Swansea, said: ""In our beer garden, if we were to do a two-metre rule, I hate to sound negative but it's probably not going to be commercially viable. I don't see it working for lots of pubs."" Tommy Heaney, who owns Heaney's restaurant in Pontcanna, Cardiff, called it ""positive news"", adding: ""We do have outdoor space but the style of food we do doesn't suit outdoor dining so we'd have to review our offering."" He said two or three weeks would have been good preparation time, calling 10 days ""not ideal"", but said: ""We've been doing takeaways and we've been blown away by the support"".

Restaurants call for more government help What do the latest lockdown rules mean? Fear pubs 'will go bust' because of two-metre rule No date has yet been given for indoor reopening in Wales The hospitality industrywas closed across the UK on 20 Marchbefore the coronavirus lockdown fully came into effect. Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes in Englandare opening from 4 July. They open a day earlierin Northern Ireland. Restrictions in England include changes to shift patterns, mandatory table service and more use of hand sanitiser. In Scotland, beer gardens and outdoor restaurants can reopenfrom 6 July. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to use indoor areas from 15 July. Cafes, restaurants and pubs have been shut since March Leaked minutes of a meeting between Welsh Government and council officials show the government is ""looking at"" allowing 1m (just over 3ft) social distancing for outdoor hospitality. Officials had considered three dates for reopening, according to the minutes, seen by BBC Wales - 6 July and 17 July were also examined. Other measures considered include: Businesses being able to apply for licences to put out furniture and serve on the pavement Play areas in pubs remaining closed Allowing customers a ""dwell time"" in the premises of one hour 45 minutes Pubs, cafes and restaurants employ a significant number of people in Wales and play an important part economically in communities. Those 68,000 people working in the industry include 22,000 full time staff. Factfile for Wales Â£2.1bnworth to the economy of accommodation and food 38,000people working in restaurants, cafes and mobile food service 30,000people working in pubs Â£30,000 a yeargross value added (GVA) per person As well as playing an important role in the wider accommodation and food sector, these businesses are closely linked to tourism and local food production. The supply chains for these are very important economically and socially. However they vary depending on the type of business. Big chains like Frankie and Benny's or Greene King are more likely to buy food from central wholesalers in England or further afield. Independent businesses are much more likely to buy locally and make a feature of that. That is virtually impossible to quantify - so we have anecdotal evidence to rely on at the moment. However we do know that Welsh Government policy for many years has been to link Welsh food to tourism and to encourage local supply chains. The harsh reality is that gross value added (GVA) per person in accommodation and food in Wales in 2018 was approximately Â£30,000 a year. This compared with GVA per person in manufacturing of Â£78,000 a year. So one could argue that manufacturing has more impact but that is just focusing on one measurement. It is important to remember that jobs in pubs, cafes and restaurants also create employment in parts of Wales that manufacturing would set up in. Concerns have also been raised over pubs and restaurants in residential areas, with more security and CCTV needed. Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said a timetable should have been given earlier, calling Welsh ministers ""ad-hoc approach"" to easing restrictions ""problematic"". Darren Millar, Welsh Conservative Covid-19 recovery spokesman, said Thursday's announcement would be ""welcome news for some businesses in the hospitality sector across Wales but without a relaxation of the two-metre social distancing rules, and the ability to use indoor spaces, it still won't be viable for many businesses"". The Welsh Local Government Association said it would continue to work closely with Welsh Government and other partners ""to safely and gradually reopen the hospitality industry in Wales"". Self-contained tourist properties will be able to reopen from 11 July Eluned Morgan used the press conference to set out 9 July as the date that the Welsh Government could sign off on plans to reopen self-contained holiday accommodation - like cottages or caravans - with no shared facilities for 11 July. ""We have brought thisÂ forward from 13 July, after discussing this further with the sector, to enable bookings to be taken from the Saturday to Saturday,"" she said.

Hairdressers and pubs reopen in England,"This video can not be played Some salons opened their doors in the dead of night Rollercoaster rides, early morning pints and long barber shop queues - this is how England is emerging after three months of coronavirus lockdown. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, cinemas and theme parks have reopened with strict social distancing rules. But ministers have urged caution and England's chief medical officer saidthe latest step was not ""risk-free"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak welcomed the reopening of businesses, saying it was ""good news"" people are working again. On a visit to The Bell and Crown in Chiswick, west London, Mr Sunak said the almost half a million people who worked in Britain's pubs and bars were ""helping us all to enjoy summer safely"". Follow live updates as England's lockdown eases 'We cannot in good conscience open the pub' What are the new rules in pubs? Overnight stays are also allowed for the first time since lockdown started, with campsites and holiday accommodation allowed to reopen. Restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas were allowed to reopen just after midnight, with some hair salons welcoming clients in the early hours. But pubs were made to wait until 06:00 BST.

Trade body Hospitality UK estimates that 53% of pubs and bars and 47% of restaurants will reopen this weekend generating a total - they hope - of nine million visits. But while a sector that employs three million people is keen to reopen, many are anxious. Will too many customers return to manage venues safely or too few to make it economically worthwhile? Social distancing measures will both reduce capacity and increase front-line costs. Three-quarters of businesses expect to run their businesses at a loss this year and the industry estimates that even if this weekend goes well, the sector could lose 320,000 jobs. It is a high-stakes gamble and the government will be watching nervously to see how the public responds and behaves. That will ultimately determine whether we are getting a sufficient economic bang for the health risk buck that medical experts say we are inevitably spending this weekend.

No date set for when Welsh pubs can reopen,"This video can not be played SA Brain chief executive Alistair Darby: ""The industry is running out of time rapidly"" Work is ""ongoing"" on when pubs can reopen but no date has been set, a Welsh Government minister has said. Wales is the only one of the UK nations without a planned reopening date for the pub trade. Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives have called for a timetable. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said discussions were taking place with the industry. ""I want to reassure you that the work is actively ongoing,"" she said. The Welsh Government has promised a ""rapid review"" to consider a phased reopening. On Wednesday the Scottish Government announced beer gardens could reopen there from 6 July, and pubs and restaurants can fully reopen from 15 July. The hospitality sectoris due to reopen in England from 4 July, whilein Northern Irelandpubs and hotels can open on 3 July. Ms Evans said timings could not be provided in Wales ""because it's very, very difficult to know where the coronavirus will be in the weeks and months ahead"". Pubs have been closed in Wales since the start of lockdown in March Helen Mary Jones, Plaid Cymru's economy spokeswoman, said she would welcome a similar approach to Scotland. ""If Welsh Government does not believe this is a possible step, I would look for an alternative timetable to be confirmed as soon as possible,"" she said. ""Plaid Cymru has been consistent in our assertion that public health should come first, but our economy sits on a cliff edge and we've never had a clearer signal that it may be safe to act to save it."" Darren Millar, Welsh Tory Covid recovery spokesman, said: ""The lack of an indicative timetable for the reopening of pubs and restaurants in Wales is now a major concern. ""If Scotland, England, and Northern Ireland have managed to set out a timetable for these businesses to reopen safely then Wales can too; I urge the first minister to give those whose employment is at risk some hope by setting out a timetable today."" Ms Evans, speaking at the daily Welsh Government press conference, said discussions were taking place with the industry. ""I can't give you a timetable or a date but I want to reassure you that the work is actively ongoing with the hospitality sector."" Dates for pub reopening have been set in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland Each stage of the reopening after lockdown had been co-ordinated, she said, adding that talks were happening to see if more outdoor seating could be provided in town and city centres to help the hospitality industry. She said each UK nation was taking a different approach, citing building work and non-essential retail being open in Wales but closed in Scotland. Shops in Scotland are opening on the 29 June. Last week Brains brewerywarned many Welsh pubs would go bust- putting thousands of jobs at risk - unless social distancing measures are relaxed. Alistair Darby, the chief executive officer of Wales' largest brewery, said: ""All business needs certainty and we aren't getting that at the moment, and the longer the uncertainty continues the more people are going to lose their jobs."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""The first minister has asked for a rapid review of the hospitality sector to consider a potential phased reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants. Those discussions are taking place with a wide range of interests across the hospitality sector in Wales and have been constructive. We will announce our intentions when further headroom for change allows."" ""We have adopted a careful and gradual approach to easing the restrictions. We will be guided by the latest scientific and medical advice and will carefully monitor the impact of each change,"" she added.

Tesco demands supplier cuts in discount battleBritainâs biggest supermarket has reportedly given suppliers until 10 July to agree price cuts.Business,"Tesco has reportedly asked suppliers to agree price cuts as it steps up its battle with budget supermarkets. The move is part of its shift to an ""everyday low pricing strategy"", which will see it use fewer promotions. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""We are committed to open, fair and transparent partnerships with all of our suppliers."" Tesco has given suppliers a deadline of 10 July to agree,according to the Grocer.,external Several suppliers told the trade publication that they faced pressure from the supermarket to lower their prices. Some raised concerns over the timescale of the demands, as well as a lack of clarity over how the change in promotions would work in practice. Tesco shoppers buying more during fewer trips Tesco sells Polish supermarket business Tesco launched its ""Aldi price match"" promise in March, where products including fresh and freezer food are matched against those offered at the budget supermarket. The supermarket announced in June that it has extendedthe scheme to nearly 500 Tesco and branded products in response to increasing competition. ""We have also reduced the number of short-term promotions, as we focus our investment on everyday low prices instead,"" it said. A Tesco spokesperson told BBC News: ""We have been speaking to suppliers about how we can work together to continue giving our customers great value. ""We don't believe that our customers should pay more for a brand in Tesco than anywhere else."" They added: ""We are committed to open, fair and transparent partnerships with all of our suppliers, and that collaborative approach will continue as we look for new and innovative ways to bring our customers great value."" Tesco reported strong first quarter sales last week. The supermarket said that while the number of trips made by shoppers fell by nearly a third in the 13 weeks to 30 May, the amount being bought rose 64%. In a trading update, Tesco said group sales had risen 8% to Â£13.4bn in the period, but warned that coronavirus-related costs were set to hit Â£840m this year. Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Group, said that investors ""should keep a close eye on the company, since the group operates in a crowded market with retailers Aldi and Lidl continuing to gain market share and current results might not be replicated when the UK is lifted from lockdown.""

India state's dog meat ban hailed as 'turning point',"Activists have long campaigned for an end to the sale of dog meat The Indian state of Nagaland has banned the import, trading and sale of dog meat, in a move celebrated by animal rights activists. The north-east state's government announced the ban following a sustained campaign by animal welfare groups. They hailed the decision as a ""major turning point"" in ending cruelty to dogs in India. But some civil society groups criticised the ban, calling it an attack on food customs in the state. Eating dog meat is illegal in parts of India, but some communities in north-eastern areas consider it a delicacy. ""The State Government has decided to ban commercial import and trading of dogs and dog markets and also the sale of dog meat, both cooked and uncooked. Appreciate the wise decision taken by the State's Cabinet,"" Nagaland's Chief Secretary Temjen Toy tweeted on Friday. The government shared no further details about how it planned to enforce the ban. Indian media said the ban came after a picture of dogs bound in sacks at a wet market was circulated widely on social media, provoking outrage. The countries where people still eat cats and dogs On Thursday, the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisation (FIAPO) said it was ""hit by shock and horror at recent images"" of dogs in ""terrifying conditions, tied up in sacks, waiting at a wet market, for their illegal slaughter, trade, and consumption as meat"". The group urged Nagaland's government to enforce an immediate ban on selling dog meat. The FIAPO was among several animal rights organisations, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), to spearhead campaigns against the sale of dog meat in Nagaland. The Humane Society International (HSI), which has campaigned for years to end India's dog-meat trade, welcomed the decision by Nagaland's government. ""The suffering of dogs in Nagaland has long cast a dark shadow over India, and so this news marks a major turning point in ending the cruelty of India's hidden dog meat trade,"" managing director of HSI, Alokparna Sengupta said. This video can not be played South Korea dog meat: The dogs saved from being eaten An estimated 30,000 dogs a year are smuggled into Nagaland, where they are sold in live markets and ""beaten to death with wooden clubs"", according to the HSI. Earlier this year, the state of Mizoram took the first step towards ending the sale of dogs, by amending legislation to remove them from the list of animals suitable for slaughter. While not widespread, the eating of dogs does take place in other countries, including China, South Korea and Thailand.

""My hair was everywhere. I'd been wearing hats to hide it,"" she said, adding that her new haircut made her feel ""normal again"". What to expect now hairdressers have reopened Her hairdresser, Carole Rickaby, said it was great to pick up the scissors again. ""We're being very cautious with aprons and facemasks, but it can be a bit of a problem,"" she said.

Two households are now able to meet indoors or outside, including for overnight stays - although they have to maintain social distancing - and campsites and hotels are allowed to reopen. People in England are still urged to stay 2m apart, but the new""one metre plus"" guidancemeans they can get closer if they use ""mitigation"" measures, such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face.

Devon and Cornwall Police have warned driversthat roads are wet and ""very busy""after tourism bosses in Cornwall said 80,000 visitors were expected this weekend. Cinema-goers at Showcase Cinema in Bluewater Shopping Centre, Dartford Despite the easing of restrictions, public health experts are continuing to warn people to be cautious to avoid a second UK wave of the epidemic. Prof Robert West, an epidemiologist from University College London, told BBC Breakfast: ""The virus still is with us. We are looking at around 20,000 new infections a week and around 1,000 deaths a week and the rates aren't coming down very fast."" The latest figures, released on Saturday, showed a further 67 people died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 44,198.

Hospitality chiefs have described it as an important development for the national psyche. But it's also a moment when health and economic concerns collide. Trade body Hospitality UK estimates that 53% of pubs and bars and 47% of restaurants will reopen this weekend generating a total - they hope - of nine million visits. But while a sector that employs three million people is keen to reopen, many are anxious. Will too many customers return to manage venues safely or too few to make it economically worthwhile? Social distancing measures will both reduce capacity and increase front-line costs. Three-quarters of businesses expect to run their businesses at a loss this year and the industry estimates that even if this weekend goes well, the sector could lose 320,000 jobs. It is a high-stakes gamble and the government will be watching nervously to see how the public responds and behaves. That will ultimately determine whether we are getting a sufficient economic bang for the health risk buck that medical experts say we are inevitably spending this weekend.

India state's dog-meat ban a 'major turning point',"Activists have long campaigned for an end to the sale of dog meat The Indian state of Nagaland has banned the import, trading and sale of dog meat, in a move celebrated by animal rights activists. The north-east state's government announced the ban following a sustained campaign by animal welfare groups. They hailed the decision as a ""major turning point"" in ending cruelty to dogs in India. But some civil society groups criticised the ban, calling it an attack on food customs in the state. Eating dog meat is illegal in parts of India, but some communities in north-eastern areas consider it a delicacy. ""The State Government has decided to ban commercial import and trading of dogs and dog markets and also the sale of dog meat, both cooked and uncooked. Appreciate the wise decision taken by the State's Cabinet,"" Nagaland's Chief Secretary Temjen Toy tweeted on Friday. The government shared no further details about how it planned to enforce the ban. Indian media said the ban came after a picture of dogs bound in sacks at a wet market was circulated widely on social media, provoking outrage. The countries where people still eat cats and dogs On Thursday, the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisation (FIAPO) said it was ""hit by shock and horror at recent images"" of dogs in ""terrifying conditions, tied up in sacks, waiting at a wet market, for their illegal slaughter, trade, and consumption as meat"". The group urged Nagaland's government to enforce an immediate ban on selling dog meat. The FIAPO was among several animal rights organisations, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), to spearhead campaigns against the sale of dog meat in Nagaland. The Humane Society International (HSI), which has campaigned for years to end India's dog-meat trade, welcomed the decision by Nagaland's government. ""The suffering of dogs in Nagaland has long cast a dark shadow over India, and so this news marks a major turning point in ending the cruelty of India's hidden dog meat trade,"" managing director of HSI, Alokparna Sengupta said. This video can not be played South Korea dog meat: The dogs saved from being eaten An estimated 30,000 dogs a year are smuggled into Nagaland, where they are sold in live markets and ""beaten to death with wooden clubs"", according to the HSI. Earlier this year, the state of Mizoram took the first step towards ending the sale of dogs, by amending legislation to remove them from the list of animals suitable for slaughter. While not widespread, the eating of dogs does take place in other countries, including China, South Korea and Thailand.
