Mask law and one metre rule set to end in England,"Boris Johnson is expected to confirm he is confident the majority of the remaining Covid restrictions in England can be lifted from 19 July. Making face masks voluntary and ending 1m-plus social distancing and QR code sign-ins at restaurants will be among his press conference announcements. The PM said people must ""learn to live"" with Covid and ""exercise judgement"". Infections are expected to rise when rules are eased but ministers believe deaths will be limited by vaccinations. A further 27,334 cases were reported across the UK on Monday, alongside another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The fourth and final stage of the government's roadmap out of lockdown in England was delayed last month to no earlier than 19 July. Among thecurrent measuresare the ""rule of six"" for gatherings, table service in pubs and restaurants, capacity limits in theatres and cinemas, the closure of nightclubs, and working from home guidance. However, while many of the remaining rules and guidance looks set to be swept away, the prime minister is not expected to address self isolation, travel restrictions or therules in schools. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules, and the Scottish government has suggested it mayretain some basic measures, including wearing masks, at its next review in August. Live coverage: Doubts over masks ahead of lockdown update What is Boris Johnson expected to say about 19 July? Dropping face mask rules negligent, says union Will we still have to socially distance this summer? The chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said it ""makes no sense"" to stop wearing face masks in enclosed public settings amid a rising number of cases of the Delta variant. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""face masks are proven to reduce spread of this infection"" and ""we can't understand why we would knowingly want people to become infected"". Unions representing public transport and shop workerssaid their staff would face even more risk of infection if face mask rules are dropped. Meanwhile, Ryanair said face masks would remain mandatory on its flight ""in order to protect the health of our passengers and crew"". In comments released by Downing Street before the prime minister gives his update at a 17:00 BST news conference, Mr Johnson said he ""must stress that the pandemic is not over and that cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks"". But praising the successful vaccine rollout, he said he would ""set out how we can restore people's freedoms"", adding: ""As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgement when going about our lives."" Downing Street said step four of the easing would go ahead in two weeks' time only if the government's ""four tests"" for easing curbs had been met. The verdict on those tests - on the jab rollout, vaccine effectiveness, hospital admissions, and new virus variants - would only be confirmed on 12 July following a review of the latest data. The findings of reviews on the use of Covid certification - or vaccine passports - andon social-distancing measuresare also due to be announced by Mr Johnson. It is understood the restriction banning pub-goers from ordering a drink directly at the bar will be dropped. But Downing Street stressed rules against travel to high-risk countries, the requirement to isolate if people test positive, as well as surge and community Covid testing programmes would continue after 19 July. Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update the Commons on the changes at the same time Mr Johnson holds his briefing at Downing Street alongside England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Behavioural psychologist Prof Stephen Reicher, one of the scientists advising the government, expressed concern about the face mask plans. He told Today: ""We need very clear messaging and in certain spaces - crowded, badly ventilated spaces - masks are crucial mitigation,"" adding ministers needed to provide ""support and proportionate mitigations to keep us safe. Along with the vaccine, that's the way out"". How can I visit my relative in a care home? Laura Kuenssberg: How much will life change on 19 July? Paul Nowak, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ""vital"" people would be returning to Covid-secure work sites. ""I just don't think it is acceptable for the government to simply outsource its responsibilities to individuals and to individual employers,"" he said. This video can not be played Some may choose to be cautious after 19 July, says NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen Powis Meanwhile, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to confirm ""what level of mortality and cases of long Covid"" it considers acceptable. ""Letting cases rise with no action means further pressure on the NHS, more sickness, disruption to education - and risks a new variant emerging with a selection advantage,"" he warned. Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director for NHS England, said infections were currently rising but hospital rates were not increasing at the same rate as previous peaks and ""things are looking very good"". He told BBC Breakfast the NHS was ""well used to coping with pressures, we do it every year and every winter. So we are prepared."" From the start of the pandemic, the single most important measure for controlling Covid was getting people to isolate when they had symptoms. It's why so many have urged the government to do more to support people financially when they do so. Everything else from mask-wearing and social distancing to contract tracing was about marginal gains on top. As we learnt more about the ability of the virus to spread before symptoms developed or among those who were asymptomatic those marginal gains became more important. But alongside isolating when ill, the new tool in the fight against Covid is, of course, vaccination. Not only do the vaccines protect you, they protect others by curbing spread by cutting your chances of being infected in the first place and your risk of passing on the virus if you do become infected. With high vaccination uptake, all those other measures are much less important than they once were. That's why ministers feel they can ditch many of them - and in doing so become arguably the first nation to relax restrictions on this scale with infections rising and attempt to learn to live with Covid. The review of social-distancing measures has been of particular interest to the hospitality industry, which says many venues are unable to operate profitably under restrictions on capacity and table service rules. The findings of a review into Covid certification are also expected. The use of certificates to prove a person's Covid vaccination or test status has been welcomed by some travel industry bosses and leading sports bodies - but the concept has raised concerns over discrimination and privacy. Separately, the PM will give further details on the future of care home visits. At the moment, care home residents in England can choose up to five people who can visit regularly, but no more than two people should visit at one time or in one day. Care minister Helen Whately says visits are unlikely to ""completely go back to normal"" as there was a need for some precautions for residents - and face coverings were expected to remain a requirement. Around 64% of the UK adult population has now received a second vaccine dose, with just over 86% having now received at least a first dose. No 10 has said the government is ensuring preparations are in place to offer third ""booster"" doses to everyone aged over 50 and the most vulnerable over the winter months.

Wildcard Raducanu retires injured at Wimbledon,"Emma Raducanu called on her trainer while a set and a break down Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere British wildcard Emma Raducanu retired from her Wimbledon fourth-round match after suffering breathing difficulties as her dream debut came to a heartbreaking end. The 18-year-old was trailing 4-6 0-3 to Ajla Tomljanovic when she called on a trainer. She left the court to receive further treatment, but it was soon announced she would not be returning. Tomljanovic will face fellow Australian Ashleigh Barty in the quarter-finals. Later on Monday, Wimbledon confirmed that Raducanu retired from the match because of ""difficulty breathing"". ""I am really sorry for her, I wish we could have finished it. I am wishing her all the best,"" Tomljanovic said. Raducanu, who was ranked 338th in the world before the tournament, had lost a tight first set and it was early in the second when she started to show signs that all was not well, frequently putting a hand to her stomach and showing hints of breathlessness. When Tomljanovic went 3-0 up, Raducanu called on a trainer at the change of ends, with a second medic soon following and appearing to listen to her chest. They quickly took her off court, and after only a few minutes, it was announced Raducanu was not fit to continue. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2021: How British teenager Raducanu lit up the first week of Wimbledon The young Briton had enjoyed a remarkable rise over the last week at Wimbledon, her maiden Grand Slam only a month after making her WTA Tour debut. She beat two top-50 opponents, Marketa Vondrousova and Sorana Cirstea, to reach the last 16, making her the last Briton standing in the singles draws. Raducanu was proving to be the story of the championships, the likes of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the prime minister, astronaut Tim Peake and musician Liam Gallagher among thousands tweeting their support. ""In so many ways this has been a life-changing week for her,"" former world number one Tracy Austin told BBC Sport. ""She was ranked 338 and now she's going to go into the 100s so it will make it much easier for her to play higher-level tournaments. ""She has a wonderful game as far as very athletic, a very good head on her shoulders, she seems very grounded because she has stayed in school. She has got ways to win points with weapons, she's got a terrific defence, it all looks great."" Raducanu and Tomljanovic had to wait for their meeting, the match not getting under way until 20:00 BST, owing to a five-set thriller between Alex Zverev and Felix Auger-Aliassime on Court One before them. But they were welcomed on to court to a rapturous applause, the capacity of Court One - and neighbouring Centre Court - increased to 75% on Manic Monday, so-called because every men's and women's singles fourth-round match is played. Little could separate the two once they did get going, Raducanu forced to save a break point in the second game before missing out on a break herself in the seventh as she continued to impress with her strong backhands and fine baseline strokes. Raducanu failed to convert two further break points, before world number 75 Tomljanovic, who defeated former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the previous round, capitalised on her own next break point to take the first set. It was the first set Raducanu had dropped in the tournament, but her troubles continued as she face two break points on her opening service game of the second set, saving the first with a driving backhand down the line, but she could not save the second. But the boisterous support in the Court One stands, cheering Raducanu's every point as though she had won a set, soon changed to concern as it became clear she was unwell. When it was announced she had retired, the court gave Raducanu an ovation, saddened her fairytale run had to end this way.

Afghan troops flee country after Taliban clashes,"More than 1,000 Afghan soldiers have fled to neighbouring Tajikistan after clashing with Taliban militants, officials have said. The troops retreated over the border to ""save their own lives"", according to a statement by Tajikistan's border guard. Violence has risen in Afghanistan and the Taliban have been making significant gains, particularly in the north of the country, in recent weeks. The surge comes as the US, UK and allies withdraw after 20 years. The vast majority of remaining foreign forces in Afghanistan have left ahead of a September deadline. There are concerns that the Afghan military, who were supposed to take over security in the country, will collapse. Under a deal with the Taliban, the US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops in return for a commitment by the militants not to allow any extremist group to operate in the areas they control. But the Taliban did not agree to stop fighting Afghan forces, and now reportedly control about a third of the country. Who are the Taliban? How can the West fight terror after leaving? US troops must leave by deadline - Afghan Taliban The retreat is the third time Afghan soldiers have fled to Tajikistan over the past three days and the fifth case over the past fortnight.  In total, nearly 1,600 soldiers have crossed the border. This group of Afghan soldiers fled to Tajikistan in June The latest group of Afghan troops sought refuge early on Monday morning after fighting with militants during the night, Tajikistan's National Security Committee said. Badakhshan and Takhar provinces, which border Tajikistan, have seen a rapid Taliban advance. ""The Taliban cut off all the roads and these people had nowhere to go but to cross the border,"" one senior Afghan official told Reuters on Monday. Zabihullah Atiq, a parliamentarian from Badakhshan, said the troops had used various routes to flee. Tajik border guards said Afghan soldiers were being provided with shelter and food, but further details were not available. By Kawoon Khamoosh, BBC News With the new surge in violence across the country, Afghan forces are facing an unprecedented level of combat in the absence of foreign troops. Government officials have been tweeting non-stop to keep soldiers motivated by underlying their sacrifices. But much of the troops' motivation disappears amid news of retreat, collapse of key districts and casualties. Military officials in Kabul have talked about ""tactical retreat"" whenever insurgents made gains, but we hear from commanders in the battlefield about a lack of ammunition, and delays in sending support. In Badakhshan province, where the government lost significant territory in recent days, local sources say many government officials ""escaped"" to Kabul way before Taliban attacks. Not only can this dishearten soldiers, but it also raises the bigger question of the loyalty of high-ranking officials in peace talks. Will political leaders - whose families already reside abroad - remain in the country if full-scale civil war erupts? President Ashraf Ghani insists that Afghan security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but there have also been reports of more soldiers seeking refuge in Pakistan and Uzbekistan to escape the fighting. Neighbouring countries are bracing themselves for a potential influx of refugees if the fighting continues to intensify. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC the group was not responsible for the recent increase in violence.  He insisted that many districts had fallen to the Taliban through mediation after Afghan soldiers refused to fight. This video can not be played ""US forces remaining would violate Doha agreement"" - Taliban For the people of Afghanistan, it is a worrying time, says Lyse Doucet, the BBC's chief international correspondent. The Taliban, who have been accused of various human rights and cultural abuses, support Islamic punishments - such as public executions of convicted murderers - as well as banning television, music and cinema, and disapproving of girls over 10 going to school. ""They are uncertain about uncertain about their own lives and the futures of their families,"" she says. Zahra, a 25-year-old resident of Kabul, is among those concerned about the future. ""People are expecting a wider than ever war. A lot of people in Kabul fear that the Taliban might reach us at any time,"" she toldBBC OS on World Service radio. Zahra said people in Kabul feared the Taliban could reach the city ""at any time"" Jamshid, a student at Kabul University, said he did not plan to stay in the country if the Taliban took power. There are also growing concerns about how to protect diplomatic missions in Afghanistan. Russia on Monday announced that it had temporarily suspended operations at its consulate in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif because of the deteriorating security situation. Envoy Zamir Kabulov said Afghan troops had surrendered too many districts, making the situation unstable. Turkey and Iran have also suspended operations in the city, moving diplomats to Kabul, according to reports. US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US that triggered the invasion. However, it has gradually regained enough strength to seize territory again. The Taliban entered direct talks with the US in 2018, and President Joe Biden has said the American pull-out is justified as US forces have made sure Afghanistan cannot become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West again. However, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai told the BBC he believed the Nato and US military mission there had failed in defeating terrorism and extremism. This video can not be played Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai: Nato failed to defeat extremism He called on both the Afghan government and the Taliban to ""sit down and talk as soon as possible for peace"". From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.

This video can not be played Wimbledon 2021: How British teenager Raducanu lit up the first week of Wimbledon The young Briton had enjoyed a remarkable rise over the last week at Wimbledon, her maiden Grand Slam only a month after making her WTA Tour debut. She beat two top-50 opponents, Marketa Vondrousova and Sorana Cirstea, to reach the last 16, making her the last Briton standing in the singles draws. Raducanu was proving to be the story of the championships, the likes of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the prime minister, astronaut Tim Peake and musician Liam Gallagher among thousands tweeting their support. ""In so many ways this has been a life-changing week for her,"" former world number one Tracy Austin told BBC Sport. ""She was ranked 338 and now she's going to go into the 100s so it will make it much easier for her to play higher-level tournaments. ""She has a wonderful game as far as very athletic, a very good head on her shoulders, she seems very grounded because she has stayed in school. She has got ways to win points with weapons, she's got a terrific defence, it all looks great."" Raducanu and Tomljanovic had to wait for their meeting, the match not getting under way until 20:00 BST, owing to a five-set thriller between Alex Zverev and Felix Auger-Aliassime on Court One before them. But they were welcomed on to court to a rapturous applause, the capacity of Court One - and neighbouring Centre Court - increased to 75% on Manic Monday, so-called because every men's and women's singles fourth-round match is played. Little could separate the two once they did get going, Raducanu forced to save a break point in the second game before missing out on a break herself in the seventh as she continued to impress with her strong backhands and fine baseline strokes. Raducanu failed to convert two further break points, before world number 75 Tomljanovic, who defeated former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the previous round, capitalised on her own next break point to take the first set. It was the first set Raducanu had dropped in the tournament, but her troubles continued as she face two break points on her opening service game of the second set, saving the first with a driving backhand down the line, but she could not save the second. But the boisterous support in the Court One stands, cheering Raducanu's every point as though she had won a set, soon changed to concern as it became clear she was unwell. When it was announced she had retired, the court gave Raducanu an ovation, saddened her fairytale run had to end this way.

Deal reached to free ship that blocked Suez Canal,"The Ever Given has been anchored in the Great Bitter Lake since it was refloated Egypt will release the container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in March, after it agreed a compensation deal with the vessel's owners and insurers. The two sides said the Ever Given would be allowed on Wednesday to leave the Great Bitter Lake, the canal's midway point, where it has been impounded. The deal's terms were not revealed, but Egypt had demanded $550m (Â£397m). The 400m-long (1,312ft) Ever Given became wedged across the canal after running aground amid high winds. It was freed six days later following a salvage operation that involved a flotilla of tug boats and dredging vessels, and during which one person was killed. Global trade was disrupted as hundreds of ships had to wait to pass through the 193km (120-mile) waterway, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal UK Club, which insured the Ever Given's owner Shoei Kisen for third-party liabilities, announced on Sunday thata ""formal solution"" had been agreed with the Suez Canal Authority (SCA),externalto settle their dispute over compensation. ""Preparations for the release of the vessel will be made and an event marking the agreement will be held at the authority's headquarters in Ismailia in due course,"" it added. The SCA said the event would be held on Wednesday, and that participants would be able to watch the ship leaving the canal. 'I was blamed for blocking the Suez Canal' Suez canal blockage caused sulphur pollution spike How was the Suez Canal ship freed? Neither side disclosed the amount of compensation, but SCA chairman Osama Rabie said it would receive a tug boat as part of the deal. The SCA initially asked for $916m, including $300m for a salvage bonus and $300m for loss of reputation. But UK Club rejected the claim, describing it as ""extraordinarily large"" and ""largely unsupported"". The SCA later lowed its demand to $550m, but the owners and insurers reportedly offered to pay $150m. This satellite photograph shows how the Ever Given was wedged across the canal Mr Rabie said in May that the Ever Given had struggled to steer and ran aground despite the efforts of two escort tugs becauseit was moving at a ""very high"" speed and its rudder's size ""was not appropriate"",external. UK Club said that while the Ever Given's owners and insurers ""fully acknowledge that the SCA is entitled to compensation for their legitimate claims arising out of this incident"", they were concerned by the allegations. ""It is important to clarify that whilst the master is ultimately responsible for the vessel, navigation in the canal transit within a convoy is controlled by the Suez Canal pilots and SCA vessel traffic management services. Such controls include the speed of the transit and the availability of escort tugs."" The value of the goods inside the Ever Given's 18,000 containers has been estimated at $775m.

Wildcard Raducanu retires injured at WimbledonThe British teenager's fairytale debut at the tournament ends in the fourth round.,"Emma Raducanu called on her trainer while a set and a break down Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere British wildcard Emma Raducanu retired from her Wimbledon fourth-round match after suffering breathing difficulties as her dream debut came to a heartbreaking end. The 18-year-old was trailing 4-6 0-3 to Ajla Tomljanovic when she called on a trainer. She left the court to receive further treatment, but it was soon announced she would not be returning. Tomljanovic will face fellow Australian Ashleigh Barty in the quarter-finals. Later on Monday, Wimbledon confirmed that Raducanu retired from the match because of ""difficulty breathing"". ""I am really sorry for her, I wish we could have finished it. I am wishing her all the best,"" Tomljanovic said. Raducanu, who was ranked 338th in the world before the tournament, had lost a tight first set and it was early in the second when she started to show signs that all was not well, frequently putting a hand to her stomach and showing hints of breathlessness. When Tomljanovic went 3-0 up, Raducanu called on a trainer at the change of ends, with a second medic soon following and appearing to listen to her chest.

Edinburgh hit with half of July rain in one hour,"This video can not be played A clean up was under way on Monday after 37mm of rain fell in an hour. Edinburgh was hit with nearly half of its average July rainfall in under an hour on Sunday, as storms caused flooding across the city. Trains were stopped and homes and businesses fought to keep the water out. The newly-opened St James Quarter shopping centre was also affected. Council flood prevention teams are working with Scottish Water to find blockages and clear surface water. A yellow warning of rain and a Sepa flood alert remain in place on Monday. Edinburgh council said up to 37mm of rain had fallen - beyond the capacity of the city's drains and sewerage system. Councillor Lesley Macinnes, transport and environment convener, said: ""Our roads and flood prevention teams have worked extremely hard, throughout Sunday and overnight, to minimise the impact of this intense, sudden downpour. ""No city's drainage systems are designed to cope with the sort of short, sharp volume of water. A couple stuck at a bus stop on Edinburgh's Roseburn Terrace ""Our sympathies are with anyone who has experienced damage to their property. Officers, along with partners, are working flat-out to make sure the aftermath is cleared as quickly as possible."" Images shared on social media showed a series of flooding incidents. At a bridge in Chesser, fire crews could be seen moving vehicles stuck in the water. A couple were also pictured stuck at a bus stop on Roseburn Terrace. Sunday's stormy weather also caused a problem for shoppers in the new St James Quarter, which opened last month. Water could be seen dripping down windows and onto the balconies of several floors to ground level. Fire crews helped to move cars stuck in floodwater in Chesser Flooding also affected Inverleith A spokeswoman for St James Quarter said: ""Parts of the galleria were cordoned off for safety reasons. ""St James Quarter has been built to fully integrate with the city's streetscape and is not an enclosed building. ""Whilst it has been designed as a naturally-ventilated environment and allows some rain to come into the galleria, the extent of water ingress in two sections was mainly caused by severe rainfall testing areas which are still under construction."" Three restaurants, Five Guys, Burger King and Nando's as well as Genting Casinos and Tenpin at Fountain Park in Fountainbridge were closed on Sunday due to flooding. They remain closed. Cineworld at the other end of the complex was unaffected by the flooding. Three restaurants, Five Guys, Burger King and Nando's as well as Genting Casinos and Tenpin at Fountain Park in Fountainbridge were closed on Sunday due to flooding The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh was also closed on Monday following flooding there. On Sunday evening, ScotRail had announced that trains between Helensburgh and Edinburgh would only run as far as Bathgate for safety reasons. Buses were arranged to run from Edinburgh to Glasgow while Network Rail workers set up pumps to clear water from railway tracks Meanwhile, a search was carried out in the River Forth for two people in a kayak after the Coastguard received a 999 call from a passer-by who was concerned about them due to the poor weather conditions. The Coastguard was called just before 17:15 on Sunday and carried out an extensive search, involving its helicopter from Prestwick, rescue teams from Fisherrow, Kinghorn and South Queensferry and RNLI lifeboats from Kinghorn and South Queensferry. After nothing was found, the search was called off at about 21:00 pending further information. Flash floods hit Edinburgh streets, shops and homes.

Van sales soar amid home delivery boom,"Sales of new vans in the UK came close to record levels during the first six months of 2021 due to a boom in home deliveries and the economy reopening. But registrations of new cars remained sluggish, with a shortage of computer chips limiting supplies of some models. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which released the data, said the industry was now battling against a ""long Covid"" of supply problems. This would restrict the UK car industry's recovery, the SMMT said. Demand for electric cars, which remained relatively strong through the pandemic, has continued to rise. In June, they accounted for more than one in every 10 cars sold. Prior to the pandemic, demand for new vans was already very strong - in 2019, sales in the first six months of the year were the highest on record. Industry experts say this was largely due to the rapid growth of online shopping and home deliveries, as well as the introduction of so-called ""clean air zones"" in several cities, which prompted businesses to invest in new vehicles. Inevitably, momentum was lost during the lockdown last year, and sales fell by 20% compared with the year before. Nevertheless, the soaring popularity of home delivery services meant the vans business suffered less severely than other parts of the auto industry. Now, with the economy reopening, demand is strong once again. In the first six months of the year more than 191,500 were sold, the third highest total on record. That happened despite the continuing shortage of computer chips, or semiconductors, which affected production volumes and deliveries in June, and took some of the energy out of the market. Electric cars accounted for more than one in 10 cars sold last month Car sales, meanwhile, which remain much higher than those of commercial vehicles in terms of overall volume, have failed to recover at the same speed. Some 186,000 new cars were registered in June, on the face of it a very significant increase of 28% over the same period last year. But the comparison is artificial; last summer, showrooms were only just beginning to reopen after the first lockdown, and sales were still very low. Compared to the average over the past decade, sales were down 16.4% in June and 26.8% for the first half of the year. While there has been a surge in demand from company fleet buyers in particular, the semiconductor shortage has affected supplies, slowing the recovery. ""With the final phases of the UK's vaccine rollout well under way and confidence increasing, the automotive sector is now battling against a 'long Covid' of vehicle supply challenges,"" explained Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT. ""The semiconductor shortages arising from Covid-constrained output globally are affecting vehicle production, disrupting supply on certain models"". Vauxhall set to build electric van at Ellesmere Port Nissan announces major UK electric car expansion Car sector calls for millions more charging points Despite the disruption, sales of electric vehicles have continued to rise rapidly. In the first half the year nearly 74,000 new battery powered cars were registered - more than six times the figure from the same period in 2019. In June, more than one in every 10 cars sold was electric, and EVs had a greater share of the market than diesels. Meanwhile, the chip shortage, which has left some customers facing long waits for their new cars, has boosted the second-hand car market. In fact, prices of used cars, which usually depreciate, have been rising. ""Demand is high"", explains Jamie Hamilton, automotive director at Deloitte. ""But the limited availability of new cars means that there are even fewer used cars coming onto the market. As a result prices have shot up. ""Unfortunately, there is little respite for the industry, with the semi-conductor shortage expected to continue causing issues throughout the year, and maybe even into 2022"".

It's been a busy day with a big announcement on lockdown in England. Here's a recap of the main Covid news: Oxygen supplies have been running low in Indonesia for days We'll be wrapping up our live page coverage for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of the latest developments from around the world. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Lifting all protections at once is reckless' - Keir Starmer Labour leader Keir Starmer has responded to the PM's plan for 19 July, saying lifting all restrictions at once, while infection rates are rising, is ""reckless"". He said masks should continue to be mandatory in enclosed places and public transport, and ""common sense has to play a part here"".  The mortuary at Fiji's largest hospital is now full, the country's health ministry has announced. It comes as the country battles a second wave of Covid-19. A new daily high of 522 new infections was recorded on Sunday. The Colonial War Memorial Hospital in the only public hospital in the capital Suva. It is now being devoted to caring for Covid patients. ""Due to the mortuary now being utilised to full capacity, the concerned relatives are kindly requested to make immediate arrangements for the uplifting of the deceased from the mortuary, and the performance of final funeral rites for your loved ones,"" the ministry said in a statement. Thirty people are known to have died of the coronavirus in Fiji, which has a population of about 900,000. The requirement to wear a mask on public transport in England looks likely to end on 19 July - despite some opposition to the idea. But asked if there were circumstances in which he would continue to wear a face covering, Boris Johnson said it would ""depend on the circumstances"". ""Clearly there's a big difference between travelling on a crowded Tube train and sitting, late at night, in a virtually empty carriage on the main railway line,"" he said. And Health Secretary Sajid Javid has told the Commons it would be ""sensible"" to wear a mask on a ""very crowded"" London Underground train. Before the PM's briefing, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he wanted the public to have a clear message over using face masks on public transport. He told the BBC: âIn London, (there) are some trains that we are
responsible for, so what I wouldnât want to do is have
confusion where TfL (Transport for London) has one set of rules, and the
government has other. âThe government knows my view; I was somebody who
was advocating for wearing face masks last year in March and April. âIt was only a few months later, the government finally
listened to our requests. âI want people returning to the tubes and buses as soon as
possible, I want the West End to be busy and thriving. ""One way to do that is to give people
confidence in public transport.""  The Scottish National Party's health spokeswoman has said she is surprised that the UK government - which is in charge of England's lockdown rules - is planning to end all measures. Scotland is in charge of its own Covid rules and aims to lift all major legal lockdown restrictions by 9 August. The Scottish government has already said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after this date - something that's not happening in England. ""If the health secretary is going to just let it rip, how does he plan to avoid generating yet another UK variant with even greater vaccine resistance?"" asked the SNP's Dr Philippa Whitford on video call in the Commons earlier. Sajid Javid, the new health secretary, had just set out the plan to lift all rules on 19 July. She said Javid ""appears to be completely ignoring the risk of long Covid which is already affecting over a million people including children"", adding: ""How does he plan to avoid soaring cases of long Covid in unvaccinated young adults and children, does he consider them to be collateral damage or just a price worth paying?"" Javid accused her of ""scaremongering"" and ""political point scoring"", adding: ""If anything, the only part of the UK where cases could be described as ripping would be in Scotland, where the case rate is higher than any other part of the UK, in fact I think they have seven of the 10 highest hotspots in terms of number of cases throughout Europe."" From 19 July, theatres and sports stadiums in England will be able to be full once again, as the limits on capacity are set to be removed. The move still needs to be confirmed on 12 July, but it means there could be full stadiums for the start of the Premier League season in August. However, the PM said some venues may choose to make use of the NHS vaccine passport service should they wish - which asks attendees to prove their vaccine status. Wimbledon has already seen an increase of crowds this week, with Centre Court at 75% capacity. There will also be hope for full stadiums during England's Test series against India starting on 4 August, as well as at Glorious Goodwood at the end of July. Read more on the sport side of things here. Entertainment bosses have welcomed the news that all limits on
the numbers of people who can go to nightclubs, theatres and gig venues will be lifted
at step four of the government roadmap, which is likely to be on 19 July. Philippa Child, head of entertainment union Bectu, said the PM's
announcement was âwelcome news for theatres, venues and events that have been
forced to close for over a year"", but said the cultural sector still faces
some
""confusion"". Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music
Venue Trust, described the announcement as ""hugely important and
provides the opportunity to revive live music"". ""It does not, however, change the central mission or the
importance of the word 'safely',"" he stressed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Theatre, described the announcement as âa lifeline for our industry [and] essential for
the survival of theatres across the countryâ. There was lots of detail on what life might look like in England after 19 July in the PM's press conference - but here's some of the other main points: The prime minister has finished setting out details on the plans for easing Covid restrictions in England from 19 July. He said that date was the right time for this, because of the arrival of summer and the school holidays, which will make it more difficult for the virus to spread. This video can not be played Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent No country in the world has attempted to lift restrictions
like this in the face of rapidly rising cases driven by the new, more
infectious Delta variant. Some say it would be better to wait until autumn when all
adults will have had the chance of a second dose. That sounds good in principle, but the bulk of scientific
opinion seems to be backing a summer lifting. Unlocking was always going to drive up infections. And the problem with trying to delay that is you risk seeing
a surge in cases at a much worse time. By the autumn, schools will be back â and we can see the huge
disruption the rise in cases in recent weeks has had. People will also be outdoors more in the summer months,
which could help flatten the peak. But, perhaps most importantly, you risk running into the flu
season. That is when the NHS is under most pressure, while a Covid
infection followed by flu in quick succession puts the vulnerable even more at
risk. The move is not without risk. The government is banking on
the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme stemming these rises
soon. Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Sir Desmond Swayne, a Conservative, aims to hold ministersâ
feet to the fire on making sure restrictions are never re-imposed. He asks the Commons: âWe will never again sacrifice freedom of
association, free enterprise and, indeed, freedom of worship in order to manage
hospital admissions ever again, will we?â Sajid Javid replies: âI take it from that heâs pleased with
todayâs announcementsâ. The lifting of Covid restrictions will allow hospitality
businesses to ârebuild and recoverâ, according to an industry body. Speaking to BBC Radio 4âs PM programme, the boss of Hospitality UK Kate Nicholls
said: âThe reaction of the industry will be one primarily of relief. âTo have some certainty brought to the debate - and to have an
ability to plan in advance. ""It allows the sector to be able to look ahead
with a degree of confidence that they are turning a corner. ""Weâll be able to
move towards a more viable proposition and start to trade more freely again â¦
to be able to rebuild and recover.â Asked about the safety of customers and staff, Ms Nicholls said:
âThe bedrock of good infection control... is ventilation, hygiene and
sanitation. Those are the measures and the key signals weâll be giving.â And asked whether staff would be free to continue wearing face masks,
Ms Nicholls said: âThat will continue to be the prevailing view going forward.
This is not about discouraging anybody.â Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Meanwhile, in the Commons, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas questions the
ending of the requirement for people in England to wear masks, since itâs
against the law to endanger others by driving at 100mph down the motorway. âWhy, when other health
and safety measures arenât left to individuals to decide, he thinks thatâs an
appropriate approach to Covid?"" she says in the Commons. ""Failing to mandate mask-wearing in stuffy,
crowded places like public transport - where people are often pressed together
for longer than 15 minutes - risks high costs. ""Allowing people to choose
whether or not to put others at risk is both reckless and unfair."" Bosses at John Lewis and Waitrose confirm they will introduce flexible working for their staff at head office, despite the end of the work-from-home recommendation from 19 July. Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations for the John Lewis Partnership, says: ""If restrictions are lifted on 19 July we won't tell our head office partners where to work. ""The pandemic has forced us all to rethink the norm of five days in an office. ""We will continue to support and enable our partners as they figure out how and where they work best for the type of work they do."" Labour leader Keir Starmer has been reacting to the PM's press conference. He says today's announcement is ""all about headlines, not public health"", and the PM is acting for ""party management"" reasons and not in the public interest. ""We need a proper plan,"" he says, because ""to throw off all protections at the same time when the infection rate is going up is reckless"". Asked what he would do differently, Starmer says he would continue with mask-wearing, and focus on improving ventilation and paying people a proper amount when they need to isolate. The PM has not seen the data, he adds, and as a result of that he is ""describing what he wants to see"" and not ""what he can see"". The prime minister has just finished his press conference, where he gave further details of plans for the final step of Englandâs roadmap out of lockdown. This is due to take place on 19 July - although this will only be confirmed on 12 July. From step four: Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Some big questions remained unaswered today Parents in England whose kids are at home because someone in their class tested positive want to know when regular testing might replace isolation, but we have to await an update from the edication secretary tomorrow We don't yet know if double-vaccinated people will be released from an obligation to self-isolate if they were in contact with an infected person so long as they take daily tests. And an update  on travel won't come until later on the week - while many have put holidays abroad on hold. But above all else, there was no clear answer on how many lives are at risk from a mix of fewer restrictions and rising cases - and what level of mortality is acceptable. No10 has said there will be fresh modelling/data before a final decision to lift restrictions is taken next week, but it seems unlikely that the PM will backtrack now.   Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether the prime minister is worried about the Euro 2020 football matches triggering ""superspreader"" events. Boris Johnson says his advice is to support England ""enthusiastically but in a responsible way"". He adds that there are testing requirements for matches at Wembley. Sir Patrick Vallance says most spreading happens indoors in crowded spaces, which is also where most superspreading events have occurred. Ross asks the advisers how many excess deaths these relaxations are likely to cause. Vallance says the models done at the start of the roadmap are available, with more modelling due next week which will be made public. He says the modelling has been very accurate in terms of timings.

Afro swim cap Olympic ban review after backlash,"Alice Dearing, pictured wearing a Soul Cap, will be the first black woman to represent Great Britain in an Olympic swimming event at Tokyo 2020 A decision not to allow swimming caps designed for afro hair at international competitions - such as Tokyo 2020 - could be reconsidered, after backlash. Soul Cap said Fina, the water sports world governing body,had told them the hats aren't suitable because they don't follow ""the natural form of the head"". The comments sparked criticism from many swimmers with some saying it would discourage black people from the sport. Fina now says it's ""reviewing the situation"" regarding the products. In a statement, it said it understood ""the importance of inclusivity and representation"". ""Fina is committed to ensuring that all aquatics athletes have access to appropriate swimwear for competition where this swimwear does not confer a competitive advantage,"" it added. It said it would speak to Soul Cap about using the hats at Fina's development centres, which train swimmers around the world. Why some 'black girls don't swim' Afro swim cap Olympic rejection is 'heartbreaking' Soul Cap makes caps to fit over and protect dreadlocks, afros, weaves, braids, and thick and curly hair. Afro hair is naturally drier than other hair because it has fewer cell layers. The sodium hypochlorite - or bleach - found in swimming pools can dry it out more, leading to damage. Young black swimmers told Radio 1 Newsbeat they were ""disappointed and heartbroken"" by Fina's words last week. Kejai Terrelonge, 17, said hair-care is one of many barriers she's faced as a black swimmer. ""Using the smaller swimming caps that everyone else would use - it would fit on my head but because I put [protective] oil in my hair, when I was swimming it would just keep sliding off and my hair would get wet,"" said Kejai, who lives in Birmingham. Swim England released astatement,externalto ""reassure"" people that Soul Caps are allowed at domestic competitions in England. It said it would raise its ""concerns"" about Fina's rejection ""through the appropriate channels"". ""Swimming hats designed for afro hair can reduce barriers to the sport for under-represented groups, including black people,"" it added. White British children are over-represented in swimming relative to their population share, according to a report by Sport England from January 2020. Around 29.3% of white British children take part in swimming, compared with 21.9% Asian children and 20.1% of black children. This video can not be played Things youâll know if youâre a black swimmer The founders of Soul Cap, Michael Chapman and Toks Ahmed-Salawudeen, said they were grateful for the support they'd had after Fina's rejection of their application to approve their hats for international competitions. They said they grew up without learning to swim because ""we didn't think it was a sport for us, it wasn't a thing amongst our friends and it wasn't encouraged by our school or parents"".

In 2017, they decided to take lessons together - where they met a black woman with afro hair who was struggling with the size of her swim cap. ""After speaking with our mums, sisters, friends and realising the lack of suitable swimwear for swimmers with afro hair, braids, locs or any type of voluminous hair - we decided to create our own,"" they said. Jamaican international swimmer Michael Gunning has also criticised Fina's wording.

Here's a round-up of the latest developments from around the world. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Lifting all protections at once is reckless' - Keir Starmer Labour leader Keir Starmer has responded to the PM's plan for 19 July, saying lifting all restrictions at once, while infection rates are rising, is ""reckless"". He said masks should continue to be mandatory in enclosed places and public transport, and ""common sense has to play a part here"".  The mortuary at Fiji's largest hospital is now full, the country's health ministry has announced. It comes as the country battles a second wave of Covid-19. A new daily high of 522 new infections was recorded on Sunday. The Colonial War Memorial Hospital in the only public hospital in the capital Suva. It is now being devoted to caring for Covid patients. ""Due to the mortuary now being utilised to full capacity, the concerned relatives are kindly requested to make immediate arrangements for the uplifting of the deceased from the mortuary, and the performance of final funeral rites for your loved ones,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Ex-Hollyoaks star in hospital with 'horrific' Covid,"The actress, who also appeared on Celebrity Big Brother, said she's ""sick of being in pain"" Former Hollyoaks actress Stephanie Davis has spent the weekend in hospital with a ""horrific"" bout of Covid. The 28-year-old was admitted early on Friday and has shared a series of videos from her hospital bed, where she has been on painkillers and with an oxygen mask and intravenous drip. Early on Monday, she said she was ""all right"" but sick of ""being in pain now"". Her representatives said she had not been vaccinated because of her allergies and the risk of anaphylaxis. She is also at high risk because of her underlying asthma, her spokeswoman said. Davis played a character called Sinead O'Connor in the Channel 4 soap from 2010 to 2019, and is also known for appearing on the BBC talent search Over the Rainbow, as well as finishing as runner-up in the 17th series of Celebrity Big Brother. In an Instagram video posted from hospital on Friday, she said: ""Last night I got a bit of a headache before bed and my sinuses - I woke up so ill and I had to call an ambulance basically. ""I've tested positive for Covid. I feel like I've been run over. The worst part is that my skin - my front and back and my skin - I can't touch my skin and it's killing me. ""I'm in so much pain. Oh my God, this is horrible. It happens so quick. I basically woke up and I couldn't move."" She updated fans in the early hours of Monday, saying: ""I think I'm anxious as well because I'm getting the camera put down today, hopefully that'll see what's causing me all the pain. ""I'm going to come off this [social media] now and I just want to get myself better. My messages have been crazy so thanks very much for that. ""I'm all right, I'm just in pain,"" she added. ""I'm just sick of being in pain now."" She signed off by telling her followers: ""Please stay safe, wear your masks, wash your hands. This is absolutely horrific.""

End of masks negligent - union,"Public transport and shop workers will face more risk of infection if mask rules are dropped, unions have said. Boris Johnson is expected to confirm later that the majority of Covid restrictions in England will be lifted from 19 July. These could include making face mask wearing voluntary and the end of 1m-plus social distancing. But dropping mask-wearing on public transport would be ""gross negligence"", the Unite union said. A Unite spokesman, pointing to official figures, said there had been a high level of Covid deaths among bus drivers even with mandatory face mask wearing. Boris Johnson to set out England's final Covid lockdown easing Covid-19: Masks will become personal choice, says Robert Jenrick ""To end the requirement to wear masks on public transport would be an act of gross negligence by the government,"" said Unite national officer for passenger transport Bobby Morton. ""Rates of infection are continuing to increase and not only does mask wearing reduce transmissions, it helps provide reassurance to drivers and to passengers who are nervous about using public transport. ""The idea of personal responsibility and hoping that people will wear masks is absolutely ridiculous, members are already reporting there is an increase in passengers ignoring the rules on mask wearing."" But industry body the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said that travelling by train was ""low risk"" and ""any decision to leave public transport behind other parts of the economy would need to be based on the science"". It said trains are ""well ventilated with air regularly refreshed either by air conditioning systems, or by doors and windows being opened"". ""Given that wearing a mask helps protect others, we would also support people who wished to continue wearing one in future if it becomes voluntary,"" the industry body added. Care minister Helen Whately told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she may continue to wear a mask when commuting by train from her constituency in Kent to London. ""I think it's the sort of environment where, if something's crowded, I think I might,"" she said. However, she added: ""I know personally, and I know others, aren't comfortable wearing masks all the time. ""As I've said, there are downsides to masks as there are downsides to many of the restrictions."" Ryanair said that face-masks would remain mandatory on its flights ""to protect the health of our passengers and crew"". There is expected to be a rise in coronavirus infections when restrictions are eased, but the government hopes that vaccinations will limit hospitalisations and deaths. The lifting of Covid restrictions was originally planned to be on 21 June, but this was pushed back to 19 July after a rise in infections driven by the Delta variant. Restrictions that are currently in placein England include the ""rule of six"" for gatherings, pubs and restaurants having to have table service, limits on how many people can be in theatres and cinemas, and nightclubs being closed. Facemasks also need to be worn in shops. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus rules, and the Scottish government has said it could keep some basic measures, including wearing masks, at its next review in August. The Usdaw union said face masks should continue to be mandatory for shoppers after 19 July to protect shop workers. ""Retail staff are working with the public every day and are deeply worried about catching Covid-19,"" said Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary. ""This is not the right time to water down safety in stores and the government should not be removing the requirements of face coverings and distancing in busy public areas like shops. ""To speak about the wearing of face coverings in these settings in terms of personal responsibility ignores the reality that public-facing workers have no option but to interact with large numbers of people as a part of their job,"" he said. The union urged shoppers to keep wearing face masks, and to carry on washing hands and social distancing ""to help make shops safer and limit the spread of Covid-19"". Mr Lillis added that many retail workers had continued to work through the pandemic ""to keep the country supplied with essentials"". ""These key workers must be valued, respected and protected,"" he added. Dan Shears, health and safety director at the GMB union, said: ""If compulsory masks are going to go then it is up to employers to control the Covid infection risk, primarily through ventilation, to keep workers and the general public safe."" The assistant general secretary of the Unison union,  Jon Richards, said: ""Now isn't the time to throw caution to the wind, especially with infections on the rise. The economy is important, but so is public confidence. ""People want clarity from the government as restrictions are eased. They don't need a confusing free-for-all, with ministers absolving themselves of any responsibility for public health. ""Face coverings and well-ventilated workspaces provide a level of reassurance and security to staff who deal with the public. Safety laws also require their employers to keep these workers safe.""

LiveLiveJohnson to give update on end of Covid restrictions2 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson sets out details of the final step of England's roadmap out of lockdown He outlines a five point plan for ""living with Covid"" - but stresses a final decision on easing restrictions on 19 July will come next week The PM says the pandemic is far from over and we must reconcile ourselves to more deaths and take a careful and balanced decision The government will drop legal restrictions to allow people to make ""informed decisions"" on managing the virus, he says ""If we can't reopen our society in the next few weeks... we must ask ourselves 'when will we be able to reopen?',"" the PM says There are shouts of âhallelujahâ in the Commons as Health Secretary Sajid Javid tells MPs social distancing rules in England will go Labourâs shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the strategy will expose many thousands of people to Covid The Duchess of Cambridge is self-isolating after coming into contact with someone who later tested positive Edited by Martha Buckley That's all from your live page team today - the updates have been brought to you by Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett, George Wright, James Clarke, Jenny Matthews, Katie Wright, Martha Buckley, Sinead Wilson and Sophie Williams. It's been a busy day with a big announcement on lockdown in England. Here's a recap of the main Covid news: Oxygen supplies have been running low in Indonesia for days We'll be wrapping up our live page coverage for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of the latest developments from around the world. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Lifting all protections at once is reckless' - Keir Starmer Labour leader Keir Starmer has responded to the PM's plan for 19 July, saying lifting all restrictions at once, while infection rates are rising, is ""reckless"". He said masks should continue to be mandatory in enclosed places and public transport, and ""common sense has to play a part here"".  The mortuary at Fiji's largest hospital is now full, the country's health ministry has announced. It comes as the country battles a second wave of Covid-19. A new daily high of 522 new infections was recorded on Sunday. The Colonial War Memorial Hospital in the only public hospital in the capital Suva. It is now being devoted to caring for Covid patients. ""Due to the mortuary now being utilised to full capacity, the concerned relatives are kindly requested to make immediate arrangements for the uplifting of the deceased from the mortuary, and the performance of final funeral rites for your loved ones,"" the ministry said in a statement. Thirty people are known to have died of the coronavirus in Fiji, which has a population of about 900,000. The requirement to wear a mask on public transport in England looks likely to end on 19 July - despite some opposition to the idea. But asked if there were circumstances in which he would continue to wear a face covering, Boris Johnson said it would ""depend on the circumstances"". ""Clearly there's a big difference between travelling on a crowded Tube train and sitting, late at night, in a virtually empty carriage on the main railway line,"" he said. And Health Secretary Sajid Javid has told the Commons it would be ""sensible"" to wear a mask on a ""very crowded"" London Underground train. Before the PM's briefing, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he wanted the public to have a clear message over using face masks on public transport. He told the BBC: âIn London, (there) are some trains that we are
responsible for, so what I wouldnât want to do is have
confusion where TfL (Transport for London) has one set of rules, and the
government has other. âThe government knows my view; I was somebody who
was advocating for wearing face masks last year in March and April. âIt was only a few months later, the government finally
listened to our requests. âI want people returning to the tubes and buses as soon as
possible, I want the West End to be busy and thriving. ""One way to do that is to give people
confidence in public transport.""  The Scottish National Party's health spokeswoman has said she is surprised that the UK government - which is in charge of England's lockdown rules - is planning to end all measures. Scotland is in charge of its own Covid rules and aims to lift all major legal lockdown restrictions by 9 August. The Scottish government has already said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after this date - something that's not happening in England. ""If the health secretary is going to just let it rip, how does he plan to avoid generating yet another UK variant with even greater vaccine resistance?"" asked the SNP's Dr Philippa Whitford on video call in the Commons earlier. Sajid Javid, the new health secretary, had just set out the plan to lift all rules on 19 July. She said Javid ""appears to be completely ignoring the risk of long Covid which is already affecting over a million people including children"", adding: ""How does he plan to avoid soaring cases of long Covid in unvaccinated young adults and children, does he consider them to be collateral damage or just a price worth paying?"" Javid accused her of ""scaremongering"" and ""political point scoring"", adding: ""If anything, the only part of the UK where cases could be described as ripping would be in Scotland, where the case rate is higher than any other part of the UK, in fact I think they have seven of the 10 highest hotspots in terms of number of cases throughout Europe."" From 19 July, theatres and sports stadiums in England will be able to be full once again, as the limits on capacity are set to be removed. The move still needs to be confirmed on 12 July, but it means there could be full stadiums for the start of the Premier League season in August. However, the PM said some venues may choose to make use of the NHS vaccine passport service should they wish - which asks attendees to prove their vaccine status. Wimbledon has already seen an increase of crowds this week, with Centre Court at 75% capacity. There will also be hope for full stadiums during England's Test series against India starting on 4 August, as well as at Glorious Goodwood at the end of July. Read more on the sport side of things here. Entertainment bosses have welcomed the news that all limits on
the numbers of people who can go to nightclubs, theatres and gig venues will be lifted
at step four of the government roadmap, which is likely to be on 19 July. Philippa Child, head of entertainment union Bectu, said the PM's
announcement was âwelcome news for theatres, venues and events that have been
forced to close for over a year"", but said the cultural sector still faces
some
""confusion"". Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music
Venue Trust, described the announcement as ""hugely important and
provides the opportunity to revive live music"". ""It does not, however, change the central mission or the
importance of the word 'safely',"" he stressed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Kill, who is in charge of the Night Time Industries Association, said: ""To
hear the Prime Minister say that we need to learn to live with this virus is a
long overdue step, and will be a relief to our sector."" And Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London
Theatre, described the announcement as âa lifeline for our industry [and] essential for
the survival of theatres across the countryâ. There was lots of detail on what life might look like in England after 19 July in the PM's press conference - but here's some of the other main points: The prime minister has finished setting out details on the plans for easing Covid restrictions in England from 19 July. He said that date was the right time for this, because of the arrival of summer and the school holidays, which will make it more difficult for the virus to spread. This video can not be played Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent No country in the world has attempted to lift restrictions
like this in the face of rapidly rising cases driven by the new, more
infectious Delta variant. Some say it would be better to wait until autumn when all
adults will have had the chance of a second dose. That sounds good in principle, but the bulk of scientific
opinion seems to be backing a summer lifting. Unlocking was always going to drive up infections. And the problem with trying to delay that is you risk seeing
a surge in cases at a much worse time. By the autumn, schools will be back â and we can see the huge
disruption the rise in cases in recent weeks has had. People will also be outdoors more in the summer months,
which could help flatten the peak. But, perhaps most importantly, you risk running into the flu
season. That is when the NHS is under most pressure, while a Covid
infection followed by flu in quick succession puts the vulnerable even more at
risk. The move is not without risk. The government is banking on
the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme stemming these rises
soon. Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Sir Desmond Swayne, a Conservative, aims to hold ministersâ
feet to the fire on making sure restrictions are never re-imposed. He asks the Commons: âWe will never again sacrifice freedom of
association, free enterprise and, indeed, freedom of worship in order to manage
hospital admissions ever again, will we?â Sajid Javid replies: âI take it from that heâs pleased with
todayâs announcementsâ. The lifting of Covid restrictions will allow hospitality
businesses to ârebuild and recoverâ, according to an industry body. Speaking to BBC Radio 4âs PM programme, the boss of Hospitality UK Kate Nicholls
said: âThe reaction of the industry will be one primarily of relief. âTo have some certainty brought to the debate - and to have an
ability to plan in advance. ""It allows the sector to be able to look ahead
with a degree of confidence that they are turning a corner. ""Weâll be able to
move towards a more viable proposition and start to trade more freely again â¦
to be able to rebuild and recover.â Asked about the safety of customers and staff, Ms Nicholls said:
âThe bedrock of good infection control... is ventilation, hygiene and
sanitation. Those are the measures and the key signals weâll be giving.â And asked whether staff would be free to continue wearing face masks,
Ms Nicholls said: âThat will continue to be the prevailing view going forward.
This is not about discouraging anybody.â Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Meanwhile, in the Commons, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas questions the
ending of the requirement for people in England to wear masks, since itâs
against the law to endanger others by driving at 100mph down the motorway. âWhy, when other health
and safety measures arenât left to individuals to decide, he thinks thatâs an
appropriate approach to Covid?"" she says in the Commons. ""Failing to mandate mask-wearing in stuffy,
crowded places like public transport - where people are often pressed together
for longer than 15 minutes - risks high costs. ""Allowing people to choose
whether or not to put others at risk is both reckless and unfair."" Bosses at John Lewis and Waitrose confirm they will introduce flexible working for their staff at head office, despite the end of the work-from-home recommendation from 19 July. Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations for the John Lewis Partnership, says: ""If restrictions are lifted on 19 July we won't tell our head office partners where to work. ""The pandemic has forced us all to rethink the norm of five days in an office. ""We will continue to support and enable our partners as they figure out how and where they work best for the type of work they do."" Labour leader Keir Starmer has been reacting to the PM's press conference. He says today's announcement is ""all about headlines, not public health"", and the PM is acting for ""party management"" reasons and not in the public interest. ""We need a proper plan,"" he says, because ""to throw off all protections at the same time when the infection rate is going up is reckless"". Asked what he would do differently, Starmer says he would continue with mask-wearing, and focus on improving ventilation and paying people a proper amount when they need to isolate. The PM has not seen the data, he adds, and as a result of that he is ""describing what he wants to see"" and not ""what he can see"". The prime minister has just finished his press conference, where he gave further details of plans for the final step of Englandâs roadmap out of lockdown. This is due to take place on 19 July - although this will only be confirmed on 12 July. From step four: Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Some big questions remained unaswered today Parents in England whose kids are at home because someone in their class tested positive want to know when regular testing might replace isolation, but we have to await an update from the edication secretary tomorrow We don't yet know if double-vaccinated people will be released from an obligation to self-isolate if they were in contact with an infected person so long as they take daily tests. And an update  on travel won't come until later on the week - while many have put holidays abroad on hold. But above all else, there was no clear answer on how many lives are at risk from a mix of fewer restrictions and rising cases - and what level of mortality is acceptable. No10 has said there will be fresh modelling/data before a final decision to lift restrictions is taken next week, but it seems unlikely that the PM will backtrack now.   Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether the prime minister is worried about the Euro 2020 football matches triggering ""superspreader"" events. Boris Johnson says his advice is to support England ""enthusiastically but in a responsible way"". He adds that there are testing requirements for matches at Wembley. Sir Patrick Vallance says most spreading happens indoors in crowded spaces, which is also where most superspreading events have occurred. Ross asks the advisers how many excess deaths these relaxations are likely to cause. Vallance says the models done at the start of the roadmap are available, with more modelling due next week which will be made public. He says the modelling has been very accurate in terms of timings.

Mask law and one metre rule set to end in EnglandBoris Johnson is ready to announce most remaining Covid restrictions can be eased from 19 July.,"Boris Johnson is expected to confirm he is confident the majority of the remaining Covid restrictions in England can be lifted from 19 July. Making face masks voluntary and ending 1m-plus social distancing and QR code sign-ins at restaurants will be among his press conference announcements. The PM said people must ""learn to live"" with Covid and ""exercise judgement"". Infections are expected to rise when rules are eased but ministers believe deaths will be limited by vaccinations. A further 27,334 cases were reported across the UK on Monday, alongside another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The fourth and final stage of the government's roadmap out of lockdown in England was delayed last month to no earlier than 19 July. Among thecurrent measuresare the ""rule of six"" for gatherings, table service in pubs and restaurants, capacity limits in theatres and cinemas, the closure of nightclubs, and working from home guidance. However, while many of the remaining rules and guidance looks set to be swept away, the prime minister is not expected to address self isolation, travel restrictions or therules in schools. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules, and the Scottish government has suggested it mayretain some basic measures, including wearing masks, at its next review in August. Live coverage: Doubts over masks ahead of lockdown update What is Boris Johnson expected to say about 19 July? Dropping face mask rules negligent, says union Will we still have to socially distance this summer? The chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said it ""makes no sense"" to stop wearing face masks in enclosed public settings amid a rising number of cases of the Delta variant. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""face masks are proven to reduce spread of this infection"" and ""we can't understand why we would knowingly want people to become infected"". Unions representing public transport and shop workerssaid their staff would face even more risk of infection if face mask rules are dropped. Meanwhile, Ryanair said face masks would remain mandatory on its flight ""in order to protect the health of our passengers and crew"". In comments released by Downing Street before the prime minister gives his update at a 17:00 BST news conference, Mr Johnson said he ""must stress that the pandemic is not over and that cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks"". But praising the successful vaccine rollout, he said he would ""set out how we can restore people's freedoms"", adding: ""As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgement when going about our lives."" Downing Street said step four of the easing would go ahead in two weeks' time only if the government's ""four tests"" for easing curbs had been met. The verdict on those tests - on the jab rollout, vaccine effectiveness, hospital admissions, and new virus variants - would only be confirmed on 12 July following a review of the latest data. The findings of reviews on the use of Covid certification - or vaccine passports - andon social-distancing measuresare also due to be announced by Mr Johnson. It is understood the restriction banning pub-goers from ordering a drink directly at the bar will be dropped. But Downing Street stressed rules against travel to high-risk countries, the requirement to isolate if people test positive, as well as surge and community Covid testing programmes would continue after 19 July. Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update the Commons on the changes at the same time Mr Johnson holds his briefing at Downing Street alongside England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Behavioural psychologist Prof Stephen Reicher, one of the scientists advising the government, expressed concern about the face mask plans. He told Today: ""We need very clear messaging and in certain spaces - crowded, badly ventilated spaces - masks are crucial mitigation,"" adding ministers needed to provide ""support and proportionate mitigations to keep us safe. Along with the vaccine, that's the way out"". How can I visit my relative in a care home? Laura Kuenssberg: How much will life change on 19 July? Paul Nowak, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ""vital"" people would be returning to Covid-secure work sites. ""I just don't think it is acceptable for the government to simply outsource its responsibilities to individuals and to individual employers,"" he said. This video can not be played Some may choose to be cautious after 19 July, says NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen Powis Meanwhile, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to confirm ""what level of mortality and cases of long Covid"" it considers acceptable. ""Letting cases rise with no action means further pressure on the NHS, more sickness, disruption to education - and risks a new variant emerging with a selection advantage,"" he warned. Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director for NHS England, said infections were currently rising but hospital rates were not increasing at the same rate as previous peaks and ""things are looking very good"". He told BBC Breakfast the NHS was ""well used to coping with pressures, we do it every year and every winter. So we are prepared."" From the start of the pandemic, the single most important measure for controlling Covid was getting people to isolate when they had symptoms. It's why so many have urged the government to do more to support people financially when they do so. Everything else from mask-wearing and social distancing to contract tracing was about marginal gains on top. As we learnt more about the ability of the virus to spread before symptoms developed or among those who were asymptomatic those marginal gains became more important. But alongside isolating when ill, the new tool in the fight against Covid is, of course, vaccination. Not only do the vaccines protect you, they protect others by curbing spread by cutting your chances of being infected in the first place and your risk of passing on the virus if you do become infected. With high vaccination uptake, all those other measures are much less important than they once were. That's why ministers feel they can ditch many of them - and in doing so become arguably the first nation to relax restrictions on this scale with infections rising and attempt to learn to live with Covid. The review of social-distancing measures has been of particular interest to the hospitality industry, which says many venues are unable to operate profitably under restrictions on capacity and table service rules. The findings of a review into Covid certification are also expected. The use of certificates to prove a person's Covid vaccination or test status has been welcomed by some travel industry bosses and leading sports bodies - but the concept has raised concerns over discrimination and privacy. Separately, the PM will give further details on the future of care home visits. At the moment, care home residents in England can choose up to five people who can visit regularly, but no more than two people should visit at one time or in one day. Care minister Helen Whately says visits are unlikely to ""completely go back to normal"" as there was a need for some precautions for residents - and face coverings were expected to remain a requirement. Around 64% of the UK adult population has now received a second vaccine dose, with just over 86% having now received at least a first dose. No 10 has said the government is ensuring preparations are in place to offer third ""booster"" doses to everyone aged over 50 and the most vulnerable over the winter months.

But praising the successful vaccine rollout, he said he would ""set out how we can restore people's freedoms"", adding: ""As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgement when going about our lives."" Downing Street said step four of the easing would go ahead in two weeks' time only if the government's ""four tests"" for easing curbs had been met. The verdict on those tests - on the jab rollout, vaccine effectiveness, hospital admissions, and new virus variants - would only be confirmed on 12 July following a review of the latest data. The findings of reviews on the use of Covid certification - or vaccine passports - andon social-distancing measuresare also due to be announced by Mr Johnson. It is understood the restriction banning pub-goers from ordering a drink directly at the bar will be dropped. But Downing Street stressed rules against travel to high-risk countries, the requirement to isolate if people test positive, as well as surge and community Covid testing programmes would continue after 19 July. Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update the Commons on the changes at the same time Mr Johnson holds his briefing at Downing Street alongside England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Behavioural psychologist Prof Stephen Reicher, one of the scientists advising the government, expressed concern about the face mask plans. He told Today: ""We need very clear messaging and in certain spaces - crowded, badly ventilated spaces - masks are crucial mitigation,"" adding ministers needed to provide ""support and proportionate mitigations to keep us safe. Along with the vaccine, that's the way out"". How can I visit my relative in a care home? Laura Kuenssberg: How much will life change on 19 July? Paul Nowak, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ""vital"" people would be returning to Covid-secure work sites. ""I just don't think it is acceptable for the government to simply outsource its responsibilities to individuals and to individual employers,"" he said. This video can not be played Some may choose to be cautious after 19 July, says NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen Powis Meanwhile, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to confirm ""what level of mortality and cases of long Covid"" it considers acceptable. ""Letting cases rise with no action means further pressure on the NHS, more sickness, disruption to education - and risks a new variant emerging with a selection advantage,"" he warned. Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director for NHS England, said infections were currently rising but hospital rates were not increasing at the same rate as previous peaks and ""things are looking very good"". He told BBC Breakfast the NHS was ""well used to coping with pressures, we do it every year and every winter. So we are prepared."" From the start of the pandemic, the single most important measure for controlling Covid was getting people to isolate when they had symptoms. It's why so many have urged the government to do more to support people financially when they do so. Everything else from mask-wearing and social distancing to contract tracing was about marginal gains on top. As we learnt more about the ability of the virus to spread before symptoms developed or among those who were asymptomatic those marginal gains became more important. But alongside isolating when ill, the new tool in the fight against Covid is, of course, vaccination. Not only do the vaccines protect you, they protect others by curbing spread by cutting your chances of being infected in the first place and your risk of passing on the virus if you do become infected. With high vaccination uptake, all those other measures are much less important than they once were. That's why ministers feel they can ditch many of them - and in doing so become arguably the first nation to relax restrictions on this scale with infections rising and attempt to learn to live with Covid. The review of social-distancing measures has been of particular interest to the hospitality industry, which says many venues are unable to operate profitably under restrictions on capacity and table service rules. The findings of a review into Covid certification are also expected. The use of certificates to prove a person's Covid vaccination or test status has been welcomed by some travel industry bosses and leading sports bodies - but the concept has raised concerns over discrimination and privacy. Separately, the PM will give further details on the future of care home visits. At the moment, care home residents in England can choose up to five people who can visit regularly, but no more than two people should visit at one time or in one day. Care minister Helen Whately says visits are unlikely to ""completely go back to normal"" as there was a need for some precautions for residents - and face coverings were expected to remain a requirement. Around 64% of the UK adult population has now received a second vaccine dose, with just over 86% having now received at least a first dose. No 10 has said the government is ensuring preparations are in place to offer third ""booster"" doses to everyone aged over 50 and the most vulnerable over the winter months.

"LiveLiveStaff worried about mask rules easing, say unions3 minutes ago","Boris Johnson sets out details of the final step of England's roadmap out of lockdown He outlines a five point plan for ""living with Covid"" - but stresses a final decision on easing restrictions on 19 July will come next week The PM says the pandemic is far from over and we must reconcile ourselves to more deaths and take a careful and balanced decision The government will drop legal restrictions to allow people to make ""informed decisions"" on managing the virus, he says ""If we can't reopen our society in the next few weeks... we must ask ourselves 'when will we be able to reopen?',"" the PM says There are shouts of âhallelujahâ in the Commons as Health Secretary Sajid Javid tells MPs social distancing rules in England will go Labourâs shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the strategy will expose many thousands of people to Covid The Duchess of Cambridge is self-isolating after coming into contact with someone who later tested positive Edited by Martha Buckley That's all from your live page team today - the updates have been brought to you by Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett, George Wright, James Clarke, Jenny Matthews, Katie Wright, Martha Buckley, Sinead Wilson and Sophie Williams. It's been a busy day with a big announcement on lockdown in England. Here's a recap of the main Covid news: Oxygen supplies have been running low in Indonesia for days We'll be wrapping up our live page coverage for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of the latest developments from around the world. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Lifting all protections at once is reckless' - Keir Starmer Labour leader Keir Starmer has responded to the PM's plan for 19 July, saying lifting all restrictions at once, while infection rates are rising, is ""reckless"". He said masks should continue to be mandatory in enclosed places and public transport, and ""common sense has to play a part here"".  The mortuary at Fiji's largest hospital is now full, the country's health ministry has announced. It comes as the country battles a second wave of Covid-19. A new daily high of 522 new infections was recorded on Sunday. The Colonial War Memorial Hospital in the only public hospital in the capital Suva. It is now being devoted to caring for Covid patients. ""Due to the mortuary now being utilised to full capacity, the concerned relatives are kindly requested to make immediate arrangements for the uplifting of the deceased from the mortuary, and the performance of final funeral rites for your loved ones,"" the ministry said in a statement. Thirty people are known to have died of the coronavirus in Fiji, which has a population of about 900,000. The requirement to wear a mask on public transport in England looks likely to end on 19 July - despite some opposition to the idea. But asked if there were circumstances in which he would continue to wear a face covering, Boris Johnson said it would ""depend on the circumstances"". ""Clearly there's a big difference between travelling on a crowded Tube train and sitting, late at night, in a virtually empty carriage on the main railway line,"" he said. And Health Secretary Sajid Javid has told the Commons it would be ""sensible"" to wear a mask on a ""very crowded"" London Underground train. Before the PM's briefing, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he wanted the public to have a clear message over using face masks on public transport. He told the BBC: âIn London, (there) are some trains that we are
responsible for, so what I wouldnât want to do is have
confusion where TfL (Transport for London) has one set of rules, and the
government has other. âThe government knows my view; I was somebody who
was advocating for wearing face masks last year in March and April. âIt was only a few months later, the government finally
listened to our requests. âI want people returning to the tubes and buses as soon as
possible, I want the West End to be busy and thriving. ""One way to do that is to give people
confidence in public transport.""  The Scottish National Party's health spokeswoman has said she is surprised that the UK government - which is in charge of England's lockdown rules - is planning to end all measures. Scotland is in charge of its own Covid rules and aims to lift all major legal lockdown restrictions by 9 August. The Scottish government has already said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after this date - something that's not happening in England. ""If the health secretary is going to just let it rip, how does he plan to avoid generating yet another UK variant with even greater vaccine resistance?"" asked the SNP's Dr Philippa Whitford on video call in the Commons earlier. Sajid Javid, the new health secretary, had just set out the plan to lift all rules on 19 July. She said Javid ""appears to be completely ignoring the risk of long Covid which is already affecting over a million people including children"", adding: ""How does he plan to avoid soaring cases of long Covid in unvaccinated young adults and children, does he consider them to be collateral damage or just a price worth paying?"" Javid accused her of ""scaremongering"" and ""political point scoring"", adding: ""If anything, the only part of the UK where cases could be described as ripping would be in Scotland, where the case rate is higher than any other part of the UK, in fact I think they have seven of the 10 highest hotspots in terms of number of cases throughout Europe."" From 19 July, theatres and sports stadiums in England will be able to be full once again, as the limits on capacity are set to be removed. The move still needs to be confirmed on 12 July, but it means there could be full stadiums for the start of the Premier League season in August. However, the PM said some venues may choose to make use of the NHS vaccine passport service should they wish - which asks attendees to prove their vaccine status. Wimbledon has already seen an increase of crowds this week, with Centre Court at 75% capacity. There will also be hope for full stadiums during England's Test series against India starting on 4 August, as well as at Glorious Goodwood at the end of July. Read more on the sport side of things here. Entertainment bosses have welcomed the news that all limits on
the numbers of people who can go to nightclubs, theatres and gig venues will be lifted
at step four of the government roadmap, which is likely to be on 19 July. Philippa Child, head of entertainment union Bectu, said the PM's
announcement was âwelcome news for theatres, venues and events that have been
forced to close for over a year"", but said the cultural sector still faces
some
""confusion"". Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music
Venue Trust, described the announcement as ""hugely important and
provides the opportunity to revive live music"". ""It does not, however, change the central mission or the
importance of the word 'safely',"" he stressed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

hear the Prime Minister say that we need to learn to live with this virus is a
long overdue step, and will be a relief to our sector."" And Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London
Theatre, described the announcement as âa lifeline for our industry [and] essential for
the survival of theatres across the countryâ. There was lots of detail on what life might look like in England after 19 July in the PM's press conference - but here's some of the other main points: The prime minister has finished setting out details on the plans for easing Covid restrictions in England from 19 July. He said that date was the right time for this, because of the arrival of summer and the school holidays, which will make it more difficult for the virus to spread. This video can not be played Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent No country in the world has attempted to lift restrictions
like this in the face of rapidly rising cases driven by the new, more
infectious Delta variant. Some say it would be better to wait until autumn when all
adults will have had the chance of a second dose. That sounds good in principle, but the bulk of scientific
opinion seems to be backing a summer lifting. Unlocking was always going to drive up infections. And the problem with trying to delay that is you risk seeing
a surge in cases at a much worse time. By the autumn, schools will be back â and we can see the huge
disruption the rise in cases in recent weeks has had. People will also be outdoors more in the summer months,
which could help flatten the peak. But, perhaps most importantly, you risk running into the flu
season. That is when the NHS is under most pressure, while a Covid
infection followed by flu in quick succession puts the vulnerable even more at
risk. The move is not without risk. The government is banking on
the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme stemming these rises
soon. Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Sir Desmond Swayne, a Conservative, aims to hold ministersâ
feet to the fire on making sure restrictions are never re-imposed. He asks the Commons: âWe will never again sacrifice freedom of
association, free enterprise and, indeed, freedom of worship in order to manage
hospital admissions ever again, will we?â Sajid Javid replies: âI take it from that heâs pleased with
todayâs announcementsâ. The lifting of Covid restrictions will allow hospitality
businesses to ârebuild and recoverâ, according to an industry body. Speaking to BBC Radio 4âs PM programme, the boss of Hospitality UK Kate Nicholls
said: âThe reaction of the industry will be one primarily of relief. âTo have some certainty brought to the debate - and to have an
ability to plan in advance. ""It allows the sector to be able to look ahead
with a degree of confidence that they are turning a corner. ""Weâll be able to
move towards a more viable proposition and start to trade more freely again â¦
to be able to rebuild and recover.â Asked about the safety of customers and staff, Ms Nicholls said:
âThe bedrock of good infection control... is ventilation, hygiene and
sanitation. Those are the measures and the key signals weâll be giving.â And asked whether staff would be free to continue wearing face masks,
Ms Nicholls said: âThat will continue to be the prevailing view going forward.
This is not about discouraging anybody.â Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Meanwhile, in the Commons, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas questions the
ending of the requirement for people in England to wear masks, since itâs
against the law to endanger others by driving at 100mph down the motorway. âWhy, when other health
and safety measures arenât left to individuals to decide, he thinks thatâs an
appropriate approach to Covid?"" she says in the Commons. ""Failing to mandate mask-wearing in stuffy,
crowded places like public transport - where people are often pressed together
for longer than 15 minutes - risks high costs. ""Allowing people to choose
whether or not to put others at risk is both reckless and unfair."" Bosses at John Lewis and Waitrose confirm they will introduce flexible working for their staff at head office, despite the end of the work-from-home recommendation from 19 July. Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations for the John Lewis Partnership, says: ""If restrictions are lifted on 19 July we won't tell our head office partners where to work. ""The pandemic has forced us all to rethink the norm of five days in an office. ""We will continue to support and enable our partners as they figure out how and where they work best for the type of work they do."" Labour leader Keir Starmer has been reacting to the PM's press conference. He says today's announcement is ""all about headlines, not public health"", and the PM is acting for ""party management"" reasons and not in the public interest. ""We need a proper plan,"" he says, because ""to throw off all protections at the same time when the infection rate is going up is reckless"". Asked what he would do differently, Starmer says he would continue with mask-wearing, and focus on improving ventilation and paying people a proper amount when they need to isolate. The PM has not seen the data, he adds, and as a result of that he is ""describing what he wants to see"" and not ""what he can see"". The prime minister has just finished his press conference, where he gave further details of plans for the final step of Englandâs roadmap out of lockdown. This is due to take place on 19 July - although this will only be confirmed on 12 July. From step four: Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Some big questions remained unaswered today Parents in England whose kids are at home because someone in their class tested positive want to know when regular testing might replace isolation, but we have to await an update from the edication secretary tomorrow We don't yet know if double-vaccinated people will be released from an obligation to self-isolate if they were in contact with an infected person so long as they take daily tests. And an update  on travel won't come until later on the week - while many have put holidays abroad on hold. But above all else, there was no clear answer on how many lives are at risk from a mix of fewer restrictions and rising cases - and what level of mortality is acceptable. No10 has said there will be fresh modelling/data before a final decision to lift restrictions is taken next week, but it seems unlikely that the PM will backtrack now.   Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether the prime minister is worried about the Euro 2020 football matches triggering ""superspreader"" events. Boris Johnson says his advice is to support England ""enthusiastically but in a responsible way"". He adds that there are testing requirements for matches at Wembley. Sir Patrick Vallance says most spreading happens indoors in crowded spaces, which is also where most superspreading events have occurred. Ross asks the advisers how many excess deaths these relaxations are likely to cause. Vallance says the models done at the start of the roadmap are available, with more modelling due next week which will be made public. He says the modelling has been very accurate in terms of timings.

Bidding war looms for Morrisons as rivals circle,"A US investment firm is considering making a rival offer for Morrisons, days after the UK supermarket agreed to a Â£6.3bn ($8.7bn) takeover. Apollo Global said it was considering the move, but no approach has yet been made to Morrisons. It is the third firm to show an interest in the UK chain in two months, fuelling speculation of a bidding war. On Saturday, Morrisons accepted an offer by another US investment group led by the owner of Majestic Wine. The takeover bid - led by US private equity firm Fortress Investment Group - is subject to shareholder approval, but the supermarket group's directors are recommending it is accepted. Morrisons is the UK's fourth largest UK supermarket chain, with nearly 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff. Supermarket Morrisons agrees Â£6.3bn takeover Asda takeover 'could lead to higher petrol prices' In a short statement issued on Monday, Apollo said it was ""in the preliminary stages of evaluating a possible offer for Morrisons"". However, it added: ""No approach has been made to the board of Morrisons. There can be no certainty that any offer will be made, nor as to the terms on which any such offer might be made."" Shares in Morrisonssurged by 11% on Monday to 269p. That took it well past the 254p per share offered by Fortress over the weekend - itself a 42% premium on the retailer's share price before the offer period. Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com, said the offer ""indicates investors believe there could be more juice to be squeezed from this particular bidding war"". ""I think there could well be another offer or two and 280p might be seen before it's a knockout. We've talked fairly regularly about the amount of private equity money there is waiting for UK companies, which are cheap versus peers [overseas]."" Over the weekend, Morrisons boss Andrew Higginson said Morrison's ""performance through the pandemic"" had improved its standing and enabled it to enter discussions with Fortress from ""a hard-won position of strength"". He said the consortium had a ""full understanding and appreciation of the fundamental character of Morrisons"". Joshua A Pack, managing partner at Fortress, said the group was committed to being ""good stewards of Morrisons"". Last month, Morrisons turned down an offer worth Â£5.5bn from a different private equity firm, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) , arguing the bid had significantly undervalued the business. Under UK takeover rules, CD&R has until 17 July to come back with a firm offer. The Takeover Panel is yet to announce the deadline by which Apollo must clarify its intentions in relation to Morrisons. Analysts have speculated that other private equity groups and e-commerce giant Amazon, which has a partnership with Morrisons, could also join the fray. You wait ages for a bidder to emerge for one of the UK's big supermarket chains, then three turn up at once. Speculation that Apollo might be a bidder for Morrisons has circulated since another US private equity firm, Clayton, Dubillier & Rice (CDR), lodged the first takeover offer for the supermarket chain a fortnight ago. Morrisons then wrong-footed the market by announcing on Saturday morning that it had agreed a deal with a group of investors led by one of CDR's rivals, Fortress Investment. Now Apollo has indeed joined the fray, saying it is considering its own offer. While it has not yet approached the Morrisons' board, a statement to the stock exchange confirming an interest makes it clear this is more than just a passing fancy. The market clearly expects a bid battle. This morning Morrisons shares were up 11% to 269p, well above the price agreed between the board and Fortress of 254p a share. CDR may return, Apollo is waiting in the wings, and some have still not given up hope of Amazon joining the fray. At the moment, however, Fortress, with a recommendation from the Morrisons' directors tucked into its back pocket, remains the favourite. What now are the chances of copycat bids for the other two large quoted UK supermarket chains, Tesco and J Sainsbury? Tesco might be simply too big for a private equity raider - its current market capitalisation is nearly Â£18bn, nearly three times the size of the Morrisons deal. And at Sainsbury's there is a potential blocking shareholder in the shape of Qatar Holdings, which still owns 15% of the chain. If the Qataris can be brought on side, Sainsbury's could, perhaps, become a takeover target. Large private equity firms have been targeting UK supermarkets, which they view as undervalued and attractive due to their large property portfolios. Last year, Apollo lost out on buying Asda, Britain's third largest supermarket group, to the Issa brothers and TDR Capital. As part of its offer, Fortress has made clear commitments not to sell off any of Morrisons' property and vowed to protect workers' jobs and pay. Nevertheless, Labour urged ministers to ensure the group's commitments ""are legally binding, and met"". The Unite union said it would not co-operate with any sale without ""unbreakable guarantees"" on jobs and conditions. Catherine Shuttleworth, head of retail research agency Savvy, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Quite often private equity will look at the potential for growth, and what is there to do in these businesses. And it may be they think there's a lot more to go there and they could do something with it. ""It may be they are complementary to other businesses they've got and they believe they can put something into those businesses that will drive profit."" She said whoever ended up buying the chain was likely to make changes. However, they would be expected to stick to their commitments under UK takeover rules.

Afghan troops flee after clashes with the Taliban,"More than 1,000 Afghan soldiers have fled to neighbouring Tajikistan after clashing with Taliban militants, officials have said. The troops retreated over the border to ""save their own lives"", according to a statement by Tajikistan's border guard. Violence has risen in Afghanistan and the Taliban have been making significant gains, particularly in the north of the country, in recent weeks. The surge comes as the US, UK and allies withdraw after 20 years. The vast majority of remaining foreign forces in Afghanistan have left ahead of a September deadline. There are concerns that the Afghan military, who were supposed to take over security in the country, will collapse. Under a deal with the Taliban, the US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops in return for a commitment by the militants not to allow any extremist group to operate in the areas they control. But the Taliban did not agree to stop fighting Afghan forces, and now reportedly control about a third of the country. Who are the Taliban? How can the West fight terror after leaving? US troops must leave by deadline - Afghan Taliban The retreat is the third time Afghan soldiers have fled to Tajikistan over the past three days and the fifth case over the past fortnight.  In total, nearly 1,600 soldiers have crossed the border. This group of Afghan soldiers fled to Tajikistan in June The latest group of Afghan troops sought refuge early on Monday morning after fighting with militants during the night, Tajikistan's National Security Committee said. Badakhshan and Takhar provinces, which border Tajikistan, have seen a rapid Taliban advance. ""The Taliban cut off all the roads and these people had nowhere to go but to cross the border,"" one senior Afghan official told Reuters on Monday. Zabihullah Atiq, a parliamentarian from Badakhshan, said the troops had used various routes to flee. Tajik border guards said Afghan soldiers were being provided with shelter and food, but further details were not available. By Kawoon Khamoosh, BBC News With the new surge in violence across the country, Afghan forces are facing an unprecedented level of combat in the absence of foreign troops. Government officials have been tweeting non-stop to keep soldiers motivated by underlying their sacrifices. But much of the troops' motivation disappears amid news of retreat, collapse of key districts and casualties. Military officials in Kabul have talked about ""tactical retreat"" whenever insurgents made gains, but we hear from commanders in the battlefield about a lack of ammunition, and delays in sending support. In Badakhshan province, where the government lost significant territory in recent days, local sources say many government officials ""escaped"" to Kabul way before Taliban attacks. Not only can this dishearten soldiers, but it also raises the bigger question of the loyalty of high-ranking officials in peace talks. Will political leaders - whose families already reside abroad - remain in the country if full-scale civil war erupts? President Ashraf Ghani insists that Afghan security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but there have also been reports of more soldiers seeking refuge in Pakistan and Uzbekistan to escape the fighting. Neighbouring countries are bracing themselves for a potential influx of refugees if the fighting continues to intensify. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC the group was not responsible for the recent increase in violence.  He insisted that many districts had fallen to the Taliban through mediation after Afghan soldiers refused to fight. This video can not be played ""US forces remaining would violate Doha agreement"" - Taliban For the people of Afghanistan, it is a worrying time, says Lyse Doucet, the BBC's chief international correspondent. The Taliban, who have been accused of various human rights and cultural abuses, support Islamic punishments - such as public executions of convicted murderers - as well as banning television, music and cinema, and disapproving of girls over 10 going to school. ""They are uncertain about uncertain about their own lives and the futures of their families,"" she says. Zahra, a 25-year-old resident of Kabul, is among those concerned about the future. ""People are expecting a wider than ever war. A lot of people in Kabul fear that the Taliban might reach us at any time,"" she toldBBC OS on World Service radio. Zahra said people in Kabul feared the Taliban could reach the city ""at any time"" Jamshid, a student at Kabul University, said he did not plan to stay in the country if the Taliban took power. There are also growing concerns about how to protect diplomatic missions in Afghanistan. Russia on Monday announced that it had temporarily suspended operations at its consulate in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif because of the deteriorating security situation. Envoy Zamir Kabulov said Afghan troops had surrendered too many districts, making the situation unstable. Turkey and Iran have also suspended operations in the city, moving diplomats to Kabul, according to reports. US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US that triggered the invasion. However, it has gradually regained enough strength to seize territory again. The Taliban entered direct talks with the US in 2018, and President Joe Biden has said the American pull-out is justified as US forces have made sure Afghanistan cannot become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West again. However, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai told the BBC he believed the Nato and US military mission there had failed in defeating terrorism and extremism. This video can not be played Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai: Nato failed to defeat extremism He called on both the Afghan government and the Taliban to ""sit down and talk as soon as possible for peace"". From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul.

Dropping face mask rule would be negligent - union,"Public transport and shop workers will face more risk of infection if mask rules are dropped, unions have said. Boris Johnson is expected to confirm later that the majority of Covid restrictions in England will be lifted from 19 July. These could include making face mask wearing voluntary and the end of 1m-plus social distancing. But dropping mask-wearing on public transport would be ""gross negligence"", the Unite union said. A Unite spokesman, pointing to official figures, said there had been a high level of Covid deaths among bus drivers even with mandatory face mask wearing. Boris Johnson to set out England's final Covid lockdown easing Covid-19: Masks will become personal choice, says Robert Jenrick ""To end the requirement to wear masks on public transport would be an act of gross negligence by the government,"" said Unite national officer for passenger transport Bobby Morton. ""Rates of infection are continuing to increase and not only does mask wearing reduce transmissions, it helps provide reassurance to drivers and to passengers who are nervous about using public transport. ""The idea of personal responsibility and hoping that people will wear masks is absolutely ridiculous, members are already reporting there is an increase in passengers ignoring the rules on mask wearing."" But industry body the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said that travelling by train was ""low risk"" and ""any decision to leave public transport behind other parts of the economy would need to be based on the science"". It said trains are ""well ventilated with air regularly refreshed either by air conditioning systems, or by doors and windows being opened"". ""Given that wearing a mask helps protect others, we would also support people who wished to continue wearing one in future if it becomes voluntary,"" the industry body added. Care minister Helen Whately told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she may continue to wear a mask when commuting by train from her constituency in Kent to London. ""I think it's the sort of environment where, if something's crowded, I think I might,"" she said. However, she added: ""I know personally, and I know others, aren't comfortable wearing masks all the time. ""As I've said, there are downsides to masks as there are downsides to many of the restrictions."" Ryanair said that face-masks would remain mandatory on its flights ""to protect the health of our passengers and crew"". There is expected to be a rise in coronavirus infections when restrictions are eased, but the government hopes that vaccinations will limit hospitalisations and deaths. The lifting of Covid restrictions was originally planned to be on 21 June, but this was pushed back to 19 July after a rise in infections driven by the Delta variant. Restrictions that are currently in placein England include the ""rule of six"" for gatherings, pubs and restaurants having to have table service, limits on how many people can be in theatres and cinemas, and nightclubs being closed. Facemasks also need to be worn in shops. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus rules, and the Scottish government has said it could keep some basic measures, including wearing masks, at its next review in August. The Usdaw union said face masks should continue to be mandatory for shoppers after 19 July to protect shop workers. ""Retail staff are working with the public every day and are deeply worried about catching Covid-19,"" said Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary. ""This is not the right time to water down safety in stores and the government should not be removing the requirements of face coverings and distancing in busy public areas like shops. ""To speak about the wearing of face coverings in these settings in terms of personal responsibility ignores the reality that public-facing workers have no option but to interact with large numbers of people as a part of their job,"" he said. The union urged shoppers to keep wearing face masks, and to carry on washing hands and social distancing ""to help make shops safer and limit the spread of Covid-19"". Mr Lillis added that many retail workers had continued to work through the pandemic ""to keep the country supplied with essentials"". ""These key workers must be valued, respected and protected,"" he added. Dan Shears, health and safety director at the GMB union, said: ""If compulsory masks are going to go then it is up to employers to control the Covid infection risk, primarily through ventilation, to keep workers and the general public safe."" The assistant general secretary of the Unison union,  Jon Richards, said: ""Now isn't the time to throw caution to the wind, especially with infections on the rise. The economy is important, but so is public confidence. ""People want clarity from the government as restrictions are eased. They don't need a confusing free-for-all, with ministers absolving themselves of any responsibility for public health. ""Face coverings and well-ventilated workspaces provide a level of reassurance and security to staff who deal with the public. Safety laws also require their employers to keep these workers safe.""

'Urgent and significant' NHS pay rise demand,"Trade unions said Welsh NHS staff are 'exhausted' a year into the Covid pandemic in the UK An ""urgent and significant pay rise"" is vital for NHS workers to reward staff and stop them leaving jobs, unions say. ""In the past year, Covid-19 has taken a terrible toll on our society. Many have sadly lost their lives and no-one has been untouched by the pandemic,"" saidWelsh Partnership Forum,externalchairman Paul Summers. Nine trade unions have signed an open letter to the Welsh government. They will give a presentation to health minister Eluned Morgan on Wednesday. The Welsh government is still to make an announcement on potential pay rises, with reports from independent pay review bodies (PRBs) expected to be published in June. NHS 1% pay rise is 'as much as we can give' - Boris Johnson 'No ceiling' for possible pay rise, says minister However, Ms Morgan suggested toPolitics Walesit would bemore than the 1% offered in England, adding: ""I think we've got an obligation. We've seen people on the frontline who have really suffered. ""They've really worked their socks off over the past year and so, if we do need to step in and find some additional funding that is beyond the 1%, then we'll certainly look at that."" The Welsh government said on Wednesday: ""We value and recognise the incredible work done by our NHS workers every day and none more so than during the pandemic' ""We haven't set an arbitrary cap on pay in our evidence to the pay review bodies and we will wait for their findings before we make an informed decision."" The Royal College of Nursing reacted angrily to proposals in England, saying it means Â£3.50 more per week in take-home pay for experienced nurses Mr Summers encouraged the Welsh Government to go beyond the recommendations if they do not meet the trade unions' demands. ""Throughout Wales, the NHS and its staff have been both vital and central to supporting the people of Wales,"" he added. ""NHS staff have exhausted themselves physically and mentally in their efforts to tackle the virus and support patients in a system that was already underfunded and struggling. ""It is therefore our belief that there has never been a time when the need for an urgent and significant pay rise for NHS staff has been so great - a belief shared by so many people across Wales."" NHS staff have been on the front line in the battle against coronavirus, caring for patients The open letter comes jointly from nine unions - the Royal College of Nursing, Royal College of Midwives, GMB, Unite, Unison, Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, BMA, British Association of Occupation Therapists and the Society of Radiographers. Mr Summers also called for the 2021 pay award to be backdated to December 2020, adding: ""With all the challenges that face NHS staff in the coming years, an urgent and significant pay rise is vital to reward staff and stem the tide of those leaving the NHS. ""Retaining and rewarding the skilled, dedicated and experienced NHS staff will have massive benefits on the health and wellbeing of Wales."" In the run-up to May's Senedd elections, Labour pledged to put in place the ""biggest recovery plan the NHS has ever seen"", a move that would include giving care workers the guarantee of a living wage. At the time, a spokesperson referred to the situation in England, saying: ""We understand the anger of staff across the NHS at the paltry 1% pay rise offered by the UK Tory government. Unlike the Tories in England, we haven't set an arbitrary cap on pay. ""The Welsh Labour government didn't include a cap on wage increases in its evidence to the pay review bodies and we wait to see their recommendations."" The Royal College of Nurses (RCN) said the Welsh Government should commit to a ""12.5% increase"" for all staff Prime Minister Boris Johnsondefended plans to give some NHS staffin England a 1% pay rise, amid warnings that ""undervalued"" nurses could quit. He said the UK government is giving workers ""as much as we can"" in the ""tough times"" of the Covid pandemic. The 1% rise in England, which is being considered by an independent panel, would cover most hospital staff. UK Labour responded by saying the proposal goes against a UK government ""promise"" made last year to give NHS workers a 2.1% pay rise. A bonus ofÂ£735 each was given to 222,000 Welsh NHS staffearlier this year - amounting to about Â£500 after tax is deducted. The Royal College of Nurses (RCN) said the Welsh Government shouldcommit to a ""12.5% increase""for all staff.

PM to set out final lockdown easing for England,"Boris Johnson is expected to confirm he is confident the majority of the remaining Covid restrictions in England can be lifted from 19 July. Making face masks voluntary and ending 1m-plus social distancing and QR code sign-ins at restaurants will be among his press conference announcements. The PM said people must ""learn to live"" with Covid and ""exercise judgement"". Infections are expected to rise when rules are eased but ministers believe deaths will be limited by vaccinations. A further 27,334 cases were reported across the UK on Monday, alongside another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The fourth and final stage of the government's roadmap out of lockdown in England was delayed last month to no earlier than 19 July. Among thecurrent measuresare the ""rule of six"" for gatherings, table service in pubs and restaurants, capacity limits in theatres and cinemas, the closure of nightclubs, and working from home guidance. However, while many of the remaining rules and guidance looks set to be swept away, the prime minister is not expected to address self isolation, travel restrictions or therules in schools. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules, and the Scottish government has suggested it mayretain some basic measures, including wearing masks, at its next review in August. Live coverage: Doubts over masks ahead of lockdown update What is Boris Johnson expected to say about 19 July? Dropping face mask rules negligent, says union Will we still have to socially distance this summer? The chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said it ""makes no sense"" to stop wearing face masks in enclosed public settings amid a rising number of cases of the Delta variant. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""face masks are proven to reduce spread of this infection"" and ""we can't understand why we would knowingly want people to become infected"". Unions representing public transport and shop workerssaid their staff would face even more risk of infection if face mask rules are dropped. Meanwhile, Ryanair said face masks would remain mandatory on its flight ""in order to protect the health of our passengers and crew"". In comments released by Downing Street before the prime minister gives his update at a 17:00 BST news conference, Mr Johnson said he ""must stress that the pandemic is not over and that cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks"". But praising the successful vaccine rollout, he said he would ""set out how we can restore people's freedoms"", adding: ""As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgement when going about our lives."" Downing Street said step four of the easing would go ahead in two weeks' time only if the government's ""four tests"" for easing curbs had been met. The verdict on those tests - on the jab rollout, vaccine effectiveness, hospital admissions, and new virus variants - would only be confirmed on 12 July following a review of the latest data. The findings of reviews on the use of Covid certification - or vaccine passports - andon social-distancing measuresare also due to be announced by Mr Johnson. It is understood the restriction banning pub-goers from ordering a drink directly at the bar will be dropped. But Downing Street stressed rules against travel to high-risk countries, the requirement to isolate if people test positive, as well as surge and community Covid testing programmes would continue after 19 July. Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update the Commons on the changes at the same time Mr Johnson holds his briefing at Downing Street alongside England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Behavioural psychologist Prof Stephen Reicher, one of the scientists advising the government, expressed concern about the face mask plans. He told Today: ""We need very clear messaging and in certain spaces - crowded, badly ventilated spaces - masks are crucial mitigation,"" adding ministers needed to provide ""support and proportionate mitigations to keep us safe. Along with the vaccine, that's the way out"". How can I visit my relative in a care home? Laura Kuenssberg: How much will life change on 19 July? Paul Nowak, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ""vital"" people would be returning to Covid-secure work sites. ""I just don't think it is acceptable for the government to simply outsource its responsibilities to individuals and to individual employers,"" he said. This video can not be played Some may choose to be cautious after 19 July, says NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen Powis Meanwhile, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to confirm ""what level of mortality and cases of long Covid"" it considers acceptable. ""Letting cases rise with no action means further pressure on the NHS, more sickness, disruption to education - and risks a new variant emerging with a selection advantage,"" he warned. Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director for NHS England, said infections were currently rising but hospital rates were not increasing at the same rate as previous peaks and ""things are looking very good"". He told BBC Breakfast the NHS was ""well used to coping with pressures, we do it every year and every winter. So we are prepared."" From the start of the pandemic, the single most important measure for controlling Covid was getting people to isolate when they had symptoms. It's why so many have urged the government to do more to support people financially when they do so. Everything else from mask-wearing and social distancing to contract tracing was about marginal gains on top. As we learnt more about the ability of the virus to spread before symptoms developed or among those who were asymptomatic those marginal gains became more important. But alongside isolating when ill, the new tool in the fight against Covid is, of course, vaccination. Not only do the vaccines protect you, they protect others by curbing spread by cutting your chances of being infected in the first place and your risk of passing on the virus if you do become infected. With high vaccination uptake, all those other measures are much less important than they once were. That's why ministers feel they can ditch many of them - and in doing so become arguably the first nation to relax restrictions on this scale with infections rising and attempt to learn to live with Covid. The review of social-distancing measures has been of particular interest to the hospitality industry, which says many venues are unable to operate profitably under restrictions on capacity and table service rules. The findings of a review into Covid certification are also expected. The use of certificates to prove a person's Covid vaccination or test status has been welcomed by some travel industry bosses and leading sports bodies - but the concept has raised concerns over discrimination and privacy. Separately, the PM will give further details on the future of care home visits. At the moment, care home residents in England can choose up to five people who can visit regularly, but no more than two people should visit at one time or in one day. Care minister Helen Whately says visits are unlikely to ""completely go back to normal"" as there was a need for some precautions for residents - and face coverings were expected to remain a requirement. Around 64% of the UK adult population has now received a second vaccine dose, with just over 86% having now received at least a first dose. No 10 has said the government is ensuring preparations are in place to offer third ""booster"" doses to everyone aged over 50 and the most vulnerable over the winter months.

Boris Johnson to set out England's final Covid lockdown easing Covid-19: Masks will become personal choice, says Robert Jenrick ""To end the requirement to wear masks on public transport would be an act of gross negligence by the government,"" said Unite national officer for passenger transport Bobby Morton. ""Rates of infection are continuing to increase and not only does mask wearing reduce transmissions, it helps provide reassurance to drivers and to passengers who are nervous about using public transport. ""The idea of personal responsibility and hoping that people will wear masks is absolutely ridiculous, members are already reporting there is an increase in passengers ignoring the rules on mask wearing."" But industry body the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said that travelling by train was ""low risk"" and ""any decision to leave public transport behind other parts of the economy would need to be based on the science"". It said trains are ""well ventilated with air regularly refreshed either by air conditioning systems, or by doors and windows being opened"". ""Given that wearing a mask helps protect others, we would also support people who wished to continue wearing one in future if it becomes voluntary,"" the industry body added. Care minister Helen Whately told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she may continue to wear a mask when commuting by train from her constituency in Kent to London. ""I think it's the sort of environment where, if something's crowded, I think I might,"" she said. However, she added: ""I know personally, and I know others, aren't comfortable wearing masks all the time. ""As I've said, there are downsides to masks as there are downsides to many of the restrictions."" Ryanair said that face-masks would remain mandatory on its flights ""to protect the health of our passengers and crew"". There is expected to be a rise in coronavirus infections when restrictions are eased, but the government hopes that vaccinations will limit hospitalisations and deaths. The lifting of Covid restrictions was originally planned to be on 21 June, but this was pushed back to 19 July after a rise in infections driven by the Delta variant. Restrictions that are currently in placein England include the ""rule of six"" for gatherings, pubs and restaurants having to have table service, limits on how many people can be in theatres and cinemas, and nightclubs being closed. Facemasks also need to be worn in shops. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus rules, and the Scottish government has said it could keep some basic measures, including wearing masks, at its next review in August. The Usdaw union said face masks should continue to be mandatory for shoppers after 19 July to protect shop workers. ""Retail staff are working with the public every day and are deeply worried about catching Covid-19,"" said Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary. ""This is not the right time to water down safety in stores and the government should not be removing the requirements of face coverings and distancing in busy public areas like shops. ""To speak about the wearing of face coverings in these settings in terms of personal responsibility ignores the reality that public-facing workers have no option but to interact with large numbers of people as a part of their job,"" he said. The union urged shoppers to keep wearing face masks, and to carry on washing hands and social distancing ""to help make shops safer and limit the spread of Covid-19"". Mr Lillis added that many retail workers had continued to work through the pandemic ""to keep the country supplied with essentials"". ""These key workers must be valued, respected and protected,"" he added. Dan Shears, health and safety director at the GMB union, said: ""If compulsory masks are going to go then it is up to employers to control the Covid infection risk, primarily through ventilation, to keep workers and the general public safe."" The assistant general secretary of the Unison union,  Jon Richards, said: ""Now isn't the time to throw caution to the wind, especially with infections on the rise. The economy is important, but so is public confidence. ""People want clarity from the government as restrictions are eased. They don't need a confusing free-for-all, with ministers absolving themselves of any responsibility for public health. ""Face coverings and well-ventilated workspaces provide a level of reassurance and security to staff who deal with the public. Safety laws also require their employers to keep these workers safe.""

"PM to set out final lockdown easing for EnglandBoris Johnson says he wants to ""restore freedoms"", as he unveils plans on social distancing and masks.UKComments","Boris Johnson is expected to confirm he is confident the majority of the remaining Covid restrictions in England can be lifted from 19 July. Making face masks voluntary and ending 1m-plus social distancing and QR code sign-ins at restaurants will be among his press conference announcements. The PM said people must ""learn to live"" with Covid and ""exercise judgement"". Infections are expected to rise when rules are eased but ministers believe deaths will be limited by vaccinations. A further 27,334 cases were reported across the UK on Monday, alongside another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The fourth and final stage of the government's roadmap out of lockdown in England was delayed last month to no earlier than 19 July. Among thecurrent measuresare the ""rule of six"" for gatherings, table service in pubs and restaurants, capacity limits in theatres and cinemas, the closure of nightclubs, and working from home guidance. However, while many of the remaining rules and guidance looks set to be swept away, the prime minister is not expected to address self isolation, travel restrictions or therules in schools. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules, and the Scottish government has suggested it mayretain some basic measures, including wearing masks, at its next review in August. Live coverage: Doubts over masks ahead of lockdown update What is Boris Johnson expected to say about 19 July? Dropping face mask rules negligent, says union Will we still have to socially distance this summer? The chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said it ""makes no sense"" to stop wearing face masks in enclosed public settings amid a rising number of cases of the Delta variant. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""face masks are proven to reduce spread of this infection"" and ""we can't understand why we would knowingly want people to become infected"". Unions representing public transport and shop workerssaid their staff would face even more risk of infection if face mask rules are dropped. Meanwhile, Ryanair said face masks would remain mandatory on its flight ""in order to protect the health of our passengers and crew"". In comments released by Downing Street before the prime minister gives his update at a 17:00 BST news conference, Mr Johnson said he ""must stress that the pandemic is not over and that cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks"". But praising the successful vaccine rollout, he said he would ""set out how we can restore people's freedoms"", adding: ""As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgement when going about our lives."" Downing Street said step four of the easing would go ahead in two weeks' time only if the government's ""four tests"" for easing curbs had been met. The verdict on those tests - on the jab rollout, vaccine effectiveness, hospital admissions, and new virus variants - would only be confirmed on 12 July following a review of the latest data. The findings of reviews on the use of Covid certification - or vaccine passports - andon social-distancing measuresare also due to be announced by Mr Johnson. It is understood the restriction banning pub-goers from ordering a drink directly at the bar will be dropped. But Downing Street stressed rules against travel to high-risk countries, the requirement to isolate if people test positive, as well as surge and community Covid testing programmes would continue after 19 July. Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update the Commons on the changes at the same time Mr Johnson holds his briefing at Downing Street alongside England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Behavioural psychologist Prof Stephen Reicher, one of the scientists advising the government, expressed concern about the face mask plans. He told Today: ""We need very clear messaging and in certain spaces - crowded, badly ventilated spaces - masks are crucial mitigation,"" adding ministers needed to provide ""support and proportionate mitigations to keep us safe. Along with the vaccine, that's the way out"". How can I visit my relative in a care home? Laura Kuenssberg: How much will life change on 19 July? Paul Nowak, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ""vital"" people would be returning to Covid-secure work sites. ""I just don't think it is acceptable for the government to simply outsource its responsibilities to individuals and to individual employers,"" he said. This video can not be played Some may choose to be cautious after 19 July, says NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen Powis Meanwhile, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to confirm ""what level of mortality and cases of long Covid"" it considers acceptable. ""Letting cases rise with no action means further pressure on the NHS, more sickness, disruption to education - and risks a new variant emerging with a selection advantage,"" he warned. Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director for NHS England, said infections were currently rising but hospital rates were not increasing at the same rate as previous peaks and ""things are looking very good"". He told BBC Breakfast the NHS was ""well used to coping with pressures, we do it every year and every winter. So we are prepared."" From the start of the pandemic, the single most important measure for controlling Covid was getting people to isolate when they had symptoms. It's why so many have urged the government to do more to support people financially when they do so. Everything else from mask-wearing and social distancing to contract tracing was about marginal gains on top. As we learnt more about the ability of the virus to spread before symptoms developed or among those who were asymptomatic those marginal gains became more important. But alongside isolating when ill, the new tool in the fight against Covid is, of course, vaccination. Not only do the vaccines protect you, they protect others by curbing spread by cutting your chances of being infected in the first place and your risk of passing on the virus if you do become infected. With high vaccination uptake, all those other measures are much less important than they once were. That's why ministers feel they can ditch many of them - and in doing so become arguably the first nation to relax restrictions on this scale with infections rising and attempt to learn to live with Covid. The review of social-distancing measures has been of particular interest to the hospitality industry, which says many venues are unable to operate profitably under restrictions on capacity and table service rules. The findings of a review into Covid certification are also expected. The use of certificates to prove a person's Covid vaccination or test status has been welcomed by some travel industry bosses and leading sports bodies - but the concept has raised concerns over discrimination and privacy. Separately, the PM will give further details on the future of care home visits. At the moment, care home residents in England can choose up to five people who can visit regularly, but no more than two people should visit at one time or in one day. Care minister Helen Whately says visits are unlikely to ""completely go back to normal"" as there was a need for some precautions for residents - and face coverings were expected to remain a requirement. Around 64% of the UK adult population has now received a second vaccine dose, with just over 86% having now received at least a first dose. No 10 has said the government is ensuring preparations are in place to offer third ""booster"" doses to everyone aged over 50 and the most vulnerable over the winter months.

Edinburgh clean-up under way after flash flooding,"This video can not be played A clean up was under way on Monday after 37mm of rain fell in an hour. Edinburgh was hit with nearly half of its average July rainfall in under an hour on Sunday, as storms caused flooding across the city. Trains were stopped and homes and businesses fought to keep the water out. The newly-opened St James Quarter shopping centre was also affected. Council flood prevention teams are working with Scottish Water to find blockages and clear surface water. A yellow warning of rain and a Sepa flood alert remain in place on Monday. Edinburgh council said up to 37mm of rain had fallen - beyond the capacity of the city's drains and sewerage system. Councillor Lesley Macinnes, transport and environment convener, said: ""Our roads and flood prevention teams have worked extremely hard, throughout Sunday and overnight, to minimise the impact of this intense, sudden downpour. ""No city's drainage systems are designed to cope with the sort of short, sharp volume of water. A couple stuck at a bus stop on Edinburgh's Roseburn Terrace ""Our sympathies are with anyone who has experienced damage to their property. Officers, along with partners, are working flat-out to make sure the aftermath is cleared as quickly as possible."" Images shared on social media showed a series of flooding incidents. At a bridge in Chesser, fire crews could be seen moving vehicles stuck in the water. A couple were also pictured stuck at a bus stop on Roseburn Terrace. Sunday's stormy weather also caused a problem for shoppers in the new St James Quarter, which opened last month. Water could be seen dripping down windows and onto the balconies of several floors to ground level. Fire crews helped to move cars stuck in floodwater in Chesser Flooding also affected Inverleith A spokeswoman for St James Quarter said: ""Parts of the galleria were cordoned off for safety reasons. ""St James Quarter has been built to fully integrate with the city's streetscape and is not an enclosed building. ""Whilst it has been designed as a naturally-ventilated environment and allows some rain to come into the galleria, the extent of water ingress in two sections was mainly caused by severe rainfall testing areas which are still under construction."" Three restaurants, Five Guys, Burger King and Nando's as well as Genting Casinos and Tenpin at Fountain Park in Fountainbridge were closed on Sunday due to flooding. They remain closed. Cineworld at the other end of the complex was unaffected by the flooding. Three restaurants, Five Guys, Burger King and Nando's as well as Genting Casinos and Tenpin at Fountain Park in Fountainbridge were closed on Sunday due to flooding The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh was also closed on Monday following flooding there. On Sunday evening, ScotRail had announced that trains between Helensburgh and Edinburgh would only run as far as Bathgate for safety reasons. Buses were arranged to run from Edinburgh to Glasgow while Network Rail workers set up pumps to clear water from railway tracks Meanwhile, a search was carried out in the River Forth for two people in a kayak after the Coastguard received a 999 call from a passer-by who was concerned about them due to the poor weather conditions. The Coastguard was called just before 17:15 on Sunday and carried out an extensive search, involving its helicopter from Prestwick, rescue teams from Fisherrow, Kinghorn and South Queensferry and RNLI lifeboats from Kinghorn and South Queensferry. After nothing was found, the search was called off at about 21:00 pending further information. Flash floods hit Edinburgh streets, shops and homes.

Significant Edward Lear poems discovered,"Edward Lear wrote the pages to a young woman he befriended in Italy Previously unseen poems and letters written by Victorian nonsense poet Edward Lear have been found hidden in a private collection. The discovery was made by University of Nottingham PhD student Amy Wilcockson in the British Library. While sifting through manuscripts, Ms Wilcockson noticed some pages written by Lear to a young English woman he had befriended in Italy. The university said the finds were significant. The poems were found in a large collection of manuscripts Ms Wilcockson found the pages, which contain a limerick about an old man on a bicycle, a poem and several letters, in a large collection of manuscripts known as the Charnwood Autograph Collection. They were written by the poet - best known as the author of The Owl and The Pussycat - to Mary Mundella, the daughter of a Nottingham hosiery merchant. Mary passed the correspondence down to her niece, Lady Dorothea Charnwood. Ms Wilcockson said the poems made her laugh out loud Ms Wilcockson said: ""I was flicking through, when I came across a poem, 'The Last of the Octopods'. ""I read the poem and laughed out loud; it was humorous and nonsensical. ""Imagine my joy when I read the signature of the poem's author."" There was an old man on a Bycicle, Whose nose was adorned with an Icicle; But they said - ""If you stop, ""It will certainly drop, & abolish both you & your Bycicle. After some research it became clear the pages were unpublished and unseen by the public, and Ms Wilcockson said she realised she had ""something special"" on her hands. ""I think this is a really major find for 19th century literary studies, and it deserves a wider public audience too,"" she added. The discoveries have now been digitised by the British Library. Amy's co-researcher Dr Edmund Downey said: ""I've felt very privileged helping bring these works to light. The texts will make a significant contribution to Lear scholarship.""

Indonesia faces oxygen crisis amid Covid surge,"Oxygen supplies have been running low for days Indonesia's government has ordered producers to prioritise medical oxygen amid a Covid surge and a shortage of oxygen in a number of cities. Hospitals say they have almost exhausted supplies, with one reporting that 63 patients died as a result of oxygen shortages. Indonesia is recording more than 25,000 new cases every day. Increased travel and the highly contagious Delta variant have exacerbated the crisis. Indonesia has had the worst Covid outbreak in South East Asia, with about 2.3 million positive cases and more than 60,000 deaths so far. Indonesia announces Covid lockdown as cases surge Reused Covid nose swab scam busted at airport However, experts warn that the overall numbers are potentially much higher because of severely inadequate testing outside the capital Jakarta. A lockdown was announcedon the country's main island Java, as well as in the tourist island of Bali last week. On Monday, two hospitals in the city of Bandung announced that they had run out of oxygen, and had to reject new patients seeking emergency treatment. Over the weekend, emergency services and intensive care units of public hospitals in the cities of Bandung, Surakarta, and Pamekasan said they were struggling with an influx of people seeking admission with some having to turn away patients. Others have set up tents outside. ""It's a war-like emergency,"" a woman seeking treatment for her elderly mother told the BBC's Indonesian service. Her mother had first been rejected at a hospital that had run out of beds, and was only able to get admitted to a makeshift tent at another one. In the Regional General Hospital (RSUD) in Bandung, the emergency room was closed for Covid patients as of 2 July, with the lack of oxygen being one of the reasons. ""Four days ago, there was shortage of oxygen supply from distributors and vendors,"" hospital head Mulyadi told the BBC at the weekend. ""So four days ago, I tried to make the use of oxygen more efficient."" He added that producers are struggling to meet the increased demand from hospitals. ""Every day a lot of people come, 10 to 15 Covid-19 patients, there are a lot of queues,"" doctor Syaiful Hidayat at the Smart Pamekasan Hospital told the BBC. The pulmonary specialist says they initially set up an emergency tent for Covid patients but were later forced to turn some patients away. Demand is also driving prices up Health ministry official Siti Nadia Tarmizi said they had asked the gas industry to step up production of medical oxygen, and appealed to people not to hoard. ""We hope people don't stock up on oxygen,"" she said, adding that this would only worsen the shortage for others. Her comments come as people have been trying to privately secure oxygen cylinders to treat patients at home. New cylinders ands refills are hard to come by, and prices have doubled because of high demand. In Jakarta, the daily number of funerals following Covid protocols jumped 10-fold since early May, the government said on Sunday. There is also a high number of infections and deaths among the country's medical frontline workers, despite most of them being vaccinated. The country is mostly relying on the Chinese Sinovac jabs and experts are now considering giving a third dose to boost efficacy against the new Delta variant. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said last week that the country was ""teetering on the edge of a Covid-19 catastrophe"". Meanwhile, starting Tuesday, Indonesia will change entry rules for foreign visitors, only allowing in fully vaccinated people who present a negative Covid test, the authorities said. Incoming visitors will still have to spend eight days in quarantine upon arrival.

Afro swim cap Olympic ban 'review' after backlash,"Alice Dearing, pictured wearing a Soul Cap, will be the first black woman to represent Great Britain in an Olympic swimming event at Tokyo 2020 A decision not to allow swimming caps designed for afro hair at international competitions - such as Tokyo 2020 - could be reconsidered, after backlash. Soul Cap said Fina, the water sports world governing body,had told them the hats aren't suitable because they don't follow ""the natural form of the head"". The comments sparked criticism from many swimmers with some saying it would discourage black people from the sport. Fina now says it's ""reviewing the situation"" regarding the products. In a statement, it said it understood ""the importance of inclusivity and representation"". ""Fina is committed to ensuring that all aquatics athletes have access to appropriate swimwear for competition where this swimwear does not confer a competitive advantage,"" it added. It said it would speak to Soul Cap about using the hats at Fina's development centres, which train swimmers around the world. Why some 'black girls don't swim' Afro swim cap Olympic rejection is 'heartbreaking' Soul Cap makes caps to fit over and protect dreadlocks, afros, weaves, braids, and thick and curly hair. Afro hair is naturally drier than other hair because it has fewer cell layers. The sodium hypochlorite - or bleach - found in swimming pools can dry it out more, leading to damage. Young black swimmers told Radio 1 Newsbeat they were ""disappointed and heartbroken"" by Fina's words last week. Kejai Terrelonge, 17, said hair-care is one of many barriers she's faced as a black swimmer. ""Using the smaller swimming caps that everyone else would use - it would fit on my head but because I put [protective] oil in my hair, when I was swimming it would just keep sliding off and my hair would get wet,"" said Kejai, who lives in Birmingham. Swim England released astatement,externalto ""reassure"" people that Soul Caps are allowed at domestic competitions in England. It said it would raise its ""concerns"" about Fina's rejection ""through the appropriate channels"". ""Swimming hats designed for afro hair can reduce barriers to the sport for under-represented groups, including black people,"" it added. White British children are over-represented in swimming relative to their population share, according to a report by Sport England from January 2020. Around 29.3% of white British children take part in swimming, compared with 21.9% Asian children and 20.1% of black children. This video can not be played Things youâll know if youâre a black swimmer The founders of Soul Cap, Michael Chapman and Toks Ahmed-Salawudeen, said they were grateful for the support they'd had after Fina's rejection of their application to approve their hats for international competitions. They said they grew up without learning to swim because ""we didn't think it was a sport for us, it wasn't a thing amongst our friends and it wasn't encouraged by our school or parents"".

Jamaican international swimmer Michael Gunning has also criticised Fina's wording.

US firm considering rival offer for Morrisons,"A US investment firm is considering making a rival offer for Morrisons, days after the UK supermarket agreed to a Â£6.3bn ($8.7bn) takeover. Apollo Global said it was considering the move, but no approach has yet been made to Morrisons. It is the third firm to show an interest in the UK chain in two months, fuelling speculation of a bidding war. On Saturday, Morrisons accepted an offer by another US investment group led by the owner of Majestic Wine. The takeover bid - led by US private equity firm Fortress Investment Group - is subject to shareholder approval, but the supermarket group's directors are recommending it is accepted. Morrisons is the UK's fourth largest UK supermarket chain, with nearly 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff. Supermarket Morrisons agrees Â£6.3bn takeover Asda takeover 'could lead to higher petrol prices' In a short statement issued on Monday, Apollo said it was ""in the preliminary stages of evaluating a possible offer for Morrisons"". However, it added: ""No approach has been made to the board of Morrisons. There can be no certainty that any offer will be made, nor as to the terms on which any such offer might be made."" Shares in Morrisonssurged by 11% on Monday to 269p. That took it well past the 254p per share offered by Fortress over the weekend - itself a 42% premium on the retailer's share price before the offer period. Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com, said the offer ""indicates investors believe there could be more juice to be squeezed from this particular bidding war"". ""I think there could well be another offer or two and 280p might be seen before it's a knockout. We've talked fairly regularly about the amount of private equity money there is waiting for UK companies, which are cheap versus peers [overseas]."" Over the weekend, Morrisons boss Andrew Higginson said Morrison's ""performance through the pandemic"" had improved its standing and enabled it to enter discussions with Fortress from ""a hard-won position of strength"". He said the consortium had a ""full understanding and appreciation of the fundamental character of Morrisons"". Joshua A Pack, managing partner at Fortress, said the group was committed to being ""good stewards of Morrisons"". Last month, Morrisons turned down an offer worth Â£5.5bn from a different private equity firm, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) , arguing the bid had significantly undervalued the business. Under UK takeover rules, CD&R has until 17 July to come back with a firm offer. The Takeover Panel is yet to announce the deadline by which Apollo must clarify its intentions in relation to Morrisons. Analysts have speculated that other private equity groups and e-commerce giant Amazon, which has a partnership with Morrisons, could also join the fray. You wait ages for a bidder to emerge for one of the UK's big supermarket chains, then three turn up at once. Speculation that Apollo might be a bidder for Morrisons has circulated since another US private equity firm, Clayton, Dubillier & Rice (CDR), lodged the first takeover offer for the supermarket chain a fortnight ago. Morrisons then wrong-footed the market by announcing on Saturday morning that it had agreed a deal with a group of investors led by one of CDR's rivals, Fortress Investment. Now Apollo has indeed joined the fray, saying it is considering its own offer. While it has not yet approached the Morrisons' board, a statement to the stock exchange confirming an interest makes it clear this is more than just a passing fancy. The market clearly expects a bid battle. This morning Morrisons shares were up 11% to 269p, well above the price agreed between the board and Fortress of 254p a share. CDR may return, Apollo is waiting in the wings, and some have still not given up hope of Amazon joining the fray. At the moment, however, Fortress, with a recommendation from the Morrisons' directors tucked into its back pocket, remains the favourite. What now are the chances of copycat bids for the other two large quoted UK supermarket chains, Tesco and J Sainsbury? Tesco might be simply too big for a private equity raider - its current market capitalisation is nearly Â£18bn, nearly three times the size of the Morrisons deal. And at Sainsbury's there is a potential blocking shareholder in the shape of Qatar Holdings, which still owns 15% of the chain. If the Qataris can be brought on side, Sainsbury's could, perhaps, become a takeover target. Large private equity firms have been targeting UK supermarkets, which they view as undervalued and attractive due to their large property portfolios. Last year, Apollo lost out on buying Asda, Britain's third largest supermarket group, to the Issa brothers and TDR Capital. As part of its offer, Fortress has made clear commitments not to sell off any of Morrisons' property and vowed to protect workers' jobs and pay. Nevertheless, Labour urged ministers to ensure the group's commitments ""are legally binding, and met"". The Unite union said it would not co-operate with any sale without ""unbreakable guarantees"" on jobs and conditions. Catherine Shuttleworth, head of retail research agency Savvy, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Quite often private equity will look at the potential for growth, and what is there to do in these businesses. And it may be they think there's a lot more to go there and they could do something with it. ""It may be they are complementary to other businesses they've got and they believe they can put something into those businesses that will drive profit."" She said whoever ended up buying the chain was likely to make changes. However, they would be expected to stick to their commitments under UK takeover rules.

LiveLiveDoubts over masks ahead of England lockdown updateLess than a minute ago,"Boris Johnson sets out details of the final step of England's roadmap out of lockdown He outlines a five point plan for ""living with Covid"" - but stresses a final decision on easing restrictions on 19 July will come next week The PM says the pandemic is far from over and we must reconcile ourselves to more deaths and take a careful and balanced decision The government will drop legal restrictions to allow people to make ""informed decisions"" on managing the virus, he says ""If we can't reopen our society in the next few weeks... we must ask ourselves 'when will we be able to reopen?',"" the PM says There are shouts of âhallelujahâ in the Commons as Health Secretary Sajid Javid tells MPs social distancing rules in England will go Labourâs shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the strategy will expose many thousands of people to Covid The Duchess of Cambridge is self-isolating after coming into contact with someone who later tested positive Edited by Martha Buckley That's all from your live page team today - the updates have been brought to you by Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett, George Wright, James Clarke, Jenny Matthews, Katie Wright, Martha Buckley, Sinead Wilson and Sophie Williams. It's been a busy day with a big announcement on lockdown in England. Here's a recap of the main Covid news: Oxygen supplies have been running low in Indonesia for days We'll be wrapping up our live page coverage for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of the latest developments from around the world. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Lifting all protections at once is reckless' - Keir Starmer Labour leader Keir Starmer has responded to the PM's plan for 19 July, saying lifting all restrictions at once, while infection rates are rising, is ""reckless"". He said masks should continue to be mandatory in enclosed places and public transport, and ""common sense has to play a part here"".  The mortuary at Fiji's largest hospital is now full, the country's health ministry has announced. It comes as the country battles a second wave of Covid-19. A new daily high of 522 new infections was recorded on Sunday. The Colonial War Memorial Hospital in the only public hospital in the capital Suva. It is now being devoted to caring for Covid patients. ""Due to the mortuary now being utilised to full capacity, the concerned relatives are kindly requested to make immediate arrangements for the uplifting of the deceased from the mortuary, and the performance of final funeral rites for your loved ones,"" the ministry said in a statement. Thirty people are known to have died of the coronavirus in Fiji, which has a population of about 900,000. The requirement to wear a mask on public transport in England looks likely to end on 19 July - despite some opposition to the idea. But asked if there were circumstances in which he would continue to wear a face covering, Boris Johnson said it would ""depend on the circumstances"". ""Clearly there's a big difference between travelling on a crowded Tube train and sitting, late at night, in a virtually empty carriage on the main railway line,"" he said. And Health Secretary Sajid Javid has told the Commons it would be ""sensible"" to wear a mask on a ""very crowded"" London Underground train. Before the PM's briefing, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he wanted the public to have a clear message over using face masks on public transport. He told the BBC: âIn London, (there) are some trains that we are
responsible for, so what I wouldnât want to do is have
confusion where TfL (Transport for London) has one set of rules, and the
government has other. âThe government knows my view; I was somebody who
was advocating for wearing face masks last year in March and April. âIt was only a few months later, the government finally
listened to our requests. âI want people returning to the tubes and buses as soon as
possible, I want the West End to be busy and thriving. ""One way to do that is to give people
confidence in public transport.""  The Scottish National Party's health spokeswoman has said she is surprised that the UK government - which is in charge of England's lockdown rules - is planning to end all measures. Scotland is in charge of its own Covid rules and aims to lift all major legal lockdown restrictions by 9 August. The Scottish government has already said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after this date - something that's not happening in England. ""If the health secretary is going to just let it rip, how does he plan to avoid generating yet another UK variant with even greater vaccine resistance?"" asked the SNP's Dr Philippa Whitford on video call in the Commons earlier. Sajid Javid, the new health secretary, had just set out the plan to lift all rules on 19 July. She said Javid ""appears to be completely ignoring the risk of long Covid which is already affecting over a million people including children"", adding: ""How does he plan to avoid soaring cases of long Covid in unvaccinated young adults and children, does he consider them to be collateral damage or just a price worth paying?"" Javid accused her of ""scaremongering"" and ""political point scoring"", adding: ""If anything, the only part of the UK where cases could be described as ripping would be in Scotland, where the case rate is higher than any other part of the UK, in fact I think they have seven of the 10 highest hotspots in terms of number of cases throughout Europe."" From 19 July, theatres and sports stadiums in England will be able to be full once again, as the limits on capacity are set to be removed. The move still needs to be confirmed on 12 July, but it means there could be full stadiums for the start of the Premier League season in August. However, the PM said some venues may choose to make use of the NHS vaccine passport service should they wish - which asks attendees to prove their vaccine status. Wimbledon has already seen an increase of crowds this week, with Centre Court at 75% capacity. There will also be hope for full stadiums during England's Test series against India starting on 4 August, as well as at Glorious Goodwood at the end of July. Read more on the sport side of things here. Entertainment bosses have welcomed the news that all limits on
the numbers of people who can go to nightclubs, theatres and gig venues will be lifted
at step four of the government roadmap, which is likely to be on 19 July. Philippa Child, head of entertainment union Bectu, said the PM's
announcement was âwelcome news for theatres, venues and events that have been
forced to close for over a year"", but said the cultural sector still faces
some
""confusion"". Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music
Venue Trust, described the announcement as ""hugely important and
provides the opportunity to revive live music"". ""It does not, however, change the central mission or the
importance of the word 'safely',"" he stressed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Kill, who is in charge of the Night Time Industries Association, said: ""To
hear the Prime Minister say that we need to learn to live with this virus is a
long overdue step, and will be a relief to our sector."" And Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London
Theatre, described the announcement as âa lifeline for our industry [and] essential for
the survival of theatres across the countryâ. There was lots of detail on what life might look like in England after 19 July in the PM's press conference - but here's some of the other main points: The prime minister has finished setting out details on the plans for easing Covid restrictions in England from 19 July. He said that date was the right time for this, because of the arrival of summer and the school holidays, which will make it more difficult for the virus to spread. This video can not be played Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent No country in the world has attempted to lift restrictions
like this in the face of rapidly rising cases driven by the new, more
infectious Delta variant. Some say it would be better to wait until autumn when all
adults will have had the chance of a second dose. That sounds good in principle, but the bulk of scientific
opinion seems to be backing a summer lifting. Unlocking was always going to drive up infections. And the problem with trying to delay that is you risk seeing
a surge in cases at a much worse time. By the autumn, schools will be back â and we can see the huge
disruption the rise in cases in recent weeks has had. People will also be outdoors more in the summer months,
which could help flatten the peak. But, perhaps most importantly, you risk running into the flu
season. That is when the NHS is under most pressure, while a Covid
infection followed by flu in quick succession puts the vulnerable even more at
risk. The move is not without risk. The government is banking on
the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme stemming these rises
soon. Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Sir Desmond Swayne, a Conservative, aims to hold ministersâ
feet to the fire on making sure restrictions are never re-imposed. He asks the Commons: âWe will never again sacrifice freedom of
association, free enterprise and, indeed, freedom of worship in order to manage
hospital admissions ever again, will we?â Sajid Javid replies: âI take it from that heâs pleased with
todayâs announcementsâ. The lifting of Covid restrictions will allow hospitality
businesses to ârebuild and recoverâ, according to an industry body. Speaking to BBC Radio 4âs PM programme, the boss of Hospitality UK Kate Nicholls
said: âThe reaction of the industry will be one primarily of relief. âTo have some certainty brought to the debate - and to have an
ability to plan in advance. ""It allows the sector to be able to look ahead
with a degree of confidence that they are turning a corner. ""Weâll be able to
move towards a more viable proposition and start to trade more freely again â¦
to be able to rebuild and recover.â Asked about the safety of customers and staff, Ms Nicholls said:
âThe bedrock of good infection control... is ventilation, hygiene and
sanitation. Those are the measures and the key signals weâll be giving.â And asked whether staff would be free to continue wearing face masks,
Ms Nicholls said: âThat will continue to be the prevailing view going forward.
This is not about discouraging anybody.â Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Meanwhile, in the Commons, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas questions the
ending of the requirement for people in England to wear masks, since itâs
against the law to endanger others by driving at 100mph down the motorway. âWhy, when other health
and safety measures arenât left to individuals to decide, he thinks thatâs an
appropriate approach to Covid?"" she says in the Commons. ""Failing to mandate mask-wearing in stuffy,
crowded places like public transport - where people are often pressed together
for longer than 15 minutes - risks high costs. ""Allowing people to choose
whether or not to put others at risk is both reckless and unfair."" Bosses at John Lewis and Waitrose confirm they will introduce flexible working for their staff at head office, despite the end of the work-from-home recommendation from 19 July. Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations for the John Lewis Partnership, says: ""If restrictions are lifted on 19 July we won't tell our head office partners where to work. ""The pandemic has forced us all to rethink the norm of five days in an office. ""We will continue to support and enable our partners as they figure out how and where they work best for the type of work they do."" Labour leader Keir Starmer has been reacting to the PM's press conference. He says today's announcement is ""all about headlines, not public health"", and the PM is acting for ""party management"" reasons and not in the public interest. ""We need a proper plan,"" he says, because ""to throw off all protections at the same time when the infection rate is going up is reckless"". Asked what he would do differently, Starmer says he would continue with mask-wearing, and focus on improving ventilation and paying people a proper amount when they need to isolate. The PM has not seen the data, he adds, and as a result of that he is ""describing what he wants to see"" and not ""what he can see"". The prime minister has just finished his press conference, where he gave further details of plans for the final step of Englandâs roadmap out of lockdown. This is due to take place on 19 July - although this will only be confirmed on 12 July. From step four: Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Some big questions remained unaswered today Parents in England whose kids are at home because someone in their class tested positive want to know when regular testing might replace isolation, but we have to await an update from the edication secretary tomorrow We don't yet know if double-vaccinated people will be released from an obligation to self-isolate if they were in contact with an infected person so long as they take daily tests. And an update  on travel won't come until later on the week - while many have put holidays abroad on hold. But above all else, there was no clear answer on how many lives are at risk from a mix of fewer restrictions and rising cases - and what level of mortality is acceptable. No10 has said there will be fresh modelling/data before a final decision to lift restrictions is taken next week, but it seems unlikely that the PM will backtrack now.   Bloomberg's Tim Ross asks whether the prime minister is worried about the Euro 2020 football matches triggering ""superspreader"" events. Boris Johnson says his advice is to support England ""enthusiastically but in a responsible way"". He adds that there are testing requirements for matches at Wembley. Sir Patrick Vallance says most spreading happens indoors in crowded spaces, which is also where most superspreading events have occurred. Ross asks the advisers how many excess deaths these relaxations are likely to cause. Vallance says the models done at the start of the roadmap are available, with more modelling due next week which will be made public. He says the modelling has been very accurate in terms of timings.

US firm considering counter offer for Morrisons,"A US investment firm is considering making a rival offer for Morrisons, days after the UK supermarket agreed to a Â£6.3bn ($8.7bn) takeover.

Didi says China app removal will affect business,"Didi is China's largest ride-hailing app China's biggest ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing has warned there will be an adverse impact on its revenues after its app was removed from Chinese stores. China's internet regulator ordered app stores to stop offering Didi's app on Sunday. It says the firm illegally collected users' personal data. It comes just days after the tech giant began selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The removal does not affect existing users, but will prevent new users registering on the country's biggest ride hailing platform. ""The company will strive to rectify any problems, improve its risk prevention awareness and technological capabilities, protect users' privacy and data security, and continue to provide secure and convenient services to its users,""Didi said in a statement,external. That came after the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said: ""After checks and verification, the Didi Chuxing app was found to be in serious violation of regulations in its collection and use of personal information."" Chinese ride-hailing giant makes $68bn US debut China ride-hailing giant in 'competition probe' China's tech giants fall under regulator's pressure Two days earlier, the CAC announced it was investigating the firm to protect ""national security and the public interest"", prompting Didi's shares to drop by 5.3%. Didi gathers vast amounts of real-time data every day. It uses some of the data for autonomous driving technologies and traffic analysis. Last week, China's answer to Uber made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange and at the end of Friday's trading had a market valuation of almost $74.5bn (Â£53.9bn). The company raised $4.4bn in the Initial Public Offering (IPO), in what was the biggest listing in the US by a Chinese company since Alibaba's debut in 2014. By Karishma Vaswani, Asia Presenter When I spoke to Didi Chuxing's founder Cheng Wei in 2018, the one thing that was apparent was that this was a man on a mission. He wanted to take the Chinese firm global, and to offer a new vision of what a company driven by data could make possible. ""We were born in China,"" he told me at his offices in Beijing during an interview for the BBC series, Asia's Tech Titans. ""But we hope to be a global company. We hope to be able to solve traffic and transportation problems for the world."" The huge ambition Cheng Wei displayed to me on the rooftop of his sprawling Beijing campus manifested itself in Didi's much-anticipated US IPO last week. But the environment in China today is very different from when I spoke to the Didi founder just a few years ago. There's tighter scrutiny now both inside and outside of China on Chinese tech firms. And Didi's troubles come against the backdrop of a broader crackdown on Chinese tech by regulators in the country - a crackdown, that some analysts have said, could be politically motivated as Beijing attempts to impose more control on the dynamic sector. What this means for both Didi and other Chinese tech firms is that this is likely to be just the start of their troubles. For those looking to list in the US - there will be more questions from investors on the regulatory outlook - which could mean a difficult and uncertain time going forward. Didi Chuxing, a platform similar to Uber or Lyft, arranges more than 20 million rides in China every day, on average. Founded in 2012, it is particularly popular in China's crowded cities. But it has expanded beyond China into 15 other markets. In June, the companyreported revenue of about 42.2bn yuan ($6.52bn),externalfor the three months to the end of March, with the vast majority of that coming from its China mobility business. China has recently moved to tighten up regulation of the country's large tech firms. The investigation follows regulatory crackdowns on other tech firms, from Alibaba to food delivery service Meituan. On Monday, the CAC also said that it plans to investigate the Chinese truck-hailing firm Full Truck Alliance (FTA). Like Didi, FTA recently made its New York Stock Exchange debut, raising $1.6bn.

Indian dowry payments remarkably stable: study,"Over 90% of couples live with the husband's family after marriage in India Dowry payments in India's villages have been largely stable over the past few decades, a World Bank study has found. Researchers looked at 40,000 marriages that took place in rural India between 1960 and 2008. They found that dowry was paid in 95% of the marriages even though it's been illegal in India since 1961. The practice, often described as a social evil, continues to thrive and leaves women vulnerable to domestic violence and even death. Paying and accepting dowry is a centuries-old tradition in South Asia where the bride's parents gift cash, clothes and jewellery to the groom's family. Thestudy,externalwas based on dowry data from 17 Indian states that contain 96% of India's population. It focussed on rural India since a majority of Indians continue to live in villages. Economists S Anukriti, Nishith Prakash and Sunghoh Kwon used information on value of gifts - cash and kind - received or given at the time of marriage. Poking fun at India's dowry problem Most Indians oppose interfaith marriage, study says They calculated ""net dowry"" as the difference between the value of gifts given by the bride's family to the groom or his family and those given by the groom's family to the bride's family. The groom's family had paid more to the bride's family in a very small number of marriages. They found the average net dowry had been ""remarkably stable"" over time, with some inflation before 1975 and after 2000. And the researchers found that a groom's family spends on average about 5,000 rupees ($67; Â£48) in real terms in gifts to the bride's family. The gifts from the bride's family, unsurprisingly, cost seven times more at about 32,000 rupees ($429). This implied an average real net dowry of 27,000 rupees ($361). Dowries consume a substantial proportion of household savings and income: in 2007, the average net dowry in rural India was equivalent to 14% of annual household income. ""As a share of income, dowry has gone down over time because on average rural incomes have risen in India,"" said Dr Anukriti, an economist at the World Bank Research Group. ""But this is just an average claim - to calculate how large dowry is relative to household income for each household, we will need data on household income or expenditure, but unfortunately we don't have such data available,"" she said. Nearly all marriages in India are monogamous Less than 1% end in divorce Parents play an important role in choosing the bride/groom - in more than 90% of marriages between 1960 and 2005, parents chose the spouse Over 90% of couples live with the husband's family after marriage Over 85% of women marry someone from outside their own village 78.3% of marriages are within the same district Source: Marriage Markets and the Rise of Dowry in India by Gaurav Chiplunkar and Jeffrey Weaver A lot has changed in India between 2008 and now. But researchers say the trends or patterns of dowry payments were not likely to be too different today in the absence of any ""dramatic changes or structural breaks in marriage markets, laws, human capital of men and women and women's labour market outcomes"". The study also found that dowry was prevalent in all major religious groups in India. Interestingly, Christians and Sikhs showed a ""striking increase in dowry"", leading to higher average dowries than Hindus and Muslims. Another interesting finding was the substantial differences in states over time. The southern state of Kerala showed a ""stark and persistent dowry inflation"" since the 1970s and had the highest average dowry in recent years, the study found. Other states such as Haryana, Punjab and Gujarat also registered inflation in dowry. On the other hand, average dowry decreased in states of Odisha (formerly Orissa), West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Dowry gifts come in cash and kind ""We don't have definitive answers about these differences. We hope to explore this question in future research,"" Dr Anukriti said. In apaper,externalpublished in January, economists Gaurav Chiplunkar and Jeffrey Weaver used data from more than 74,000 marriages in India over the last century to explain how the dowry system had evolved over time. The researchers found that the proportion of Indian marriages including dowry payments doubled between 1930 and 1975, and the average real value of dowry payments tripled. But post-1975, there was a decline in average dowry size. They estimated that the total value of dowry payments in India between 1950 and 1999 was nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars.

Didi says China app removal will impact business,"Didi is China's largest ride-hailing app China's biggest ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing has warned there will be an adverse impact on its revenues after its app was removed from Chinese stores. China's internet regulator ordered app stores to stop offering Didi's app on Sunday. It says the firm illegally collected users' personal data. It comes just days after the tech giant began selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The removal does not affect existing users, but will prevent new users registering on the country's biggest ride hailing platform. ""The company will strive to rectify any problems, improve its risk prevention awareness and technological capabilities, protect users' privacy and data security, and continue to provide secure and convenient services to its users,""Didi said in a statement,external. That came after the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said: ""After checks and verification, the Didi Chuxing app was found to be in serious violation of regulations in its collection and use of personal information."" Chinese ride-hailing giant makes $68bn US debut China ride-hailing giant in 'competition probe' China's tech giants fall under regulator's pressure Two days earlier, the CAC announced it was investigating the firm to protect ""national security and the public interest"", prompting Didi's shares to drop by 5.3%. Didi gathers vast amounts of real-time data every day. It uses some of the data for autonomous driving technologies and traffic analysis. Last week, China's answer to Uber made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange and at the end of Friday's trading had a market valuation of almost $74.5bn (Â£53.9bn). The company raised $4.4bn in the Initial Public Offering (IPO), in what was the biggest listing in the US by a Chinese company since Alibaba's debut in 2014. By Karishma Vaswani, Asia Presenter When I spoke to Didi Chuxing's founder Cheng Wei in 2018, the one thing that was apparent was that this was a man on a mission. He wanted to take the Chinese firm global, and to offer a new vision of what a company driven by data could make possible. ""We were born in China,"" he told me at his offices in Beijing during an interview for the BBC series, Asia's Tech Titans. ""But we hope to be a global company. We hope to be able to solve traffic and transportation problems for the world."" The huge ambition Cheng Wei displayed to me on the rooftop of his sprawling Beijing campus manifested itself in Didi's much-anticipated US IPO last week. But the environment in China today is very different from when I spoke to the Didi founder just a few years ago. There's tighter scrutiny now both inside and outside of China on Chinese tech firms. And Didi's troubles come against the backdrop of a broader crackdown on Chinese tech by regulators in the country - a crackdown, that some analysts have said, could be politically motivated as Beijing attempts to impose more control on the dynamic sector. What this means for both Didi and other Chinese tech firms is that this is likely to be just the start of their troubles. For those looking to list in the US - there will be more questions from investors on the regulatory outlook - which could mean a difficult and uncertain time going forward. Didi Chuxing, a platform similar to Uber or Lyft, arranges more than 20 million rides in China every day, on average. Founded in 2012, it is particularly popular in China's crowded cities. But it has expanded beyond China into 15 other markets. In June, the companyreported revenue of about 42.2bn yuan ($6.52bn),externalfor the three months to the end of March, with the vast majority of that coming from its China mobility business. China has recently moved to tighten up regulation of the country's large tech firms. The investigation follows regulatory crackdowns on other tech firms, from Alibaba to food delivery service Meituan. On Monday, the CAC also said that it plans to investigate the Chinese truck-hailing firm Full Truck Alliance (FTA). Like Didi, FTA recently made its New York Stock Exchange debut, raising $1.6bn. It had a market valuation of more than $20bn at the end of trading on Friday.
