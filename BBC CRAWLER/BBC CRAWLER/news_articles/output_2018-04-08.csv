"Hungary PM to be re-elected, results show","Viktor Orban (c) will be prime minister for a third time Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed a landslide victory in Sunday's general election. The 54-year-old will serve a third consecutive term in office, with his party Fidesz projected to win a two-thirds majority in parliament. Fidesz won almost half of the vote, with 93% of ballots counted, Hungary's National Election Office said. Mr Orban is a strong Eurosceptic who campaigned on an anti-immigration platform. In a speech to supporters on Sunday night, Mr Orban said his victory gave Hungarians ""the opportunity to defend themselves and to defend Hungary"". Leaders of the second and third-placed parties have resigned in light of the result. Polling stations were meant to close at 19:00 (17:00 GMT), but some stayed open hours later due to long queues. Voter turnout reached a near-record 69% - an outcome some believed would favour the prime minister's opponents. But with almost all votes counted, the nationalist Jobbik party is in second place with 20% of the vote. The Socialists are in third with 12%, and the LMP, Hungary's main Green Party, is in fourth with 7%. The man who thinks Europe is being invaded Nationalism in heart of Europe needles EU Jobbik's chairman Gabor Vona stood down on Sunday night, telling a news conference: ""Jobbik's goal, to win the elections and force a change in government, was not achieved. Fidesz won. It won again."" Socialist Party President Gyula Molnar was similarly downcast as he resigned, saying: ""We regard ourselves as responsible for what happened [and] we have acknowledged the decision of voters."" By the BBC's Budapest Correspondent Nick Thorpe As Fidesz paints the map of Hungary orange (their colour) once again, preliminary results show they will reach the 133 seats in the 199 seat Parliament needed for a constitutional two-thirds majority. They won two-thirds victories at both previous elections, in 2010 and 2014. The prime minister's party won in most rural constituencies and in provincial towns, while opposition parties took most seats in the capital, Budapest. Mr Orban's legitimacy on a European level will likely be strengthened, as nationalist parties across the continent take heart from his victory. There were only two consolation prizes for anti-Fidesz voters: most constituencies in the capital, Budapest, went to opposition candidates. And Fidesz have also lost a large part of the youth vote. The next Fidesz government can be expected to include younger ministers, in an attempt to address this problem. The result spells trouble ahead for civil society groups which campaign for human rights and against corruption, and for critical media. Viktor Orban has promised a ""settling of accounts - moral, politically, and legally"" with his opponents. The election campaign was dominated by immigration, with Mr Orban promising to defend the country's borders and block migration by Muslims. The prime minister refused to debate publicly with his opponents or speak to the independent media, speaking instead at rallies for his supporters. These addresses focused on one core policy - stopping immigration. ""Migration is like rust that slowly but surely would consume Hungary,"" Mr Orban said at his final rally on Friday. In 2015, Hungary built a fence along its borders with Serbia and Croatia to stop illegal migrants. Mr Orban hammered home his anti-immigration stance at a number of campaign rallies Mr Orban is an avowed Eurosceptic who opposes further EU integration. He refused to take part in the EU's refugee resettlement programme and has praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, tweeted Mr Orban her congratulations and said the ""mass immigration promoted by the EU has been rejected once again"". Hungary jails 'terrorist' over border riot Hungarian PM: Migrant crisis 'is a German problem' Mr Orban has promised to cut income taxes and pass pro-growth economic policies. His administration has presided over strong economic growth, which he had argued would be threatened under the opposition.

'Enough police' to tackle violence rise,"Falling police numbers are not to blame for rising violence and a new approach is needed, the home secretary has said. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Amber Rudd said evidence did not back up claims that reduced resources were the cause of more crime. Labour said police numbers were a factor and accused Ms Rudd of having her head ""stuck in the sand"". More than 50 people have been killed in violent attacks in London since the start of the year. In the latest incident, a woman was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder on Saturday night after a man wasstabbed outside Highbury and Islington stationin north London. On Monday the government will unveil a new strategy to tackle serious violence, including an  Offensive Weapons Bill for England and Wales, with new rules on the carrying of knives and acid. Woman held after man stabbed in London London killings: Why are they happening? Met 'has not lost control of streets' In her article, Ms Rudd said police numbers were rising in the early 2000s - when serious violent crimes were at their highest. But, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, the shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said Ms Rudd had ""stuck her head in the sand"" and that suggesting police numbers had little effect was ""a very naive position"". There have been more than 50 killings in London this year ""We've seen cuts to youth services, education, children's services and all these wrap around services that we know support our young people,"" she told the Andrew Marr programme. The government has defended its current policy on ""stop and search"", which Ms Rudd described as a ""vital policing tool"". Speaking on Andrew Marr, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC the government would consult on extending the powers of stop and search, so that those who may be carrying acid could also be searched by police. Mr Javid said there was ""a real problem"", but that the new weapons bill would make a ""big difference"" to the rate of crimes. Tough restrictions on online sales of knives - preventing them from being posted to residential addresses It would also become illegal to possess in private certain weapons such as zombie knives and knuckle-dusters A ban on the sale of the most dangerous corrosive products to under-18s A consultation on extending stop and search powers to enable the police to seize acid from people carrying it in public without good reason Making it an offence to possess a knife on a further education premises Ms Rudd said the government's new Serious Violence Strategy would ""radically change"" how the rising violence is addressed. Crime minister Victoria Atkins said it would be focused on education and prevention. ""So before a young person thinks of picking up a knife we want them to stop, to have the skills to say no, to be resilient,"" she told the BBC. No easy answers to London's killings Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales As well as introducing new laws and powers, Ms Rudd pledged to work with representatives from local government, health, education and industry to address the root causes of crime. She said the drug trade would be highlighted as a ""key driver"" of rising violence and pressure would be put on internet companies to clamp down on the incitement and glorification of violence on social media. Mo Timbo says there are many issues which lead young men to gang culture Mo Timbo - now a pastor in Hull - grew up in Peckham in south-east London. From the age of  14 he was heavily involved in gang culture, and sold drugs like cannabis and heroin. ""By the age of 19, I'd been stabbed, arrested several times and I found myself serving time in prison,"" he told Radio Humberside's James Hogarth. ""For the society I was part of, that seemed to be a very normal thing."" Mo agreed with Ms Rudd's assessment that falling police numbers may not be linked to the rise in violence. ""With more stop and searches and more police around, it almost sends a message out to the gangs that it's you against us. So we would stick together to the point where rival gangs would come together as a team against the police,"" he said. ""It's not down to one thing. There are so many deep issues we need to work on,"" he added. ""Look at the family - what happens in the household? (If) you're no longer finding that nurturing at home, you're finding it on the streets. I wouldn't say it's just down to angry young men.""

Berlin police arrest six over attack plot,"More than 30,000 runners took part in Sunday's half-marathon Berlin police have arrested six people who they suspect of ""preparing a grave city-endangering violent act"". The arrests, of people aged between 18 and 21, came amid German media reports of a knife attack being foiled against Sunday's half-marathon in the city. A police spokesman said on Sunday there was no conclusive evidence the run had been the target of the alleged plot. Police say a number of searches have been made, with some electronics seized for further examination. Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller thanked the city's security forces for preventing an ""impending attack with their vigilance and police work"". Die Welt newspaper earlier reported that one man detained had planned to mount a deadly knife attack on participants and spectators at the half-marathon. The newspaper reported that those arrested were suspected of having links to a Tunisian Islamist who killed 12 people in the city in a December 2016 truck attack. Sunday's police statement said that several addresses had been searched along with two vehicles. The police declined to give further details.

Radio 4 host 'incandescent with rage' over pay,"Montague left Today to join Radio 4's World At One last month BBC Radio 4 presenter Sarah Montague said she was ""incandescent with rage"" when she found out she was being paid less than her Today programme co-hosts. Montague wrote inThe Sunday Times,externalthat she felt her Â£133,000-a-year salary for Today, which she left last month, subsidised ""other people's lifestyles"". She was the only Today host that did not appear on the BBC's list of those earning Â£150,000 or more last July. A BBC spokeswoman said it was committed to closing its gender pay gap by 2020. She said the BBC compared favourably on the gender pay gap than ""virtually every broadcaster and newspaper group"". Before the BBC's top earners list was published last year, Montague said she suspected she was paid less than colleagues, but felt ""some moral high ground from taking less of the licence fee than others"". The list showed Today programme hosts John Humphrys earned between Â£600,000 and Â£649,000, Nick Robinson Â£250,000 to Â£299,000, Mishal Husain Â£200,000 to Â£249,000 and Justin Webb Â£150,000 to Â£199,999. ""What a fool I was,"" she wrote. ""I felt like a sap"". Montague, who moved to Radio 4's World At One programme last month, said her Â£133,000 wage for hosting Today was a ""very good wage for a job that I loved"". But she said she ""hadn't clocked just how professionally damaging it would feel"" to know she was earning less than her Today colleagues. Gender pay gap: Six things we've learnt What is the gender pay gap? John Humphrys defends 'jokey' pay gap remarks Some of the BBC's most high-profile female presenters have criticised the corporation for not closing the gender pay gap, whileformer BBC China editor Carrie Gracie resignedfrom her post early in 2018, citing pay discrimination. Montague, 52, said it never occurred to her that she would be paid less than male colleagues when she joined the corporation in 1997, as a news channel presenter. ""I had long suspected that I was paid much less than my colleagues but until the pay disclosures I had no idea of the scale of that difference,"" she wrote. ""Some years ago I was even assured by a manager that I was not the lowest paid on the programme."" The BBC,which has revealed a gender pay gap of 9.3%, compared with a national average of 18%, said it was introducing a ""clear and transparent pay framework"" in the future. It also said it had ""tougher targets for improvement on a shorter timescale"" compared to other broadcasters.

Politicians in 'idiot' row over poisoning,"A bitter row has broken out between Labour and the Conservatives over their language and response to the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Boris Johnson accused Jeremy Corbyn of refusing to ""unequivocally"" blame the Russian state, describing him as ""the Kremlin's useful idiot"". But Labour said Mr Johnson was the ""idiot"" having ""undermined his own government's position"" on the evidence. Moscow has denied the UK government's claim that it was behind the attack. Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Ex-spy 'improving rapidly' after poisoning The UK says there is ""no other plausible explanation"" for the incident, while Russia has accused Britain of  waging a ""propaganda war"" against it over the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, on 4 March. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, following Britain's initial expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mr Johnson said the Kremlin had made a ""cynical attempt to bury awkward facts beneath an avalanche of lies and disinformation"". He said the Russian government and state-owned media had invented 29 theories about the attack. ""There is only one thing that gives the Kremlin succour and lends false credibility to its propaganda onslaught. That is when politicians from the targeted countries join in,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Sadly, I am driven to the conclusion that Jeremy Corbyn has joined this effort ...Truly he is the Kremlin's useful idiot"". The health of Mr Skripal and his daughter are said to be improving Fellow Conservatives joined the attack on the Labour Leader. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC: ""There's no doubt when it comes up against this issue with Russia that we are having, this very serious issue, that Jeremy Corbyn has let the British people down."" And policing minister Nick Hurd said that while the phrase ""useful idiot"" was part of ""the lexicon of Johnson"", he added: ""I feel very strongly that Jeremy Corbyn has been insufficiently clear in his condemnation of Russia."" Labour has already called for an investigation into whether Mr Johnson misled the public about Russia's involvement, in his remarks about the findings of the UK's defence laboratory Porton Down. The party said that in an interview given to German TV last month, Mr Johnson said that ""people from Porton Down"" were ""absolutely categorical"", adding: ""I asked the guy myself. I said 'are you sure?', and he said 'there's no doubt'."" But last week, the Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson is the government's useful idiot because what he's done is create a situation where he has contradicted the evidence and overstepped the mark. ""Porton Down have been absolutely clear that they didn't say what Boris Johnson said."" She said that Mr Johnson had ""driven a wedge for the Russians to say there are questions on the evidence."" ""I think that is really dangerous, that we have got a foreign secretary that undermines his own government's position."" The UK has refused to grant Viktoria Skripal a visa to visit Britain Labour says Mr Corbyn ""has repeatedly said the evidence points to Russia being responsible, directly or indirectly, and that the Russian authorities must be held to account on the basis of evidence"". On Saturday, the Foreign Office described a Russian request for a meeting with Mr Johnson on the Salisbury poisoning as a ""diversionary tactic"". Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy has also requested a meeting with Scotland Yard over its handling of the suspected murder of Russian businessman Nikolay Glushkov. Mr Glushkov was found dead in his home in New Malden, south London, on 12 March. Four days later the Met launched a murder investigation and an inquest heard the 68-year-old's cause of death was compression to the neck. ""For Russia this murder has a criminal as well as political dimension,"" an embassy spokesman said. ""Almost a month has passed since Mr Glushkov's death, and like ... with Sergei and Yulia Skripal, the British side provided no information."" Mr Glushkov was a close friend of outspoken President Putin critic Boris Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch found hanged at his Berkshire home in 2013. The Met made no comment. The requests followed Russian Embassy criticism of the UK government's refusal - on immigration rules - to grant a visa to Ms Skripal's cousin, Viktoria Skripal, to visit Britain. The embassy says the refusal to allow Viktoria Skripal to visit her cousin and uncle was ""disappointing"" and ""politically motivated"". Mr Skripal was jailed by Russia for spying for Britain, but released as part of a spy swap between the US and Russia in 2010. Yulia was visiting him in the UK when the attack happened on 4 March. She is now conscious and talking in hospital. Salisbury District Hospital has said Mr Skripal is responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"".

Late prostate cancer diagnosis 'worries',"Four in 10 prostate cancer cases in the UK are diagnosed late, a study suggests. The report by charityOrchid,externalfound a ""worrying trend"" of late diagnosis with 37% of prostate cancer cases diagnosed at stages three and four. It comes as ministers announced extra funding for prostate cancer research. InFebruary figures showedthe number of men dying from prostate cancer had overtaken female deaths from breast cancer for the first time in the UK. With an aging population, the charity has called for urgent action to prevent a ""ticking time bomb in terms of prostate cancer provision"". Orchid chief executive Rebecca Porta said: ""With prostate cancer due to be the most prevalent cancer in the UK within the next 12 years, we are facing a potential crisis in terms of diagnostics, treatment and patient care. Urgent action needs to be taken now."" The report canvassed the opinion of the UK's leading prostate cancer experts and looked at previously published data to get a picture of the prostate cancer care across the UK. The data came from organisations such as NHS England, charities and the National Prostate Cancer Audit. The report says that 42% of prostate cancer patients saw their GP with symptoms twice or more before they were referred, with 6% seen five or more times prior to referral. Prof Frank Chinegwundoh, a urological surgeon at Bart's Health NHS Trust said: ""25% of prostate cancer cases in the UK are diagnosed at an advanced stage. ""This compares to just 8% in the US where there is greater public awareness of prostate cancer and greater screening,"" he added. He said while there was controversy over the effectiveness of the standard PSA test used to detect the cancer, ""it is still vital that patients are diagnosed early to assess if they need treatment or not as advanced prostate cancer is incurable"". The report also said there needed to be renewed efforts to develop better testing methods. prostate cancer is diagnosed by using the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, biopsies and physical examinations there can be few symptoms of prostate cancer in the early stages, and because of its location most symptoms are linked to urination needing to urinate more often, especially at night needing to run to the toilet difficulty in starting to urinate weak urine flow or taking a long time while urinating feeling your bladder has not emptied fully men with prostate cancer can also live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment because the disease often progresses very slowly The PSA test is available free to any man aged 50 or over who requests it, but the report said this can ""create inequity"" with tests being taken up by ""more highly educated men in more affluent areas"". Prof Anne Mackie, director of programmes for the UK National Screening Committee, said the test was not offered universally because it was not very good at predicting which men have cancer. ""It will miss some cancers and often those cancers that are picked up when using the PSA test are not harmful,"" she explained. ""Treatment for prostate cancer can cause nasty side effects so we need to be sure we are treating the right men and the right cancers. ""There is a lot of research into screening and treatment for prostate cancer and the committee, along with NICE and the NHS, is keeping a close eye on the evidence as it develops,"" she added. A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""NHS England is working closely with leading clinical experts to bring the latest research on prostate cancer into practice. Targeted work is also being undertaken to ensure prostate cancer is diagnosed quickly and that everyone receives the best care wherever they live across the country."" On the day the study was published, the government announced a Â£75m five-year funding package for research into the condition. The new studies will particularly target higher risk groups including black men - one in four of whom will develop the disease - as well as men aged 50 or over and men with a family history of prostate cancer. Over 40,000 patients will be recruited for more than 60 studies in prostate cancer, to test treatments including more precise radiotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryotherapy, alongside supportive interventions including exercise and dietary advice. This new research drive comes as 'one stop cancer shops' are being piloted in ten areas to catch cancer early and speed up diagnosis, particularly for those suffering with less obvious symptoms.

Reed wins Masters as McIlroy fades,"This video can not be played Masters 2018: Patrick Reed holds nerve to beat rivals and win Masters Masters final leaderboard -15P Reed (US);-14R Fowler (US);-13J Spieth (US);-11J Rahm (Sp);-9C Smith (Aus), B Watson (US), H Stenson (Swe), R McIlroy (NI);-8M Leishman (Aus);-7T Finau (US), D Johnson (US);-6C Hoffman (US), J Rose (Eng), L Oosthuizen (SA) Selected others: -5P Casey (Eng);-4T Fleetwood (Eng), J Thomas (US);+1T Woods(US);+2P Mickelson (US);+3M Fitzpatrick (Eng);+4T Hatton (Eng), I Poulter (Eng) Patrick Reed held off fellow Americans Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler to claim his first major title with a one-shot win at the Masters at Augusta. The world number 24, who had been ahead since the second round, led Rory McIlroy by three shots overnight. McIlroy, chasing his first Green Jacket to complete the Grand Slam, faded with a two-over 74, while Reed parred the last to shoot 71 and win on 15 under. Fowler (67) ended second, one ahead of Spieth, who had nine birdies in a 64. Reed, 27, said: ""I knew it was going to be tough. ""Any time trying to close off a golf tournament is really hard but to close off my first major at a place that's so close to me, being where I went to college, means so much. Woods will captain the US team at the 2019 Presidents Cup ""I knew the lead would shrink and grow - it's just the flows of golf, you have to know how to handle it and the way I could get that done was to make sure the putter was working. ""Just to make par on the last and to watch the ball go in the hole and know that I've won my first major - to finish off that drought - meant so much to me."" This video can not be played Masters 2018: Patrick Reed presented with green jacket at Augusta The scene was set for a classic duel between the final pair, Reed and McIlroy, with expectations for a repeat of their epic match at the2016 Ryder Cup,which the American shaded by one hole. But the 28-year-old Northern Irishman, who surged into contention with a bogey-free 65 on Saturday, cut a disconsolate figure and he was the only one of the top 16 to return an over-par final round. ""I played probably some of the best golf I've ever played here - it just wasn't meant to be,"" said McIlroy, who has won four majors, the last of them the 2014 PGA Championship. ""I think 100% I can come back and win here. I've played in two final groups in the last seven years, I've had five top-10s, I play this golf course well. I just haven't played it well enough at the right times."" Although it was not the collapse of 2011 when hesquandered a four-shot leadwith a final round of 80, McIlroy was unable to produce his sparkling best and made only one birdie in the closing 14 holes. This video can not be played 'I didn't put enough pressure on Reed' Reed is the ninth first-time major winner in the past 12 Masters and all four major championships are now held by Americans - all of whom are aged 27 or under. Spieth won last year'sOpen,Brooks Koepka theUS Openand Justin Thomas theUS PGA Championship. Both Reed and McIlroy hit errant drives at the opening hole but, while Reed dropped a shot, McIlroy saved his par. They could have been level at the second when McIlroy hit a majestic second to four feet at the par five and Reed found the bunker. But McIlroy missed his eagle chance and then missed the green at the third to drop a shot, while Reed rattled in a putt from the fringes of the green for a birdie to regain his three-shot advantage. Another imperious iron shot from McIlroy to three feet set up a birdie at the par three fourth but he missed another short putt at the next to fall three shots back again. Twice Reed followed bogeys with birdies as he combated the challenge of the world number seven. This video can not be played Masters 2018: Jordan Spieth sinks a ninth birdie to keep pressure on Patrick Reed However, there were challenges coming from further down the leaderboard. Spieth, who began nine shots behind Reed, had five birdies in his opening nine holes and claimed sole possession of second place on 11 under when he holed from off the green at the 12th. The Texan almost followed it with an eagle at the par-five 13th after a superb iron to 12 feet from the pine straw but his putt stayed right and he tapped in for birdie. Reed moved two clear again when he rolled in a 22-foot birdie putt from the back of the 12th green but Spieth was soon tied at the top, with birdies on the 15th and 16th - the latter a 33-foot putt. However, Reed regained the lead with a birdie from eight feet at the 14th. The roar that greeted Spieth's putt on 16 in comparison to Reed's on 14 gave a clear indication of who the Augusta National patrons wanted to win. In fact, right from the first tee, the fans appeared to be siding more with McIlroy than Reed and once they realised the Northern Irishman was fading, they cheered every change to the leaderboard that favoured Spieth, or indeed Fowler, over the man who went to university in Georgia. BBC Radio 5 live commentator John Murray pointed out that there were groans around the 15th green and 16th tee when Spieth's bogey at the last was registered on one of the on-course leaderboards. Reed was about to putt for par on the 15th at the time. And when Reed walked on to the 18th green the BBC's Iain Carter noted the reception was ""respectful"" rather than the ""whooping and hollering"" normally reserved for a champion in waiting. Spieth had needed a par at the last to equal the course record but his final drive clipped a tree and went only 177 yards, leaving him 267 to the green, which took him another two shots. He then missed an eight-foot par putt to set the clubhouse target at 13 under. Fowler, playing in the penultimate group and like Reed searching for a first major, came closest to usurping his compatriot, with six birdies in his final 11 holes. While the crowd were captivated by the thrilling charge from Spieth, the slightly built 29-year-old Fowler, who was five off the lead going into the final round, quietly moved up the leaderboard. Birdies on the 12th, 13th and 15th holes pushed him to 13 under. The world number nine, who added second place at the Masters to runner-up finishes at the US Open and The Open, sent his approach to seven feet for a birdie at the last to set the clubhouse target, but Reed, who played the final seven holes in two under, calmly negotiated the 18th to take the coveted Green Jacket. Casey made the cut on the number at five over Justin Roseconceded he had ""a nearly week"" after finishing as the leading Englishman, making six birdies in a final round 69 to tie for 12th. He told BBC Sport: ""I got some momentum going and saw some signs I was going to make some putts but at Augusta if you're one or two yards out you go from hero to zero. ""I find it amazing that the winner normally comes out of the last group because I think it's a golf course where a huge comeback is possible."" Paul Caseywas also in sight of the Augusta National course record of 63, jointly held by Nick Price (1986) and Greg Norman (1996). The 40-year-old, who won the Valspar Championship last month, was five over after two rounds to make the cut on the number. He played his first 15 holes in nine under and needed one more birdie in the final three for the record, but he bogeyed the last two for a 65 and finished in a share of 15th on five under. Tommy Fleetwoodbogeyed two of the final four holes for a 74 and finished joint 17th with PGA champion and world number twoJustin Thomason four under. Matt Fitzpatrickhad two double bogeys in a 75 and share of 38th at three over. Ian Poulter,who won last week in Houston to earn his place at Augusta, had seven birdies in a closing 69 and finished four over alongsideTyrrell Hatton,who had six birdies in his 70 to compensate for a double bogey at the 15th. This video can not be played Masters 2018: Charley Hoffman sinks a stunning hole-in-one Tony Finau,who dislocated an ankle in exuberant celebration of a hole-in-one in Wednesday's par-three competition, rolled in six consecutive birdies from the 12th to finish at seven under. The solitary hole-in-one in the main event came from fellow AmericanCharley Hoffman,who made the 20th ace at the 16th in Masters history and he ended in a tie for 12th. Four-time championTiger Woods,who won the last of his 14 major titles 10 years ago, completed his first four rounds at a major since the 2015 Masters with an eagle at the 15th in a round of 69 for a share of 32nd on one over par. World number 18Phil Mickelson,three times a Masters champion, also eagled the 15th, having made an eagle at the eighth on Saturday, and finished a fluctuating week with a 67 and a two over total for a share of 36th. There were a total of 19 sub-70 rounds on the final day, but Reed's 71 ensured that no player has yet compiled a week of four rounds in the 60's in the history of the Masters.

Deutsche Bank boss to step downThe German bank has reported losses in the three years under British chief executive John Cryan.5m5 minutes agoBusiness,"On his way out... but Deutsche Bank said John Cryan had ""laid the groundwork for a successful future of the bank"" Deutsche Bank has dismissed its chief executive John Cryan amid continued losses at Germany's biggest lender. After taking over in 2015, British-born Mr Cryan, 57, has battled the fallout from a series of scandals as well as three years of reported losses. Co-deputy chief executive Christian Sewing, 47, will take over as chief executive immediately. The shake-up was announced after an emergency meeting that ended late on Sunday night. Mr Cryan's contract was due to run until 2020. Deutsche chairman Paul Achleitner said Mr Cryan had ""laid the groundwork for a successful future of the bank"" despite his ""relatively short tenure"" as chief executive. Mr Sewing, who has been with the bank for his entire career, had been responsible for its private and commercial bank operations. Some analysts say his appointment suggests a strategic shift towards retail banking in its home market. Deutsche Bank has grappled with falling revenues and its share price has sunk by close to a third this year. Shares rose more than 3% in Frankfurt on Monday. The search to replace Mr Cryan is understood to have begunafter the bank reported an annual loss of â¬500m,external(Â£436m) at the end of February. That followed losses of â¬6.8bn in 2015 and â¬1.4bn in 2016. Mr Cryan was appointed as co-chief executive in July 2015 to overhaul the bank following a number of regulatory problems stretching back to before the financial crisis. The Sunderland-born banker was also tasked with controlling the lender's spiralling costs and quickly cut thousands of jobs. But after becoming sole chief executive in 2016, Deutsche continued to struggle, largely because of a slump in its investment banking division which accounts for more than half of sales. In resolving its legal difficulties, it also incurred a series of heavy penalties, including a$7.2bn (Â£5.9bn) payment to US authoritiesin 2016 over an investigation into mortgage-backed securities. At that time, it was considered to bethe most dangerous bank in the worldafter the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that a potential collapse of Deutsche posed the biggest risk to the stability of the global financial system. Also in June 2016, Deutsche's US division failed a stress test conducted by the US Federal Reserve. Deutsche and Santander's US unit were the only two of 33 banks to fail the test, which assessed how they would perform in a financial crisis. Markus Riesselmann, an analyst at Independent Research, said Mr Cryan ""had to battle serious problems that his predecessors swept under the rug for years"". ""He's largely cleared those up and now it looks like Deutsche can't turn things around regarding margins, but I doubt a new chief executive could successfully make that transition. It seems rather to be a fundamental 'Deutsche Bank problem',"" he added. Christian Sewing has been described as strong and disciplined Mr Achleitner said Mr Sewing had proved to be a ""strong and disciplined leader""  in his more than 25 years at Deutsche. ""The supervisory board is convinced that he and his team will be able to successfully lead Deutsche Bank into a new era. We trust in the great ability of this bank and its many talents."" Deutsche Bank also said the co-head of its corporate and investment banking, Marcus Schenck, will leave.

Berlin police arrest six over attack plotThey say there is no conclusive evidence that Sunday's half-marathon was the target.10m10 minutes agoEurope,"More than 30,000 runners took part in Sunday's half-marathon Berlin police have arrested six people who they suspect of ""preparing a grave city-endangering violent act"". The arrests, of people aged between 18 and 21, came amid German media reports of a knife attack being foiled against Sunday's half-marathon in the city. A police spokesman said on Sunday there was no conclusive evidence the run had been the target of the alleged plot. Police say a number of searches have been made, with some electronics seized for further examination. Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller thanked the city's security forces for preventing an ""impending attack with their vigilance and police work"". Die Welt newspaper earlier reported that one man detained had planned to mount a deadly knife attack on participants and spectators at the half-marathon. The newspaper reported that those arrested were suspected of having links to a Tunisian Islamist who killed 12 people in the city in a December 2016 truck attack. Sunday's police statement said that several addresses had been searched along with two vehicles. The police declined to give further details.

Radio 4 host 'incandescent with rage' over payRadio 4's Sarah Montague has written of her fury after finding out she was paid less than co-hosts.8h8 hours agoUK,"Montague left Today to join Radio 4's World At One last month BBC Radio 4 presenter Sarah Montague said she was ""incandescent with rage"" when she found out she was being paid less than her Today programme co-hosts. Montague wrote inThe Sunday Times,externalthat she felt her Â£133,000-a-year salary for Today, which she left last month, subsidised ""other people's lifestyles"". She was the only Today host that did not appear on the BBC's list of those earning Â£150,000 or more last July. A BBC spokeswoman said it was committed to closing its gender pay gap by 2020. She said the BBC compared favourably on the gender pay gap than ""virtually every broadcaster and newspaper group"". Before the BBC's top earners list was published last year, Montague said she suspected she was paid less than colleagues, but felt ""some moral high ground from taking less of the licence fee than others"". The list showed Today programme hosts John Humphrys earned between Â£600,000 and Â£649,000, Nick Robinson Â£250,000 to Â£299,000, Mishal Husain Â£200,000 to Â£249,000 and Justin Webb Â£150,000 to Â£199,999. ""What a fool I was,"" she wrote. ""I felt like a sap"". Montague, who moved to Radio 4's World At One programme last month, said her Â£133,000 wage for hosting Today was a ""very good wage for a job that I loved"".

John Humphrys defends 'jokey' pay gap remarks Some of the BBC's most high-profile female presenters have criticised the corporation for not closing the gender pay gap, whileformer BBC China editor Carrie Gracie resignedfrom her post early in 2018, citing pay discrimination. Montague, 52, said it never occurred to her that she would be paid less than male colleagues when she joined the corporation in 1997, as a news channel presenter. ""I had long suspected that I was paid much less than my colleagues but until the pay disclosures I had no idea of the scale of that difference,"" she wrote. ""Some years ago I was even assured by a manager that I was not the lowest paid on the programme."" The BBC,which has revealed a gender pay gap of 9.3%, compared with a national average of 18%, said it was introducing a ""clear and transparent pay framework"" in the future. It also said it had ""tougher targets for improvement on a shorter timescale"" compared to other broadcasters.

The 18-year-old was found injured in Link Street, the Met Police said Six people have been killed in shootings and stabbings in London in the past seven days, prompting the city's mayor Sadiq Khan to back the use of ""targeted""stop-and-search in the capital.

Rayner frustrated by anti-Semitism action,"Labour frontbencher Angela Rayner said she has been ""a little frustrated"" with the speed at which the party has responded to a report on anti-Semitism. The shadow education secretary said Jeremy Corbyn had been ""quite clear"" there was no place for anti-Semitism. But she said it was not right when action against ""anti-Semitic rhetoric"" was ""far too slow"" by all parties. TheChakrabarti report,externalfound Labour was not overrun by anti-Semitism but noted an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". The 2016 inquiry made 20 recommendations, including procedural changes to improve the party's disciplinary process and the appointment of a lawyer to give advice on issues including disciplinary matters and to take responsibility for instructing external lawyers. Labour row: Jewish leaders agree to meeting Corbyn apologises for 'hurt' caused by anti-Semitism Momentum says Labour 'failed' on anti-Semitism Last week the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council saidin an open letter to Labour MPsthere has been a ""repeated institutional failure"" to properly address anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn said last week that he recognised that anti-Semitism had ""surfaced"" in the party and said he was ""sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused"" and pledged to ""redouble my efforts"" to tackle it. Ms Rayner told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that Labour's incoming general secretary Jennie Formby had made the issue her priority and Mr Corbyn had been clear on the issue. But she added: ""I've been a little frustrated that we haven't moved forward on the Chakrabarti report as fast was I would've liked to have seen."" ""We need to make sure that the full Chakrabarti report is implemented and that we have an absolute zero tolerance. ""It can't be right when people see on social media - and it's not just the Labour Party but across the board - anti-Semitic rhetoric and they see no action taken or that action is far too slow."" Several Labour MPs, including Luciana Berger, attended an anti-Semitism protest outside Parliament Asked about last week's meeting of the Bristol West Labour Party, in which MP Thangam Debbonaire was reportedlyheckled for attending a protest,externalagainst anti-Semitism in the party, Ms Rayner said:  ""I wasn't at the meeting but what I can tell you is Thangam is an absolute credit to the Labour Party...  So Thangam is doing a fantastic job, she shouldn't be hounded out of any meeting. Meanwhile Ms Rayner's shadow cabinet colleague Andrew Gwynne had said there is ""absolutely no place"" in the Labour Party for anti-Semitism, after The Sunday Telegraph reported that he was a member of a Labour supporters' Facebook page where offensive remarks were posted. Denton and Reddish MP Mr Gwynne said: ""I was added to this Facebook group without my knowledge or permission. ""I do not support the posts and I abhor anti-Semitism. It has absolutely no place in the Labour Party or in society. End of."" Former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that Labour's ""vastly increased membership"" meant ""you have got a few that are causing problems"". She added: ""There is no doubt that there are people who are guilty of anti-Semitic actions and words and so on who are pretending that it is only because they are really just good little left-wingers. ""I think that's disgraceful and it brings them - but unfortunately other people around them - into disrepute and it's incredibly unfair."" But Derby North MP Chris Williamson told the programme: ""We know that anti-Semitism does exist on the Left. I've got to say I've not come across it inside the Labour Party, I think it's more on the outer fringes of left-wing organisations outside the Labour Party."" A demonstration, led by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, was held outside the Labour Party Head Office in central London on Sunday.

UK wife-carrying champion crowned,"This video can not be played UK wife-carrying champion crowned in Dorking Couples from across the world braved swamps and bogs on a treacherous course in the 11th UK Wife Carrying Race. Chris Hepworth, carrying Tanisha Prince, of West Drayton, London, raced to victory in the contest over a 1250ft (380m) obstacle course in Surrey. Organisers suggested the activity of wife-carrying began in June 793 AD. They said Vikings carried ""wenches"" in a practice that lasted for 300 years and was reborn after 900 years - and some people took it ""very seriously"". Competitors faced a 49ft (15m) ascent and descent on the course, described as ""very tough"" by organisers. Information for competitors said: ""You do not have to be married (to each other, anyway) but it certainly helps if you are at least friends."" The race covers a 380m obstacle course with an ascent and a descent Chris Hepworth, carrying Tanisha Prince, raced to victory Under the rules, all ""wives"" - who can be male or female over the age of 18 - had to weigh at least 50kg and there were penalties for dropping the ""wife"". Any underweight candidates had a rucksack of tinned baked beans to add to the load. Winner Mr Hepworth said he was ""surprised and chuffed"" and his ""wife"" Ms Prince said for her the uphill climb was easier than going downhill. They will go on to compete in the world contest in Finland in July. ""Maybe we can be the ones to win it,"" Mr Hepworth said. The event was sold out, with up to 50 people taking part Organisers warned of the serious injuries participants risked, saying:  ""Wife carrying can be a dangerous activity, which can lead to any one or more of the following injuries: slipped disk, broken legs and arms, spinal damage, facial injury, skull fracture, hernias, and other sundry injuries and illnesses, and potentially including death. ""But please don't let this put you off!"" Ben and Hannah Brackenbury entered the contest to mark their first wedding anniversary. Mrs Brackenbury said: ""It's got to be done."" Her husband said: ""I was away for the weekend. I got a message saying am I free on that day. ""I thought she'd booked us in for a spa or something. Next thing I get home and she says I've entered us into the UK wife-carrying competition."" The couple said they practised in the garden and in the rain, and tried some jumps in preparation for getting over hay bales. Ben and Hannah Brackenbury entered the contest to mark their first wedding anniversary Several holds were recognised in the contest The winner received a barrel of local ale while last place was awarded the ""ceremonial"" Pot Noodle and dog food. Recognised holds included the bridal carry, the piggy back, the shoulder-ride, the fireman's carry and what was dubbed the Estonian hold - where the wife hangs upside down on the husband's back with legs crossed in front of the face. The Dorking hold was described as the reverse of the Estonian hold. The winning couple will go on to compete in Finland The Estonian hold was said to be ""very fast"" and the Dorking hold ""not so fast"" The world contest takes place in Finland in July Fancy a go at wife-carrying?

Hamilton up for record Olivier haul,"This video can not be played Hamilton won seven awards, including best actor in a musical for Giles Terera Hip hop musical Hamilton has swept the board at the Olivier Awards, picking up seven gongs from its 13 nominations. It equals Matilda's 2012 record for most Olivier Awards won by a musical. The West End production of Lin-Manuel Miranda's show about US founding father Alexander Hamilton won best new musical and outstanding achievement in music. But its creator had to stay away from the London awards, the biggest event in the UK theatrical calendar, having been diagnosed with shingles. All the winners and nominees Olivier Awards 2018: What else happened? Hamilton opened in London late last year It was also a good night for The Ferryman, which picked up three awards. The drama, set in rural County Armagh in 1981, against the backdrop of The Troubles, won best new play and best director for Sam Mendes, while Laura Donnelly was named best actress. Laura Donnelly received the best actress award for her starring role in The Ferryman Miranda was jointly awarded the outstanding achievement in music prize with orchestrator Alex Lacamoire. He sent Lacamoire a list of thank yous - set to the music of My Favourite Things - to sing to the audience at the show, at the Royal Albert Hall, on his behalf. Giles Terera, who won best actor in a musical for his role as Hamilton's nemesis Aaron Burr, said he was ""relieved, elated and happy"" that Hamilton had done so well. ""We didn't take anything for granted,"" he said. ""But I'm glad we got recognised."" ""Every now and then there's a show that comes along and it shifts things, moves it outside the realm of musical theatre,"" he added, putting Hamilton alongside other great musicals like West Side Story, Les MisÃ©rables and Rent. Jamael Westman, who stars as Alexander Hamilton, said the show - which opened in London late last year - was ""breaking down barriers, it's breaking down the understanding we have of musical theatre"". He added: ""This is re-imagining what it can be, using the hip-hop form and more contemporary types of song and the use of language that is almost Shakespearean. ""It's changing the way that we see theatre and is breaking boundaries. That's why it's been recognised."" Hamilton's other awards include best supporting actor in a musical Michael Jibson, who plays King George III (in a performance that sees him on stage for just eight minutes), as well as best theatre choreographer, best lighting design and best sound design. Despite being the biggest winner of the night, it failed to break the record for most Olivier Awards set by Harry Potter and the Cursed Child last year when it picked up nine. Giles Terera, winner of the best actor in a musical award for Hamilton, alongside Sir Cameron Mackintosh and co-star Michael Jibson, winner of the best actor in a supporting role Jez Butterworth wrote The Ferryman based on the experiences of his partner Donnelly's family in Northern Ireland. Picking up the best new play award, Butterworth said: ""It's her story. I stayed in with a gin and tonic and she had to go out to work. I knew how much that cost her and how much this will mean."" After picking up her own award, Donnelly - who played widow Caitlin in the original production - said: ""I'm thrilled - but I'm in shock. It's what I dreamt of from childhood so to get to this point is surreal."" She said because of the subject matter, she felt a ""weight of responsibility I hadn't in any other job to do it justice, because it was so close to home."" The couple are taking The Ferryman to Broadway later this year. Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston took the best actor prize for Network for his portrayal of Howard Beale in the National Theatre production. In his acceptance speech, he said he was grateful to be working in a country that funds the arts, adding: ""Hopefully that will continue."" Speaking backstage, he added: ""To support children's imagination and their ability to grow in a social, emotional way, [the arts are] more important than learning the dates of a war."" Former Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston won the best actor award for his performance in Network Other highlights of the ceremony, hosted by Catherine Tate, included: Bertie Carvel being named best actor in a supporting role for Ink James Graham winning best new comedy for Labour of Love Stephen Sondheim's Follies winning best musical revival Killology winning outstanding achievement in affiliate theatre Dick Whittington winning the Olivier for best entertainment and family show Denise Gough was named best supporting actress for Angels in America. Gough was not there to collect her award, but in a statement read by actress Ophelia Lovibond, she highlighted the importance of the Time's Up movement. Several actresses brought feminist activists as their guests, and many others wore Time's Up and 50/50 pins or rings to show their support. Angels in America also won best revival, with director Marianne Elliott saying: ""No one thought we could do this. It's a monolith of a play. This is extraordinary - it's the proudest I've ever been."" Bob Dylan-inspired musical Girl from the North Country was also honoured, with Shirley Henderson winning best actress in a musical and Sheila Atim winning best supporting role in a musical. Shirley Henderson being helped on to the stage by Cuba Gooding Jr Atim seemed genuinely shocked by her win. ""Guys, guys - this is mental!"" she said. One of the first people she thanked was Bob Dylan, ""for writing this stuff before I was born"". Sheila Atim thanked the women of colour who had won Olivier Awards before her She then thanked women of colour who had won Olivier Awards before her. ""To me, it is very, very important. I really hope - especially with Time's Up and the 50/50 movement - that there will be more women who look like me up here."" Shirley Henderson said it felt ""crazy"" to win, and that the script for Girl From the North Country had been ""everything I'd been looking for, for a long time"" - having not been on the stage for 17 years. David Lan won the special award in recognition of his outstanding contribution for his artistic directorship of the Young Vic. Performances included one from past stars of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat - including Jason Donovan and Lee Mead - to mark the 50th anniversary of the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical.

German suspect 'had mental health issues',"Police stand outside the building where the driver reportedly lived The man suspected of carrying out a van attack in MÃ¼nster was a lone German who suffered mental health problems, the state interior minister has said. Authorities have searched four homes associated with the suspect, and said they have found ""no clues"" pointing to an extremist or political motive. Two people were killed when a van was driven into a restaurant terrace area of the west German city on Saturday. The 48-year-old driver shot and killed himself after hitting diners. He has been identified in German media as Jens R - prosecutors say he was known to police. In 2015 and 2016, he had faced allegations of making threats, damaging property, a hit-and-run traffic accident and fraud, all of which were dropped. Well-wishers left flowers, candles and a sign asking ""why?"" at the scene of the attack ""The person in focus had [psychological] abnormalities"" that needed careful investigation, regional interior minister Herbert Reul said after placing flowers at the scene of the attack. He said there was no evidence linking the suspect to Islamist militancy, and that he was not a refugee. How Germany van incident unfolded online ""We are assuming the motives and origins [of the crime] lie within the perpetrator himself,"" Hajo Kuhlisch, chief of local police told reporters. The victims were a 51-year-old woman from near LÃ¼neburg, in the north of the country, and a 65-year-old man from Borken, near MÃ¼nster. Some 20 others were injured. MÃ¼nster's mayor Markus Lewe (L) and federal interior minister Horst Seehofer (2nd r) paid tribute at the scene of the crime ""We now know it was in all likelihood a lone perpetrator, a German,"" Mr Reul said. Prosecutors said there had been three criminal proceedings against him in MÃ¼nster, and one in the city of Ansbach dating back to 2015 and 2016. ""We have no indications of a politically motivated background [for the crime]"", senior prosecutor Elke Adomeit said. The van used in the attack on Saturday was removed in the night Although officials have provided few details, the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that the man lived just 2km (1.2 miles) from the restaurant. A vehicle, reportedly a grey VW van, was driven into a tourist square in the 300,000-population city at 15:27 local time (13:27 GMT) on Saturday. Eyewitnesses said it was driven at speed and photographs of the aftermath showed tables and chairs strewn across a restaurant terrace area. A bang was heard and people screamed, one cafe employee told local media. Daniel Kollenberg, who witnessed the aftermath, told the BBC: ""I think it is a deliberate attack because it's not allowed for cars to go in this area."" Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement that she was ""deeply shaken"" by the incident. ""Everything possible is now being done to clarify the facts and to support the victims and their relatives,"" she said. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted in French and German, saying his country was suffering with Germany. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Canada mourns ice hockey crash dead,"This video can not be played The names of the victims were read out at the service Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has attended a vigil to honour the 15 killed in a crash involving a bus carrying a junior ice hockey team. Canada has seen an outpouring of grief following Friday's collision. Ten players on the Humboldt Broncos team, aged between 16 and 21, died when their team bus collided with a semi-trailer in Saskatchewan. Police are still trying to determine the reason for the crash. The lorry's driver was not hurt. Hockey teams from around the country paid tribute to the dead during weekend fixtures. Many have pledged donations to support their families and the surviving players. Online fundraising pages have raised millions of dollars. Aerial photographs of the scene showed the scale of the collision with heavy damage to the coach (right) There were 29 people on the team's bus when the crash happened around 17:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Friday. That number includes players, coaching staff and the driver. Fifteen were confirmed dead by officials on Sunday. Fourteen people were also injured in the crash. Head coach Darcy Haugan, 42, was among the first confirmed casualties.

One team member's father, Tom Straschnitzki, said his son Ryan was in hospital with a serious back injury and that he could not feel his legs. The family flew to his bedside on Saturday. ""He keeps asking about his team and coaches,"" Mr Straschnitzki told the BBC from his home in Airdrie, Alberta. ""I say: 'I don't know son'."" The lorry and bus collided on Highway 35, north of Tisdale. The team had been heading to the town of Nipawin for a play-off game. Aerial photographs of the crash site show it happened close to a junction between two roads. The lorry driver was not injured and has been allowed to go free while authorities investigate, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Myles Shumlanski, father of one of the Broncos players, described the crash scene as a ""disaster"" to the Saskatoon Star Phoenix paper. ""We had a crane lifting the bus,"" he said. Rob Muench, the mayor of Humboldt, said it would take years for the community to come to grips with the tragedy. ""Throughout Canada we see teams going out into the Canadian winters on buses all the time and it's always a thought in parents' and fans' minds about what could happen,"" he said. ""There is no playbook on what to do in cases like this."" Humboldt's mayor wore the team's jersey in solidarity on Saturday evening Nipawin Apostolic Church lead pastor Jordan Gadsby told the BBC he had opened his church to families shortly after learning of the crash. ""The worst part of the night was sitting with and watching parents cry as they waited to find out if their son was alive or not,"" he said. News of the crash has shocked Canada, where ice hockey is a national sport and loved by many. Users on social media expressed solidarity using the hashtags #prayersforhumboldt and #humboldtstrong. Mr Trudeau said the entire country was ""in shock and mourning"" along with Humboldt, which has a population of only 6,000. ""Our national hockey family is a close one, with roots in almost every town - small and big - across Canada,"" he added. He has received condolence calls from other world leaders, including US President Donald Trump. Humboldt Broncos President Kevin Garinger said the club were ""heartbroken and completely devastated"" by the tragedy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The young athletes who play in the competitions like the Saskatchewan league often go on to play for colleges, major junior teams or the National Hockey League. Canada has experienced similar tragedies before. In 1986 a bus carrying the Swift Current Broncos junior hockey team hit a patch of black ice on a Saskatchewan stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway, killing four players. Since 1987, Western Hockey League team uniforms have been adorned with a clover patch in remembrance of the young men killed that day.

The arrests, of people aged between 18 and 21, came amid German media reports of a knife attack being foiled against Sunday's half-marathon in the city. A police spokesman said on Sunday there was no conclusive evidence the run had been the target of the alleged plot. Police say a number of searches have been made, with some electronics seized for further examination. Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller thanked the city's security forces for preventing an ""impending attack with their vigilance and police work"". Die Welt newspaper earlier reported that one man detained had planned to mount a deadly knife attack on participants and spectators at the half-marathon. The newspaper reported that those arrested were suspected of having links to a Tunisian Islamist who killed 12 people in the city in a December 2016 truck attack. Sunday's police statement said that several addresses had been searched along with two vehicles. The police declined to give further details.

Blair believes NI deal 'still possible'Tony Blair discusses NI's political future on the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.,"This video can not be played Tony Blair says NI impasse needs government's full focus Former PM Tony Blair has said he believes a solution to the current deadlock at Stormont is possible. Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017, when the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in -split in a bitter row. ""I can't believe it's not possible to find a way round it,"" Mr Blair said in an interview marking 20 years since the Good Friday agreement. ""It's very similar to the types of issues we used to deal with,"" he said. ""You've just got to keep working at them until you find a way through."" Mr Blair played an integral part inthe 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Bertie Ahern, George Mitchell and Tony Blair helped broker the 1998 Good Friday Agreement He said he thinks Prime Minister Theresa May can make progress, but that it will require ""constant work"" and her full authority. Mr Blair also said the UK must work very hard to overcome the immediate challenges and future consequences of Brexit. Looking back to the Good Friday Agreement Would McGuinness have brought back Stormont? Good Friday Agreement: It's not finished says Seamus Mallon Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide Mrs May has faced criticism from those who think her ""hands-off"" approach and parliamentary alliance with the DUP had undermined her authority in Northern Ireland. Several rounds of negotiations aimed at restoring the power-sharing coalition ended in failure last year. But Mr Blair thinks she still can broker a deal. ""I'm sure she can do it, because to be fair to her I'm sure she wants to keep the Good Friday Agreement and she wants to make sure it works satisfactorily,"" he said. ""But I think they need to realise that this requires the full focus of government at certain points in time. ""Remember, we went through setting up the new Northern Ireland police service,decommissioning Drumcree,external, there were all those things happening and at a certain point the authority of the prime minister is necessary in order to get people to move and to come into some form of alignment. ""I think it's constant work."" Mr Blair has made no secret of his opposition to Brexit in general and its impact on Northern Ireland in particular. Mr Blair said he was concerned over the possibility of border check points after Brexit When asked if Brexit had the potential to reignite violence in Northern Ireland, he replied: ""Not of itself, it won't. ""But, if what it does, is provide significant disruption to that idea at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement - that of the recognition of nationalist aspirations, if it disrupts that because the border becomes a hard border and you have some sort of border checks and freedom of movement becomes more difficult, then it's got the potential to cause tension. ""Now, that shouldn't ever justify or end up in violence, but it will give a different complexion to the nationalist aspirations."" Blair: Brexit puts NI peace process at risk Why is the Northern Ireland border question so hard? Brexit: All you need to know Mr Blair added that he found Northern Ireland unionists' opposition to membership of the EU a ""really strange consideration"". He said the interests of Northern Ireland ""must be with remaining part of the EU, because it just makes life so much easier with the border"". Mr Blair now spends his time working on other areas of conflict like the Middle East and Africa. But he remains proud of his role in negotiating the Good Friday Agreement, despite the current political vacuum at Stormont. ""The truth is the agreement was never going to simply, the day after it, usher in a great new world when everything was going to be fine,"" Mr Blair said. ""But where we are today should be compared not with the ideal world but with where we were. ""When you compare that you realise, one, that it was a huge achievement for everyone concerned to bring about the agreement and, secondly, it's worth keeping and it would be dangerous and foolish to put it at risk."" During the Good Friday Agreement negotiations, Mr Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern operated as a team. Tony Blair and the former Taoiseach (Irish PM) Bertie Ahern signing the Good Friday Agreement So, is he dismayed about the recent tensions between London and Dublin over Brexit? ""Yes, I'm worried about it because that relationship wasn't just a personal relationship between myself and Bertie Ahern, it was that the two countries were natural allies,"" he said. Mr Blair said there had been many ""positive changes"" in Anglo-Irish relations that happened partly because both the UK and Ireland were ""part of that family of European countries"". ""My only point about this is not going over the top and saying 'if we do Brexit we're going to scrap the Good Friday Agreement and [there's] going to be a return to conflict'. ""I'm simply saying that it's going to post a big challenge and it's going to mean this government is going to have to work very hard to overcome that challenge, not just the immediate challenge of Brexit, but the consequences of that as they reverberate in the years ahead.""

'No clues' for German van attack motive,"Police stand outside the building where the driver reportedly lived The man suspected of carrying out a van attack in MÃ¼nster was a lone German who suffered mental health problems, the state interior minister has said. Authorities have searched four homes associated with the suspect, and said they have found ""no clues"" pointing to an extremist or political motive. Two people were killed when a van was driven into a restaurant terrace area of the west German city on Saturday. The 48-year-old driver shot and killed himself after hitting diners. He has been identified in German media as Jens R - prosecutors say he was known to police. In 2015 and 2016, he had faced allegations of making threats, damaging property, a hit-and-run traffic accident and fraud, all of which were dropped. Well-wishers left flowers, candles and a sign asking ""why?"" at the scene of the attack ""The person in focus had [psychological] abnormalities"" that needed careful investigation, regional interior minister Herbert Reul said after placing flowers at the scene of the attack. He said there was no evidence linking the suspect to Islamist militancy, and that he was not a refugee. How Germany van incident unfolded online ""We are assuming the motives and origins [of the crime] lie within the perpetrator himself,"" Hajo Kuhlisch, chief of local police told reporters. The victims were a 51-year-old woman from near LÃ¼neburg, in the north of the country, and a 65-year-old man from Borken, near MÃ¼nster. Some 20 others were injured. MÃ¼nster's mayor Markus Lewe (L) and federal interior minister Horst Seehofer (2nd r) paid tribute at the scene of the crime ""We now know it was in all likelihood a lone perpetrator, a German,"" Mr Reul said. Prosecutors said there had been three criminal proceedings against him in MÃ¼nster, and one in the city of Ansbach dating back to 2015 and 2016. ""We have no indications of a politically motivated background [for the crime]"", senior prosecutor Elke Adomeit said. The van used in the attack on Saturday was removed in the night Although officials have provided few details, the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that the man lived just 2km (1.2 miles) from the restaurant. A vehicle, reportedly a grey VW van, was driven into a tourist square in the 300,000-population city at 15:27 local time (13:27 GMT) on Saturday. Eyewitnesses said it was driven at speed and photographs of the aftermath showed tables and chairs strewn across a restaurant terrace area. A bang was heard and people screamed, one cafe employee told local media. Daniel Kollenberg, who witnessed the aftermath, told the BBC: ""I think it is a deliberate attack because it's not allowed for cars to go in this area."" Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement that she was ""deeply shaken"" by the incident. ""Everything possible is now being done to clarify the facts and to support the victims and their relatives,"" she said. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted in French and German, saying his country was suffering with Germany. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Rogue' estate agents crackdown announced,"All estate agents will be required to hold a professional qualification under new government rules to crack down on ""rogue"" operators. Managing agents will also be forced to reveal the fees they receive for referrals to solicitors, surveyors and mortgage brokers. Housing Secretary Sajid Javid also vowed to tackle ""stressful"" delays faced by buyers and sellers. Estate agents welcomed the plans but Labour called them ""small scale"". According to government research, there are approximately 20,000 estate agent businesses across the country, and currently, anyone can practise as an agent. However, it said a minority caused problems and thatabout a quarter of sellers,externalsaid they would use a different agent if they were to sell their home again. The government also vowed to tackle ""gazumping"", where a seller pulls out of a sale to take a higher offer from another buyer. Instead buyers and sellers would be encouraged to sign lock-in agreements and face losing money if they backed out of a deal without justification. It said delayed decisions currently contributed to more than 250,000 house sales falling through annually. Mr Javid said: ""Buying a home is one of the biggest and most important purchases someone will make in their life. But for far too long buyers and sellers have been trapped in a stressful system full of delays and uncertainty. ""So we're going to put the consumers back in the driving seat."" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government also said it would: Require estate agents and freeholders to provide up-to-date lease information for a set fee and to an agreed timetable, which will end the current situation where leaseholders are ""at the mercy"" of freeholders and their agents Strengthen Trading Standards so it can carry out more enforcement activity, including banning agents Produce guides on ""How to Buy"" and ""How to Sell"" to ensure customers are better informed about the process and know what questions they should be asking Paula Higgins, boss of campaign group the Homeowners Alliance, said: ""These reforms - which the HOA called for - will go a long way to bring more certainty for homeowners and help stop sales falling through. ""In an industry tarnished by Wild West attitudes, these reforms will send the cowboys packing."" Mark Hayward, head estate agents body NAEA Propertymark, said he welcomed the commitment to further regulation. ""We have long argued that estate agents should be recognised as professionals. This is an important step towards achieving this and we look forward to working with the government."" But John Healey MP, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said the proposals fell ""far short"" of the changes needed to help homeowners and first-time buyers. ""Homeownership rose under Labour but has fallen under the Tories and there are now a million fewer younger households owning a home than there were in 2010. ""At the same time, this month ministers have scrapped Support for Mortgage Interest payments that helped over 100,000 homeowners last year."" Last week the government also introduced new measures to crack down on rogue landlords. It will launch a national database that allows councils to more easily track landlords who have been convicted of housing or other criminal offences. Tougher laws could also see offenders hit with lifetime bans from leasing homes.

Man hurt wrestling 'public nuisance' ram,"The sheep has reportedly broken a man's hand A rampant ram, which has allegedly injured several ramblers, is a ""public nuisance"", says one of its victims. David Evans said he wrestled the sheep for 10 minutes after it charged at him last month, injuring his thumb. He said another man has had to have a metal plate in his hand after being rammed in the same field in Kirk Ireton, Derbyshire. The BBC has tried to contact the owner of the field, which has a public footpath through it, for comment. David Evans wrestled for 10 minutes with the ram in a field in Kirk Ireton, Derbyshire Mr Evans said he feared the ram could kill a child. ""I crossed the stile at the bottom of the field and walked up and this ram appeared alongside me, quite friendly I thought,"" he said. ""I looked down and it herded me across the field so I pushed it away, it backed off and just charged. ""[It had a] massive pair of horns, I grabbed its horns and wrestled with it for a bit, put it down and it still came at me again."" He said he suffered cuts to his hands, one of which has gone septic. The parish council wants the ram moved to a field without a public right of way Another man was attacked the next day, breaking his hand in three places, he said. ""He had an operation a week later and had a steel plate put in and he's a builder so he's off work at the moment."" Farmers who keep animals in fields crossed by public rights of way can be liable to civil and/or criminal proceedings if members of the public are injured by their livestock. Farmers who are aware that particular livestock are likely to be upset by people walking in their field, or are likely to behave aggressively towards people, should consider moving the animal in a field without public access. Source: NFU Kath Stevens, from Kirk Ireton Parish Council, said the authority had written to the farmer asking them to move the animal after several reports of rammings. ""I'm afraid children will use that footpath, they wouldn't stand a chance with it. I want it made safe for people to walk together.""

Man 'kept son in cage for over 20 years',"Japanese police have arrested a 73-year-old man suspected of keeping his son in a wooden cage for over 20 years. Yoshitane Yamasaki said he locked up his son, now 42, because he suffered mental problems and was sometimes violent, according to officials quoted by public broadcaster NHK. The cage, 1m in height and less than 2m wide, was in a hut next to Mr Yamasaki's house in the city of Sanda. The son, who now suffers a bent back, is being looked after by authorities. Israel teen 'kept at home since birth' US 'house of horrors' parents in court Local media report he has been in the care of a social welfare facility in western Japan since January. A visit by a city official to Mr Yamasaki's home at the time alerted authorities to the 42-year-old man's confinement. Investigators believe Mr Yamasaki began confining his mentally ill son from the age of 16, when he began to ""act up"". For the time being, police have only arrested the pensioner for caging his son for 36 hours on 18 January. Mr Yamasaki has reportedly admitted the allegations, telling authorities that he fed his son every day, and allowed him to bathe every other day.

Costs halt domestic violence cases,"Domestic abuse victims in England have been unable to get emergency court orders stopping their abusers from harming them, an organisation has said. The National Centre for Domestic Violence said 6,000 victims were denied free legal representation last year. Legal Aid applicants for non-molestation orders are means tested and often told to pay towards the cost. The government said it was making it easier for domestic violence victims to prove they needed Legal Aid. The National Centre for Domestic Violence told BBC Radio 5 live Investigates that the problem arises when they appear to have money or assets of their own. It said too many women were turned away because they appeared to own assets or savings that were actually under the control of their abusers. Mark Groves, who is the company's chief executive said: ""While many people think Legal Aid is free, it is not, you have to pay a means-tested contribution. ""Economic abuse victims who don't control their money may not have this [and] those who have fled the family home may not have the right documentation. ""If you own a house, you have to put down a cash deposit equal to the equity in that house, which could be hundreds of thousands,"" he explained. Mum-of-two Alice, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, was granted legal aid to secure a non-molestation order after she told police about years of violence inflicted by her husband. But after getting the injunction she said the Legal Aid Agency got back in touch to say she had not qualified for free legal representation and she was handed the bill. ""I got a letter saying the injunction would cost me Â£6,000,"" she said. ""I was in tears when they told me, it was a complete shock. ""The only way I'd be able to pay that money was to get a loan I couldn't afford, or to sell my house and move back in with my mum,"" she added. Domestic Abuse: Tougher sentences recommended Suffragettes needed? The women still struggling to vote Anonymous voting made 'more accessible' for domestic abuse Alice is now appealing against the decision but said if she had known from the outset she would have to pay she would not have proceeded. She added: ""If I was told that I'd have to pay Â£6,000 I'd never have gone through with the process, and I'd have had no choice in letting my abuser back into my life."" Changes introduced under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 removed most legal aid in the family courts except in cases of domestic violence. But to secure free legal support, victims have to provide evidence of the abuse, as well as being subject to a means test on income and assets. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said the government's aim was in fact to make it easier to obtain legal aid in such cases. ""This includes widening the evidence that can be submitted, ensuring most victims only have to provide evidence once during their case, and scrapping the overall time limit for submitting evidence,"" he said. ""The Legal Aid Agency also considers all evidence of financial abuse, allowing victims to clearly demonstrate where this has occurred."" Police and specialist services may refer domestic violence victims to The National Centre for Domestic Violence when they need emergency court orders to stop abuse. The organisation's staff attempt to secure legal aid on the victim's behalf. During 2017 it took 78,356 referrals from police and domestic violence groups in England but, of those, 6,295 victims did not proceed because they were ordered to contribute to the legal costs. 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live,  February at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio Have you got something you want investigating?

Two killed as van drives into German crowdThe driver shot himself after ploughing into people outside a restaurant in the city of Muenster.,"The vehicle was driven, reportedly at speed, into diners in the city's old town Two people have been killed in the western German city of Muenster after a van drove into people sitting outside restaurants. The driver of the vehicle, who has not yet been officially identified, died after shooting himself at the scene. About 20 people were injured in the incident, six seriously, which occurred near the Kiepenkerl statue in the city's old town area. Authorities have said there is no indication it is an Islamist attack. How Germany van incident unfolded online State Interior Minister Herbet Reuel said investigators currently believe the perpetrator is a German citizen. Mr Reuel also said that two people had been killed by the driver, revising an earlier police figure of three. A vehicle, reportedly a grey VW van, was driven into a restaurant terrace area at 15:27 local time (14:27 BST) on Saturday. Eyewitnesses said it was driven at speed and photographs of the aftermath showed tables and chairs strewn across the popular tourist square. This video can not be played The area in Muenster's old town has been closed off while emergency services work An employee at one of the cafes told local media that she heard a bang and people screaming. ""I'm angry - it's cowardly to do something like this,"" she told German television channel N24. The suspect's motive and exact identity still remains unclear, but German media reported he was a national with mental health problems. An apartment elsewhere in the city has been searched by investigators. Daniel Kollenberg, who witnessed the aftermath, told the BBC: ""I think it is a deliberate attack because it's not allowed for cars to go in this area."" Images on social media showed furniture strewn at the scene around the city's Kiepenkerl statue He said, ""People are calm, but really shocked,"" adding that people were scared and disbelieving that such an attack could happen in Muenster. The city, in Germany's north west, has a population of about 300,000. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement she was ""deeply shaken"" by the incident. ""Everything possible is now being done to clarify the facts and to support the victims and their relatives,"" she added. The incident comes at a time of a heightened concern in Europe, following a spate of jihadist attacks using vehicles to kill pedestrians in the UK, France and Sweden. Specialist police were deployed to search the area and an apartment thought to belong to the perpetrator Local police repeatedly urged people on Saturday afternoon not to speculate about the nature of the incident and wait for official information. Germany has seen a number of jihadist attacks in recent years.In December 2016 a lorry was driven into a crowd at a Christmas market in the capital, Berlin.

Canada 'in shock' at ice hockey bus crashAt least 15 people were killed in the collision between a bus and a lorry in Saskatchewan.10h10 hours agoUS & Canada,"A photo posted to the team's Twitter feed on 24 March after a play-off win Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says ""an entire country is in shock and mourning"" in the wake of a deadly bus crash in the province of  Saskatchewan. There was an outpouring of grief across Canada at news of the collision between a bus carrying a junior ice hockey team and a semi-trailer. The Humboldt Broncos team, which has members aged between 16 and 21, were en route on Friday to a play-off game. At least 15 people have been confirmed dead in the crash. Details have been slow to trickle out in the wake of the tragedy, and the identities of the deceased have not yet been released by authorities. Tom Straschnitzki said his son Ryan is in hospital in Saskatoon with a serious back injury, and told his father that he can't feel his legs. The family flew to his bedside on Saturday to be with him. ""He keeps asking about his team and coaches. I say: I don't know son,"" he told the BBC from his home in Airdrie, Alberta. Community members are leaving flowers and notes outside the arena where the teams plays Mr Trudeau said in a statement that ""our national hockey family is a close one, with roots in almost every town - small and big - across Canada"". He has received calls of condolences from other world leaders, including US President Donald Trump. Rob Muench, mayor of the 6,000-population city of Humboldt where the team are based, said it will take years for the community to come to grips with the tragedy. ""Throughout Canada we see teams going out into the Canadian winters on buses all the time and it's always a thought in parents' and fans' minds about what could happen,"" he said. ""There is no playbook on what to do in cases like this."" Families, friends and supporters of the Humboldt hockey team gathered in Nipawin's Apostolic Church The Humboldt Broncos, who play in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, were travelling to a game against the Nipawin Hawks. Nipawin Apostolic Church lead pastor Jordan Gadsby told the BBC he opened his church to families shortly after learning of the crash. ""The worst part of the night was sitting with and watching parents cry as they waited to find out if their son was alive or not,"" he said. ""It's an awful tragedy. I wish we could re-do yesterday. But we can't. We have tomorrow instead."" Local media showed pictures of the scene, as rescue efforts continued overnight The lorry and bus collided on Friday at around 17:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Highway 35, north of Tisdale. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said 29 people including the driver were on the bus at the time, and that15 people were killed. The other 15 passengers have been taken to hospital. Two remain in critical condition. The lorry driver was not injured in the collision. Police said on Saturday they have yet to determine the cause of the crash. Myles Shumlanski, father of one of the Broncos players, described the scene as a ""disaster"" to the Saskatoon Star Phoenix paper. ""We had a crane lifting the bus,"" he said. It is not yet known who has died. There were ice hockey coaches on the bus in addition to team members. Photographs on social media showed several of the players comforting each other in hospital.

Canada has experienced similar tragedies before. In 1986, on a frigid and blustery late December day, a bus carrying the Swift Current Broncos junior hockey team hit a patch of black ice on a Saskatchewan stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway, killing four players. Since 1987, Western Hockey League team uniforms have been adorned with a clover patch in remembrance of the young men killed that day. A roadside monument was erected at the crash site 30 years later. Did you witness the crash? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Brazil's Lula surrenders to policeThe former president is flown to prison by helicopter to begin a 12-year sentence for corruption.1han hour agoLatin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Lula forced his way through crowds of his supporters to turn himself in Brazil's former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva is starting a 12-year sentence for corruption after surrendering to police. It follows a two-day stand-off that saw him take refuge in a steelworkers' union building after missing a court deadline to hand himself in. The 72-year-old walked out of the office in his hometown, near Sao Paulo, and was taken away by police cars. Scores of supporters had earlier blocked his car from leaving the scene. Lula maintains he is innocent, but said he would comply with the arrest warrant against him. Footage on Brazil's GloboNews showed Lula and his bodyguards pushing through the crowd outside the union building, in the town of Sao Bernardo do Campo. A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Lula: Only death will take me off streets He was then flown by police helicopter to the southern city of Curitiba to begin his prison sentence. Demonstrators set off fireworks as the helicopter landed, and riot police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The fire department said eight people were slightly injured, one of them by a rubber bullet. Lula was flown to the federal police headquarters in Curitiba by helicopter Anti-Lula demonstrators were waiting to celebrate his arrival Lula was the frontrunner for October's presidential election, but his jailing leaves the race wide open. The former metalworker and trade union activist is an iconic figure for the left in Latin America. He was the first left-wing leader to make it to the Brazilian presidency in nearly half a century. Earlier on Saturday, flanked by his impeached successor as president, Dilma Rousseff, the 72-year-old delivered an impassioned 55-minute speech. ""I will comply with the order and all of you will become Lula,"" he told the crowd in Sao Bernardo do Campo. ""I'm not above the law. If I didn't believe in the law, I wouldn't have started a political party. I would have started a revolution."" This video can not be played Lula was earlier carried through a crowd of his supporters Promising to come out of his legal troubles ""bigger and stronger"", he said: ""I was born with a short neck so I can keep my head high."" When he left the stage, he was carried on the shoulders of delighted supporters chanting ""Free Lula!"" By the BBC's Katy Watson in Sao Paulo It's been a dramatic few days in Brazilian politics - this in a country that's used to political intrigue. As Saturday went on, the situation felt like it was getting tense. As protestors blocked the exits preventing Lula from leaving, several vans of federal police arrived and there was talk of riot police arriving, too. But aware Lula's arrest could lead to confrontations, they weren't an overt presence. And in the end, Lula walked out and got into a car with nobody resisting his surrender. This marks the end of another chapter in Brazil's political soap opera. But there's no question he'll feature in the next one. His influence will continue to dominate the upcoming presidential elections, even if he's barred from running himself. The charges against Lula came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has embroiled top politicians from several parties. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe from engineering firm OAS. Lula is said to have accepted a flat in this block in Guaruja as a bribe Lula says his conviction was designed to stop him from running for president again. In an order issued on Thursday, federal judge Sergio Moro said Lula had to present himself before 17:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Friday at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba. He missed that deadline and retreated to the union building in his hometown - triggering a two-day waiting game. The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Lula served as president from 2003-2011. Despite a lead in opinion polls ahead of October's election, he remains a divisive figure. Allow Twitter content?

While he was in office, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades, allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions of people were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. Two last-minute appeals to have Lula's arrest warrant suspended failed. Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin rejected Lula's appeal on Saturday, a day after his appeal to the Superior Court was declined. Allow Twitter content?

Under a 2016 law, defendants can be jailed if their conviction is upheld on a first appeal - as Lula's was earlier in the year. The former president faces six separate pending trials for corruption.

Doctor: 'We will stay until the end',"A Syrian girl receives treatment at a hospital in the city of Douma in the Eastern Ghouta As theSyrian government tightens its noose aroundtheEasternGhouta,and air strikes pound the enclavefrom above, doctors and medicsare locked in a desperate battle to save the wounded. Fearful of targeted strikes, they asked the BBC to withhold their realnamesand locations. You may find some of the images upsetting. Dr Hamid's family lives in one room now â a cramped, dimly-lit garage attached to the building that used to be their home. The rest of the house, in a suburb of the Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, was destroyed a month ago, days after the Syrian government began a brutal escalation of force against the enclave. Dr Hamid, 50, leaves the makeshift shelter three times a week for a nearby hospital, where he is a trauma doctor. Each time he kisses his wife and five children goodbye, he tries not to think that it might be the last time.  He cycles to the hospital through deserted, rubble-strewn streets, mindful of the danger of being outside even for a few minutes. If the bombing is heavy, and there are many injured, he might work for more than 24 hours without a break. When he is treating wounded children he thinks of his own children, and in the short pauses between patients he prays for their lives. There is no respite. On Thursday, Syria entered the eighth year of its civil war. More than 400,000 people are believed to have been killed or are missing, presumed dead. Three of Dr Hamid's own children, and many of the children brought to his hospital, have never known peace. The injured children arrive with penetrating shrapnel wounds, missing limbs, severe burns, or sometimes with no visible injuries at all, and yet lifeless, with a lingering smell of gas on their bodies. ""Most of the children who die have been shelled in the head or have injuries in their abdomen or bowels, and I have seen some cases of penetrating wounds directly in the heart,"" said Dr Hamid. ""These children need specialist surgeons and seven or 14 days in intensive care,"" he said. ""Many could be saved. In London they could be saved. In Ghouta we cannot do anything. We try to stop the bleeding and make it OK for them, then we allow them to die."" A massive escalation of force that began last month has devastated towns and cities in the Eastern Ghouta Backed by heavy Russian air strikes, Syrian pro-government forces are tightening the noose around the Eastern Ghouta, one of the last rebel redoubts in Syria. At least 1,100 civilians have been killed since the regime stepped up its air war last month and cut the enclave into three pockets. The rebels have shelled civilians in neighbouring government-controlled areas and, according to a UN official,used snipers to kill those attempting to flee.,external In phone interviews, four doctors and medical staff described work in the enclave as a raw and restless battle to save people from death, with little or no room left to rescue limbs, preserve sight, or ward against fatal infections. Successful treatment had become a binary calculation, they said: alive or dead. This week, a five-year-old boy arrived at Dr Hamid's hospital with multiple trauma wounds and fractures in both his legs and arms. Dr Hamid sutured the boy's wounds and amputated one of his arms and one of his legs at the upper thigh. ""That is his future,"" Dr Hamid said. But the boy is alive, that is a success. The same day, an 18-month-old girl was brought in with a massive laceration to her thigh after a barrel bomb attack, completely severing her artery. Dr Hamid tried desperately to connect the leg and restore some blood flow, but he could not suture the artery properly. ""We do not know in the future if she will walk or if her leg will be only a picture of a leg,"" he said. ""But she is alive."" A success. The same week, five young children who were brought to Dr Hamid died. ""When we are dealing with children, we hope God will look to them,"" he said, letting out a long, deep sigh. ""I'm sorry, words cannot express this."" An injured child lies in hospital after a bombing in Douma, Eastern Ghouta About 50 patients in need of urgent medical care were evacuated from the Eastern Ghouta this week, and civilians from some areas are beginning to escape, but the UN estimates that about 390,000 people remain trapped, hiding in makeshift underground shelters with limited access to food, water, sanitation and medical treatment. Direct attacks on health care facilities have spiked in recent weeks, according to the World Health Organisation, mostly in the Eastern Ghouta. A third of Dr Hamid's hospital has been damaged. The functioning parts are crowded with the wounded, making it hard to move around, and when the shelling is bad there are dead bodies on the floor that cannot be removed. Last week, the staff could not take out the bodies for 48 hours. All over the Eastern Ghouta, medical staff are physically and emotionally exhausted, said Lorena Bilbao, Syria co-ordinator for Doctors Without Borders. ""They have been working almost non-stop, with few hours' sleep, no regular meals, and the constant frustration and fear of the bombing,"" she said. Why is there a war in Syria? Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Falling hair and eating inedible plants to survive The escalation in February brought with it new weapons and a ""new kind of horror"", said Atef, 36, a radiologist at a surgical hospital in the enclave. Suddenly they were seeing patients with multiple severe injuries. ""We are not used to this level of wounds,"" he said. ""We cannot help them. When you look around, there is desperation on the faces of the staff."" Many of those left in the Eastern Ghouta are now hiding underground. Atef lives in a basement under a public building, with his wife, children, and 100 other people. Mohammed, a 23-year-old medical student who was forced to abandon his studies to become a full time war medic, lives with his family in a neighbour's basement, where 30 people are crammed into three small rooms and there is no electricity or water. To pass the time, the family members talk in the dark or run down the batteries of their phones playing games. Five of Mohammed's cousins died in the past month, he said. So did his uncle, his sister's husband, his brother's wife, and her entire family. ""The patients are also our family,"" he said. ""We will carry on treating them until all the medication is gone. Until we stand with nothing. Until the last minutes."" A doctor treats a wounded man after air strikes on Hamouria, Saqba and Kafr Batna in the Eastern Ghouta A Red Cross convoy carrying food parcels was allowed access to the enclave on Thursday but no medical supplies were permitted. According to the World Health Organisation, the Syrian regime confiscated 70% of medical supplies from a previous convoy, including trauma kits, surgical kits and insulin. Doctors Without Borders says there is now only one vascular surgeon left in the region and no possibility to transfer patients, leaving general doctors with no choice but to amputate limbs that could be saved. Dr Hamid estimated that the hospital could have as little as a few weeks' worth of anaesthetic left, raising the fearful prospect of amputations with no pain relief. ""We are working with stitches that were used before, disposable gloves that we wore before, chest drainage that was used on other patients,"" he said. ""Most wounds get infected and need bandages, but we are using bandages that we used before."" There is also no lab equipment to test for the presence of the toxic chemical chlorine, which medics and opposition activists say has been used as a weapon by pro-government forces. The government denies using any kind of chemical weapons, but their claim is undermined by a UN conclusion that it used chlorine at least three times in 2014 and 2015, and by a current UN investigation into reports of chlorine use in January in the Eastern Ghouta. On the ground, it is undermined by the irritated eyes and airways, and the powerful smell that lingers on patients, described in detail by three members of staff at Dr Hamid's hospital. ""To us it is obvious after an attack,"" said Dr Hamid. ""Everyone who comes in the ambulances has the same smell."" Exposure to chlorine doesn't generally kill, but it can if your lungs are very small. You can drown in the fluid that builds up. Dr Hamid and Mohammed recalled two cases brought in on the same day. ""We saw a three-month-old baby girl and a boy of two years,"" said Mohammed. ""The girl was on ventilation for a week and she survived, but the boy died. He was blue and the smell of his body was full of chlorine."" ""Children are the hardest to treat, they remind you of your own children,"" said Dr Hamid As the seventh anniversary of the conflict passed, the steadily worsening brutality in the Eastern Ghouta reflected the state of the wider war. The government of Bashar al-Assad says it is cleansing the nation of terrorists, but it has pounded the country indiscriminately, killing tens of thousands of civilians. ""They say they are killing terrorists but we are not terrorists. The people I see dying are women and children,"" said Dr Hamid. He is counting down now until the IV antibiotics, anaesthetic, and insulin at the hospital run out, which will not be long if no supplies are allowed in. There is already no dialysis available, consigning chronic kidney patients to a slow, terrible death from renal failure. The place where Dr Hamid was born and raised had been abandoned to its own slow death, he said. It was a place that people came to from Damascus, with their wives and husbands and children, for weekend picnics, or to shop for cheap merchandise in the bustling markets. ""They came here from all around to smell the fresh air and the rivers and the trees,"" he said. ""To me it was a paradise on the Earth."" Now he prays in his cramped shelter at night that his children will one day see the place he can still conjure in his mind, ""as green as it was when I was a boy"". ""It may be too late for me,"" he said, ""but God willing, our children will see these days.""

Northern Irishman McIlroy, who will become the sixth man to win the career Grand Slam of golf's four majors if he wins at Augusta, is second on 11 under. Two ahead overnightto lead outright for the first time in a major, world number 24 Reed made two eagles in a 67. Rickie Fowler (65) is third on nine under, one ahead of Jon Rahm (65). The last four champions at Augusta had already won in that season, but of those within six of the lead after two rounds this year, only McIlroy, world number one Dustin Johnson and number two Justin Thomas have tasted victory so far in 2018. The Cut; BBC Radio 5 live's golf podcast from round three McIlroy made par from this picturesque, if daunting position McIlroy made a superb start playing alongside Henrik Stenson in the penultimate group. He birdied three of the first six holes and then a chip from the undulations off to the right of the eighth green hit the flag and rattled into the cup for an eagle to give him a share of the lead on nine under. This video can not be played Masters Memories 2018: McIlroy 'roaring' after stunning eagle chip It was a five-under front nine from the world number seven, his lowest at Augusta National. At the 13th, as torrential rain began to fall, his second plummeted into the brightly coloured azaleas to the left of the green and he did well to salvage par. He birdied the par-five 15th and then holed from 17 feet for another at the last to equal his lowest Masters round and ensure he will partner Reed in Sunday's final round at 19:40 BST - which you can watch, live and uninterrupted on BBC Two and the BBC Sport website from 18:30. The four-time major winner has history against American Reed, having been edged out by one hole in aclassic Ryder Cup duelat Hazeltine in 2016. A defiant McIlroy said: ""Patrick has a three-shot lead but I feel like all the pressure is on him. He has got to protect that and he has some pretty big-time players behind him."" This video can not be played 'Extraordinary' Reed retains Masters lead Three of the last four winners at Augusta were ahead at the halfway stage and Reed calmly moved clear again with his fifth run of three consecutive birdies this week. He dropped a shot at the short 12th but coaxed a downhill putt in at the next for his first eagle of the tournament, before swiftly adding another at the 15th by holing a magnificent chip over a greenside bunker - and was five in front at that stage. Reed, runner-up in last year's PGA but yet to land a major title, missed a short putt to bogey the 16th and a seven-foot birdie chance at the last, but is the first man since Lee Westwood in 2010 to play his first three rounds under 70 at the Masters. When asked about McIlroy saying the pressure was all on him, Reed replied: ""I am leading, so I guess so. But at the same time, he's trying to go for the career Grand Slam. You can put it either way. ""It's going to be electrifying. The fans are going to be ready to go, they are going to be ready to cheer for whoever is making putts, whoever is making birdies or pulling off shots."" However, since 2010, South African Charl Schwartzel is the only man outside the world's top 20 to claim the coveted Green Jacket. This video can not be played Round of the Day: Jon Rahm's superb seven under par The forecasted storms did not prove as dramatic as predicted on a third day that featured 11 sub-70 rounds. One of those was put together byRahm.The Spaniard, who was three over after Thursday's opening round, made his second eagle of the week on Saturday and added five birdies to move to eight under. The powerfully-built 23-year-old finished in a tie for 21st on his Masters debut last year. EnglishmanTommy Fleetwood,who missed the cut on his first appearance at the event 12 months ago, produced his first sub-70 round with a superb 66. This video can not be played Masters 2018: Tommy Fleetwood hails 'brilliant' day at Augusta He was level par at the halfway stage and nine shots off the pace, but leapt up the leaderboard with five successive birdies on the back nine. However, the 27-year-old from Southport three-putted the final green for a 66 to drop back to six under. Asked about his score he said: ""I need to go out and do the same on Sunday. All I can do is try shoot the same score again. If I can get going on that front nine, having watched so many Masters Sundays, it will be a joy to be part of one."" Fowler,still seeking his first major, displayed some masterful touches on the notoriously daunting greens and made five birdies and an eagle in his bogey-free round, while two-time champion Bubba Watson shares sixth place after seven birdies in a 68. Former world number oneJordan Spieth,the 2015 Masters champion, began the third round level with McIlroy at four under but dropped two shots on the front nine, before birdies at inward par fives took him to five under, alongside close friendThomas,the PGA champion, who had three birdies in a 70. Dustin Johnson'schallenge was checked by driving into the trees and making a double bogey at the 11th and he is one further back. Four-time championTiger Woods,playing alongsideIan Poulterin the fifth group of the morning, bogeyed the first two holes but made three birdies in a 72 to remain at four over. It was an eventful day for three-time winnerPhil Mickelson,who took a triple bogey seven at the first hole after some trouble with low-lying limbs of a tree, but chipped in for an eagle en route to a 74 and a seven over total. World number fiveJustin Rose,twice runner-up at Augusta in the last three years, is 11 shots off the lead after adding a 71 to rounds of 72 and 70. Rose compiled four birdies and said optimistically: ""It's a golf course you can have a big comeback on and on the Sunday the pins offer an opportunity to shoot in the low 60s. ""I'm surprised more guys haven't had comebacks here - let's hope that starts tomorrow."" Former US Amateur championMatt Fitzpatrick,the 23-year-old from Sheffield, had four birdies and an eagle in a fine 67 to reach level par, whilePaul Casey,playing with a marker in the first group of the day, returned a round of 69 and a two-over total. World number 15Tyrrell Hattonfinished with two bogeys for a 73 and is six over, one ahead of Poulter, who had five bogeys in a 74.

Brazil's Lula surrenders to police,"This video can not be played Lula forced his way through crowds of his supporters to turn himself in Brazil's former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva is starting a 12-year sentence for corruption after surrendering to police. It follows a two-day stand-off that saw him take refuge in a steelworkers' union building after missing a court deadline to hand himself in. The 72-year-old walked out of the office in his hometown, near Sao Paulo, and was taken away by police cars. Scores of supporters had earlier blocked his car from leaving the scene. Lula maintains he is innocent, but said he would comply with the arrest warrant against him. Footage on Brazil's GloboNews showed Lula and his bodyguards pushing through the crowd outside the union building, in the town of Sao Bernardo do Campo. A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Lula: Only death will take me off streets He was then flown by police helicopter to the southern city of Curitiba to begin his prison sentence. Demonstrators set off fireworks as the helicopter landed, and riot police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The fire department said eight people were slightly injured, one of them by a rubber bullet. Lula was flown to the federal police headquarters in Curitiba by helicopter Anti-Lula demonstrators were waiting to celebrate his arrival Lula was the frontrunner for October's presidential election, but his jailing leaves the race wide open. The former metalworker and trade union activist is an iconic figure for the left in Latin America. He was the first left-wing leader to make it to the Brazilian presidency in nearly half a century. Earlier on Saturday, flanked by his impeached successor as president, Dilma Rousseff, the 72-year-old delivered an impassioned 55-minute speech. ""I will comply with the order and all of you will become Lula,"" he told the crowd in Sao Bernardo do Campo. ""I'm not above the law. If I didn't believe in the law, I wouldn't have started a political party. I would have started a revolution."" This video can not be played Lula was earlier carried through a crowd of his supporters Promising to come out of his legal troubles ""bigger and stronger"", he said: ""I was born with a short neck so I can keep my head high."" When he left the stage, he was carried on the shoulders of delighted supporters chanting ""Free Lula!"" By the BBC's Katy Watson in Sao Paulo It's been a dramatic few days in Brazilian politics - this in a country that's used to political intrigue. As Saturday went on, the situation felt like it was getting tense. As protestors blocked the exits preventing Lula from leaving, several vans of federal police arrived and there was talk of riot police arriving, too. But aware Lula's arrest could lead to confrontations, they weren't an overt presence. And in the end, Lula walked out and got into a car with nobody resisting his surrender. This marks the end of another chapter in Brazil's political soap opera. But there's no question he'll feature in the next one. His influence will continue to dominate the upcoming presidential elections, even if he's barred from running himself. The charges against Lula came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has embroiled top politicians from several parties. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe from engineering firm OAS. Lula is said to have accepted a flat in this block in Guaruja as a bribe Lula says his conviction was designed to stop him from running for president again. In an order issued on Thursday, federal judge Sergio Moro said Lula had to present himself before 17:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Friday at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba. He missed that deadline and retreated to the union building in his hometown - triggering a two-day waiting game. The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Lula served as president from 2003-2011. Despite a lead in opinion polls ahead of October's election, he remains a divisive figure. Allow Twitter content?

While he was in office, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades, allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions of people were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. Two last-minute appeals to have Lula's arrest warrant suspended failed. Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin rejected Lula's appeal on Saturday, a day after his appeal to the Superior Court was declined. Allow Twitter content?

Under a 2016 law, defendants can be jailed if their conviction is upheld on a first appeal - as Lula's was earlier in the year. The former president faces six separate pending trials for corruption.

Russian meeting call 'diversionary tactic',"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in hospital The Foreign Office has described a Russian request for a meeting with Boris Johnson on the Salisbury poisoning as a ""diversionary tactic"". The Foreign Office said Russia's response had been ""unsatisfactory"", as it had been three weeks since Russia was asked to ""engage constructively"". The Russian Embassy said it was ""high time"" for a meeting on the inquiry. Current interaction between the embassy and the Foreign Office was ""utterly unsatisfactory"", it said. The Foreign Office said it would respond to the invitation for a meeting between Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko and Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson ""in due course"". It said: ""It's over three weeks since we asked Russia to engage constructively and answer a number of questions relating to the attempted assassinations of Mr Skripal and his daughter. ""Now, after failing in their attempts in the UN and international chemical weapons watchdog this week and with the victims' condition improving, they seem to be pursuing a different diversionary tactic."" The UK government says Russia is behind the attack on a Russian father and daughter - Sergei and Yulia Skripal - who were poisoned with a toxic nerve agent in Salisbury last month. Moscow has denied all involvement. Ex-spy 'improving rapidly' after poisoning Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Ina statement,external, a Russian embassy spokesman said: ""We believe that it is high time to arrange a meeting between Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson."" It added that the ambassador had already sent a note to the foreign secretary, and it hoped ""the British side will engage constructively and that such meeting is arranged shortly"". The meeting request follows Russian Embassy criticism of the UK government's refusal - on immigration rules - to grant a visa to Ms Skripal's cousin, Viktoria Skripal, to visit Britain. The Russian Embassy said Sergei and Yulia ""remain hidden from the public"". ""The stubborn refusal to cooperate, to provide transparency and to answer the numerous questions means Britain has something to hide,"" the embassy said. Viktoria Skripal later told the BBC she did not have enough money in her bank account to satisfy the visa requirements. Skripal phone call: 'I have no doubt it was Yulia' Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Mr Skripal was jailed by Russia for spying for Britain, but released as part of a spy swap between the US and Russia in 2010. His daughter Yulia was visiting him in the UK when the attack happened on 4 March. She is now conscious and talking in hospital. Salisbury District Hospital has said Mr Skripal, isresponding wellto treatment and ""improving rapidly"". A diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West has followed, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. Russia's request for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Two days later, at a UN Security Council meeting, Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia said Britain's main goal had been ""to discredit and even delegitimise"" Russia with ""unsubstantiated accusations"".

Corbyn 'Kremlin's useful idiot' - Johnson,"A bitter row has broken out between Labour and the Conservatives over their language and response to the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Boris Johnson accused Jeremy Corbyn of refusing to ""unequivocally"" blame the Russian state, describing him as ""the Kremlin's useful idiot"". But Labour said Mr Johnson was the ""idiot"" having ""undermined his own government's position"" on the evidence. Moscow has denied the UK government's claim that it was behind the attack. Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Ex-spy 'improving rapidly' after poisoning The UK says there is ""no other plausible explanation"" for the incident, while Russia has accused Britain of  waging a ""propaganda war"" against it over the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, on 4 March. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, following Britain's initial expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mr Johnson said the Kremlin had made a ""cynical attempt to bury awkward facts beneath an avalanche of lies and disinformation"". He said the Russian government and state-owned media had invented 29 theories about the attack. ""There is only one thing that gives the Kremlin succour and lends false credibility to its propaganda onslaught. That is when politicians from the targeted countries join in,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Sadly, I am driven to the conclusion that Jeremy Corbyn has joined this effort ...Truly he is the Kremlin's useful idiot"". The health of Mr Skripal and his daughter are said to be improving Fellow Conservatives joined the attack on the Labour Leader. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC: ""There's no doubt when it comes up against this issue with Russia that we are having, this very serious issue, that Jeremy Corbyn has let the British people down."" And policing minister Nick Hurd said that while the phrase ""useful idiot"" was part of ""the lexicon of Johnson"", he added: ""I feel very strongly that Jeremy Corbyn has been insufficiently clear in his condemnation of Russia."" Labour has already called for an investigation into whether Mr Johnson misled the public about Russia's involvement, in his remarks about the findings of the UK's defence laboratory Porton Down. The party said that in an interview given to German TV last month, Mr Johnson said that ""people from Porton Down"" were ""absolutely categorical"", adding: ""I asked the guy myself. I said 'are you sure?', and he said 'there's no doubt'."" But last week, the Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson is the government's useful idiot because what he's done is create a situation where he has contradicted the evidence and overstepped the mark. ""Porton Down have been absolutely clear that they didn't say what Boris Johnson said."" She said that Mr Johnson had ""driven a wedge for the Russians to say there are questions on the evidence."" ""I think that is really dangerous, that we have got a foreign secretary that undermines his own government's position."" The UK has refused to grant Viktoria Skripal a visa to visit Britain Labour says Mr Corbyn ""has repeatedly said the evidence points to Russia being responsible, directly or indirectly, and that the Russian authorities must be held to account on the basis of evidence"". On Saturday, the Foreign Office described a Russian request for a meeting with Mr Johnson on the Salisbury poisoning as a ""diversionary tactic"". Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy has also requested a meeting with Scotland Yard over its handling of the suspected murder of Russian businessman Nikolay Glushkov. Mr Glushkov was found dead in his home in New Malden, south London, on 12 March. Four days later the Met launched a murder investigation and an inquest heard the 68-year-old's cause of death was compression to the neck. ""For Russia this murder has a criminal as well as political dimension,"" an embassy spokesman said. ""Almost a month has passed since Mr Glushkov's death, and like ... with Sergei and Yulia Skripal, the British side provided no information."" Mr Glushkov was a close friend of outspoken President Putin critic Boris Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch found hanged at his Berkshire home in 2013. The Met made no comment. The requests followed Russian Embassy criticism of the UK government's refusal - on immigration rules - to grant a visa to Ms Skripal's cousin, Viktoria Skripal, to visit Britain. The embassy says the refusal to allow Viktoria Skripal to visit her cousin and uncle was ""disappointing"" and ""politically motivated"". Mr Skripal was jailed by Russia for spying for Britain, but released as part of a spy swap between the US and Russia in 2010. Yulia was visiting him in the UK when the attack happened on 4 March. She is now conscious and talking in hospital. Salisbury District Hospital has said Mr Skripal is responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"".

"150 dead in Syria gas attack, rescuers say","This video can not be played Children being treated after the Douma attack At least 70 people have died in a suspected chemical attack in Douma, the last rebel-held town in Syria's Eastern Ghouta, rescuers and medics say. Volunteer rescue force the White Helmets tweeted graphic images showing several bodies in basements. It said the deaths were likely to rise. There has been no independent verification of the reports. Syria has called the allegations of a chemical attack a ""fabrication"" - as has its main ally, Russia. The US state department said Russia - with its ""unwavering support"" for Syria's government - ""ultimately bears responsibility"" for the alleged attacks. Syrian warplanes strike rebel enclave Mattis warns Syria over poison gas use 'We will stay until the end': A doctor's battle in Eastern Ghouta Several medical, monitoring and activist groups reported details of a chemical attack. ""Seventy people suffocated to death and hundreds are still suffocating,"" said Raed al-Saleh, head of the White Helmets. An earlier, now deleted tweet, put the number dead at more than 150. The pro-opposition Ghouta Media Center tweeted that more than 75 people had ""suffocated"", while a further 1,000 people had suffered the effects of the alleged attack. It blamed a barrel bomb allegedly dropped by a helicopter which it said contained Sarin, a toxic nerve agent. The Union of Medical Relief Organizations, a US-based charity that works with Syrian hospitals, told the BBC the Damascus Rural Specialty Hospital had confirmed 70 deaths. Pro-government forces are fighting to drive rebels out of Douma A spokeswoman said there were reports of people being treated for symptoms including convulsions and foaming of the mouth, consistent with nerve or mixed nerve and chlorine gas exposure. Continued shelling overnight and on Sunday was making it impossible to reach victims. As the allegations emerged, Syria's state news agency Sana said the reports were invented by the Jaish al-Islam rebels who remain in control in Douma. ""Jaish al-Islam terrorists are in a state of collapse and their media outlets are [making] chemical attack fabrications in an exposed and failed attempt to obstruct advances by the Syrian Arab army,"" Sana said. In August 2013, rockets containing the nerve agent Sarin were fired at rebel-held areas of the Eastern Ghouta, killing hundreds of people. A UN mission confirmed the use of Sarin,external, but it was not asked to state who was responsible. Western powers said only Syrian government forces could have carried out the attack. In April 2017, more than 80 people died in a Sarin attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, and a joint inquiry by the UN and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) held the Syrian government responsible. About 80 people died and many more were injured in the attack on Khan Sheikhoun Activists, medics and the US say Syrian government forces dropped bombs containing toxic chlorine gas on rebel-held towns in early 2018. Syria government behind 2017 Sarin attack - UN N Korea 'helps Syria make chemical weapons' The joint UN-OPCW mission is investigating the reports. It previously found that government forces have used chlorine as a weapon at least three times during the seven-year civil war.

Brazil's Lula surrenders to policeThe former Brazilian president hands himself in to begin a jail term for corruption.2h2 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Lula forced his way through crowds of his supporters to turn himself in Brazil's former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva is starting a 12-year sentence for corruption after surrendering to police. It follows a two-day stand-off that saw him take refuge in a steelworkers' union building after missing a court deadline to hand himself in. The 72-year-old walked out of the office in his hometown, near Sao Paulo, and was taken away by police cars. Scores of supporters had earlier blocked his car from leaving the scene. Lula maintains he is innocent, but said he would comply with the arrest warrant against him. Footage on Brazil's GloboNews showed Lula and his bodyguards pushing through the crowd outside the union building, in the town of Sao Bernardo do Campo. A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Lula: Only death will take me off streets He was then flown by police helicopter to the southern city of Curitiba to begin his prison sentence. Demonstrators set off fireworks as the helicopter landed, and riot police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The fire department said eight people were slightly injured, one of them by a rubber bullet. Lula was flown to the federal police headquarters in Curitiba by helicopter Anti-Lula demonstrators were waiting to celebrate his arrival Lula was the frontrunner for October's presidential election, but his jailing leaves the race wide open. The former metalworker and trade union activist is an iconic figure for the left in Latin America. He was the first left-wing leader to make it to the Brazilian presidency in nearly half a century. Earlier on Saturday, flanked by his impeached successor as president, Dilma Rousseff, the 72-year-old delivered an impassioned 55-minute speech. ""I will comply with the order and all of you will become Lula,"" he told the crowd in Sao Bernardo do Campo. ""I'm not above the law. If I didn't believe in the law, I wouldn't have started a political party. I would have started a revolution."" This video can not be played Lula was earlier carried through a crowd of his supporters Promising to come out of his legal troubles ""bigger and stronger"", he said: ""I was born with a short neck so I can keep my head high."" When he left the stage, he was carried on the shoulders of delighted supporters chanting ""Free Lula!"" By the BBC's Katy Watson in Sao Paulo It's been a dramatic few days in Brazilian politics - this in a country that's used to political intrigue. As Saturday went on, the situation felt like it was getting tense. As protestors blocked the exits preventing Lula from leaving, several vans of federal police arrived and there was talk of riot police arriving, too. But aware Lula's arrest could lead to confrontations, they weren't an overt presence. And in the end, Lula walked out and got into a car with nobody resisting his surrender. This marks the end of another chapter in Brazil's political soap opera. But there's no question he'll feature in the next one. His influence will continue to dominate the upcoming presidential elections, even if he's barred from running himself. The charges against Lula came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has embroiled top politicians from several parties. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe from engineering firm OAS. Lula is said to have accepted a flat in this block in Guaruja as a bribe Lula says his conviction was designed to stop him from running for president again. In an order issued on Thursday, federal judge Sergio Moro said Lula had to present himself before 17:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Friday at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba. He missed that deadline and retreated to the union building in his hometown - triggering a two-day waiting game. The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Lula served as president from 2003-2011. Despite a lead in opinion polls ahead of October's election, he remains a divisive figure. Allow Twitter content?

While he was in office, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades, allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions of people were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. Two last-minute appeals to have Lula's arrest warrant suspended failed. Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin rejected Lula's appeal on Saturday, a day after his appeal to the Superior Court was declined. Allow Twitter content?

Under a 2016 law, defendants can be jailed if their conviction is upheld on a first appeal - as Lula's was earlier in the year. The former president faces six separate pending trials for corruption. As a convict Lula would normally be barred from standing for election in October, but Brazil's top electoral court reserves the final decision if and when he submits his candidacy.
