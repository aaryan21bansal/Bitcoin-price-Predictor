"Separatist protest draws 350,000 in Barcelona","This video can not be played Protesters target police HQ, vandalising vehicles and hurling paintballs About 350,000 people have protested in Barcelona over the jailing of separatist leaders from Spain's Catalonia region, police say. The peaceful march was also organised to underline support for Catalonia's independence movement. A separate demonstration by a direct action group turned violent on Saturday evening, as protesters targeted the police headquarters. Spanish unionists plan to hold their own mass rally in the city on Sunday. Catalan crisis in 300 words Nine separatist leaders were jailed on 14 October by Spain's Supreme Courtfor between nine and 13 years after being convicted of sedition. The days that followed saw some of the worst violence in the history of the modern independence movement, which prides itself on its peaceful tactics. Grassroots independence groups had urged independence supporters to fill the streets but said they were committed to peaceful protests, Reuters news agency reports. A sea of protesters stretched from the city's waterfront to the landmark Sagrada Familia church. Separatist lone-star flags waved above the huge crowd ""It is time to sit down and talk,"" one protester told Reuters. ""I think it is time for the state to find a solution because it seems that this has no end and we are always at the same point. We have come here because we are fed up with so much repression that we have suffered from the state."" ""We have always defended non-violence,"" said another. ""What is happening in Barcelona is not a reflection of us, we separatists are not violent, we want our country, we want to be free."" The day had begun with a gathering of mayors from across Catalonia to endorse the campaign for self-determination. Mayors of 814 out of the region's 947 local authorities gathered at the regional government's headquarters to meet Catalan President Quim Torra. This video can not be played Catalonia independence protesters: ""We feel like we are all being tried"" As the mayors chanted ""independence"", Mr Torra said Catalans must unite to oppose ""repression"" and ""force the Spanish state to talk"". Later on Saturday, a pro-independence group that favours direct action organised a protest outside the police headquarters in the city. Demonstrators threw balls, bottles and stones at riot police. Riot police later moved to disperse the crowds, armed with shields and batons and backed by riot vans. Projectiles were fired during the clashes and at least six people were hospitalised with injuries, according to Reuters news agency. On Sunday, politicians from Spain's two main centre-right parties, the Popular Party and Ciudadanos, are expected to attend the unionist rally, which comes two weeks before the Spanish general election. Meanwhile, supporters of the far-right Vox party rallied in the Spanish capital Madrid on Saturday to hear calls for a harder line on the separatists. Party leader Santiago Abascal attacked Spain's mainstream parties, including the ruling Socialists, telling the crowd: ""Faced with criminal separatism, there is only Vox!"" This video can not be played Bel, student, 20: ""We are living demonstrations"" Rioters threw paving stones and petrol bombs while police fired baton rounds and used truncheons. Cars and other property were damaged as fires were lit in the streets of Barcelona and other towns. Between 14 and 20 October, 593 people, including 226 police officers, received treatment for injuries as a result of the protests, according to regional emergency services. The Spanish authorities later updated the number of officers injured to 289. Successive Spanish governments have refused to grant separatists in Catalonia a referendum on independence, which became a live issue again after the global financial crisis of 2008. This video can not be played Catalan Minister Alfred Bosch: ""Weâre not haters"" Spurred on by the results of an unrecognised plebiscite in November 2014, separatists held an illegal referendum in October 2017, which Spain tried to prevent by force, eventually jailing the separatist leaders. Catalonia's quarrel with Spain explained While the separatists regularly attract massive shows of public support, they have only a slim majority in the regional parliament anda recent survey suggests Catalonia's residents oppose independence by about 48% to 44%,external. Catalonia has its own language and distinctive traditions, and a population nearly as big as Switzerland's (7.5 million). It is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, making up 16% of the national population and accounting for almost 19% of Spanish GDP. The EU has treated the crisis as an internal matter for Spain, deaf to the separatists' pleas for support, but there have been warnings that the issue is damaging Spain's democratic credentials.

"'Fears confirmed' over rights at work, says Labour","Business minister Kwesi Kwarteng said the reports are ""completely mad"" Labour has said leaked government papers ""confirm its worst fears"" about plans to dilute workers' rights after Brexit. The documents,revealed by the Financial Times,external, say that the drafting of commitments on workers' rights and the environment in the Brexit deal ""leaves room for interpretation"". Labour said it is a ""blueprint"" for ending ""vital rights and protections"". But Business Minister Kwesi Kwarteng said the claims are ""way exaggerated"". The leaked paper suggests that the government believes there is considerable scope to diverge from the EU on employment rights and other regulations after Brexit, despite its pledge to maintain a ""level playing field"" in Boris Johnson's latest deal. In Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, references to a level playing field - the idea that the UK and EU countries keep their rules and standards close to prevent one trying to gain a competitive advantage - were removed from the legally binding withdrawal agreement. What does the Brexit deal say about workers' rights? No 10 denies government division over Brexit plans Do voters support Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? Instead, they were put into the non-binding ""political declaration"", which describes the potential future relationship between the UK and EU. According to the FT, the leaked document says the UK's and EU's interpretation of the ""level playing field"" pledge will be ""very different"", and the text represents a ""much more open starting point"" for negotiations over a future trade deal. Purportedly drafted by the Brexit department, the paper appears to contradict promises by the prime minister on Wednesday that the UK is committed to the ""highest possible standards"" for the environment and rights at work. It comes as EU leaders considertheir decision on a new deadline for Brexit, having agreed to an extension in principle after the UK government admitted it could not meet its 31 October deadline. The document will fuel fears among some in the EU that Boris Johnson is planning to shape Britain into a Singapore-style economy, with low taxes and light regulation, which could compete against Europe by potentially downgrading rights. Suggestions that workers' rights could be diluted will also raise concerns among Labour MPs, 19 of whom voted for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to progress in the House of Commons. Labour shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said the documents ""confirm our worst fears"". She said: ""Boris Johnson's Brexit is a blueprint for a deregulated economy, which will see vital rights and protections torn up."" The Brexit department said it did not recognise the document, however. And Business Minister Kwesi Kwarteng told the BBC the claims were ""completely mad"" after the government had worked to win the support of Labour MPs. ""It wouldn't make any sense at all to dilute workers' rights in building that coalition to land the bill,"" he said. ""We have said we will be better than our word. We have said our ambition on securing workers' rights will be stronger than the provision of the bill."" Environmental groups have also raised concerns after the document was leaked, calling on ministers to introduce legal guarantees on current standards in the Environment Bill, which is due to be debated for the first time in the Commons on Monday. Benjamin Halfpenny from Greener UK, a coalition of groups including the RSPB, Friends of the Earth and the National Trust, said: ""The government has had plenty of opportunities to put a commitment to existing standards into law, but has thus far not done so. ""Such a commitment would not prevent future governments from going further on things like water quality and chemical safety, just stop them going backwards."" A Brexit department spokesman said the government ""has no intention of lowering the standards of workers' rights or environmental protection after we leave the EU"". He said the UK already exceeds the minimum standards in areas such as maternity leave, shared parental leave and greenhouse gas emissions targets. What does the Brexit deal say about workers' rights?

Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani 'butt dials' reporter,"This video can not be played Who is Rudy Giuliani? Rudy Giuliani, personal lawyer to US President Donald Trump, has left two unintended voicemail messages on a reporter's phone, NBC News reports. In the calls, Mr Giuliani reportedly spoke about needing money and attacked Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Mr Giuliani has not yet commented on the calls. Lawmakers demanded documents from Mr Giulianiearlier this month as part of the presidential impeachment inquiry. In the past he publicly admitted asking Ukrainian officials to investigate widely debunked corruption allegations against Mr Biden. Top Trump aide 'called Giuliani a hand grenade' Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? Three Democratic-led committees are currently investigating whether President Trump tried to pressure Ukraine's president into investigating Mr Biden in exchange for military aid. NBC investigative reporterRich Shapiro says he received two voicemails from Mr Giuliani,externalin the space of a month. He described them as the result of ""what is known, in casual parlance, as a butt dial"". A ""butt dial"" happens when someone unknowingly calls one of their contacts by accidentally applying pressure to their phone's buttons while it is in their pocket. Rudy Giuliani, pictured using a phone as intended Mr Shapiro missed the first call, mid-afternoon on 28 September, because he was at a child's birthday party. He had interviewed Mr Giuliani for an article the day before. For the entirety of the ensuing three-minute voicemail, the president's personal lawyer reportedly attacked Mr Biden and his family. ""Biden has been trading in on his public office since he was a senator,"" Mr Giuliani reportedly said to an unidentified man. In the conversation, he brought up the discredited allegations that Joe Biden, when vice-president, stopped an investigation in Ukraine to protect his son Hunter. What was Trump's lawyer up to in Ukraine? The Trump impeachment story explained ""He did the same thing in China. And he tried to do it in Kazakhstan and in Russia,"" Mr Giuliani reportedly added. In the second voicemail, left on the night of 16 October, Mr Giuliani again recorded a conversation with an unknown man. ""We need a few hundred thousand,"" Mr Giuliani reportedly said at one point, in a conversation that Mr Shapiro says covered Bahrain and an unknown man named Robert. Mr Giuliani was mayor of New York City from 1994 until 2001, and was in office during the 9/11 terror ttacks. He was one of the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, before withdrawing and backing eventual candidate John McCain. Since April 2018, he has served as a lawyer for President Trump. Mr Giuliani was present during Mr Trump's call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July, which is the subject of the impeachment inquiry.

Telegraph owners to put paper up for sale,"Directors at the Telegraph Media Group said they were 'naturally disappointed' with the profit slump The billionaire owners of the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph are to put both titles up for sale. Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay are understood to be reviewing all of their key assets, which includes the Telegraph Media Group (TMG). Figures published on 17 October showed TMG's profit for the last financial year was Â£900,000 - a 94 per cent drop on the previous financial year. The Barclay twins, who bought the paper in 2004, have declined to comment. The news of the sale was first reported bythe Times.,external There have been rumours of a sale of the Telegraph for several years, which the owners have consistently denied. Sir David Barclay (L) and his twin brother Sir Frederick received knighthoods in 2000 Sales of the print editions have plummeted in recent years, with the Daily Telegraph averaging a daily circulation of 310,586. The Sunday Telegraph sells, on average, 244,351 copies. A source close to the matter told the BBC the brothers were not under any time pressure to sell the paper, which could happen over the next 12-18 months. No adviser has so far been appointed for the sale but it is expected the Telegraph will be the first asset to be sold. What does the future hold for the Daily Telegraph? Who are the Barclay brothers? Aidan Barclay, 63, and Howard Barclay, 59, are thought to be evaluating the family's businesses on behalf of their father, Sir David Barclay, and his 84-year-old twin Sir Frederick. The brothers also own the Spectator magazine, delivery company Yodel and retailer Shop Direct, which includes online outlets Littlewoods and Very. The Ritz hotel, which is also owned by the Barclay brothers, is already on the market. By Business Correspondent Katie Prescott For newspaper owners, the Barclay twins aren't very media-friendly. They live in the Channel Islands and Monaco - they say - for health reasons, and few photos of them exist. Though the Telegraph newspapers have been struggling with falling circulation and profits, the reason for the sale is understood to be more personal. The brothers are looking to hand over to the next generation of their large family, where there are differing views about the future of the business. There have been rumours over the years that several buyers have expressed an interest, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and the owner of the Independent and Evening Standard, Evgeny Lebedev. Its political ally on the right - the Daily Mail - is also thought to be a contender. Notable columnists for the Telegraph include Sir William Hague, Allison Pearson and Boris Johnson. Before becoming Prime Minister, Mr Johnson earned Â£275,000 for weekly columns between 11 July 2018 and 10 July 2019. Who are the Barclay brothers?

Why are Vietnamese people trying to reach the UK?Essex lorry deaths: What we know,"Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luon are feared to be among the lorry death victims There are fears that at least some of the victims found dead inside a refrigerated lorry in Essex on Wednesday came from Vietnam. Anti-trafficking charities say that many people who travel illegally from Vietnam to the UK are seeking to make money to send back to their families. But why and how do Vietnamese people make such hazardous and potentially life-threatening journeys across the world? ""Vietnam is a booming economy but not everyone is benefitting enormously from that,"" says Giang Nguyen, head of the BBC's Vietnamese Service. ""Vietnam has a huge surplus of labour."" According to the UN,external, while the country has enjoyed significant reductions in poverty at a national level, it is unequal across population groups and regions. The Vietnamese risking it all to get to the UK More Vietnamese families fear relatives among 39 dead ""Most of the migrants who go to Europe and the UK from Vietnam actually only come from a handful of provinces in Vietnam,"" says Mimi Vu, an expert on anti-trafficking in Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh City. The poorer Nghe An province has seen more emigration in recent years ""In these areas there's been a tradition in the past couple of decades of migration overseas, legal or irregular, in order to find work and then sending money home."" During the last decade, migration from Vietnam to the UK originated from the northern city Hai Phong and Quang Ninh province, but more recently there has been the growth of irregular migration from three central provinces, Nghe An, Quang Binh and Ha Tinh, which are comparatively poorer. It has been estimated that networks from Vietnam are smuggling around 18,000 people a year to Europe, but fewer than 1,000 a year to the United States. For Vietnamese migrants, the UK is probably the most popular destination in Europe, says Dr Tamsin Barber, a lecturer in political sociology at Oxford-Brookes University, who specialises in migration and the British-Vietnamese population. They know if they come to the UK they're likely to be able to secure work and possibly quite a lot of money to send back to their families in Vietnam, she says. There's also a wide network of Vietnamese people who are already in the UK who can help newcomers with accommodation and employment. Once they're in the UK, there is high demand for low-skilled labour in Vietnamese restaurants, nail salons and the illicit cannabis industry. Many of those who travel from Vietnam to the UK work in nail bars Interviews with Vietnamese returnees from the UK suggest the majority worked in manual occupations such as agriculture and fishing, but also in seasonal or casual work or running small businesses. Some were unemployed. But, Dr Barber adds, ""there is - at the moment - no legal route in for low-skilled Vietnamese migrants working in the UK, so this is obviously having to be done through very circuitous and precarious journeys"". Ms Vu says prospective migrants can pay a range of prices. For those with less money - $10,000 to $15,000 (Â£7,800 to Â£11,600) - the journey is ""more arduous"" and could, for example, include stints of walking across forests at night. But those who can afford to pay more - $40,000 to $50,000 (Â£31,000 to Â£39,000) - would travel mostly by plane. A sum of Â£30,000 is the equivalent of 30 years' salary for someone living in a rural area in Vietnam, Ms Vu says. It's ""an astronomical sum"", she adds, but some families believe it is worth it ""because they believe this is the best way for them or their child to have a better future"". ""Vietnam is a very family-centric culture and everything is done for the family."" According to the UN, Vietnamese migrants may have generated $300m (Â£234m) a year for smugglers to take them to Europe. To finance the trip, many borrow from family and acquaintances. Some are forced to use the informal credit market, with interest on the loan fluctuating at the whim of the lender. Unsurprisingly, if the journey fails, they would have attempted it again as it's the only way for them to recoup the money. Dr Barber says others may raise the money through selling land or property. Vietnamese families are taking these ""huge risks"" because they ""really view this as their one opportunity to send a family member abroad to earn money,"" she says. Smuggling agents market two type of services to transport migrants to the UK - ""premium"" or ""economy"" - according toresearch by the Independent Anti-slavery Commissioner,external. A premium service is advertised as taking as direct a route as possible with minimal risk. In one case, would-be migrants were given Schengen business visa application papers and a direct flight to Paris, where they were kept in safe houses before travelling to the UK. The cheaper economy option would have taken them several months. ""But no matter what kind of 'class' of travel you choose, you are still going to end up at a border and still going to be snuck in in the back of a lorry or on a ferry,"" Ms Vu says. How are lorries checked for concealed migrants? 'I almost suffocated in the back of a lorry' Most Vietnamese nationals arriving in Europe travel to Russia first before going overland through Eastern Europe. In the past, many victims told the police that they had passed through China en route to the UK. In fact, China, together with France, Russia, Germany and Poland, are among the common transit countries for Vietnamese migrants who attempt to travel to the UK. Many may stop in these transit countries, such as Ukraine or Poland, where they are asked to work in exploitative conditions to either finance the next leg of their journey or make money for their traffickers. The last leg of the journey is likely from France. Here, people could pay a smuggler to be hidden in a secret compartment of a truck, or hide themselves in a truck close to the harbour without the driver noticing. A recent report funded by the Home Office noted Vietnamese who are trafficked for forced labour or sexual exploitation, or willingly smuggled to Europe, are vulnerable to exploitation during their journeys.

Why are Vietnamese people trying to reach the UK?,"Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luon are feared to be among the lorry death victims There are fears that at least some of the victims found dead inside a refrigerated lorry in Essex on Wednesday came from Vietnam. Anti-trafficking charities say that many people who travel illegally from Vietnam to the UK are seeking to make money to send back to their families. But why and how do Vietnamese people make such hazardous and potentially life-threatening journeys across the world? ""Vietnam is a booming economy but not everyone is benefitting enormously from that,"" says Giang Nguyen, head of the BBC's Vietnamese Service. ""Vietnam has a huge surplus of labour."" According to the UN,external, while the country has enjoyed significant reductions in poverty at a national level, it is unequal across population groups and regions. The Vietnamese risking it all to get to the UK More Vietnamese families fear relatives among 39 dead ""Most of the migrants who go to Europe and the UK from Vietnam actually only come from a handful of provinces in Vietnam,"" says Mimi Vu, an expert on anti-trafficking in Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh City. The poorer Nghe An province has seen more emigration in recent years ""In these areas there's been a tradition in the past couple of decades of migration overseas, legal or irregular, in order to find work and then sending money home.""

Rudy Giuliani, personal lawyer to US President Donald Trump, has left two unintended voicemail messages on a reporter's phone, NBC News reports. In the calls, Mr Giuliani reportedly spoke about needing money and attacked Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Mr Giuliani has not yet commented on the calls.

Top Trump aide 'called Giuliani a hand grenade' Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? Three Democratic-led committees are currently investigating whether President Trump tried to pressure Ukraine's president into investigating Mr Biden in exchange for military aid.

Telegraph owners to put paper up for saleBillionaire owners the Barclay twins are reviewing their key assets after slump in papers' profits.UK,"Directors at the Telegraph Media Group said they were 'naturally disappointed' with the profit slump The billionaire owners of the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph are to put both titles up for sale. Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay are understood to be reviewing all of their key assets, which includes the Telegraph Media Group (TMG). Figures published on 17 October showed TMG's profit for the last financial year was Â£900,000 - a 94 per cent drop on the previous financial year. The Barclay twins, who bought the paper in 2004, have declined to comment. The news of the sale was first reported bythe Times.,external There have been rumours of a sale of the Telegraph for several years, which the owners have consistently denied. Sir David Barclay (L) and his twin brother Sir Frederick received knighthoods in 2000 Sales of the print editions have plummeted in recent years, with the Daily Telegraph averaging a daily circulation of 310,586. The Sunday Telegraph sells, on average, 244,351 copies. A source close to the matter told the BBC the brothers were not under any time pressure to sell the paper, which could happen over the next 12-18 months. No adviser has so far been appointed for the sale but it is expected the Telegraph will be the first asset to be sold. What does the future hold for the Daily Telegraph? Who are the Barclay brothers? Aidan Barclay, 63, and Howard Barclay, 59, are thought to be evaluating the family's businesses on behalf of their father, Sir David Barclay, and his 84-year-old twin Sir Frederick. The brothers also own the Spectator magazine, delivery company Yodel and retailer Shop Direct, which includes online outlets Littlewoods and Very. The Ritz hotel, which is also owned by the Barclay brothers, is already on the market. By Business Correspondent Katie Prescott For newspaper owners, the Barclay twins aren't very media-friendly. They live in the Channel Islands and Monaco - they say - for health reasons, and few photos of them exist. Though the Telegraph newspapers have been struggling with falling circulation and profits, the reason for the sale is understood to be more personal. The brothers are looking to hand over to the next generation of their large family, where there are differing views about the future of the business. There have been rumours over the years that several buyers have expressed an interest, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and the owner of the Independent and Evening Standard, Evgeny Lebedev. Its political ally on the right - the Daily Mail - is also thought to be a contender. Notable columnists for the Telegraph include Sir William Hague, Allison Pearson and Boris Johnson. Before becoming Prime Minister, Mr Johnson earned Â£275,000 for weekly columns between 11 July 2018 and 10 July 2019. Who are the Barclay brothers?

How good is the world's most expensive whisky?,"A rare bottle of Scotch whisky hit the headlines this week after it was sold fora world record Â£1.45m at auction in London. The Macallan 1926 60-year-old single malt from cask number 263 had been described by Sotheby's as the ""holy grail"" of whisky. At more than Â£50,000 a dram, you might expect it to taste spectacular. We tracked down one of the few people in the world to have tried the whisky to give us his verdict. David Robertson tasted it a number of times between 1994 and 2000 when he was distillery manager and then master distiller at The Macallan. Mr Robertson, who is now a co-director of whisky experts Rare Whisky 101 (RW101), recalls: ""My boss and I were lucky enough to have a few samples in the nosing room that we had to ensure were 'ok'. ""From memory it was an incredibly rich, intense spirit - full of dried fruits, of prunes and dates and tons of incredible spicy notes of cloves, ginger and cinnamon. ""I also recall zesty orange marmalade, hints of peat and smoke, finished with a delicious drying oak tannin from the sherry cask, and waxy, linseed oil and leather notes."" And his overall verdict? ""It's a great whisky - but I've had better. The Macallan 1979 Gran Reserva, for example, was truly a stunning dram. There are other bottles from other distillers that are at least as good."" The Spanish oak sherry cask was distilled in 1926 and bottled in 1986. Only 40 bottles were produced. Macallan commissioned pop artists Peter Blake and Valerio Adami to design labels for a limited edition of 24 bottles - 12 Adami and 12 Blake. One bottle was hand-painted by Irish artist Michael Dillon. The rest of the bottles form part of The Macallan Fine and Rare Collection, which includes the Macallan 1926. Experts believe at least one of the bottles has been consumed. The new owner of the Macallan 1926, who has not been identified, may never get round to tasting this particular bottle. RW101 co-director Andy Simpson says purchasers of rare whisky fall into three categories - the drinker, the investor and the collector. The 60-year-old Macallan sold for a record Â£1.45m at auction Mr Simpson thinks it unlikely that the bottle was bought to be consumed, given its value. Nor does he think an investor is behind the purchase. He explains: ""The investor is looking to leverage value in a bottle by buying low and selling high, which is clearly not the case here. ""In my opinion - and I could be wrong - this bottle was bought by a collector who simply didn't care about the price because they needed it to complete a collection.""

My pimp branded me with a 'Love is Loyalty' tattoo," The former sex slavestransforming their tattoos By Elaine Jung    Warning: Some readers may find some of these details upsetting For 17 years, Hollie was forced to sleep with countless men by several pimps. Four years ago, she finally escaped from sex trafficking. One of her traffickers, she says, branded her with a tattoo which read  “Love is Loyalty”. It’s what he did to most of the women who worked for him - either that or  “Love is Royalty”. “He wants to put his name on you. Like a keepsake - like you’re his possession. Everybody knows you’re his bitch,” she says. Hollie, 36, was sold into sex slavery at 15 years old, after a childhood of deprivation and abuse. Despite this difficult start in life, Hollie says she initially excelled in school. “It was an escape from my reality. In first grade, there was a teacher with the same last name as me. I used to pretend she was my mother because I longed for a relationship with my [real] mother.” Unable to cope, Hollie’s mother gave her to her own parents to be looked after. “I remember being called ‘a hooker’, ‘a whore’, ‘a worthless piece of shit like my mother’, before I even knew what any of these things meant.” Hollie says that from the age of 12 she was smoking marijuana every day at home, before quickly moving on to harder drugs. “It was my ‘normal’ - that was just what my life was like.” She says she was in and out of juvenile detention centres for misdemeanours like truancy and underage drinking, before finally running away from one at 15 to go back to live with her mother. “It was one of the worst decisions of my life because within two weeks of being there, we were using drugs together. Within a month we were prostituting together.” Hollie says that at a point at which she was vulnerable and tired of being exploited by her mother, she was targeted by a man who asked her to join his team of sex workers. “It looked glamorous - he had fancy jewellery, nice shoes, nice clothes, lots of money and women all around him. It looked like he took care of them and got drugs whenever they wanted it. So, I did it. I joined his team and I entered into hell.” What followed, Hollie says, were years of violence, sexual abuse and death threats. “By the time I was 17 or 18 I had been raped more times than I can count. I’d been kidnapped. I’d been held hostage, stabbed and shot at.” The environment Hollie was working in was extremely violent, and rape is often used by gangs to exert control over their trafficking victims. So for Hollie, the tattoos forced upon her to show her loyalty to the gang became more than just undesirable adornments. They became symbols of years of trauma. Hollie’s finger tattoo - before and after After her escape, she heard about a charity called Survivor’s Ink - which covers  branding tattoos of sex trafficking survivors for free. She went along to choose a design to cover up the “Love is Loyalty” tattoo at the top of her back. “It’s a flower blossoming into a butterfly, soaring into freedom. Because I feel free now. I have the choice to make decisions on my life and where I move next. I never had that before. Somebody was always controlling me like a puppet. And today, nobody controls me.” Hollie’s new back tattoo   Warning: Some readers may find some of these details upsetting For 17 years, Hollie was forced to sleep with countless men by several pimps.

I have the choice to make decisions on my life and where I move next. I never had that before. Somebody was always controlling me like a puppet. And today, nobody controls me.” Hollie’s new back tattoo    Mike Prickett, the tattoo artist who transformed Hollie’s “branding”, says he has been shocked by the number of times he’s been called on to carry out this type of work. “Human trafficking was one of those things that was never really on my radar. It was something that you saw on the news that happened in other countries - not in your backyard.” He has also noticed a disturbing development. “Probably in the past year and a half to two years, [branding tattoos] have become a lot bigger. When I first started, the brandings were maybe a softball size. Now I get more stuff that takes up to five sessions [to cover] rather than just one.” Mike Prickett at work Survivor’s Ink estimates that almost 90% of sex trafficking victims in the US are branded in this way. The charity has overseen the de-branding of about 200 women from Columbus - Ohio’s state capital - and the surrounding area alone. While the most common are tattoos of crowns, dollar bags, gang signs or the words “property of” [followed by the gang name or gangmaster involved], many tattoos are unique to a trafficker-victim relationship. Mary Fischer, who manages Survivor’s Ink, says the tattoos are an abuse tactic. “It’s a demoralising mark to show ownership, a control mechanism to try to convince the victim that their body is not their own: ‘I own your body, I can do whatever I want to your body.’ “I couldn’t believe how many people actually tattooed a name and ‘property’ underneath it. That was very shocking to me.” She says in some cases the tattoos are forced on the women, but sometimes the women themselves want to get them done to prove their loyalty to their pimp, either to give them protection on the streets or as a means of retaining or regaining basic provisions from their gangmaster. “They [the pimps] start out by showing [the women in their gang] a bunch of love, and then they take it away and make them compete to be able to gain just a little bit of that attention back.” Mike says the most upsetting tattoo he has transformed was one of two devils having sex across the lower back of another sex trafficking survivor called Jen. Jen had it replaced shortly after she escaped trafficking in 2015, with a vivid bouquet of flowers - a process that took four long agonising sessions.  Jen's new lower back tattoo She says she assumes her trafficker thought the tattoo would help him make more money. “I guess he thought it would be funny, thought it would be cute.”   For Jeffrey Bagley, a convicted sex trafficker at the Noble Correctional Institution in Ohio, money certainly seems to have been a motivator. Bagley would sell women for at least $125 (£97) a time – with some women meeting up to 12 clients per day. At one point, he was pimping out as many as 50 women. Bagley was convicted in April with another man, Curtis Gossett, for trafficking women and using drugs to control them. Gossett was sentenced to 13 years in jail, Bagley was given 10 years. “Recruiting” women took place on the streets and in some cases directly from jail, Bagley says. He bought a publication at a local shop each week which listed new female prisoners and the offence they had been charged with. He says he would then visit those who had been convicted of soliciting for sex, offering to pay their bail if they agreed to work for him.  The women would then be taken to a hairstylist, given make-up, body products, designer clothes and meals, he says, to make them look good for the photos that were then used to sell them. “We’d get them clothes from [lingerie shop] Victoria’s Secret or wherever. We had a certain house where they could just go sit for a few weeks and get healthy again and eat. “And then after a few weeks, it was time to go to work,” says Bagley. He says that usually the women were advertised on Backpage.com - an online marketplace for selling and buying sex, which was shut down by the FBI in April 2018. Women were also moved across Ohio to be sold during major sporting events like the Kentucky Derby, Bagley says. Hotels near airports were also magnets, “because a lot of our clients were CEOs of big companies that would come in”. The only regret Bagley expresses is for getting caught. He claims the women who worked for him could have stopped whenever they wanted to but he provided them with “the best drugs”. Jeffrey Bagley  “I was pretty much in the same boat they were in. I was getting high just like they were. I did it for the drugs just like they did.” Some 83% of sex trafficking victims in the US are US citizens according to the country’s Department of Justice. The average age of a first-time victim in America is between 12 and 14 years old, according to ECPAT-USA, an NGO seeking to end the exploitation of children. In the US, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act defines sex trafficking as coercing or forcing people into offering commercial sex or recruiting any child under the age of 18 to do so. Polaris, a US project working to eradicate modern slavery, says its National Human Trafficking Hotline received reports of 34,700 sex trafficking cases within the country between 2007 and 2017.  And approximately 3,000 under-age girls are at risk of being trafficked at any given time across Ohio, according to Scott Arnold, executive director of Gracehaven, a Columbus safe house for child victims of sex trafficking. “The first stage happens in their home,” he says. “It can be a mom who is drug addicted and needs to pay for her addiction. It can also be moms who bring men into their home, whether it’s the father - or more often than not a boyfriend - who begin to molest the child and then things go from there. “Another typical path would be a young person who is in relational strain with their family. There could be violence or just an unhappy home life. And so that kid is at risk [of grooming by] an older man who shows up in her life and begins to act and behave like he’s romantically interested. “These kids desperately need help now. Nearly every prostitute that we see was a child once that was trafficked against her will and manipulated into a life. When you see it that way, suddenly you’re horrified on a whole new level.” He says that in countries like the US, because being a sex worker is mostly seen as a choice, there isn’t the sense of crisis about sex trafficking in the public sphere that there should be. “They [the public and the authorities] see the movie Pretty Woman and they think, ‘Wow that’s just a life choice of a person who could choose to get out of at any time.’ That’s just not the way it is.” Hollie says there is also a misguided notion that trafficking is a crime that only takes place across international borders, or as a result of abduction. Despite almost a lifetime of being abused, manipulated and traumatised, Hollie eventually managed to escape her final trafficker. Physically leaving, however, wasn’t the main challenge she says. “I never identified as a human trafficking victim.” She instead describes feeling a “trauma bond” to her traffickers. She says [of one of the men involved]: “I felt like he took care of me even though he would beat me and I’d wake up to him raping me.” She says she even felt love for him at times. “He was there for so long and probably one of the very few people in my life that had been consistent.” Charities tackling human trafficking say a number of trafficking victims display the symptoms of so-called Stockholm syndrome - apsychological conditionin which kidnap victims form an emotional attachment to their captors. Hollie was in and out of jail nearly 50 times on charges of soliciting for sex and drug possession, and during her final spell in prison she began attending a counselling group. She says it gave her a powerful insight into how she might be able to start her life again. “We were going through power, control and manipulation one day, and all these things that these abusers and traffickers are doing to their victims [and] I identified. It was like a light clicked on for me and the fog was removed from my eyes, and I was able to make a choice. I empowered myself.” She heard about a programme in Columbus called Catch [Changing Actions to Change Habits] Court that helps sex trafficking survivors. “While I was sitting in jail I wrote to Catch and asked them if they could save my life.”    Catch Court is a government-funded programme run by the Franklin County Court in Columbus. It redefines women jailed for prostitution or crimes committed for their trafficker as victims and offers them a voluntary path to healing and recovery. That involves two years of intensive probation, requiring a sober home, medically-supported addiction treatment and trauma therapy. Catch Court was set up in 2009 by Judge Paul Herbert, after he noticed a trend in defendants on prostitution charges showing visible signs of abuse. Of over 1,000 women arrested for prostitution in Columbus, Judge Herbert found 92% of them qualified as trafficking victims. He says that while prostitution is often referred to as the world’s oldest profession, for him it’s “the world's oldest oppression of women and girls and vulnerable populations”. Each week for Catch, the women on the programme must report to Courtroom 12C in Columbus to update Judge Herbert on their progress. It’s a day for affirmations, accountability, and celebrating breakthroughs - however small. Over lunch there is laughter and chatter – it’s clear new friendships are forged here. “We are going to love you until you love yourself,” is a phrase that is often passed between them. Women in Catch Court The proceedings are generally informal. Judge Herbert opts for pink shirts rather than his courtroom robe, motivational speakers attend, and he says he tends to “take a step back”. “By the time the handcuffs come off, we’re hoping that [the trafficking survivor] looks forward to coming to court and being part of that camaraderie,” he says. Catch Court says its recidivism rate is much lower than the national average. Judge Herbert attributes much of this to rigorous trauma therapy. “A woman is using drugs to medicate her trauma and then she winds up having to sell her body to get the drugs to medicate the trauma. We found that once you settle that trauma down, they don’t want to use drugs any more. The trauma is at the root of their drug addiction, rather than their drug addiction driving everything.” Sex workers receive care packages  Hollie left prison in 2015 on Christmas Day. “It was my birthday, and it was the first day of my brand-new life. I haven’t looked back since I did intense trauma therapy and intense drug treatment. I did that for a year and focused only on getting my life together.” Early on in her recovery, Hollie became involved in a non-profit organisation called Reaching for the Shining Starz, that hands out weekly care packages to possible victims of sex trafficking. She quickly became its executive director.  The first time she went out with the group to volunteer, she noticed a young woman asleep on a street corner in the freezing cold. Handing her a care package, she realised with horror that it was her younger sister Rosie. “Tears just started flowing,” she says. “It was the first time I had seen her in a year and a half and it was the most horrifying thing. The last time I’d seen her, she was about 100 pounds heavier and looked so vibrant and beautiful. The woman in front of me had pock marks all over her face, track marks all over her arm, was soaking wet and had a black eye. “I felt like I caused this because my mother brought me into the lifestyle, I was in the lifestyle, I probably made it look really glamorous and I brought her into the lifestyle. And I brought her into her own living hell.” Like Hollie, most of Rosie’s childhood had been one of abuse and being trafficked. Hollie visited Rosie each week to hand her a care package. It took more than a year of gentle persuasion before Rosie decided to leave her destructive life behind. “I felt trapped and I honestly thought that I wasn’t going to make it out. I thought that I was going to die out here on these streets and that’s really what I believed. Today I'm just amazed with how far I’ve come,” Rosie says, smiling. Rosie and Hollie  Rosie, now 27, graduated from Catch Court in September and is working at Freedom a la Cart, a catering company that only employs survivors of sex trafficking. The sisters have moved in together and spend time with each other most weekends. “She’s my best friend and my little sister, and I missed not having her in my life for so long,” says Hollie.   Hollie secured a scholarship to study communications at Ohio State University and is now considering a law degree. For now she is back in court – not as a criminal but as a legal advocate for victims of domestic violence at the prosecutor’s office. She describes it as her “greatest opportunity” and notes the irony. “Five years ago I was being prosecuted and sentenced to prison, and today I work for and with prosecutors,” she laughs. She also volunteers in Judge Herbert’s courtroom and continues to mingle with fellow survivors. And she is planning another tattoo - a starfish. She says it is a reference to a story, originally written by anthropologist and  natural science writer Loren Eiseley, about a little boy on a beach where hundreds of starfish have washed ashore. As he picks them up and throws them back into the sea, an adult comes over to remind him that he can’t save them all. “He picks up another and throws it back saying: ‘Well I just saved that one’. “If I’ve made a difference in one person’s world - that’s all that matters to me. I can’t save the world. I’ll probably never end human trafficking, but my intention is to get plenty of people to rally around me so that I can make a dent.” Watch the documentary:Surviving Sex Trafficking Broadcast times onBBC World News: Sat 7 Dec 2019 - 0910 GMT Sun 8 Dec 2019 - 1510 GMT  Hollie is one of the BBC’s 100 Women of 2019.

Parents urge action over 'sick' fundraising scam,"Darci died of leukaemia last year A grieving couple who discovered a fake GoFundMe page had been set up in the name of their dead daughter say the problem needs to be taken seriously. Amanda and Graeme Jackson, from Kirkcaldy in Fife, lost their six-year-old daughter Darci to cancer last year. They had created a GoFundMe page to raise money for vital treatments but she died before it could be used. As they were making funeral arrangements, the couple found a fake page using Darci's images and story. Hundreds of pounds had been donated to the fraudulent campaign. Graeme said he made the ""sick"" discovery when the couple were in the midst of terrible grief. Amanda and Graeme Jackson lost their daughter Darci last year ""Scammers are going to scam, but to go to that low level and scam a dead child's page is unbelievable,"" he toldBBC Scotland's The Nine. His wife added: ""You can't fathom that another person would do such as thing. It's absolutely vile."" The couple described their daughter as ""an incredibly fun-loving, sassy, determined, brave, special little girl"". They had launched the fundraising campaign to pay for potentially life-saving treatment in the US for her acute lymphoblasic leukaemia but she died days later. The money raised was never withdrawn by the Jacksons and all donors were refunded Her parents said Darci was fun-loving, sassy and determined The fake funding appeal was discovered as they prepared to bury her. Graeme said: ""Going through the pain of losing your daughter is hard enough without someone setting up a fake page that you have then to deal with."" The Jackson's alerted GoFundMe and the company removed the page and passed the details to police. However, the police investigation was eventually dropped. Although officers were able to trace the IP address responsible, they were not able to identify a suspect. Amanda said: ""If there were consequences to carrying out these kinds of things then it might make people stop and think about doing it. There is no deterrent at all."" Her husband said websites such as GoFundMe were often a ""good thing"" but when fake pages were set up more needed to be done about it. The people who donated to the scammed account were all refunded by GoFundMe. Darci's images were used by a fake fundraising page It said it had the strongest and most effective processes in the market for dealing with fake pages. John Coventry, GoFundMe's European director, said fraud was rare. He said: ""If you say we have about 75,000 campaigns a year, you are talking about maybe five confirmed cases of fraud each year, which is really quite low. ""The thing about any financial technology products is people are constantly trying to beat the system and we are constantly trying to beat them. ""We put almost a third of our company's resources into trust and safety. That's a huge investment on our part and we are continually working to make the system safer to make sure we eliminate fraud entirely.""

'England produce finest performance of their lives',"This video can not be played Watch the best moments in England's win over All Blacks This time, against New Zealand in a stone-cold World Cup classic, there was no need to go toboundaries scored. If England have ever produceda better 80 minutes of rugby unionthen no-one dancing round Yokohama or screaming the sofas down back home could care to remember it. It was supposed to be close. It was supposed to be the All Blacks, because it is almost always the All Blacks, going back through the years at Twickenham and Auckland and all points in between. And yet it was comfortable, in an excruciating sort of way, if you ignore the dread tension of being up and ahead from the second minute against a side who routinely make late comebacks like other teams make touch. And if you could watch George Ford's penalties arcing towards the posts while still breathing, and watch the percussive demolition hits of Sam Underhill, Tom Curry and Maro Itoje without grabbing your own ribs and wincing. Maro Itoje was named player of the match as England's pack dominated their All Black counterparts From the first minute to the last England were demonstrably the superior team. There's a decent argument they also won the time before then too; when you can stare down the haka and grin, as Owen Farrell did, or stroll towards it like a man off to the bar, as Joe Marler did. There was no fear when so many down the years have quaked. England made All Blacks look like 'they hadn't a clue' - pundit reaction Report: England reach World Cup final England had to stand up to haka - Farrell Never before have New Zealand conceded a World Cup try as early as Manu Tuilagi's second-minute score. Only once before have they been kept scoreless in the first half of a World Cup match. It is 18 games - across 12 years -  since they were beaten in this tournament, and this was only a second loss to England in 17 meetings. Yet on a night of the gloriously strange, the most nonsensical stat of all was also among the most startling: the three-time world champions scored fewer points thanLeicester did away goals against Southamptonthe night before. To tip the All Blacks from their throne, even the most ebullient among England's support thought half their team would have to produce the finest performance of their lives. This video can not be played England can play better in the final - Jones And so it came to pass: Ford and Underhill and Curry and Itoje all at dreamy, terrifying peak that left black shirts retreating and panicking and doing all the things they usually dish out to others. Steve Hansen picked Scott Barrett to dominate the line-out. England owned the airwaves instead, except for the one ghastly moment when Ardie Savea was gifted the chance to bring a game that could have been 17 points distant back to a six-pointer. The biggest Barrett was hooked at half-time, Sam Cane thrown on with the game half-gone, the Kiwi breakdown a shellshocked mess. Curry and Underhill went at the wreckage like some kind of demonic twins. There was nothing kamikaze about it. It was the death-knell instead for a team that had cut Ireland apart in the quarter-finals with quick ball and who love to slow that of their opposition so they can get up fast and flat and shut everything else off. In total England won 16 turnovers. No team has won more at this World Cup. The last time England managed as many in the tournament was back in 1987, against Japan, when there were 4,893 spectators watching, which gives you some sort of idea how remarkable the comparison is. Breakdown won, set-piece won, discipline won. England conceded just six penalties to the All Blacks' 11. But it was impossible to find an area in which England were not out in front. They were faster and they were more precise. They kicked from hand better, and they tackled in the way that wrecking-balls meet walls. All Blacks lost to the better side - Hansen England can play better in final - Eddie Jones, Vunipola & Itoje on historic win This video can not be played 'I'll give you a rugby education outside' - All Blacks coach angered by question The team got it all right and so did their coach Eddie Jones. Right in bringing back Ford, right in resisting the temptation to buttress his line-out with another jumper in place of the relentless Curry, right with the conditioning that allowed his picks to keep going at a pace that first stretched the black-shirted resolve and then broke it. A first World Cup final since 2007 but done in such a contrasting way. England in Paris 12 years ago were a gutsy collection of old warriors and stalwarts who refused to beaten. They won games through the last true international hurrah of Jonny Wilkinson and disbanded quietly once coldly dismantled by South Africa in the final. This is a young team that is accelerating into world-beating maturity before our eyes, a squad that shipped 31 second-half points against Scotland as recently as last March and finished a dismal fifth in the Six Nations a year before, now pushing back fresh boundaries with every game that comes. Manu Tuilagi's second-minute try was his sixth of 2019 from centre The only England team to ever win the Webb-Ellis trophy arrived at the tournament in 2003 as the best team in the world and held their position on the curve just long enough to make it count when it truly mattered. This one shows no sign of stalling. Jones has had some luck in having Tuilagi and both Vunipolas fit when Stuart Lancaster lost two of the three four years ago. He has reaped the harvest that Lancaster sowed in giving debuts to a young Farrell, and Ford, and May, and Slade. But he is taking that raw mix and turning it into something special. At a time of financial crisis the RFU bet the house on Jones. He has now narrowed the odds in a way that many doubted he could. No-one is remembered for winning a semi-final. Should all this momentum, hope and belief come crashing down in the same stadium in a week's time then Saturday's triumph will fade and pale. Yet as Hey Jude and Wonderwall blasted out around the two tiers of blue seats on Saturday evening, and white shirts in the stands cavorted and bellowed along, it was all about the now and this night. The kings are dead, their throne empty. Next week can wait for another dawn.

Police ask Vietnamese to help identify lorry dead,"The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Efforts to identify 39 bodies found inside a lorry are focusing on the Vietnamese community, police have said, as officers seek to establish whether a ""wider conspiracy"" was involved. Eight women and 31 men were discovered in Grays, Essex, on Wednesday. Det Ch Insp Martin Pasmore said he remained ""open-minded"" about the nationalities of the victims. A fifth person has been arrested in connection with the deaths, while four suspects remain in custody. The victims - whom police initially believed to be Chinese nationals - were inside a refrigerated trailer which came to the UK via the port of Zeebrugge. Essex Police said there had been a ""large amount of engagement"" from the Vietnamese population since the discovery. VietHome, an organisation that represents the Vietnamese community in the UK, said it had received photos of nearly 20 people reported missing. In Vietnam, Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam said he had been told of ""more than 100"" people who left the Yen Thanh province ""on their way to a new life"". Families from the area believed their relatives were victims of the ""tragic journey"", he said. This video can not be played Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam says he has spoken with families who believe their relatives may be victims Det Ch Insp Pasmore, who is leading the Essex force's identification efforts, said the bodies had been removed from the trailer and taken to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. Those inside were carrying ""very few"" identity documents, leaving officers to rely on fingerprints, DNA and distinguishing features such as tattoos or scars, he said. Appealing to the Vietnamese community, Det Ch Insp Pasmore said people in the UK illegally may be concerned for a relative but fearful of approaching the police. He said Essex Police would ""take no action whatsoever"" against those who come forward. How is a dead body identified? How are lorries checked for concealed migrants? 'I almost suffocated in the back of a lorry' Essex lorry deaths: What we know Det Ch Insp Pasmore said he had also met the Vietnamese Ambassador to the UK, who had vowed to help with the identification process. Addressing a press conference, he said he was unable to comment on ""investigative elements"" of the case. However, he said there were ""lines of inquiry that are set of course to establish whether or not there are wider conspiracies involved in this"". ""It must be clear that criminals, murderers are taking more and more chances with these vulnerable people and the risk is massive,"" he said. The families of Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong are concerned they may be among the victims The BBC has also been contacted by Vietnamese families who fear their relatives were among the dead. The last message from Pham Thi Tra My, 26, was sent to her family at 22:30 BST on Tuesday - two hours before the trailer arrived at the Purfleet terminal from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Her family have shared texts she sent to her parents which, translated, read: ""I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed. ""I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother."" Nguyen Dinh Gia, believes his son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20 was also among the 39 victims. He said he had not heard from his son since he said he was joining a group in Paris to try and reach the UK last week. Mr Luong's brother, Nguyen Dinh Oanh, wanted to warn others against making similar dangerous journeys. ""My advice to them is stay at home, work hard enough just to make a reasonable living. ""We want the money but we value the human life more."" In Ireland, a man in his 20s considered of ""interest"" to the Essex Police investigation was arrested in Dublin. An Garda Siochana (Irish Police) said they had detained the suspect in relation to ""an outstanding court order"" connected to an offence in the Republic of Ireland. Three others were arrested on Friday on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people. A 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland was detained at Stansted Airport and a couple from Warrington, Joanna and Thomas Maher, were arrested in Cheshire. Before their arrest, the couple denied having anything to do with the lorry and told reporters they sold it last year. The driver of the lorry, Mo Robinson, has been held on suspicion of murder since Wednesday. Police have been given extra time to question the 25-year-old of County Armagh. The lorry driver has been named locally as Mo Robinson, from County Armagh The trailer arrived in Purfleet on the River Thames from Zeebrugge in Belgium at 00:30 BST on Wednesday. It left the port shortly after 01:05 the same day and the bodies were discovered at Waterglade Industrial Park about 35 minutes later. Police in Belgium are trying to trace the route of the trailer and the driver who delivered it to Zeebrugge. ""We would like people to be arrested as soon as possible,"" said a spokesman for the Belgian prosecutor's office. By Lucy Williamson BBC News, northern France An hour's drive inland from the French coast, a dozen Vietnamese men nurse tea over a smoking campfire, as they wait for a phone call from the man they call ""the boss"". An Afghan man, they say, who opens trailers in the lorry-park nearby and shuts them inside. Duc paid â¬30,000 ($33,200; Â£25,000) for a prepaid journey from Vietnam to London - via Russia, Poland, Germany and France. It was organised, he says, by a Vietnamese contact back home. ""I have some Vietnamese friends in UK, who will help me find jobs when I get there,"" he told me. ""These friends help me get on lorries or container trucks to go across the border.""

Prayers have been said for her during a service in Yen Thanh, in the northern central coast region of Vietnam. Tran Ngoc An, the Vietnamese ambassador to the UK, visited Grays on Saturday morning with embassy officers and held meetings with Essex Police and the local council. The ambassador has also spoken to Home Secretary Priti Patel about the deaths. In a statement, the embassy said there was a ""willingness to exchange information and to co-ordinate"" with British authorities to help identify the victims. It added that there had been no official confirmation of the identity of the victims. The Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said he had asked the relevant authorities to urgently establish the identities of victims and look into the cases of Vietnamese nationals who were sent abroad illegally.

British backpacker missing after Cambodia party,"Amelia Bambridge's sister Georgie (right) said the family were trying to be strong A British student who disappeared after a beach party on a Cambodian island has been reported missing. Amelia Bambridge, 21, who was on her gap year, was last seen in the resort of Koh Rong on Wednesday. Members of her family, from Worthing, Sussex, flew from the UK to Cambodia where searches of the sea, beaches and jungle have begun.

Police question four suspects over lorry deaths,"The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Efforts to identify 39 bodies found inside a lorry are focusing on the Vietnamese community, police have said, as officers seek to establish whether a ""wider conspiracy"" was involved. Eight women and 31 men were discovered in Grays, Essex, on Wednesday. Det Ch Insp Martin Pasmore said he remained ""open-minded"" about the nationalities of the victims. A fifth person has been arrested in connection with the deaths, while four suspects remain in custody. The victims - whom police initially believed to be Chinese nationals - were inside a refrigerated trailer which came to the UK via the port of Zeebrugge. Essex Police said there had been a ""large amount of engagement"" from the Vietnamese population since the discovery. VietHome, an organisation that represents the Vietnamese community in the UK, said it had received photos of nearly 20 people reported missing. In Vietnam, Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam said he had been told of ""more than 100"" people who left the Yen Thanh province ""on their way to a new life"". Families from the area believed their relatives were victims of the ""tragic journey"", he said. This video can not be played Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam says he has spoken with families who believe their relatives may be victims Det Ch Insp Pasmore, who is leading the Essex force's identification efforts, said the bodies had been removed from the trailer and taken to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. Those inside were carrying ""very few"" identity documents, leaving officers to rely on fingerprints, DNA and distinguishing features such as tattoos or scars, he said. Appealing to the Vietnamese community, Det Ch Insp Pasmore said people in the UK illegally may be concerned for a relative but fearful of approaching the police. He said Essex Police would ""take no action whatsoever"" against those who come forward. How is a dead body identified? How are lorries checked for concealed migrants? 'I almost suffocated in the back of a lorry' Essex lorry deaths: What we know Det Ch Insp Pasmore said he had also met the Vietnamese Ambassador to the UK, who had vowed to help with the identification process. Addressing a press conference, he said he was unable to comment on ""investigative elements"" of the case. However, he said there were ""lines of inquiry that are set of course to establish whether or not there are wider conspiracies involved in this"". ""It must be clear that criminals, murderers are taking more and more chances with these vulnerable people and the risk is massive,"" he said. The families of Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong are concerned they may be among the victims The BBC has also been contacted by Vietnamese families who fear their relatives were among the dead. The last message from Pham Thi Tra My, 26, was sent to her family at 22:30 BST on Tuesday - two hours before the trailer arrived at the Purfleet terminal from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Her family have shared texts she sent to her parents which, translated, read: ""I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed. ""I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother."" Nguyen Dinh Gia, believes his son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20 was also among the 39 victims. He said he had not heard from his son since he said he was joining a group in Paris to try and reach the UK last week. Mr Luong's brother, Nguyen Dinh Oanh, wanted to warn others against making similar dangerous journeys. ""My advice to them is stay at home, work hard enough just to make a reasonable living. ""We want the money but we value the human life more."" In Ireland, a man in his 20s considered of ""interest"" to the Essex Police investigation was arrested in Dublin. An Garda Siochana (Irish Police) said they had detained the suspect in relation to ""an outstanding court order"" connected to an offence in the Republic of Ireland. Three others were arrested on Friday on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people. A 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland was detained at Stansted Airport and a couple from Warrington, Joanna and Thomas Maher, were arrested in Cheshire. Before their arrest, the couple denied having anything to do with the lorry and told reporters they sold it last year. The driver of the lorry, Mo Robinson, has been held on suspicion of murder since Wednesday. Police have been given extra time to question the 25-year-old of County Armagh. The lorry driver has been named locally as Mo Robinson, from County Armagh The trailer arrived in Purfleet on the River Thames from Zeebrugge in Belgium at 00:30 BST on Wednesday. It left the port shortly after 01:05 the same day and the bodies were discovered at Waterglade Industrial Park about 35 minutes later. Police in Belgium are trying to trace the route of the trailer and the driver who delivered it to Zeebrugge. ""We would like people to be arrested as soon as possible,"" said a spokesman for the Belgian prosecutor's office. By Lucy Williamson BBC News, northern France An hour's drive inland from the French coast, a dozen Vietnamese men nurse tea over a smoking campfire, as they wait for a phone call from the man they call ""the boss"". An Afghan man, they say, who opens trailers in the lorry-park nearby and shuts them inside. Duc paid â¬30,000 ($33,200; Â£25,000) for a prepaid journey from Vietnam to London - via Russia, Poland, Germany and France. It was organised, he says, by a Vietnamese contact back home. ""I have some Vietnamese friends in UK, who will help me find jobs when I get there,"" he told me. ""These friends help me get on lorries or container trucks to go across the border.""

Parents urge action over 'sick' fundraising scamA couple who found a fake GoFundMe page in the name of their dead six-year-old daughter want the problem tackled.Scotland,"Darci died of leukaemia last year A grieving couple who discovered a fake GoFundMe page had been set up in the name of their dead daughter say the problem needs to be taken seriously. Amanda and Graeme Jackson, from Kirkcaldy in Fife, lost their six-year-old daughter Darci to cancer last year. They had created a GoFundMe page to raise money for vital treatments but she died before it could be used. As they were making funeral arrangements, the couple found a fake page using Darci's images and story. Hundreds of pounds had been donated to the fraudulent campaign. Graeme said he made the ""sick"" discovery when the couple were in the midst of terrible grief. Amanda and Graeme Jackson lost their daughter Darci last year ""Scammers are going to scam, but to go to that low level and scam a dead child's page is unbelievable,"" he toldBBC Scotland's The Nine. His wife added: ""You can't fathom that another person would do such as thing. It's absolutely vile."" The couple described their daughter as ""an incredibly fun-loving, sassy, determined, brave, special little girl"". They had launched the fundraising campaign to pay for potentially life-saving treatment in the US for her acute lymphoblasic leukaemia but she died days later. The money raised was never withdrawn by the Jacksons and all donors were refunded Her parents said Darci was fun-loving, sassy and determined The fake funding appeal was discovered as they prepared to bury her. Graeme said: ""Going through the pain of losing your daughter is hard enough without someone setting up a fake page that you have then to deal with."" The Jackson's alerted GoFundMe and the company removed the page and passed the details to police. However, the police investigation was eventually dropped. Although officers were able to trace the IP address responsible, they were not able to identify a suspect. Amanda said: ""If there were consequences to carrying out these kinds of things then it might make people stop and think about doing it. There is no deterrent at all."" Her husband said websites such as GoFundMe were often a ""good thing"" but when fake pages were set up more needed to be done about it. The people who donated to the scammed account were all refunded by GoFundMe. Darci's images were used by a fake fundraising page It said it had the strongest and most effective processes in the market for dealing with fake pages. John Coventry, GoFundMe's European director, said fraud was rare. He said: ""If you say we have about 75,000 campaigns a year, you are talking about maybe five confirmed cases of fraud each year, which is really quite low. ""The thing about any financial technology products is people are constantly trying to beat the system and we are constantly trying to beat them. ""We put almost a third of our company's resources into trust and safety. That's a huge investment on our part and we are continually working to make the system safer to make sure we eliminate fraud entirely.""

Pentagon snubs Amazon for $10bn 'Jedi' contract,"The Pentagon wants to replace ageing computer networks with a single cloud system The Pentagon has awarded a $10bn (Â£8bn) cloud-computing contract to Microsoft, following a heavily scrutinised bidding process in which Amazon had been seen as the favourite. The 10-year contract for the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure, or Jedi, is aimed at making the US defence department more technologically agile. Amazon's bid drew criticism from its rivals and US President Donald Trump. The company said it was ""surprised"" by the decision. A ""detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings"" would ""clearly lead to a different conclusion"", it said. Amazon is said to be evaluating its options after the decision. It has 10 days to decide whether or not to launch a challenge. In its statement, the Pentagon said all offers ""were treated fairly"". Microsoft executive Toni Townes-Whitley said the company was ""proud"" to have had its cloud technologies picked by the Department of Defense to ""satisfy the urgent and critical needs of today's warfighters"". The Department of Defense wants to replace its ageing computer networks with a single cloud system. Under the contract, Microsoft will provide artificial intelligence-based analysis and host classified military secrets among other services. Pentagon pushes pause on $10bn AI tech deal Google drops $10bn battle for Pentagon data It is hoped that Jedi will give the military better access to data and the cloud from battlefields. Amazon had been considered the front-runner - until President Trump began questioning whether the process was fair. In July he told reporters that he was getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and Amazon"". Microsoft had not been considered the front-runner He said other companies had told him that the contract ""wasn't competitively bid"" and that his administration would ""take a very long look"" at the process. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post newspaper - in the past. Dan Ives, managing director and equity analyst Wedbush Securities, said he expected Amazon and others to challenge the decision in the courts, but called it a ""paradigm changer"" for Microsoft. The move was likely to boost Microsoft's share price and bring ""significant positive financial implications"" for the company in the coming years, he said. By Leo Kelion, BBC Technology desk editor Amazon will be bitterly disappointed to have lost this contract, having long considered its bid to be the stronger. But after President Trump's comments about ""receiving tremendous complaints"" about Amazon's frontrunner status in July, and then the delay to announcing the award the following month, it had always looked liked Microsoft could pull off an upset. The timing is curious, however, coming just days after Defence Secretary Mark Esper unexpectedly removed himself from the review process after months of involvement, on the grounds that one of his sons worked for IBM - one of the other original applicants. It means Microsoft is now set to be a huge recipient of Department of Defense funds. Not only will it benefit from Jedi, but also a separate multi-billion dollar contract known as Deos. This has run into delays of its own, but is still set to result in the DoD using cloud-based Office 365 for its email, calendar, video-calling and other productivity software needs. One issue for Microsoft is whether its closeness to the military will cause it problems. Some ofits own workers have already objected to it developing a version of its Hololens augmented reality headset for the US military,external, and the idea of it now providing machine learning tools and other systems to help ""enhance force lethality"" could prove to be a PR nightmare. For Amazon, if the loss of such a lucrative contract is linked to Jeff Bezos's ownership of the Washington Post, it could fuel calls for AWS to be spun off from its parent and established as a separate company. There had already been speculation this might happen in order to head off regulators' concerns that Amazon already extends too deeply into Americans' lives. The announcement marked the end of a long process that had pitted tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and IBM against each other. As the world's biggest provider of cloud-computing services, Amazon had been the favourite to win Jedi. But its competitors argued that the process was unfair. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos Oracle challenged the bidding process in federal court earlier this year, saying that it was rigged to favour Amazon, but a federal judge dismissed the allegation. It said that it had awarded more than $11bn in 10 separate cloud-computing contracts over the past two years. The Jedi deal ""continues our strategy of a multi-vendor, multi-cloud environment as the department's needs are diverse and cannot be met by any single supplier,"" it added.

Claire Foy and Matt Smith: A successful re-coupling?Lungs turns the highly personal into the powerfully political: it lays the issue of our age at our door.,"You can imagine the casting conversation down at the Old Vic theatre in London when they decided to reprise Duncan Macmillan's play Lungs: a two-hander featuring a right-on young couple thinking about settling down... Senior Creative [SC]: So, we're after a box office pairing the public would love (pay) to see reunited. Junior Creative [JC]: What about Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio? SC: Great idea! [pauses to think] A bit old, maybe? JC: Okay, how about Letitia Wright and Daniel Kaluuya? SC: Another awesome suggestion! But is she old enough? JC: Ooh, ooh, oohâ¦ I've got it! This is brilliant! SC: Pray tell. JC: Claire Foy and Matt Smith! SC: Perfect! You. Are. A. Genius! Book 'em! And so it came pass - probably not quite like that - the two British actors who formed a dream team double-act in The Crown for Netflix as The Queen and Prince Philip were reunited to play another young couple trying to work out their place in the world. This time around tiaras and Buckingham Palace have been traded-in for trainers and IKEA, but they are essentially dealing with the same issues of love, commitment, betrayal, duty, compromise and existential anxiety. There's none of the expensive paraphernalia that came with The Crown such as lavish sets and a large supporting cast. Claire Foy as the Queen and Matt Smith as Prince Philip received critical acclaim for their performances in The Crown In Lungs, Matt Smith and Claire Foy play an unnamed couple who wrestle with the big issues of climate change and having children in an overpopulated world In Lungs the stage is almost bare; the actors don't have a prop to call their own. It is entirely down to their talents to bring to life Duncan Macmillan's words in an 80-minute play in which they are constantly on the stage bantering to-and-fro without an interval to catch their breath. It's a tall order, made slightly easier by the sheer quality and directness of the writing and their palpable stage chemistry. Foy is superb as the doubting yet strident left-leaning intellectual with a PhD who is at once perceptive and blindly self-absorbed. Smith does what he did as Prince Philip in The Crown, which is to play Foy's foil. Here, he is a struggling musician intimidated by his partner's intelligence and rhetorical ferocity. The full force of which is evident in the opening exchange caused by his unwitting decision to wonder aloud if they should have a child together. Big mistake. She is staggered by his thoughtlessness, impudence, and lazy arrogance. ""It's like you punch me in the face and then asked me a maths question"" is one of the many ways she describes the effect of his casual conversation opener while they queued in IKEA. He tries to put the pin back in the grenade but it's too late. Before he knows it she is telling him that his predatory countenance when they are in the throes of passion freaks her out, ""Sometimes it looks like you are going to hack off my limbs and bury me in the woods."" He tries back-peddling, and then justifying, and eventually - when all else fails - agreeing. Matt Smith and Claire Foy during rehearsal It's like watching a boxing match in which one fighter is clearly stronger and more assertive while the other ducks and dives and seeks a way out by fair means or foul. Into this semi-comic world of domestic disharmony Macmillan introduces the underlying theme of his decade-old play (first professionally staged in 2011), which is the negative impact we gas-guzzling humans are having on the planet. Foy's character wants to know if she and he can still be ""good people"" if they decide to have a child, which she says will have a lifetime carbon footprint amounting to 10,000 tonnes of CO2, ""That's the weight of the Eiffel Tower. I'd be giving birth to the Eiffel Tower."" It's a great line from which you can extrapolate the bigger question being asked: can we in the wealthy West ever be ""good"" when our privilege is at the expense of others and the planet? It is a subject that deeply troubles the playwright who wrote this ""end of days"" play in a single night having put aside a more complex concept. Playwright Duncan Macmillan says since he wrote Lungs, the threat of climate change has grown, but as a parent, he ""doesn't feel as if despair is an option"" It is a good piece of work. But unlike his excellent subsequent plays like Every Brilliant Thing and People, Places, Things - which deal with depression and addiction respectively - Lungs runs out of breath about two-thirds of the way through. The witty repartee between Foy and Smith pales, the unevenness of their relationship loses credibility. That said, it is a bold and invigorating idea to focus their entire relationship on the single issue of procreation in the form of a discussion taking place over years but presented as one seamless conversation (a time-shifting exercise beautifully executed by director Matthew Warchus). The upside for Macmillan is it allows him to highlight what he considers to be the ""thing that makes drama interesting"", which is, ""present-tense decision-making."" The downside is it ends up leaving the characters boxed in and the story with nowhere to go. Foy's character gets bigger but predictable, Smith's smaller and boring. The piece eventually peters out. But not before landing some heavy blows. Lungs turns the highly personal - deciding to have a child - into the powerfully political: it lays the issue of our age at our door. And it does so with biting wit, a sense of urgency and an appropriate level of high anxiety, all expertly delivered by the two actors. More Claire Foy and Matt Smith combos please.

Leicester smash nine past SouthamptonLeicester City equal the record for the biggest ever Premier League victory.BBC SportComments,"Jamie Vardy's hat-trick sees him become the Premier League's top scorer, moving above Sergio Aguero and Tammy Abraham Leicester City equalled the 24-year-old record for the biggest ever Premier League victory as 10-man Southampton were dismantled at a rainswept St Mary's. The victory sees Brendan Rodgers' side climb into second place, leapfrogging Manchester City and moving five points behind leaders Liverpool. The result, which matches Manchester United's 9-0 win against Ipswich in 1995, was only confirmed in stoppage time thanks to Jamie Vardy's penalty. Both Vardy and Ayoze Perez scored hat-tricks, with the visitors aided by Ryan Bertrand's red card for a reckless challenge on Perez in the build-up to Ben Chilwell's opener. That opened the floodgates for Leicester, who turned on the style just two days before the first anniversary of the helicopter crash that killed the club's former chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four other people. Youri Tielemans also scored his third goal of the campaign and James Maddison added a superb free-kick on a miserable evening for Southampton, who drop into the bottom three. On a landmark night, Leicester also: recorded the biggest ever victory by an away side in an English top-flight league match in the 131-year history of the Football League inflicted Southampton's biggest ever defeat as an English league side in all competitions in their history became only the second team in Premier League history to establish a five-goal lead in the first half of an away game in the competition, after Manchester City against Burnley in April 2010 (also 5-0) became only the second side in Premier League history to have two players score a hat-trick in the same game (Perez and Vardy), after Arsenal in May 2003 - also against Southampton (Pennant and Pires) Leicester 'here to stay at top' - Chilwell Saints boss Hasenhuttl takes '100% responsibility' for defeat Leicester may have played a game more than Liverpool but this emphatic result means that they have now scored more goals than the league leaders and are just four behind Manchester City. And the omens look good for Rodgers' side who have now collected one point more from the opening 10 games of the current season than at the same stage of their title-winning campaign in 2015-16. With trips to Crystal Palace and Brighton on the horizon either side of hosting Arsenal, Leicester have every chance to kick on from their strong start, but given the strength and form of Liverpool and Manchester City, a title challenge appears unlikely. This video can not be played Rodgers delighted with 'ruthlessly simple' Leicester But the manner in which the Foxes ruthlessly cut through the hosts will nevertheless serve as a warning to others, with their three goals inside the opening 19 minutes the fastest they have amassed that scoreline in a Premier League match since 1998. Also working in Leicester's favour is the attacking menace still being provided by Vardy. While the forward is approaching his 33rd birthday, there are few signs, if any, that his physical capabilities are waning and he looked as sprightly as ever as he recorded his first hat-trick for almost three years. His first showed nimbleness and awareness as he cut inside Saints defender Maya Yoshida to drill a close-range effort into the bottom corner, while his second showcased smart movement as he headed past Angus Gunn from close range. His trademark blistering pace then took him clear of the Southampton defence to win and convert a late penalty. His exploits were also complemented by Perez, who opened his account for the season after finding the bottom-right corner following a neat one-two with Tielemans. The Spaniard then superbly swept home Chilwell's pinpoint cross for his second before finding the bottom corner with a left-footed shot to complete his treble. Football Daily podcast: It's raining goals... for Leicester Reaction to Leicester's record-equalling victory at Southampton At the start of the evening Southampton's focus was purely on ending a barren run of seven games without a home win dating back to April. But by half-time manager Ralph Hasenhuttl had changed tack considerably, by simply trying to avoid any further embarrassment. The Austrian, who at times appeared exasperated and spent much of the interval sitting in his technical area, introduced Kevin Danso and Jack Stephens to replace Jannik Vestergaard and Danny Ings, but it was too little to late. This video can not be played Southampton 0-9 Leicester: Hasenhuttl apologises for Saints 'disaster' With the crowd visibly thinning in the second period, Hasenhuttl must now hope the scale of this defeat has not eroded the confidence of his players too much. While the Saints are a couple of points better off than at the same time last term, they appear in danger of being dragged into another relegation fight. And their road to redemption is unlikely to be an easy one with their next two fixtures away at Manchester City in both the Carabao Cup and Premier League. Perez became the first player since Luis Suarez v Norwich City (2012) to score a hat-trick in back-to-back Premier League appearances against the same opposition, having done so for his former club Newcastle as they beat the Saints 3-1 at St James' Park in April Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""I'm very pleased to see our work rate, we scored some great goals and we were very hungry tonight. It was horrible weather but our focus was outstanding. I'm very pleased how we defended, and we were ruthless. I'm very proud to stand and be the manager of that team. ""We wanted to get the ball back quickly and attack again. A mark of the good sides is you don't let up. We wanted to show we're a good side and we certainly did that in the second half. ""We were ruthlessly simple in our game. When you're so many goals up you can easily slow but we kept focused. We want to be a top team and to be a top team you must be clinical. ""It was a very good team performance and we're pleased to keep a clean sheet. It's good for our goals for but the clean sheet is equally important."" Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""That was one of the tough ones tonight.

Deadly anti-government protests sweep Iraq,"This video can not be played Protesters cover their faces to shield themselves from tear gas in Baghdad At least 40 people have died in Iraq during a fresh wave of anti-government protests that descended into violence. Two of the dead were reportedly hit by tear gas canisters fired by security forces in the capital Baghdad. Reports say half of the victims were killed while trying to storm the offices of militia groups and the government. Protesters are demanding more jobs, better public services and an end to corruption. About 2,000 people were wounded in protests across the country, AFP quoted a security source as saying. Similar protests earlier this month were brutally put down by security forces, leaving nearly 150 people dead. A government report has acknowledged that authorities used excessive force in quelling that unrest. Ahead of the latest protests, Iraq's leading clerics and the United Nations issued calls for restraint. Iraq protests: What's behind the anger? Iraqi police used excessive force - inquiry A day earlier Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who took office a year ago on Friday, warned protesters that violence would not be tolerated. He has promised a cabinet reshuffle and a package of reforms to address protesters' demands but many remain unconvinced. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Baghdad's Tahrir Square on Friday morning. When some tried to enter the Green Zone, where government buildings are based, security forces used tear gas to drive them back. Iraqi security forces blocked protesters as they tried to reach government buildings Demonstrators ran for cover as police fired tear gas Police and medical sources told Reuters news agency that two demonstrators had died in Baghdad after being struck by tear gas canisters. Pictures from Baghdad show at least one person, apparently hit by a canister, lying motionless on the street. Twelve died while setting fire to the headquarters of a paramilitary force in the southern city of Diwaniyah, security sources told AFP. There is no official confirmation of the figures. The Iraqi interior ministry said 68 members of the security forces were injured across the country. Demonstrators disperse as Iraqi security forces use tear gas in Baghdad Iraqi protesters burn items to block a road during clashes with security forces The government's handling of the protests this month has fuelled discontent across Iraq, with political leaders facing calls to resign. ""We're not hungry, we want dignity,"" shouted one marcher. Another said that Iraq's politicians had ""monopolised all the resources"". Do today's global protests have anything in common? The ongoing protests around the world in pictures Protesters have called on the Shia-led government to overhaul Iraq's sectarian political system, in which power is shared along religious and ethnic lines. Elsewhere, as unrest spread through Iraq's southern cities: About 3,000 protesters broke into a government building in Dhi Qar province Guards protecting a Shia militia group's offices in Maysan province opened fire, wounding at least six Protesters set fire to a Shia political party's offices in Muthanna province A curfew was imposed in several southern provinces Anti-government protesters march through flood waters in the city of Najaf The protests started in Baghdad on 1 October. Most of those taking part were young and unemployed. After security forces used live ammunition against demonstrators, the unrest escalated and spread to other cities and towns. This video can not be played Video from early October shows protesters fleeing from Iraqi security forces A government committee that was tasked with investigating the violence said149 civilians and eight security personnel had been killedin protests between 1 and 6 October.

Two more arrests over deaths,"The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Two people have been arrested on suspicion of the manslaughter of 39 people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex. The man and woman, both 38, from Warrington, Cheshire, were also held on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic. The BBC has spoken to the families of three Vietnamese people who are worried their relatives may have been in the trailer. The family of one woman say she sent a text saying she could not breathe. They say Pham Tra My, 26, sent the message on Tuesday night and they have not been able to contact her since. They said they had paid Â£30,000 for her to be smuggled to Britain. Two other families have also been in touch with the BBC. They are relatives of a 26-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman. The 19-year-old's brother said she called him early on Tuesday to say she was getting in to a container and was turning off her phone to avoid detection. There has been no word from her since, he said, but a people smuggler had returned money to the family. Relatives of the 26-year-old - with whom she was said to be travelling - also received money back, according to the younger woman's brother. Month-long journey: Ms Pham's brother said that Â£30,000 had been paid to people smugglers Essex Police initially said the victims - 31 men and eight women - were believed to be Chinese. They were found at an industrial estate in Grays at 01:40 BST on Wednesday. Detectives are still questioning the lorry driver on suspicion of murder. Police have been given extra time to question driver Mo Robinson, of County Armagh in Northern Ireland, who was arrested on Wednesday. This video can not be played Thirty nine bodies were found in the trailer container Post-mortem examinations are due to start later after the first 11 bodies were moved from Tilbury Port to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. Private ambulances continued transporting more of the 39 bodies from the refrigerated lorry trailer to the mortuary on Friday. How is a dead body identified? How are lorries checked for concealed migrants? 'I almost suffocated in the back of a lorry' Essex lorry deaths: What we know The trailer arrived in Purfleet on the River Thames from Zeebrugge in Belgium at 00:30 on Wednesday. It left the port shortly after 01:05 the same day and the bodies were found in the trailer at Waterglade Industrial Park about 30 minutes later. The lorry driver has been named locally as Mo Robinson, from County Armagh Police said recovering the bodies would take time and the dignity of the victims was its primary concern. The Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said he had sent a team to Essex to help verify the identity of the victims. He added that their nationality was yet to be confirmed. Essex Police believes the lorry arrived in Holyhead in north Wales on Sunday, having travelled from Dublin. Global Trailer Rentals Ltd told RTE News,externalit owned the trailer and said it had been hired on 15 October. Tracking data from the trailer shows it had travelled between cities in Belgium and France, including Dunkirk, Bruges, and Lille, in the days before the discovery, sources said.

Pentagon snubs Amazon for $10bn AI contract,"The Pentagon wants to replace ageing computer networks with a single cloud system The Pentagon has awarded a $10bn (Â£8bn) cloud-computing contract to Microsoft, following a heavily scrutinised bidding process in which Amazon had been seen as the favourite. The 10-year contract for the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure, or Jedi, is aimed at making the US defence department more technologically agile. Amazon's bid drew criticism from its rivals and US President Donald Trump. The company said it was ""surprised"" by the decision. A ""detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings"" would ""clearly lead to a different conclusion"", it said. Amazon is said to be evaluating its options after the decision. It has 10 days to decide whether or not to launch a challenge. In its statement, the Pentagon said all offers ""were treated fairly"". Microsoft executive Toni Townes-Whitley said the company was ""proud"" to have had its cloud technologies picked by the Department of Defense to ""satisfy the urgent and critical needs of today's warfighters"". The Department of Defense wants to replace its ageing computer networks with a single cloud system. Under the contract, Microsoft will provide artificial intelligence-based analysis and host classified military secrets among other services. Pentagon pushes pause on $10bn AI tech deal Google drops $10bn battle for Pentagon data It is hoped that Jedi will give the military better access to data and the cloud from battlefields. Amazon had been considered the front-runner - until President Trump began questioning whether the process was fair. In July he told reporters that he was getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and Amazon"". Microsoft had not been considered the front-runner He said other companies had told him that the contract ""wasn't competitively bid"" and that his administration would ""take a very long look"" at the process. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post newspaper - in the past. Dan Ives, managing director and equity analyst Wedbush Securities, said he expected Amazon and others to challenge the decision in the courts, but called it a ""paradigm changer"" for Microsoft. The move was likely to boost Microsoft's share price and bring ""significant positive financial implications"" for the company in the coming years, he said. By Leo Kelion, BBC Technology desk editor Amazon will be bitterly disappointed to have lost this contract, having long considered its bid to be the stronger. But after President Trump's comments about ""receiving tremendous complaints"" about Amazon's frontrunner status in July, and then the delay to announcing the award the following month, it had always looked liked Microsoft could pull off an upset. The timing is curious, however, coming just days after Defence Secretary Mark Esper unexpectedly removed himself from the review process after months of involvement, on the grounds that one of his sons worked for IBM - one of the other original applicants. It means Microsoft is now set to be a huge recipient of Department of Defense funds. Not only will it benefit from Jedi, but also a separate multi-billion dollar contract known as Deos. This has run into delays of its own, but is still set to result in the DoD using cloud-based Office 365 for its email, calendar, video-calling and other productivity software needs. One issue for Microsoft is whether its closeness to the military will cause it problems. Some ofits own workers have already objected to it developing a version of its Hololens augmented reality headset for the US military,external, and the idea of it now providing machine learning tools and other systems to help ""enhance force lethality"" could prove to be a PR nightmare. For Amazon, if the loss of such a lucrative contract is linked to Jeff Bezos's ownership of the Washington Post, it could fuel calls for AWS to be spun off from its parent and established as a separate company. There had already been speculation this might happen in order to head off regulators' concerns that Amazon already extends too deeply into Americans' lives. The announcement marked the end of a long process that had pitted tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and IBM against each other. As the world's biggest provider of cloud-computing services, Amazon had been the favourite to win Jedi. But its competitors argued that the process was unfair. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos Oracle challenged the bidding process in federal court earlier this year, saying that it was rigged to favour Amazon, but a federal judge dismissed the allegation. It said that it had awarded more than $11bn in 10 separate cloud-computing contracts over the past two years. The Jedi deal ""continues our strategy of a multi-vendor, multi-cloud environment as the department's needs are diverse and cannot be met by any single supplier,"" it added.

Two more arrests over lorry deaths,"The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Two people have been arrested on suspicion of the manslaughter of 39 people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex. The man and woman, both 38, from Warrington, Cheshire, were also held on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic.

They say Pham Tra My, 26, sent the message on Tuesday night and they have not been able to contact her since. They said they had paid Â£30,000 for her to be smuggled to Britain. Two other families have also been in touch with the BBC. They are relatives of a 26-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman. The 19-year-old's brother said she called him early on Tuesday to say she was getting in to a container and was turning off her phone to avoid detection. There has been no word from her since, he said, but a people smuggler had returned money to the family. Relatives of the 26-year-old - with whom she was said to be travelling - also received money back, according to the younger woman's brother.
