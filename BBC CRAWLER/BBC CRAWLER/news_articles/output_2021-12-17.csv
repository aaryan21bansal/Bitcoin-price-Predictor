PM urged to get a grip after by-election rout,"This video can not be played Watch Helen Morgan celebrate her victory by bursting ""Boris' bubble"" Senior Tories have urged Boris Johnson to make changes following a huge by-election defeat for the Conservatives. Ex-Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said No 10 needed discipline while another senior Tory said the PM needed to get ""a bit of a bloody grip"". Mr Johnson said he was ""disappointed"" with his party's performance in the North Shropshire vote. The Lib Dems who won the ultra-safe Tory seat, said voters were ""fed up"" with Mr Johnson's ""incompetence"". The party's candidate, Helen Morgan, overturned a Tory majority of almost 23,000 at the last general election to win by 5,925 votes, saying: ""The people of North Shropshire have spoken on behalf of the British people. They have said loudly and clearly, 'Boris Johnson, the party is over.'"" Their historic victory came after a week dominated by claims of Covid rule-breaking in No 10 and a revolt by Mr Johnson's own MPs over restrictions. The PM blamed a ""constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians"" in the media for the result. Tories lose seat they held for nearly 200 years No 10 inquiry chief faces questions over own 'party' Analysis: Has Johnson lost his winning touch? How did Tories turn off true blue North Shropshire? Although few have commented publicly, Conservative MPs are said to be divided over Mr Johnson's future. Iain Duncan Smith - who led the party for two years - told the BBC the government had lost focus as a result of stories about Downing Street parties. ""The prime minister needs to show really strongly that he doesn't just disapprove but is prepared to get rid of people who are breaking those rules,"" he said. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith says the PM ""gets there has been a series of things happening which should not have doneâ. He also criticised Conservative MPs calling for a Mr Johnson to be replaced saying ""I want my colleagues to stop playing games.... the party has to get behind him."" Veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale described the result ""as a referendum on the prime minister's performance"". And former Scottish Tory leader Baroness Davidson told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Mr Johnson was ""drinking in the last-chance saloon"". She said Conservative MPs were ""looking for a bit of a bloody grip"" and an end to the government's ""own goals"". This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson's reaction to the North Shropshire by-election defeat Responding to his party's defeat, the prime minister said: ""Clearly the vote in North Shropshire is very disappointing result. I totally understand people's frustrations. I hear what the voters are saying."" The defeat comes at the end of a torrid week for Mr Johnson, during which100 Conservative MPs rebelledover government proposals to introduce Covid passes in England. There have also beencriticisms over Downing Street Christmas parties during restrictions last December. Civil service boss Simon Case had been conducting an inquiry into potential rule-breaching events in No 10,but he is now expected to step asideafter claims an event was held in his own office last year. The prime minister put much of the blame for the by-election defeat on media coverage, saying that ""what the people have been hearing is just a constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians and stuff that isn't about them"". ""The job of the government is to make people like you [journalists] interested in the booster roll-out and skills and housing and everything else we're doing,"" he added. ""Unfortunately we haven't been able to get the focus on those issues."" Boris Johnson is in a very precarious position, not just because of the monster by-election defeat in North Shropshire. This week huge numbers of his own backbenchers didn't back him on a key part of his plans to deal with the pandemic, and there was a report on how the lavish redecoration of his flat above Downing Street was paid for. There is a difference of opinion inside the Conservative Party of whether or not this is a situation that can be recovered from. Some MPs think it's a situation past saving and are focusing on when and how a change at the top can be conducted. Others, however, don't believe it's terminal. Mr Johnson said one of his stock lines - that he takes responsibility for everything that happens in the government. That's not the same self-reflection that some of his colleagues would like from him right now. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who is isolating with Covid, said his party could now beat the Conservatives ""anywhere"", adding: "" I think people are so fed up with Boris Johnson, so fed up with his incompetence and his behaviour, I think they'll be really happy about that."" The by-election was called because previous North Shropshire MP Owen Paterson quit in November after being found guilty of breaking parliamentary rules on lobbying - trying to influence government policy - in return for money. Fourteen candidates stood,with Ms Morgan taking 17,957 votes, while Conservative Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst got 12,032 and Labour's Ben Wood came third with 3,686. Labour, which came second in the constituency at the 2019 election, saw its share of the vote fall from 22.1% to 9.7%. The North Shropshire result is the second loss of a former Conservative stronghold to the Lib Dems this year, with the party seizing Chesham and Amersham, in Buckinghamshire, in July.

"Pastor Mick: âIf I lock this door, he diesâ","Every seven seconds - on average - a person was referred for NHS mental health support in England in September. In Burnley, that comes as no surprise to Pastor Mick - a drug-dealer-turned-lifesaver during Covid - who each day meets people struggling to survive. This article contains several references to suicide. Joanne was shaken to her core 18 months ago when her partner, Robert, died suddenly. ""It feels like it's my fault, because I didn't get the help quick enough for him,"" she says. Robert's mental health deteriorated during the first lockdown. He couldn't cope with being stuck at home and developed suicidal thoughts. Joanne says she rang a mental health team two weeks before his death asking for help - and was told someone would ring Robert the next day. But she says the call never came. Two weeks later, Robert took his own life. Joanne is speaking to us in Pastor Mick's new home in the heart of Burnley town centre - a former gym that closed during the pandemic. The building has been reborn as his church - and is called the Church on the Street. It's a big space. The original showers, lockers and mirrors are still there, but there are crucial new additions. There's a giant wooden cross by an altar and four new office rooms in the corner - used as a private quiet space for qualified mental health counsellors. It was Joanne who found Robert's body. Later that day, she got a call from the mental health team she'd contacted a fortnight before. Joanne has a photo of Robert on her tablet ""They were like: 'Can I speak to Robert?' ""I said, 'He's not here no moreâ¦ he's done the damage.'"" Joanne says the woman on the phone apologised and said they had been very busy. ""She said 'I'm so sorry to hear that, I wish I could have got back sooner.'"" Although Joanne doesn't blame the mental health team, she believes Robert could have been saved with early help. ""I think he'd have been all right - he'd have still been here."" More than a year on, Joanne is still haunted by death. Each word brings back painful memories, but she wants to share how she is feeling. ""I can see the flashbacks. I can see him every day in my head - when I get up, when I go to sleep."" She says one day everything just became too much for her. ""I rang Pastor Mick and he told me to come down. He's been great."" Church on the Street has been Joanne's salvation. She says it's a place where she and her family feel safe - and she's not the only one. Hundreds of others come here each week looking for hope. Sadly, Joanne's story is one Pastor Mick is all too familiar with. When Robert died, he says, two other young men took their lives in streets close to Robert's home. At the time, Mick was regularly handing out food parcels in a car park in Burnley. ""I just couldn't believe what was happening. I knew I'd have to do something more and that I needed somewhere - a home - to deal with the mess and devastation left behind by Covid."" Inside Mick's church - we spent a month there on and off - there's a friendly open-door policy. Mick wants others who have had troubles to find hope - just like he has. In his 20s,Mick was a drug dealerconsumed by cocaine and violence. He has now found faith and feeds the poor. The church is expanding quickly - it has its own food and clothes banks. Mick also liaises with the police, housing organisations, the local council and drug rehabilitation services. Watch - The Cost of Covid: A Year on the Front Line Twelve months in Burnley with Pastor Mick ""What we are doing here is free. The hot food is free, the coffee is free, the tea is free, the counselling is free,"" he explains. ""We are keeping people alive. Sometimes it just puts it off for another day, but it's another day of life, a lot of them die."" Mick is particularly concerned about the lack of access to mental health care for the most vulnerable - people who find it difficult to see their GPs, let alone get access to a bed in a support facility. ""The help available is negligible, the mental health system is on its backside."" Mick blames the Covid lockdowns and the many months of restrictions for making issues worse. In Burnley, he hears stories of people who, in isolation, have spiralled down - turning to drugs and alcohol. In September 2021, Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust says it recorded the highest monthly number of so-called ""Section 136"" detentions in its area. That's when police detain a person and take them to a place of safety if they appear to have a mental health disorder. There were 196 - more than six a day. In response, the trust says it has expanded its street triage services for people in crisis - in partnership with the police and ambulance services. Mick says every other person he meets is struggling with a mental health issue - whether it be anxiety, paranoia or just being unable to cope with everyday life. After a busy day, he closes the church - but then, just before he locks up, his phone rings. It's another person in need of help - called John. We can make out some of the conversation. He sounds manic, lost and angry and is threatening to kill himself. He believes there has been a great injustice and people are out to get him. Mick talks to John calmly and compassionately. ""Come and see me. I'm here, I'm waiting for you. There's a brew here for you, we can talk it through."" The deal has been agreed. John won't attempt to take his life and Mick will hang on for him. ""[If] I lock this door, he dies, that's a fact - so the door has to stay open."" When John arrives at the church, he's shouting, sweating and struggling to breathe. It's upsetting to see. John at the Church in the Street ""I know who they are,"" he says, shaking uncontrollably. ""They've been so horrible and nasty towards me. I've just had enough, it's been going on too long."" Mick gently guides him over to the middle of the room. ""Come on, I want you to take a deep breath,"" says Mick, holding John in his arms. ""Take a really deep breathâ¦ All rightâ¦ So tell me what the panic is?"" Fifteen minutes later, John is calmer. His breathing has stabilised and, with a cup of tea, he's eating a slice of warmed-up meat and potato pie. John tells us that just before his crisis he had called his GP panicking for a prescription - but had been told to call back in 48 hours. John is thankful - there was nowhere else for him to go. ""Nobody else has listened - he's the only one,"" he says pointing at Mick. Mick says if it hadn't been for BBC reports on his charitable work at the end of 2020, many people in Burnley wouldn't know they could turn to him - and finding a home for his new church might not even have been possible. ""This place is breathing new life, it's helping people. The people who don't make it through the door die."" We catch up with John the next day. He's smiling and like a different person. ""You don't know what to think, what to do, who to speak to,"" he says. ""People look at you like you belong in a lunatic asylum when you speak about your mental health."" John at home But John also reveals he hasn't seen a GP all year and has lost faith in mental health care - describing it as ""non-existent"". Mick has referred John to the local mental health crisis team, but John has been unable to see them. The Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust told us the use of its mental health urgent assessment centres from July to September 2021 was 75% higher than in the last three months of 2020. It also said that community mental health referrals in August this year - at nearly 600 per 100,000 adults - were nearly 50% higher than England's national average. Those statistics will come as no surprise to Father Alex who, like Pastor Mick, we first met a year ago. In his church, St Matthew's, pews have been replaced by tables and chairs and a place to cook hot food for those in need. ""We have examples of people waiting 16 weeks when they're in crisis for mental health support,"" he tells us. ""So people are being talked off bridges and given crisis care [phone] numbers."" Looking at Demi Lea and her two children - who have come for breakfast at St Matthew's - you'd never think they were struggling. But Demi Lea says she hasn't done a food shop for months and relies on food banks, charity, and handouts. Father Alex talking to Demi Lea She first referred herself for mental health support at the end of 2020, got a phone consultation in June and is now on a waiting list for therapy. But in August, her mental health got even worse after the death of her grandmother - who she used to rely on for support. ""I haven't been able to get on top of things - financially it's been tough,"" she says. ""I can barely function."" Since we met, Father Alex has managed to arrange counselling sessions for Demi Lea. She says she's extremely grateful. Back at the Church on the Street, we sit down again with an exhausted Mick at the end of a busy day. We chat with him and his colleague Kev - a support worker - about the deaths of two young men, rumoured to have taken their own lives the night before. Mick and Kev are shocked but not surprised - although they caution against speculation. As we talk, just like the night before, there are more emergencies. Over a 30-minute period, Mick gets three panicked phone calls. The first is from a mum whose son ran away from home saying he was going to kill himself. The second is from another worried mum whose child is also having suicidal thoughts. Mick says the struggle for these families is to be seen quickly by professionals. Then comes the third call.

""I can't cope with life, I just don't want to live any more,"" says a woman's softly spoken voice. ""Nobody has listened, I just want to go to sleep and not wake up."" Mick, head in hands, tries to reassure her. ""I know that feeling,"" says Mick, ""but there is a light that is stronger than the darkness. We'll get you in here on Monday, we'll see you."" He then asks if she has taken any medication. ""Yes"" comes the reply - enough for an overdose. Kev dials for an ambulance straight away on his phone, while Mick keeps her conscious and talking on his. ""I just don't want to live, Mick, I'm in a dark tunnel and can't get out,"" says the woman. He pleads with her. ""There's always hope. Make sure your doors are unlocked."" Pastor Mick talks to the woman on his phone Mick stays on the line until the paramedics arrive and make sure she is safe. But how has he ended up taking emergency calls? What happens when he can't answer the phone? Is this more than he can cope with? He tells us there was a missed call one night when he was asleep - and the caller had left a worrying message. ""If you don't answer the phone, I'm going to kill myself."" Unfortunately, that person did take their own life, Mick explains - his voice breaking with emotion. A few days later when we arrive at the church one morning, we meet a man called Robbie who's 29. He has been on the streets all night, but is now sitting in the office going through his possessions - the clothes on his back and a couple of see-through plastic bags. He's showing Mick the medication he's been prescribed. During lockdown Robbie struggled and began hearing voices. One told him to jump from a well-known bridge in Burnley. Police managed to get to Robbie just in time to stop him and he was admitted to a psychiatric unit. Robbie shows his medication to Pastor Mick Since then, he's received six months of expert care at several psychiatric units in Lancashire - something he says has worked well. But yesterday, he was released without accommodation arranged. He says he was told to head to Burnley Borough Council's housing department, but by the time he got there it was closed. ""I just ended up walking around town all night and then as soon as this place opened I just came to Pastor Mick,"" says Robbie. ""Without this place I'd be dead."" Mick is incandescent. He's angry that the money spent on Robbie's care has now been wasted. ""He's been released from a psychiatric unit to the street with enough drugs to kill an elephant. It's a tragedy, it doesn't need to be like this."" Robbie begins to get upset. ""I feel confusion, suicidal - it's like they've designed it to make me do it because they don't want me here no more. But I'm just trying to better myself. I just want a better life, that's all I want. I'm sick of this."" The next night, Church on the Street paid for Robbie to stay in a hotel. The following night he was placed by Burnley council in a shared room in a B&B above a pub. But within 72 hours he had been readmitted to a psychiatric unit. During our visits to the church, we talk to Mick's volunteers about the struggle to get mental health support for those who desperately need it - including David Allen, a mental health counsellor with more than 20 years' experience. ""It's not just here in Burnley, it's all over the country. And the ones that suffer most are always at the bottom of the pile. They just feel left behind because they can't get any help."" Many self-medicate - he says - with drugs and alcohol. All of a sudden, in the street outside the church, there's another tense moment. Women scream after a man collapses. ""He's OD'd. Help, he's overdosed outside."" Pastor Mick moves quickly. There's now quite a crowd gathered - with children circling on bikes. Two police community support officers are talking into their radios. But Mick was the first on his hands and knees, talking to the unresponsive man and checking for a pulse. He rushes inside and asks Kev for the Naloxone, a medicine that rapidly reverses the effects of an opioid overdose - such as heroin. Mick tries to help the man outside the church entrance By the time Mick gets back to the man - needle in hand - the panic is over. The emergency medication wasn't needed and the man is back on his feet. Nevertheless it was still a traumatic moment for Mick - and he becomes emotional. ""People don't like to see [moments like] that but that's the reality of every city and every town in this country,"" he says. ""And I'm sorry if it offends people, but they're dying, and they can all be saved, every last one of them."" Pastor Mick and his colleagues are proud with what they have achieved this year - but they also fear what the pandemic might yet bring in terms of mental health problems. Health economist Dr Luke Munford - from the University of Manchester - says an alarm bell is ringing in many poorer areas of the UK. Urgent and emergency mental health referrals to crisis teams in East Lancashire almost quadrupled when you compare July 2019 to July 2021 - he told us - but the picture is ""similarly stark in other deprived parts of the country"". The Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust says it's receiving Â£11.6m of NHS funding over three years to help improve community mental health services. Pastor Mick's transformation from violent drug dealer to lifesaver during a pandemic is profound - a personal redemption. ""To be able to serve people who are dying has become the biggest privilege of my life,"" he says. ""I feel the best I've ever felt in my life, I feel free. It's made me a better, stronger person - a softer, gentler person."" NHS England told us they urge anyone who requires help with mental health to come forward.

Russia lists demands for defusing Ukraine tensions,"This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Russia has demanded strict limits on the activities of the US-led Nato military alliance in countries in Eastern Europe. The demands, which are unlikely to be met, come amid Western fears Russia plans to invade its neighbour Ukraine. Russia denies this, but wants Nato to rule out Ukraine and others ever joining the alliance to defuse the situation. It has asked for urgent talks with the United States. The US said it was open to talking but that it would be putting its own concerns on the table too. ""We've had dialogue with Russia on European security issues for the last twenty years,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Friday. ""That has sometimes produced progress, sometimes produced deadlock, but we are fundamentally prepared for dialogue."" Earlier on Friday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters the US will not go into the talks alone: ""There will be no talks on European security without our European allies and partners."" Nato, which was originally set up to defend Europe against possible threats from the former Soviet Union, has forces in the Baltic republics and Poland. What is the Nato defence alliance? Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia had given the US and Nato two draft treaties. There was no other option, he said, as the ""state of relations between Russia and the collective West is a total lack of trust"". In the proposalsRussia sets out a series of radical demands,external, which require countries that joined Nato after the fall of the Soviet Union not to deploy troops or weapons in areas where they could be seen as a threat to Russia. Heavy bombers and warships would not be allowed in areas outside their national airspace or waters from which they could launch an attack. That would mean Nato not playing any role at all in any of the three Baltic republics or Poland. And Nato would have to abandon any plans for Ukraine and Georgia to eventually join the Western alliance. Diplomacy is the art of the possible. Well it wasâ¦ until now. It's virtually impossible to imagine the US and Nato signing the draft documents Russian diplomats have drawn up, without considerable changes. Russia demanding a veto on who joins the Alliance. A non-starter. Nato has said many times before that Moscow can have no say over who gets to be a member. Plus the Russians want to turn the clock back to May 1997. Any country that joined the Nato alliance after that date won't be allowed Nato troops or weaponry. How would the Baltic states, which view Russia as a potential threat, feel about that? Moscow knows very well it's demanding things the West won't deliver, so why ask? A negotiating tactic, perhaps. Ask for the world and hope to secure other concessions. Or it may be designed for domestic consumption: to convince the Russian public that growing tension between Russia and the West isn't Moscow's fault. Russia invaded Georgia during a brief war in 2008 and seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 before backing separatists in eastern Ukraine. Conflict in the east began in April 2014 and has claimed more than 14,000 lives, with casualties still being reported. However, the build-up of Russian forces in areas beyond Ukraine's borders has prompted fears of another Russian invasion. EU leaders warned at a summit late on Thursday night that any aggression would have ""massive consequences and severe cost"" and spoke of restrictive measures while calling for diplomatic efforts to resolve the increase in tensions. CONTEXT:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? ANALYSIS:What would be the fallout if Russia invaded Ukraine? PUTIN:Russian leader compares Ukraine war zone to genocide ZELENSKY:Ukraine's leader who swapped TV stardom for presidency They said diplomacy should focus on the four-way dialogue between Paris, Berlin, Kyiv and Moscow, known as the Normandy format. Russia pointedly preferred to focus on talks with the US. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has warned that Russia is increasing, not reducing, its troops on the border with ""combat-ready troops, tanks, artillery, armoured units, drones [and] electronic warfare systems"". Several ceasefires have been agreed but violence is still going on in eastern Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday he would prefer sanctions to be imposed immediately, before Russia took any military action.

Probe into 'aggressive' energy debt tactics,"Scottish Power said it had ordered an investigation into aggressive tactics A whistleblower claims call handlers working on behalf of Scottish Power are told to threaten customers with debt enforcement - even over mistaken bills. The man, an employee of an outsourced company, works in a call centre in the west of Scotland dealing with people who call to query outstanding balances. He said colleagues had also raised concerns over aggressive tactics. Scottish Power has ordered an investigation following concerns raised with the BBC. The employee, who says he wants to protect his identity over fears he will lose his job, said it was clear to see where errors had been made on an account. Woman 'harassed' by power firm over false debt Scottish Power to pay Â£18m after customer service failings Scottish Power gets record number of complaints He said: ""It may be a wrong meter reading, they've not been billed correctly, they might not be responsible for it, or they're not a Scottish Power customer. However, until that's dealt with then it's going to stand, we're going pursue them for that debt. ""We tell them if they cannot pay that balance in full today, or make a part payment, then I need to advise them that that can involve litigation, third party involvement, extra charges being applied, impact on credit reference or worst case scenario, we can enforce a prepayment meter in your property. Even if it's not your debt."" It followsthe case of Irene Girvan, from Glasgow, who claimed the energy giant hounded her for a year over money she insists she did not owe. The 64-year-old told BBC Scotland she was threatened with debt collectors and missed a Covid booster jab while waiting for enforcement officers she believed were coming to change her locks. Scottish Power has apologised for distress caused to Ms Girvan and cleared the debt. Officials said there was ""no excuse for our failures"" in this case. The call centre whistle-blower said the tactics he is asked to deploy have taken a toll on his mental health. He said: ""We've all raised concerns about it. I've had people screaming, crying, threatening to kill themselves on the phone. ""It does have a toll on you, yeah, definitely. Just as a normal human being because you've got morals, you've got principles."" A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: ""Like many businesses, we outsource the services provided by collection agencies to follow-up on outstanding customer accounts as required, and the agents are not employed by Scottish Power directly. ""We require all third-party business partner interactions to be conducted in line with industry requirements and best practice - and the claims made in no way reflect the service we expect to be delivered. ""We take these allegations seriously and will follow-up with the partner company concerned."" In 2016, the firm was fined Â£18m by the regulator Ofgem over poorly-handled customer complaints. On Friday it also emerged that Edinburgh woman Lizzy Wilson, who had never been a customer of Scottish Power, had been pursued for a debt of more than Â£1,000. Scottish Power said it had now stopped any further bills to Ms Wilson while it investigates the issue and apologised for any inconvenience caused. Jemiel Benison from Citizens Advice Scotland said threats of debt collection happened quite often, but were an outdated practice. He said: ""These are tactics that are, or should be, way in the past. That's not the way that industry tends to work. They are heavily regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). ""This is an anomaly and it is extremely heavy-handed."" He said that anyone with a problem like this should get in touch with their nearest Citizens Advice branch for support.

Omicron 'storm' warning prompts nightclub closures,"Social distancing will be a requirement again in response to Omicron Wales must brace itself for the ""storm of Omicron"", the first minister has warned. Nightclubs will close in Wales after 26 December in response to the rising number of cases of the variant. Social distancing will also be reintroduced in shops and workplaces. Mark Drakeford also said more decisions on Covid restrictions would be made on Monday - in particularwith regard to sports events. A return to other restrictions - like extended household bubbles and the rule of six in pubs - is not being ruled out after Christmas. As it happened: Friday's press conference Welsh festive sport verdict on Monday First estimate of booster jab impact on Omicron The first minister told BBC's Today programme: ""Wales is in the calm before the storm. We see the storm of Omicron coming our way and we need to prepare for it now."" He pleaded with people to have a smaller Christmas and issued guidance to people avoid meeting ""wider circles of friends"". The number of Omicron cases detected in Wales rose by 64 to 159 cases on Friday. It comes as the UK sawa record number of Covid casesfor a third day, exceeding 90,000. Mr Drakeford warned that London was already seeing an increase in people going to hospital with Covid. ""We have to be prepared for the same to happen here,"" he told a press conference. And he warned it was ""inescapable"" that a sharp increase in cases will impact the delivery of public services. Updated guidance will be issued for care home visits, and people on the shielding list will be written to with new advice on how to protect themselves. But it is not expected they will be asked to shield like at the start of the pandemic. The first minister said he had not introduced stricter measures immediately because the government's actions had to be ""proportionate and fair"" to everyone as Christmas was a ""special"" time of year. ""Our Omicron numbers are the lowest anywhere else in the UK,"" he said, adding providing people adhered to the latest advice given, a pathway had been created into Christmas. Business lobby group the CBI said the fresh restrictions on companies were a ""big setback"". Announcing a two-phased plan, the Welsh government said it was giving ""strong guidance"" for people to leave a day between social events and to meet outdoors over Christmas. But from 27 December new legal restrictions will come into force. What are the new Covid rules for Wales? How do I get a booster in Wales? Omicron: Is it milder despite dodging immunity? How can I tell I have Omicron? They include the two-metre rule in workplaces, and extra rules for businesses and services to protect customers and staff, such as limiting numbers in supermarkets, one-way systems and tighter controls at check-outs. Businesses will also be required to allow people to work from home wherever possible. Welsh ministers say they will make Â£60m available for firms impacted by the new restrictions. The cash is earmarked for January but is not designed to cover wages, as the furlough scheme did earlier in the pandemic. The Federation of Small Businesses welcomed the cash but demanded ""urgent clarity"" on whether it would be available to firms that have seen a loss of bookings ""at an alarming rate"". This video can not be played Covid help should not just be for England, says Mark Drakeford But Mr Drakeford said the ability to provide and sustain and longer-term support to businesses is ""severely constrained by the current position of the UK Treasury and its refusal to open vital support schemes, such as furlough"". Such schemes should be available for all UK nations when needed ""and not just at the point at when restrictions are introduced in England"", he added. Mr Drakeford said Omicron was the most serious development in the pandemic so far. ""People should think very carefully about who they are meeting and how they are meeting to keep themselves and others safe before Christmas,"" he added. In the run-up to Christmas, the Welsh government urged people to: Take a lateral flow test before going out, going Christmas shopping or visiting people Meet outdoors, or if meeting indoors ensure it is well ventilated Leave a day between social events Socially distance, wear a face covering and wash your hands Get vaccinated, and make getting a booster a priority if you have had an appointment The guidance does not go as far as Scotland where indoor social mixing is limited tothree households. The Welsh government appears to be caught between a rock and a hard place when it come to the imposition of additional Covid restrictions that they believe could be necessary to meet the threat the Omicron variant poses to the Welsh NHS. It seems clear that ministers believe that strict new restrictions should be introduced but, without UK treasury support for affected businesses, are wary of introducing measures that could hurt the already battered hospitality and retail sectors of the economy. All eyes will be on the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to see what help might be on offer but with the UK government already nursing a hangover after a backbench Commons rebellion on Covid passes, it seems unlikely that Downing Street will move as quickly and firmly as the Welsh government would like. While Welsh ministers probably do have the resources to offer some additional support for businesses, a new Covid wave could lead to increased financial pressure on the health and other public services as they seek to cover for staff absences and increased public demand. With ministerial meetings being held on an almost daily basis it seems unlikely that today's announcements are the last word on Christmas and new year restrictions - and more measures may well be announced in coming days. Nightclubs were reopened last summer Wales is the first UK nation to close a business sector in response to the Omicron wave. The decision to shut nightclubs means they will be closed for New Year's Eve. The Night Time Industries Association said it was ""angry and frustrated"" they had been singled out for closure and claimed there was a lack of evidence to show transmission of the virus was higher in nightspots. Chief executive Mike Kill said: ""We've implemented Covid passports and lateral flow tests even though it has cost us some trade so why are we being singled out and targeted? These further restrictions are a step too far. ""Isn't there a greater concern that people who would normally socialise on New Year's Eve will now displace to other unregulated settings without those controls?"" But the first minister said the decision ""is about protecting the health of people who otherwise would be putting themselves in harm's way"". Asked if the move punishes younger people, Mark Drakeford said: ""If you look at London and you look to see where the most rapid growth has been in the Omicron variant, it has been people in their twenties and thirties."" The announcement also sparked concern from Prof Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist at Swansea University. ""I don't want to sound like the Grinch but this is not going to stem the tide of Omicron cases in Wales - hospitalisations and hospital pressure will follow in weeks,"" he said. He argued that the minimum needed was what the Welsh government called""alert level one"",external- which would have seen a return to the rule of six indoors - with a brief break at Christmas. Sara Jones, Head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, urged customers to show ""consideration and patience"" as shops reintroduce measures, which are likely to reduce capacity. But Ian Price, CBI Wales director, said: ""As Omicron cases continue to rise it's only right the government prioritises public health, but fresh restrictions are a big setback for businesses, particularly in hospitality."" This video can not be played Care home staff say they are ""reliving"" first lockdown feelings Care homes in Wales said they are relieved visits are still allowed but feared another rise in cases would put extra strain on already ""tired"" staff. ""It's a balance to keep people safe but not take away that contact of visits,"" said Care Homes Wales chief executive Mary Wimbury. ""However some care homes are not just asking whether they have enough staff to manage visits, but are there enough staff to the care home running safely? ""Staff live in their local community and it's almost impossible to stop them catching the virus somehow. The worry is for their health but also the pressure it puts on the staff who are there and are very tired. ""Everyone is worried at how things will pan out."" Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh government needed to provide ""clarity"" on the money being offered to support businesses. He said the Welsh government had a lot more money available to help firms: ""There's Â£600m sitting in the Welsh government budget which is available to them to spend on COVID measures"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said all governments face a ""difficult balancing act"" in taking these decisions. ""We're in the position in Wales, fortunately at the moment, I think we have about 5% of the population and less than 1% of the confirmed Omicron cases. And that allows that breathing space in the run-up to Christmas, but obviously we are facing a very, very difficult situation thereafter."" The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said support for health services is also needed. ""The Liberal Democrats have called for a 6% rise in our wages to both health and care workers,"" she said.

Omicron rise prompts scaled-down Christmas plea,"People are advised to have a smaller Christmas and avoid meeting ""wider circles of friends"" by the first minister Nightclubs will close in Wales from 26 December Social distancing will also be reintroduced in shops and workplaces Further restrictions relating to pubs, bars and restaurants could come in after Christmas Ben Frampton and Thamayanthi McAllister The press conference has ended and that brings an end to today's live coverage - this is what we've learned so far:  To keep up to date with any other developments today, clickhere. The owner of Potters bar and restaurant in
Newport, Enzo Nigro, said Mr Drakefordâs announcement has left him on âtenterhooksâ about what
other restrictions may be announced next week. âHe hasnât really said anything to help us to prepare, apart
from two-metre rule. ""He hasnât said anything about live entertainment, about
track and trace or passports, people sitting at a table - nothing. âYet again we are on tenterhooks worrying about what is
going to happen next week."" Mr Nigro said companies had cancelled Christmas parties and the uncertainty was
ânot fairâ on businesses like his. He said: âWe have had lots of phone calls to see if we are
going to be open, and if we are going to be showing live entertainment. âBut I didnât know, and I still donât know if we are allowed
to. But I am guessing â from what he has just said â that we can. Until he
springs it on us that we canât."" The Federation of Small Businesses in Wales policy chairman Ben Francis said: ""We welcome the fact that the first minister has not implemented any further restrictions in the week to Christmas which allows some flexibility for retail businesses and others to continue to trade in this vital festive period. ""We encourage people to âshop smallâ and support these businesses in the week ahead."" The organisation also wants to know if small firms would be able to get financial help in the run-up to 27 December as the hospitality sector was facing cancelled bookings as people felt inhibited from going out. ""Funding should always be commensurate with the restrictions placed on businesses and we call on Welsh and UK governments to work together to ensure that whatever lies ahead, sufficient support will be always available for Welsh smaller businesses,"" added Mr Francis.

Three times as many people have been asking to have their booster vaccination at home compared to those who requested home jabs earlier in programme, the Welsh government has said. Mr Drakeford said: ""There are a lot more people looking to have the booster at home and it is a very labour-intensive way of providing the vaccine. ""But what we have done in very recent days is quite significantly to increase the amount of money that we are providing to GPs to do home vaccinations. ""And we hope that that will mean that we will have more of their time available to do this part of the vaccination programme, because they are in many ways amongst the best suited to do it."" The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said support for health services was also needed. She said NHS and care workers will be ""bearing the brunt"" over the next week or so. ""The Liberal Democrats have called for a 6% rise in wages to both health and care workers. ""And we do need to see the Welsh government actually committing to something that rewards our health workers because they've been outstanding. ""And, as we know, this virus is meaning that they are really on their knees both in terms of numbers but also in terms of the lack of health workers that are able to go in because they're either self isolating, or indeed, they're being affected directly. ""So I would have liked to see more and I hope that we do see more about how we're going to support our health services."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said all governments face a ""difficult balancing act"" in taking these decisions. ""I think that the government has broadly got this right, in terms of a judgement call,"" he said. ""We're in the position in Wales, fortunately at the moment, I think we have about 5% of the population and less than 1% of the confirmed Omicron cases. ""And that allows that breathing space in the run-up to Christmas, but obviously we are facing a very, very difficult situation thereafter. Mr Price has also called on the UK Treasury to reintroduce the furlough scheme as ""hospitality is already reeling because people have been voting with their feet, 40% down at a time when those businesses were hoping that they'd be able to make up the losses that they've incurred over a very, very difficult last two years"". Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh government needed to provide âclarityâ on the money being offered to support businesses. He welcomed the Â£60m which has been announced as business support for the Omicron wave, but said the Welsh government had a lot more money available to help firms. He said: ""Thereâs Â£600m sitting in the Welsh government budget which is available to them to spend on Covid measures. ""Itâs really important that we get some clarity about that money going forward to support businesses that affected by restrictions."" The first minister has insisted Covid passes ""have been very effective"". Mark Drakeford said the passes - which were introduced in October - ""have helped a number of settings to stay open or events to take place, that otherwise might not have been possible"". But, he added, the emergence of the Omicron variant has changed the situation. ""We've seen evidence in other parts of the world at just how it spreads in those enclosed settings and what super-spreader those events can be - a single individual, able to infect very large numbers of other people at a single event,"" he said. He also defended the planned closure of nightclubs to avoid the risk of Omicron spreading. ""So it's the new context that means we feel that they have to close rather than because we think passes have not been effective,"" said Mr Drakeford. ""If we were only dealing with Delta then I think staying open with a pass would be the path that we were on. ""Sadly, the sky has has darkened with the new variant that we know is coming our way."" The decision to close nightclubs from 27 December ""is about protecting the health of people who otherwise would be putting themselves in harm's way,"" Mr Drakeford says. Asked if the move punishes younger people, he replied: ""If you look at London and you look to see where the most rapid growth has been in the Omicron variant, it has been people in their 20s and 30s."" He added that while the restrictions would have a varying effect on different ages groups, he was in fact ""discriminating in favour of young people"" saying they were more likely to go against public advice despite more young people being affected by the Omicron variant.

It is ""inescapable"" that a sharp increase in Omicron cases will have an impact on the delivery of Wales' public services, according to Mr Drakeford. He said the NHS, councils, the police and other public services ""are planning very hard"" to put in place ""whatever measures will be needed to provide a continuity of service to people here in Wales"". He added: ""If this is going to spread in the way that some of the models suggest then the people we rely on to look after us in an emergency will themselves be affected by it."" ""I won't disguise from anybody the concerns that were expressed there about the way in which the Omicron variant could have a major impact on the number of people available to be in the workplace."" Mr Drakeford says the Welsh government will provide financial support to nightclubs that will have to close from 27 December, but criticised the UK government for ""its refusal"" to reintroduce furlough. He said a financial support package of up to Â£60m would be available to businesses materially affected by new restrictions. But his ability âto provide and sustain longer-term economic supportâ during this new wave was ""severely constrained by the current position of the UK Treasury and its refusal to open vital support schemes, such as furlough,"" he added.

Mr Drakeford says updated guidance about care home visiting will be published this week. He said the chief medical officer would also be writing to everyone on the shielding list about the steps they can take to protect themselves. Mr Drakeford says the Welsh government will be changing the law so it makes it clear that people must work from home ""wherever they can"". ""This year a smaller Christmas is a safer Christmas,"" he added. He also confirmed that new restrictions on 27 December would be introduced to help control the spread and ""to prevent large numbers of people needing hospital care"". He said shops, workplaces and businesses would reopen after Christmas but with ""new"" protections in place. ""There will be a strengthened set of reasonable measures, which will include returning to the 2m rule for social distancing. ""This means that shops, businesses and workplaces will need to make some changes to the way they operate â putting in place extra measures, such as one-way systems and physical barriers."" First Minister Mark Drakeford says Omicron ""particularly likes"" big gatherings and enclosed spaces where it can easily move from person to person. He urged people to reduce the number of people they meet ""especially if youâre seeing older or more vulnerable people over Christmas"". Mr Drakeford said people should take the following measures: ""Get vaccinated â and if youâve had your booster appointment, please make this your top priority. ""If youâre going out, going Christmas shopping or visiting people â flow before you go. Take a lateral flow test. If itâs positive â then donât go out at all. ""Meeting outdoors is better than indoors. If youâre meeting indoors make sure itâs well ventilated. ""Space out your socialising - if you seeing families and friends, don't see them all in one go."" He also reminded people not to forget about washing their hands, social distancing and wearing a face covering in public places. The first minister says there are about 100 confirmed cases of Omicron in Wales and, because it is âeasilyâ transmitted, there could be âlarge numbersâ of people admitted to hospital. ""By the end of December, it will be the dominant form of the virus in the UK,"" Mark Drakeford said. ""This is a very fast-moving form of the virus, which is easily transmitted from person to person. ""It has spread rapidly throughout England and Scotland. ""Because of how easily Omicron is transmitted and its ability to infect large numbers of people, this could translate into large numbers of people being admitted to hospital. ""We are already seeing increases in the number of people admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in London. ""We should be prepared for the same to happen here."" First Minister Mark Drakeford says the ""vast majority"" of coronavirus infections in Wales at the moment are caused by the Delta variant, but this is the ""calm before the storm"". He says the Delta variant will continue to be the main cause of infections up to Christmas: ""This is the form of coronavirus, which caused the large peak of cases earlier in the autumn. ""The rate remains high across Wales but it is currently stable at around 500 cases per 100,000 people. ""But this is the calm before the storm. ""We are seeing cases of Omicron increasing every day in Wales â and across the UK."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Anti-5G necklaces found to be dangerously radioactive,"Necklaces and accessories claiming to ""protect"" people from 5G mobile networks have been found to be radioactive. The Dutch authority for nuclear safety and radiation protection (ANVS) issued a warning about ten products it found gave off harmful ionising radiation. It urged people not to use the products, which could cause harm with long-term wear. There is no evidence that 5G networks are harmful to health. The World Health Organization says 5G mobile networks are safe, and not fundamentally different from existing 3G and 4G signals. Mobile networks use non-ionising radio waves that do not damage DNA. Despite this, there have beenattacks on transmittersby people who believe they are harmful. The products identified included an ""Energy Armor"" sleeping mask, bracelet and necklace. A bracelet for children, branded Magnetix Wellness, was also found to be emitting radiation. The bracelet for children was found to be radioactive ""Don't wear it any more, put it away safely and wait for the return instructions,"" the ANVS said in a statement. ""The sellers in the Netherlands known to the ANVS have been told that the sale is prohibited and must be stopped immediately, and that they must inform their customers about this."" Conspiracy theories have fuelled a market of ""anti-5G"" devices that are typically found to have no effect. In May 2020, the UK'sTrading Standards sought to halt salesof a Â£339 USB stick that claimed to offer ""protection"" from 5G. So-called ""anti-radiation stickers"" have also beensold on Amazon.

Tories lose seat they held for nearly 200 years,"This video can not be played Watch Lib Dem by-election winner Helen Morgan's victory speech The Conservatives have lost the North Shropshire seat they held for 115 years to the Liberal Democrats in a by-election blow to Boris Johnson. Winner Helen Morgan overturned a Tory majority of almost 23,000, declaring that the ""party is over"" for the PM. The result follows a torrid week for Mr Johnson, who has faced criticism over Downing Street parties and a rebellion by his own MPs over Covid measures. Tory MP Sir Roger Gale said the prime minister was on ""last orders"". ""One more strike and he's out,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the by-election ""has to be seen as a referendum on the prime minister's performance"". Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""I know that the voters of North Shropshire are fed up and they wanted to give us a kicking... We've heard that message loud and clear."" But he added: ""I don't think this amounts to a sea-change."" Analysis: Has Johnson lost his winning touch? Live: Lib Dems earn shock win The by-election followed the resignation of Owen Paterson, the MP for North Shropshire since 1997, who was found to have breached parliamentary rules on lobbying. The seat has been won by the Conservatives at every general election for nearly 200 years, although it was briefly held by a Liberal MP under its old name of Oswestry after a by-election in 1904. In her victory speech, Ms Morgan, who won by 5,925 votes, said: ""The people of North Shropshire have spoken on behalf of the British people. They have said loudly and clearly, 'Boris Johnson, the party is over.' ""Your government, run on lies and bluster, will be held accountable. It will be scrutinised, it will be challenged and it can and will be defeated."" Ms Morgan's victory takes the number of Lib Dem MPs up to 13, still significantly down from a high of more than 60 during the mid-2000s. The party lost dozens of its seats at the 2015 general election after being part of a coalition government with the Conservatives. But, at a celebration rally in Oswestry, part of the North Shropshire constituency, former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said millions of people around the UK ""have woken up this morning feeling that a bit of light has broken into the darkness"". He also held up a large blue balloon bearing the slogan ""Boris's bubble"", which Ms Morgan, formerly a chartered accountant, proceeded to burst with a foot-long pin. The government is going to try and say this is mid-term misery - and, yes, by-elections are a way the public can stick two fingers up to a government when they're cross. But let's be plain: this is an appalling result for the Conservatives, in a part of the country where the tradition of voting Tory is baked into the earth. This isn't a little slip up; it's a disaster. People on the ground say the Tory campaign was going OK, until all of the recent shenanigans in Downing Street emerged, and that that is when support fell off a cliff. Boris Johnson does have an extraordinary ability to bounce back. But there are people in the Conservative Party who are pencilling in the possibility of a summer leadership election. Things are febrile, and we shouldn't predict things with any certainty - but there's no doubt this is a really dangerous moment for the prime minister. Fourteen candidates stood in Thursday's by-election. Ms Morgan took 17,957 votes, with Conservative Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst amassing 12,032 and Labour's Ben Wood coming third with 3,686. The last-placed candidate, independent Yolande Kenward, received just three votes. The North Shropshire result saw a the seventh biggest swing - 34.2% - in a by-election since World War Two. It is the second loss of a former Conservative stronghold to the Lib Dems since the  general election, with the party seizing Chesham and Amersham, in Buckinghamshire, with a 25% swing in July. Earlier this month, the Toriesheld Old Bexley and Sidcup in a by-electionfollowing the death of MP James Brokenshire, but the majority was cut from nearly 19,000 to 4,478, with a 10% swing to Labour. The North Shropshire seat has existed in some form since the 1830s and, until Friday, had always had a Conservative MP. The area voted strongly in favour of Brexit in the 2016 referendum, but this did not stop the pro-EU Lib Dems taking the constituency. The by-election came just two days after Boris Johnsonexperienced his biggest rebellion in office,when 100 Conservative MPs voted against the government's proposals to introduce Covid passes in England. It also followedrows about a Number 10 Christmas party during lockdown restrictions last Decemberand the prime minister's appearance at a virtual quiz alongside two colleagues at about the same time. Before that, there had also been a fine for the Conservative Party over the financing of Mr and Mrs Johnson's renovation of the No 10 flat, and the fallout over Owen Paterson's departure,with the prime minister admitting some fault over the latter.,external This video can not be played Watch Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey's reaction to the result: ""We've brought new hope to the whole nation"" Reacting to his party losing North Shropshire, Dr Shastri-Hurst said: ""We are 11 years into Conservative government. Our elections are never an easy thing to do. ""But of course, we do need to reflect upon the result and I am sure as a party we will do that."" But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who is currently self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, said it was a ""watershed moment in our politics"". ""Millions of people are fed up with Boris Johnson and his failure to provide leadership throughout the pandemic and last night the voters of North Shropshire spoke for all of them,"" he added. Labour, which came second in North Shropshire at the 2019 election, saw its share of the vote fall from 22.1% to 9.7%. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Breakfast: ""We put the effort into it that was proportionate to our chances of winning. ""But clearly people wanted to send a message to the government that they're fed up with the incompetence, the sleaze, the kind of revelations we've seen over the last few weeks. ""The government has to take heed of that."" Correction 17th February 2022: This article originally reported that the Conservative Party held the North Shropshire seat for nearly 200 years. In fact the seat was held by a Liberal MP, under its old name of Oswestry, from 1904-1906, following a by-election and so we have amended the article to make clear that the seat was held by the Conservative Party for 115 years.

Ports and Eurostar busy ahead of France travel ban,"Passengers queuing to board Eurostar trains at St Pancras on Friday afternoon Ports are reporting long queues to board ferries and Eurostar has advised ticketless customers to avoid St Pancras station ahead of a ban on travel to France at 23:00 GMT. Most of the rail operator's services are sold out after a rise in bookings in response to the Covid restrictions announced by France on Thursday. Many flights are fully booked and there were two-hour waits at Dover. France said the ban was due to UK's surge in Omicron cases. The ban will mean only those with ""compelling reasons"" will be able to travel between the UK and France after 23:00, and tourist or business trips will not be permitted. By 09:00 on Friday at Dover, P&O Ferries said people were having to queue for two hours at border control and a further 30 minutes at check-in. The company said it would put anyone who missed their departure time on the next available ferry. Eurotunnel also reported a large amount of traffic, and long queues were seen at St Pancras station as people queued for Eurostar trains. France to drastically restrict travel from UK What are France's new rules for UK travellers? Covid cases hit record as booster drive continues Chancellor to hold Omicron crisis talks with firms Ferry company DFDS said it expected services to be busy ""as people prepare to get away for Christmas to see family and friends before the restrictions come into effect"". But it said it had ""plenty of capacity"". Eurostar said bookings increased after the announcement, although it would not give exact figures, and it expected trains to be busy. The company has been advising passengers not to come to the station unless they have a ticket and the necessary testing completed. While some rushed to beat the deadline, several people messaged Eurostar on social media to demand refunds on tickets they could no longer use. Vehicles queue up at the entrance of Port of Dover on Friday evening Eurostar's St Pancras terminal was packed with passengers trying to travel before the ban The company has offered a voucher or the opportunity to rebook tickets without a further fee. The office of French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the UK was facing a ""landslide"" of Omicron cases, and the ""extremely rapid spread"" of the variant had prompted the travel restrictions. There were 88,376 infections reported in the UK on Thursday, setting a new record for the second day running as the new variant spreads. Lorry drivers are among the exceptions to the travel ban, along with French citizens and legal residents returning home, their partners and children, and EU citizens travelling home through France. People intending to travel through France to another country are only allowed to make their journey if they stay within the international area of an airport for less than 24 hours. Anyone still permitted to travel will have to show evidence of a negative Covid test taken within 24 hours and must isolate for at least two days on arrival. Long queues snaked around the station as Eurostar advised anyone without a ticket to stay away Travel firms have described the measures as a ""hammer blow"". Trade association Abta requested an urgent meeting with Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to discuss the industry's need for financial support. Chief executive Mark Tanzer said its income was down by 78% this year, compared with 40% in the hospitality sector. He said: ""Over the past fortnight, we have heard nothing from government about how travel and tourism might be supported. The time to act is now."" Travellers 'devastated' over French restrictions The chancellor cut short his business trip to California yesterday and is preparing tomeet business leaders for crisis talks, with Mr Sunak saying the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to support jobs.

Man guilty of murdering millionaire hotelier,"Sir Richard Sutton's wealth was valued at Â£301m in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List A man who killed one of the UK's richest men and paralysed his own mother has been found guilty of murder and attempted murder. Thomas Schreiber stabbed 83-year-old Sir Richard Sutton at his home near Gillingham, Dorset, in April. Schreiber, 35, also attacked his mother Anne Schreiber, who was Sir Richard's partner, during the ""ferocious"" attack, Winchester Crown Court heard. He will be sentenced at the same court on Monday. Thomas Schreiber stabbed Sir Richard at least five times, the court heard A cry of ""yes"" could be heard from the public gallery, where some members of the family were sitting, as the verdicts were read out. The judge, Mr Justice Garnham, told the defendant: ""The only sentence I can pass is of life imprisonment but for the offence of murder I have to set the minimum number of years and I also have to sentence you for the attempted murder of your mother."" Armed police were called to Moorhill, Sir Richard's home in Higher Langham that he shared with both Anne and Thomas Schreiber, at 19:30 BST on 7 April. This video can not be played Police were called to Sir Richard's Moorhill estate near Gillingham in Dorset Ms Schreiber was described as being ""barely conscious"" when she was found in the kitchen, before being carried out by police officers to waiting paramedics. Sir Richard was found dead outside his upstairs bedroom. He had been stabbed at least five times. Prosecutor Adam Feest QC told the court: ""Police didn't know what they would find. This was a ferocious and sustained attack on both victims."" Schreiber had been harbouring ""feelings of resentment"" towards the couple, having been forced to live at Moorhill due to the pandemic, jurors were told. Sir Richard and Ms Schreiber were living with the defendant at the time of the attack The court heard Schreiber told a friend he ""couldn't stand"" Sir Richard. Millionaire murder accused 'couldn't stop' attack Hotelier murder accused incensed by row, jury told Hotelier died in ferocious attack, court told Another message from Schreiber said: ""My mind is consumed with hatred of the worst kind... I contemplate murdering them... I want them to suffer."" The fatal attack happened on the eighth anniversary of the death of Schreiber's father, David, who the court heard suffered from depression and had a drinking problem. Sir Richard had an estimated family fortune of Â£301m He separated from Ms Schreiber in about 2003. The court heard Sir Richard had given Schreiber and his two sisters Â£100,000 as deposits to buy a house, along with a monthly Â£1,000 allowance. Schreiber had previously admitted manslaughter and also pleaded guilty to driving a Range Rover dangerously on the A303, A4 and M3 in a high-speed chase as he fled to London after the attack. He was eventually detained by police on Chiswick High Road. Thomas Schreiber was pursued by at speeds of up to 135mph as he fled towards central London Sir Richard was listed at number 435 in the Sunday Times Rich List last year, with an estimated family fortune of Â£301 million - a rise of Â£83 million on the previous year.

Rail fares to rise at fastest pace for nine years,"Regulated rail fares in England will rise by 3.8% from March, in the biggest increase for nine years. These regulated prices make up about half of fares and include season tickets on most commuter routes. Increases are normally implemented on the first working day of every year, but have been delayed until March since 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The fare rises are based on the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation in July. This time, the government says it will not increase fares by the normal formula of RPI plus 1%, which it used this year when fares went up by 2.6%. Fares for rail services in Northern Ireland are set by state-owned operator Translink, which does not use RPI. The Scottish Government has not announced its plan for 2022. Wales usually matches changes made in England. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to increasing public transport use in Wales and competitively-priced fares are an important way to do this. We are considering the options available to us."" A 3.8% rise in England would lead to increases in the cost of annual season tickets such as: Brighton to London (any route): Up Â£194 to Â£5,302 Liverpool to Manchester (any route): Up Â£105 to Â£2,865 Rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: ""[This] strikes a fair balance, ensuring we can continue to invest record amounts into a more modern, reliable railway, ease the burden on taxpayers and protect passengers from the highest RPI in years. ""Delaying the changes until March 2022 offers people the chance to save money by renewing their fares at last year's price."" Operators are generally expected to match these rises for unregulated fares, although they have been hit hard by the cost of lower passenger numbers during the pandemic. With the cost of living going up, another price rise will inevitably prompt some grimaces - particularly for commuters considering a regular return to the office when the current working-from-home guidance eventually lifts. But demand for traditional season tickets was already falling before lockdowns caused rail usage to plummet. And it is leisure, not commuter use, that has led the recovery so far. The dilemma here is how to attract people back onto the railways, while also trying to address the financial impact of the pandemic on the industry. Raise prices too much and passengers won't want to return. The government says it is protecting people by going with July's RPI figure, even though inflation has risen markedly since then and the increase won't come in until March. The industry says it is trying to adapt to passengers' changing needs. So-called flexible season tickets - effectively a bulk purchase of tickets to be used over a set period - are part of that. Around 100,000 have been bought since they launched in late June. The government said Â£14bn of taxpayers' money had been spent to keep services running during the pandemic. It said the rise would help meet some of those costs as well as pay for service improvements. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""As some fares rise it is even more important that Great British Railways, when it is set up, gives life to the government's ambition to make rail fares better value for money. ""The need to boost passenger numbers and revenue through innovative rail ticket retailing and offers will be vital. Keeping costs under control will also be needed."" But Louise Haigh, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: ""This brutal Tory fare hike will be a nightmare before Christmas for millions of passengers. ""Families already facing soaring taxes and bills will now be clobbered with an eye-watering rise in the cost of the daily commute."" Inflation rose by 5.1%in the 12 months to November, the highest level in a decade, prompting the Bank of England to increase the UK interest rate for the first times in three years. The Department for Transport also announced the Book with Confidence scheme will be extended until the end of March next year. This allows passengers to change their travel plans up until the night before departure, without being charged a fee, or cancel their tickets and receive a refund in the form of rail vouchers.

"Royal Albert Hall boss notes huge drop in salesCraig Hassall calls for ""a stronger government position"" to help the struggling theatre industry.","The Royal Albert Hall is a historic London venue The boss of the Royal Albert Hall has said the venue has seen a huge drop in sales since the spread of Omicron. Craig Hassall, chief executive officer of the historic London hall, is calling for ""a stronger government position"" to help the struggling arts industry. Equity, a trade union for performing arts workers, has written to the chancellor requesting financial support for those affected by cancellations. Shows across the UK are being cancelled and postponed due to Covid outbreaks. They include West End hits The Lion King and The Life of Pi, as well as The Sorcerer's Apprentice at Northern Stage, Jack and the Beanstalk at Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, and The Book of Mormon at the Palace, Manchester. Hassall told the BBC: ""Our Christmas sales were doing tremendously well until Omicron hit and then they absolutely plateaued and we are seeing a huge drop in sales. Craig Hassall is CEO of the Royal Albert Hall in London ""We've lost one show actually, but nothing beyond that. I know that the West End is really suffering from people with Covid, crew and so on, losing shows. ""We've been OK, touch wood, but the impact on sales is certainly being seen across our season."" Top theatres cancel shows after Covid outbreaks Venues report 'catastrophic' audience declines Masks required in more indoor venues in England Last week, face coverings were made compulsory in most indoor venues in England, under measures to tackle the new variant. People across the UK have also been advised to limit social gatherings, in the run-up to the festive period. Hassall added that he thought the government advice on the matter has been ""a little bit cloudy and a bit vague"". ""In terms of the Royal Albert Hall, we're not covered by Plan B because of our capacity. And yet we've asked people to wear masks and we have asked people to show their Covid status, and people are very compliant and very happy to do so. ""But I think a stronger government position would help people feel more confident to come out to places like the Royal Albert Hall, where they can feel safe and we know that people out will be safe in a place like ours with our cleaning regimes or ventilation protocols. ""But the government advice has been a bit woolly I'm sorry to say and that's not really helping things."" The Lion King is one of many shows across the country that has seen cancellations In response, a spokeswoman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told the BBC: ""Our unprecedented Â£2bn Culture Recovery Fund has given out Â£1.5bn in grants and loans, and almost Â£200m to the devolved administrations. The Â£300m third round of the fund is still open for applications, providing vital ongoing support for the cultural, heritage and creative sectors. ""We will keep the delivery of the programme under active review and consider how best to adapt it in line with the needs of the sector."" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has also urged organisations in need of support toapply to the fund for assistance,external. Ray Spencer, who plays Dame Bella in the pantomime Rapunzel at the Customs House Theatre in South Shields, Tyneside, told BBC Newcastle the production was ""20% down on what we'd normally expect at this time"". ""A lot of that has been schools, and organised parties from factories, shops, guilds, WIs (Women's Institutes) haven't come in the numbers they'd normally come,"" he said. Spencer, who is also the executive director of the theatre, told reporter Fergus Hewison: ""So, bottom line - that means in excess of Â£90,000, probably near Â£100,000 of lost income and eventually lost profit. ""What we do at Christmas, like many theatres - pantomime - is a third, or 40% of people's turnover. So to lose that sort of percentage is a massive blow for all the work that we do which is reliant on what we make for Christmas."" He added that if social distancing were to be introduced, it would be ""a disaster"". ""If we were to close again, we don't have the sort of reserves that we would like to have to be able to carry the building, which still has its overheads,"" he said. ""We would hope that the government could find some assistance to support organisations and everybody else forced to close."" Face masks are now mandatory in indoor venues like theatres and cinemas Jamie Eastlake is the owner of the N16 theatre company, which is rehearsing for its production of Cinderella at a bar in Blyth in Northumberland. He told BBC Newcastle a fairy godmother - or some cash from the chancellor - is needed to save theatre at the moment. ""Bookings are falling through the door, we're having cancellations left, right and centre. We have staff ill, we've had actors drop out, we've had to push productions back. The word nightmare doesn't really sum it up at the moment. ""We thought it was the ultimate nightmare being close down but this year seems to be even worse. There's a huge hole coming to us, we know that, and I think a lot of organisations know that as well."" He said their quietist time of year was between January and March, and that it would be ""incredibly difficult"" to fill the financial hole left by Covid without ""some level of support"". The calls for support come after theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber said no-one in the government listens"" to the fears of those within the theatre industry, which he describes as being ""decimated"". On Thursday night, his production of Cinderella was cancelled due to ""Covid-related absences"", as well as performances of hit musicals Hamilton and The Lion King in London. ""It has been a terrible few days and it is getting worse,""Lord Lloyd Webber wrote in the Daily Mail,external. ""It is simply heartbreaking for me to see our industry decimated by a situation beyond all of our control."" Gig tickets, Christmas and Covid: Can I get a refund? On Wednesday theatre director Sir Nicholas Hytner called for greater support for struggling entertainment and arts venues. The former artistic director of the National Theatre told Newsnight on Wednesday that venues were closing as actors and crews were coming down with Covid. Bookings, he noted, had ""fallen off a cliff"". ""We are in crisis mode at the moment,"" he said ""We now surely don't want to get into a situation where the government's investment last year [the Cultural Recovery Fund] is wasted because the sectors that it has supported collapse in the new year. ""We need to see short-term finance, we need to see loans, we need to see VAT looked at again, we need to see business rates looked at again."" English gig venues have been open without social distancing since July Elsewhere, Cabaret, featuring Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley, has axed some shows at London's Playhouse Theatre, while the The National Theatre has cancelled certain performances of Hex, based on the classic fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, and The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time. Jon Morgan, director of Theatres Trust said that while new government advice, urging caution around gatherings, ""did not directly affect theatres"" there had ""already been an impact on ticket sales and theatres are finding themselves in a precarious position"". ""Like the hospitality sector, the theatre sector will need additional economic support to help it survive this latest challenge,"" he added. Other entertainment industry bodies have also been speaking about the impact of Covid on their colleagues. Creative UK called for measures including a return of the furlough scheme and extension of the Culture Recovery Fund, while UK Music has written to Chancellor Rishi Sunak asking for ""urgent targeted financial support"".

coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News New data on
Omicron has been released by the UK Health Security Agency based on people
infected so far. It shows that 18%
of people with Omicron infected someone else in their household, compared to
10% of people who tested positive with Delta. The percentage of
people infecting others outside their household was also higher for Omicron
than for Delta - nearly 9% compared to 3%. People are also
more likely to be reinfected with Omicron after having had a previous
coronavirus infection. And studies show
that lateral flow tests are just as good at detecting Omicron as they are at
detecting the Delta variant of the virus. As a result, health officials are urging people
to test regularly, particularly before attending social gatherings. Denmark's prime minister has announced that her government intends to propose new restrictions to curb
the rapid spread of coronavirus and the new Omicron variant,
which now accounts for a fifth of all cases registered in
the country. Denmark has seen cases rise rapidly over the past week and daily infections broke another
record on Friday as 11,194 Covid cases were recorded. The country has recorded a total of 9,009 Omicron infections so far. ""In record time, the rules of the game have again been
changed,"" Mette Frederiksen said at a news conference on Friday. The new restrictions, which will need approval from
parliament, include plans to close a host of venues such as theatres, cinemas,
entertainment parks and conference centres. Frederiksen also proposed to ban the serving of alcohol after 22:00 local time and urged Danes to limit their social contacts in the run up to Christmas. Despite the increase in cases, the country is in a better position than it was last Christmas, with death rates and hospital admissions significantly below the previous peak. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Seven Covid cases have been
recorded in Taiwan today, and while by international standards this number
might seem low, it is the highest number of cases in more than three months. There has been renewed concern
about a potential outbreak in Taiwan this week after clusters of cases were
identified at two quarantine hotels: one in Taipei and
one in Taoyuan. Outbreaks amongst people on the
same floors led to suspicions of cross-contamination, which have now been
confirmed. As a result, Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has
classified these cases as locally-transmitted. These new cases have led to the
CECC making it mandatory that all arrivals now undergo six Covid-19 tests. It
has also urged increased inspections and ventilation at quarantine hotels. Taiwan has consistently
recorded a single case or zero cases since 20 September. These latest developments come
shortly on the heels of Taiwan reopening its borders, to allow an influx of
people to return for the Lunar New Year. Relaxed rules were introduced
from Tuesday meaning that arrivals can stay a minimum of seven days at a quarantine
facility, rather than the previously-mandated 14-days. This is on the condition
that they self-isolate at home, and carry out regular PCR tests. Anna Baldwin had planned a family trip to Disneyland for Christmas From tonight only those with ""compelling reasons"" will be able to travel from the UK to France, meaning last-minute cancellations for families who had booked holidays. Mum-of-two Anna Baldwin is ""devastated"" a surprise trip to Disneyland for her sons' Christmas present won't be able to go ahead. As well as the cost of tests she's already paid for, Anna is also worried about the extra expense on things like food for a Christmas at home. Meanwhile, businesses have also been hit. Victor Dapremont, a sales manager for the Mademoiselle Hotel in Paris, says 80% of guests coming from England have cancelled their bookings, with Brits normally making up around a third of guests. Read more about the impact on holidaymakers and businesses here. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Boris Johnson and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have held talks on coronavirus funding amid the threat of the Omicron variant  - but no extra money is heading to Scotland at the moment. The BBC understands the Scottish government thinks the talks were constructive but inconclusive. More talks between the PM and devolved administrations are due this weekend. Earlier, Sturgeon said it would be ""unconscionable"" if more money was not allocated by the UK government ""very quickly"". The BBC has approached the UK Treasury for comment. Read more on the latest Covid situation in Scotlandhere. Rising Covid cases have left London's fire and rescue service with ""unprecedented"" staff shortages, the Fire Brigades Union says. According to London Fire Brigade statistics 40 fire engines, out of a total of 142, were unavailable on both the day and night shift on Thursday - a level also reached for at least parts of the 10, 11 and 15 December. The union says Covid has been skyrocketing in the service as the Omicron variant has taken hold in the capital, with almost 10% of operational firefighters now either having tested positive or self-isolating. It says Covid-related shortages are having a greater impact due to ""already low levels of fire and rescue staffing in the capital"". The union's London regional secretary Jon Lambe says Omicron is having a ""devastating impact"" on the London Fire Brigade. Cosmo (centre) will spend Christmas with a friend We've been hearing today from people who have tested positive for Covid who will now have to isolate over Christmas. Cosmo Wilson is among those who will be spending Christmas away from family - for the second year running - after testing positive for Covid. Last year the UK's travel restrictions meant he couldn't fly back to see his parents in Thailand, so he spent the festive season with friends in Nottingham instead. This year he had been planning to stay with his sister and their aunt and uncle, in Uckfield, East Sussex. But the 22-year-old waitertested positive this week and his self-isolation ends as the clock ticks past midnightinto Christmas Day. So he'll spend the day in London with a friend instead. Cosmo says seeing the positive test result was a ""jarring"" moment. ""The main feeling was just disbelief,"" he tells Newsbeat. The man heading an investigation into lockdown parties at Downing Street invited staff to a ""Christmas party"" in his office last year. Top civil servant Simon Case is due to report shortly on claims Covid rules were broken at events for staff in the run up to last Christmas. But the BBC has been told that Case's position as chairman of the inquiry is now under consideration. The Cabinet Office has been asked to comment. We'll bring you more on this developing story as we get it. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics We were expecting these case figures to go up - and we can expect them to go up further. The number of people getting tested is up about 20% in a week - but the case numbers are up about 40% in the same time. And we can expect that to go up further because when you look at London and Scotland - the two parts of the UK where Omicron is furthest advanced - cases are rising even faster there. So how long will it go on for? The modellers aren't sure yet. They're talking about peaks early in the new year - if you keep on doubling and doubling and doubling cases, there'll eventually be more people getting infected than there are people in the UK - so there is a limit on this. The real question - which still hasn't been answered - then becomes: how ill does it make people and how much pressure is it going to put on the healthcare system? Here are some graphics explaining the latest coronavirus situation in the UK. UK case numbers continued to climb today, with another 93,045 infections reported on Friday - a record high for a third consecutive day Deaths remain stable - but it's worth remembering this current spike in Omicron cases won't be reflected in these figures yet There are more than 7,000 Covid patients in hospital in the UK The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 132,836 or 38.6% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 4.5% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. A further 93,045
coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 111 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The UK
reported 88,376 cases yesterday. Molly Nancarrow felt ""very stressed, anxious and overwhelmed"" when her lateral flow test came back positive for Covid on Tuesday. ""I just can't believe this is happening,"" the 20-year-old tells Newsbeat. Molly, who's a student at the University of Gloucestershire, says it's ""heartbreaking""
to be missing the build-up to Christmas with her family in Bath because the days before 25 December make the day itself ""more magical"". ""It's what gets me in the Christmas mood, spending time with my family. Being on my own is going to make it a little bit harder."" Instead of going on walks and visiting Christmas markets with her mum, step-dad and brothers, Molly's going to spend time on FaceTime with them instead. She's waiting on a PCR test result, but no matter what comes back, she says she'll stay away from home until she's feeling better because her brothers are vulnerable. Read more of Molly's storyhere. Some more now on the study we reported on earlier from Imperial College London. Their researchers say the risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant is 5.4 times greater than with the Delta variant. The study suggests protection against reinfection by Omicron from past infection may be as low as 19%. According to the data, boosters are vital in controlling Omicron, and could provide around 85% protection against severe illness, as we reported a short while ago. But researchers say they may lose some effectiveness over time. They estimate the proportion of Omicron among all Covid cases between 29 November and 11 December was doubling every two days up to 11 December. Based on this, they also estimate the reproduction number (R) of Omicron was above 3, over the period studied. Read more Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Yesterday, China recorded its
100,000th case of Covid-19 since the very start of the pandemic. There have only been 56
locally-transmitted cases of the virus in the last 24 hours. The majority of
cases are in two hotspots: the eastern province of Zhejiang (which neighbours
Shanghai), and the northern reaches of Inner Mongolia. Cases have remained low in
recent months in China, due to the countryâs zero-Covid policy. This involves
locking down communities the moment one person tests positive, and mass-testing
large populations for any âsilent carriersâ. Officials have projected that
this strategy will remain in place until the spring. The country is now introducing
new restrictions ahead of the festive period. It is anticipating increased travel
over Christmas, and ahead of the 2022 Lunar New Year, which will fall on 1
February. Today, the Ministry of Culture
and Tourism is enforcing rules that cross-border provincial tourism be
suspended if any cases are detected in land border cities or ports, in order to
prevent cases at Chinaâs borders spreading more inland. Official media are also noting
today that many areas, including the cities of Beijing and Xiâan, are making it a
requirement that travellers in the new year show a negative Covid-19 test
within 48 hours of travel. Ronan O'Gara's La Rochelle side were due to travel to play Bath on Saturday before the travel ban We've just heard about Covid causing disruption in England's Premier League. Now, it's been announced that five Heineken Champions Cup fixtures between French and British Rugby Union teams have been postponed this weekend, as well as two games from the European Challenge Cup. The announcement follows the French government's decision on Thursday to ban all non-essential travel to and from the UK and to tighten testing requirements for travellers. The French sports ministry told Reuters they had been ""working on getting an exemption through meetings with the government's crisis unit"". Despite the decision, Welsh side Dragons will play Lyon tonight, with the French team due to return immediately after the game and before the border restrictions come into force. The blanket postponement may cause some controversy as it comes after Saturday's clash between Ospreys and Racing 92 was cancelled due to a number of positive Covid-19 cases in the Welsh side. Irish side Leinster had to forfeit their game against Montpellier for similar reasons. The Irish side is said to be furious after organisers handed them 28-0 defeat for their inability to fulfil the fixture. The UK has recorded 3,201 new cases of the Omicron variant, up from yesterday's figure of 1,691. It takes the total number of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK to 14,909 - although the true figure is believed to be much higher because not all labs can detect the variant and not everyone will come forward for testing. Football fans have their Covid passes checked at the Chelsea v Everton match Premier League clubs willmeet on Monday to discuss the escalating crisisaround the coronavirus pandemic with nine games postponed over the past week - including five already from this weekend's 10-match fixture list. Brentford boss Thomas Frank is leading calls for games to be postponed until Boxing Day to enable a reset, while others have asked for clarity on the situation. Meanwhile, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has cancelled a press conference after
returning an inconclusive coronavirus test result. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston says getting vaccinated is ""the socially
responsible thing to do"" after the English Football League confirmed on Thursday that one in four
players in its competitions had no intention to receive a single vaccine at this
stage. Shadow Sports Minister Jeff Smith echoes his call, saying that as ""role models"" he would urge
any footballers not yet vaccinated to do so. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Father smothered his children and poisoned partnerJordan Monaghan is sentenced to a minimum of 40 years for murdering his daughter, son and partner.Lancashire","Jordan Monaghan has been convicted of murdering his two children and his partner A murderer who smothered his own baby daughter and his toddler son before going on to poison a new partner has been jailed for a minimum of 40 years. Jordan Monaghan killed 24-day-old Ruby at their Blackburn home in January 2013. Eight months later, he smothered 21-month-old Logan at a swimming pool. The 30-year-old was on police bail six years later when he went on to poison his 23-year-old girlfriend, Evie Adams. Monaghan was found guilty at Preston Crown Court on three counts of murder. The construction worker smothered Ruby on New Year's Day in 2013 as she slept in a Moses basket. Ruby's mother Laura Gray, 28, was sleeping upstairs at the time. Eight months later, Monaghan took his son Logan to Waves swimming pool in Blackburn and smothered him while they were alone in a changing room cubicle. The court heard the day before Logan's death, Ms Gray had told Monaghan their relationship was over after discovering he owed thousands of pounds in gambling debts. Sentencing Monaghan, Mr Justice Goose told him: ""You are an exceptionally controlling, selfish and cruel man. ""The trigger to these offences were your volatile relationships. ""The consequences were the snuffing out of the lives of two very young children and a young woman."" The judge added: ""[Ruby's] life had barely started and you extinguished it."" Lancashire Police said that after murdering his son, Monaghan posed for pictures and spoke to newspapers about the tragedy of losing two children. After an inquest into Logan's death in August 2013, he told reporters: ""It feels as if history is repeating itself. ""Everything has been taken away from us. ""We can't believe this has happened for a second time. We are just in shock and completely devastated."" Monaghan smothered both his daughter Ruby and son Logan The 10-week trial heard both Ruby and Logan suffered a ""collapse"" and were seen by medics in the months before their deaths, but no serious medical conditions were found. Prosecutor Duncan Smith QC told the jury both infants recovered prior to a final fatal event, when Monaghan ""unlawfully and deliberately"" obstructed their breathing. The court heard parts of Logan and Ruby's mother Ms Gray's victim impact statement, which said all she had ever wanted was to be a mum and to ""give my children the love and opportunities I never had growing up"". She said: ""When the children were born, they consumed my world. ""I loved every single day I had with them. ""Jordan was their daddy, he was one of the two people who was meant to love and protect them the most in the whole world. ""Instead, he did the opposite."" Ms Gray could be heard weeping in the public gallery as the verdicts were given. A post-mortem examination concluded Ruby died from acute bronchopneumonia and Logan's cause of death remained ""unascertained"". Neither child's death could be explained by illness, genetic defect or natural causes, and Monaghan was arrested in 2018 after police reviewed their deaths when further information came to light. In October 2019, he was on bail for their murders when he killed Ms Adams with a deadly cocktail of prescription drugs, including tramadol and diazepam, which he had bought illegally on the black market. The court heard Monaghan committed the murders because he could not face rejection by his partners. Police had warned Ms Adams, who had suffered ""chronic abuse"" before being fostered aged 12, not to be with him and a court order was made banning contact. However, the relationship continued and Monaghan killed her and then faked a suicide note after she threatened to end their relationship. Jurors heard he had told her: ""I won't keep putting up with you saying we are over."" The court was told Monaghan had staged the suicide note's ""discovery"" by having it fall out of a picture frame as he removed a photo of the couple to place in her coffin. Monaghan was on police bail for his children's murders when he poisoned his new girlfriend Evie Adams Monaghan was also convicted of two counts of attempted murder to a third child who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Due to a minor illness, he was not in court as the guilty verdicts were delivered following six days of deliberation by the jury. Speakign afterwards, the Crown Prosecution Service's Martin Hill said Monaghan's cruelty was ""beyond belief"" and his ruthlessness was ""harrowing"". ""It is difficult to comprehend the depravity that went into planning and committing these murders,"" he said.

How did Tories turn off North Shropshire?,"Helen Morgan is the newly elected Lib Dem MP for North Shropshire After a long history of voting Tory, Martin Dicken will no longer back the Conservatives ""as long as I have got breath in my lungs"". ""You can't trust any Conservative politician,"" the North Shropshire voter told the BBC. This in a constituency that for 115 years has never turned its back on the Tory party - until now. As Helen Morgan swept the Lib Dems to victory with a 6,000-vote majority, what went wrong for the Conservatives in this ""true blue"" area? This is a quiet corner of England - only 80,000 people live within the geographically huge constituency which covers 93,521 hectares. There are no cities, only a handful of market towns including Wem, Whitchurch, Ellesmere, Oswestry and Market Drayton. During the election campaign, voters made clear what mattered to them was local issues: farming, the NHS and improving public transport and connectivity. Martin Dicken said he would no longer vote for the Conservative Party ""Our police station has closed, our ambulance service has closed, we have got one doctors surgery for the whole of the Whitchurch area where they're planning another 5,000-7,000 houses in the next three or four years,"" Mr Dicken, who lives in the town, said. ""So for me, the Conservative party, I don't think have got their feet on the ground, they need to wake up and not bury their heads in the sand over loads of measures."" Likewise for Jane Gray, from the village of Woore: local issues were front and centre when she decided which box to mark with a cross on Thursday. Jane Gray, a traditional Tory supporter, voted Lib Dem for the first time in her life ""We have no services in this village, we have no buses. ""Children on third-level education can't get to any college unless they have parents with the car who can take them, or friends,"" she said. For the first time, her ballot was for the Lib Dems and not the Conservatives. ""I've never voted Lib Dem before, I have swung from Conservatives,"" she said. ""So we're very pleased."" One of the reasons Mr Dicken and other voters were impressed by the newly-elected Lib Dem MP was that she was ""a local lady"". Mrs Morgan, an accountant, lives in Harmer Hill, a village just south of Wem. The Conservative candidate Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst hails from Birmingham and many voters questioned whether he could truly understand what makes this rural constituency tick. Tory candidate Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst hails from Birmingham It's not difficult to find voters who have turned their back on the Conservatives for the first time. As well as local issues, stories of sleaze and misconduct have cut through to the electorate - indeed Mrs Morgan said the vote was a resounding message that ""enough is enough"". Lib Dems deliver shock by-election win in blow to PM Tories lose seat they held for nearly 200 years What to expect from an unexpected by-election Lynne Edwards, out shopping in Oswestry with her husband Keith, said voters were telling the PM they want something different It was allegations of sleaze that triggered this election in the first place. Owen Paterson, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 1997, resigned amid a lobbying scandal when he was found to have broken rules in his work for private companies which paid him thousands of pounds a month. ""I think [voters] are very fed up with what's gone on in the last few weeks,"" said Lynne Edwards, from Wem. Out shopping in Oswestry with her husband Keith, she said the Conservatives had ""a really difficult job with all that's being going on in Westminster"" but the switch away from the Tories was probably a temporary ""blip"". ""I think people are sending a bit of a message that perhaps we are fed up... we're telling Boris [Johnson] 'we want something different'."" Philip Simpson said Helen Morgan was the ""right candidate for a job"" Philip Simpson, from Rosehill Brick and Tile Yard near Market Drayton, also declined to give the Tories his usual support in this by-election. ""It was coming,"" he said. ""It seemed to me there was a lot of discontent with the local population in the way the government was handling the policies and the way they were implementing them and I think the [Liberal Democrat] candidate was clearly the candidate for the job,"" he said. ""When I looked at the candidates, Mrs Morgan, she had a good CV, she lived locally... I felt like she would have a good grip on the financial side of government spending."" Robert Hewson said he hoped the Lib Dems kept to election promises Even a Conservative councillor from Whitchurch is pleased his new MP is at least a local. ""It is nice to have someone local again,"" Councillor Robert Hewson said. ""The Conservative man, he was from out of town. I think people have got to know the area and know the towns."" He had previously supported Mr Paterson, who he said he had ""a lot of respect"" for. It's not over for the Tories, he said, but certainly ""a big shake up"". By Elizabeth Glinka, BBC Midlands Political Editor It's the scale of the victory that's the biggest surprise. In this 'true blue' Conservative seat, Helen Morgan made it not just over the line, but won with a comfortable majority of almost 6,000. During the past week the campaign has become increasingly intense as Westminster politics delivered a daily diet of controversy. The Conservative campaign locally came under pressure. Labour saw its vote share collapse and by the early hours the Lib Dems were confident enough to call it. Voters of all stripes perhaps lent their vote to the Liberal Democrats to send a message to the Conservative government and the prime minister. ""I hope it sends a message that we need more support,"" said Market Drayton sweet shop owner Jane Warner. Like so many others, the traditional Conservative supporter withheld her vote from the party this time around. Jane Warner voted for Labour's Ben Wood because he was ""a local lad"" ""We need them to be more relevant, we need them to understand smaller issues and the smaller towns in Shropshire that need as much attention as Westminster and London and the bigger cities."" Ms Warner instead voted for Labour's candidate Ben Wood and the reasoning is perhaps at this point predictable. ""I felt he was a local lad and really interested in local issues like local business and farming and those are really big issues in Market Drayton,"" she said. ""I didn't meet the Conservative candidate once - he didn't come in here, I didn't have anything through the door from him, I didn't know him. He wasn't a local person so I wasn't going to vote for him."" Perhaps the former Conservative leader of Shropshire Council summed it up most succinctly. Posting on Twitter, Keith Barrow, whose daughter Kirsty Walmsley stood for Reform UK, said the Tories had been ""arrogant and complacent at the start"". ""[The] Conservatives picked the wrong candidate who had the wrong policies,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he totally understood voters' frustrations. ""I hear what the voters are saying,"" he said. ""In all humility, I've got to accept that verdict"". Correction 17th February 2022: This article originally reported that the Conservative Party held the North Shropshire seat for nearly 200 years. In fact the seat was held by a Liberal MP, under its old name of Oswestry from 1904-1906  following a by-election and so we have amended the article to make clear that the seat was held by the Conservative Party for 115 years.

PM 'very disappointed' by Tory poll routThe Lib Dems take North Shropshire from the Tories in one of the biggest by-election upsets in years.UK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played Watch Helen Morgan celebrate her victory by bursting ""Boris' bubble"" Senior Tories have urged Boris Johnson to make changes following a huge by-election defeat for the Conservatives. Ex-Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said No 10 needed discipline while another senior Tory said the PM needed to get ""a bit of a bloody grip"". Mr Johnson said he was ""disappointed"" with his party's performance in the North Shropshire vote. The Lib Dems who won the ultra-safe Tory seat, said voters were ""fed up"" with Mr Johnson's ""incompetence"". The party's candidate, Helen Morgan, overturned a Tory majority of almost 23,000 at the last general election to win by 5,925 votes, saying: ""The people of North Shropshire have spoken on behalf of the British people. They have said loudly and clearly, 'Boris Johnson, the party is over.'"" Their historic victory came after a week dominated by claims of Covid rule-breaking in No 10 and a revolt by Mr Johnson's own MPs over restrictions. The PM blamed a ""constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians"" in the media for the result. Tories lose seat they held for nearly 200 years No 10 inquiry chief faces questions over own 'party' Analysis: Has Johnson lost his winning touch? How did Tories turn off true blue North Shropshire? Although few have commented publicly, Conservative MPs are said to be divided over Mr Johnson's future. Iain Duncan Smith - who led the party for two years - told the BBC the government had lost focus as a result of stories about Downing Street parties. ""The prime minister needs to show really strongly that he doesn't just disapprove but is prepared to get rid of people who are breaking those rules,"" he said. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith says the PM ""gets there has been a series of things happening which should not have doneâ. He also criticised Conservative MPs calling for a Mr Johnson to be replaced saying ""I want my colleagues to stop playing games.... the party has to get behind him."" Veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale described the result ""as a referendum on the prime minister's performance"". And former Scottish Tory leader Baroness Davidson told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Mr Johnson was ""drinking in the last-chance saloon"". She said Conservative MPs were ""looking for a bit of a bloody grip"" and an end to the government's ""own goals"". This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson's reaction to the North Shropshire by-election defeat Responding to his party's defeat, the prime minister said: ""Clearly the vote in North Shropshire is very disappointing result. I totally understand people's frustrations. I hear what the voters are saying."" The defeat comes at the end of a torrid week for Mr Johnson, during which100 Conservative MPs rebelledover government proposals to introduce Covid passes in England. There have also beencriticisms over Downing Street Christmas parties during restrictions last December. Civil service boss Simon Case had been conducting an inquiry into potential rule-breaching events in No 10,but he is now expected to step asideafter claims an event was held in his own office last year. The prime minister put much of the blame for the by-election defeat on media coverage, saying that ""what the people have been hearing is just a constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians and stuff that isn't about them"". ""The job of the government is to make people like you [journalists] interested in the booster roll-out and skills and housing and everything else we're doing,"" he added. ""Unfortunately we haven't been able to get the focus on those issues."" Boris Johnson is in a very precarious position, not just because of the monster by-election defeat in North Shropshire. This week huge numbers of his own backbenchers didn't back him on a key part of his plans to deal with the pandemic, and there was a report on how the lavish redecoration of his flat above Downing Street was paid for. There is a difference of opinion inside the Conservative Party of whether or not this is a situation that can be recovered from. Some MPs think it's a situation past saving and are focusing on when and how a change at the top can be conducted. Others, however, don't believe it's terminal. Mr Johnson said one of his stock lines - that he takes responsibility for everything that happens in the government. That's not the same self-reflection that some of his colleagues would like from him right now. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who is isolating with Covid, said his party could now beat the Conservatives ""anywhere"", adding: "" I think people are so fed up with Boris Johnson, so fed up with his incompetence and his behaviour, I think they'll be really happy about that."" The by-election was called because previous North Shropshire MP Owen Paterson quit in November after being found guilty of breaking parliamentary rules on lobbying - trying to influence government policy - in return for money. Fourteen candidates stood,with Ms Morgan taking 17,957 votes, while Conservative Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst got 12,032 and Labour's Ben Wood came third with 3,686. Labour, which came second in the constituency at the 2019 election, saw its share of the vote fall from 22.1% to 9.7%. The North Shropshire result is the second loss of a former Conservative stronghold to the Lib Dems this year, with the party seizing Chesham and Amersham, in Buckinghamshire, in July.

"Omicron 'could hit 11,000 a day' in NI this month","Hospitals in Northern Ireland could be under even more pressure in January, say health officials Ministers have been warned there could be 11,000 Omicron variant cases each day in Northern Ireland in a worst-case scenario by the end of December. There are now 210 confirmed cases, but sources advise that the real number could be up to 10 times those detected. Health officials said a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. Projections about Covid patient numbers were shown to ministers on Thursday but no further restrictions were announced. Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan said ""more clarity"" was needed on the link between the variant and hospitalisations. The executive is next expected to meet on Wednesday. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there could be a ""clearer picture"" then about the variant and any action that may be required. Allow Twitter content?

A document given to ministers on Thursday stated that action may be needed for a ""reasonable chance"" of keeping hospital inpatient numbers below 1,000. It outlined that a ""significant intervention"" would be needed ""immediately after Christmas"" to help the health service. The document also explained that it was likely that a peak in coronavirus case numbers would occur in the third week of January, with hospital admissions peaking in late January or February. The paper added: ""The extent of the hospital peak will depend on the severity of Omicron illness but without further measures is likely to exceed numbers observed earlier in the epidemic, potentially by several fold."" The 11,000 cases a day figure, which was described as a modelling projection and ""not a prediction"", was included in a series of graphs presented by Stormont's chief medical officer. It was described as the worst case scenario if no further restrictions are imposed, and the vaccine booster rate remains at current levels. Ministers were also told that hospitalisation figures could reach 4,000 by January on the current trajectory. But they were warned the figures were based on the current available data, and much more information will become available over the weekend. Speaking after the executive meeting, Mr Givan said Northern Ireland was behind the curve of Omicron cases being experienced elsewhere in the UK. He also said he had been ""encouraged"" by the level of uptake of the Covid-19 booster jabs. ""We don't panic, we continue to put into practice our public health, we be careful over the Christmas period and we get as much information as we can which will help inform the executive at our next meeting next week,"" he said. Paul Givan said Northern Ireland was not in the same position as last Christmas due to the vaccine programme Mr Givan said he wanted flexibility from the UK Treasury for the devolved regions to access coronavirus funding depending on their individual circumstances. He said: ""If we're not getting any more funding then we have to look at our existing resources,"" he said. Covid-19 vaccine certificates have been introduced for entry to some venues Further data will emerge from experience in England and Scotland in the next fortnight, where community transmission of the variant is more advanced. The paper received by ministers also said hospital admissions in Northern Ireland declined modestly in the past week but hospital occupancy remained at a ""relatively high"" level. Intensive care units occupancy and deaths declined modestly in the past week, it added. It warned that Omicron will become dominant around the final week of December, potentially with ""very large numbers of cases"". The chief medical officer has said he is more concerned than at any other time in the pandemic. Six more coronavirus-related deaths and another 2,237 casesof the virus were recorded in Northern Ireland on Thursday. The situation has been exacerbated by a shortage of nursing staff, withthe Belfast Telegraph reporting that 575 nurses left the health service,externalin Northern Ireland between June and October. The potential for a surge in Omicron cases has led the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) to warn that a crisis could be looming. ""What we're seeing are the outworkings of an exhausted and burnt-out group of people who have been trying to hold the service together for a long time,"" said Rita Devlin of the RCN. Booster jabs on offer to over 18s in NI from Monday What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? ""People have just reached the end of their tether,"" she continued. ""In a crisis situation you can keep going with no breaks and working overtime but only for a short time. ""Our nurses are saying... [there] just seems to be no end to it."" The Covid-19 booster jab programme in Northern Ireland will open to all age groups from Monday Earlier on Thursday an organisation representing the bar and restaurant sector saidthe industry was ""in freefall"" as a result of new Covid rules. Colin Neill, of Hospitality Ulster, said factors including the spread of the Omicron variant and speculation about new restrictions had led to many people cancelling Christmas bookings. He said the situation was ""unsustainable"" and he called for the Stormont executive to offer financial support. At Thursday's meeting of the executive, ministers were briefed on the spread of the Omicron variant in Northern Ireland. They also heard details of the plan for a rapid roll-out of Covid-19 booster vaccinations. BBC News NI understands that from Monday all adults in Northern Ireland will be able to get a booster vaccination as long as their last dose was administered at least three months ago. Staffing cover for schools, which have been affected by a rise in coronavirus cases, was also expected to be discussed.

If you still want more, there's a round up of all the biggest by-election news in our main storyhere. We're drawing our live coverage to a close. Here's the latest after the Liberal
Democratsâ shock by-election victory in the traditionally very safe Tory seat of
North Shropshire: Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor Chatting to a few Tory MPs and ministers, there is a sense
that Boris Johnson is wounded but can survive, and probably has about four
months to sort things out. They expect to see changes to the personnel and the way
things work in Downing Street, and an attempt to sort out the whipsâ office â
which lots of MPs see as a major problem. They accept that the prime minister canât change his
character, but they think he could improve the way he runs his government. There is a concern that he has mistakenly assumed that his
80-seat majority in Parliament means he doesnât have to make the case for what
heâs doing to his own backbenchers. And there is a feeling he is isolated and lacks friends in
Parliament to form a protective ring around him in troubled times. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Tories losing North Shropshire by-election As we've been reporting, the Lib Dems have taken a seat held by the Tories for nearly two centuries. At the last election in 2019, the Conservatives won North Shropshire with a majority of almost 23,000 votes. They took 62.7% of the vote. This graphic gives you a sense of how dominant the Tories have been in the seat. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Tory backbench MP Philip Dunne, who represents a Shropshire seat, says today's by-election result is ""very disappointing"" but not ""that surprising"" for a party in government. He says the result was ""exacerbated by a series of negative stories coming out of Whitehall during the course of this by-election, some of which were self-inflicted"". Asked whether Boris Johnson still retains his appeal to voters, Dunne tells BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The challenge for him will be to make sure it is"". He adds that this will require the PM to deliver on his manifesto promises at the 2019 election, and ""ensuring that we don't have banana skins to slip up on inadvertently"". Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Boris Johnson is in a very precarious position. And that's not just because of the monster by-election defeat in North Shropshire, but this weekhuge numbers of his own backbenchers didn't back himon a key part of his plans to deal with the pandemic.

Earlier, Johnson said one of his stock lines - that he takes responsibility for everything that happens in the government. That's not the same self-reflection that some of his colleagues would like him to do right now. The question for the next few weeks and months for Downing Street is: what is the PM's capacity for that self-reflection? The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson says Boris Johnson is ""drinking in the last chance saloon"" after the by-election result. The Tory peer tells BBC Radio 4's World at One there's been a ""general lack of grip"" and MPs were looking for a PM who had ""less of the drama"". She also says she feels for the Conservative candidate, who she says taken ""an almighty kicking"" because of events that were outside of his control. The Tory peer says Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, who got 12,032 votes, is an ""immensely qualified and competent individual"" - a former army medic, surgeon and barrister. ""I hope he's not left to carry the can,"" she says. This video can not be played North Shropshire by-election: the Lib Dem winner's victory speech as she tells Boris Johnson ""the party is over"". If you're just joining us this Friday lunchtime - we're bringing you live and continuous coverage after the Liberal Democrats took the safe Conservative seat of North Shropshire following yesterday's by-election. The vote was called after the constituency's Tory MP Owen Paterson resigned from Parliament having been accused of breaking lobbying rules. Liberal Democrat Helen Morgan will now represent the largely rural constituency at Westminster, having won an almost 6,000-vote majority. Sophie Madden and Riyah CollinsBBC News, West Midlands As Helen Morgan swept the Lib Dems to victory with a 6,000-vote majority, what went wrong for the Conservatives in this ""true blue"" area? This is a quiet corner of England - only 80,000 people live within the geographically huge constituency. There are no cities, only a handful of market towns. During the election campaign, voters made clear what mattered to them was local issues: farming, the NHS and improving public transport and connectivity. Mrs Morgan, an accountant, lives in Harmer Hill, a village just south of Wem. The Conservative candidate Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst hails from Birmingham and many voters questioned whether he could truly understand what makes this rural constituency tick Continue readinghere. Lynne and Keith Edwards, from Wem, were in Oswestry for market day and told the BBC of their ""surprise"" at the result. Lynne said she thought the Conservative candidate, Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, would be elected ""with a reduced majority"". She added: ""I think they're [voters] very fed up with what's gone on in the last few weeks, I think the Conservative guy had a really difficult job and with all that's being going on in Westminster, the parties and things like that. ""I think people are sending a bit of a message that perhaps we are fed up and they're telling Boris [Johnson] we want something different."" But she added she thinks Helen Morgan winning is a ""temporary blip"". Keith said: ""There's been a lot of publicity around Boris in the last few weeks, that undoubtedly had some effect, but how much, I don't know."" Asked what they'd like their new MP to tackle, he said: ""We'd like some interest locally, there was a lot of comment about Dr Shastri-Hurst being from Birmingham, we both thought he was an impressive guy, but people were very much attached to somebody local."" Allegations of lockdown parties in Whitehall have been on the lips of plenty of voters in North Shropshire - and after her election win, Lib Dem MP Helen Morgan told the PM the ""party is over"". Asked by a reporter outside a local pub if she had any plans herself to have a victory party later, Morgan laughs and says: ""Only with my own family."" Boris Johnson said he is ""responsible for everything the government does"" after his party lost the former safe seat of North Shropshire in yesterday's by-election.. Thursdayâs win by Helen Morgan saw a Conservative majority of 23,000 turned into a 6,000-vote majority for the Liberal Democrats. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Tories losing North Shropshire by-election Asked whether he should resign if it would help the Conservative Party, the prime minister replies: ""what we're focusing on is getting the job done."" He says he is ""focused on"" speeding up the government's vaccination programme. ""I think that is what people would want me to be focused on right now,"" he adds. On whether he takes personal responsibility for the defeat,
Boris Johnson says he accepts his job is to âget the focusâ on what matters to
people. Pressed again on whether he was responsible, he adds: âIâm
responsible for everything the government does, of course I take personal
responsibilityâ. Asked later whether he accepts responsibility for his
botched attempt to change Commons lobbying rules - which is what prompted the
by-election - he replies: âI doâ. ""I think my job is to get over what we're doing more
effectively,"" he adds, accepting that the row over parties in Downing
Street last year has ""obstructed"" the task of informing voters about
the government's agenda. He says that over the last few weeks, people have been
hearing about a âconstant litany of stuff about politiciansâ, and not about
their priorities. Boris Johnson has given his first reaction to the North Shropshire result, telling reporters during a visit to a vaccination centre that it was a ""very disappointing"" night for his party. âI totally understand peopleâs frustrations, I hear what the
voters are saying,"" he adds. âIn all humility, Iâve got to accept that verdictâ. But as Sir Roger Gale speaks another senior Tory backbench MP, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, says the Conservative party has âgot to calm downâ despite the ""bad"" result in North Shropshire. âThis is not a morning when we want to be contemplating a
big blame game, or a big change â we need to just work out what we need to do
in the future,"" he tells Sky News. Asked about Boris Johnson's position as leader, Clifton-Brown replies: âAt the moment I want him to succeed, I am giving him the benefit
of the doubt."" However, he says he wants the prime minister to ""think carefully how he governs this country"", and how to avoid repeating the ""self-inflicted own goals"" of recent months. BBC Newsnight's Lewis Goodall takes a look at what the North Shropshire by-election means for the Conservatives. This video can not be played More now from veteran Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale, who tells the BBC the by-election was ""a referendum on the performance of Downing Street"". Gale - who is an outspoken critic of the PM - says Johnson now has three weeks to ""get his house in order"" while Parliament breaks for Christmas. The North Thanet MP saysthe rebellion by 99 Tory MPsagainst a government vote this week showed the ""strength of feeling in Parliament"" - while this morning's result showed the strength of feeling in the country. Gale adds that people don't want or need a leadership election middle of the pandemic but says he would be surprised if Johnson fought the next election. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Clothes sales back to pre-Covid levels in NovemberTotal UK retail sales rose by 1.4%, helped by Black Friday and early Christmas shopping.","Clothing sales were back to pre-Covid levels for the first time in November as consumers took advantage of Black Friday and started Christmas shopping early. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said total UK retail sales rose by 1.4% last month. Demand for fashion rebounded while shoppers also spent in computer stores and on toys and jewellery. But economists warned the lift could be dampened by the emergence of Omicron. Sales of clothing rose by 2.9% in November and were 3.2% higher than February 2020 before the UK entered its first lockdown to stop the spread of Covid. Overall retail sales beat expectations of 0.8% growth and were ahead of a 1.1% rise recorded in October. Five items that are going up in price and why Why is the cost of living going up? Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS, said: ""Clothing stores fared particularly well and have exceeded their pre-pandemic level for the first time. Computer, toy and jewellery retailers also reported robust sales this month."" However, online sales continued to slip as the economy emerged from lockdown. The proportion of online sales fell to 26.9% in November 2021, its lowest since March 2020. Ms Bovill said more consumers were choosing to visit the High Street and retail parks. Bethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics, said it ""was mainly due to a stronger-than-usual boost from Black Friday and people starting their Christmas shopping early"". But she added: ""That means it was unlikely to last, even before the Omicron outbreak further dampened sales volumes in December."" Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at investment firm Fidelity International, said: ""The lead up to the big day looks to be far from the Christmas bonanza high-street retailers had their hopes pinned on."" With inflation at a 10-year high, fears around the Omicron variant lowering footfall and ongoing staff shortages, Ms Montgomery said that it's going to be a ""rough ride"" through the next few months for retailers.

Democratsâ shock by-election victory in the traditionally very safe Tory seat of
North Shropshire: Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor Chatting to a few Tory MPs and ministers, there is a sense
that Boris Johnson is wounded but can survive, and probably has about four
months to sort things out. They expect to see changes to the personnel and the way
things work in Downing Street, and an attempt to sort out the whipsâ office â
which lots of MPs see as a major problem. They accept that the prime minister canât change his
character, but they think he could improve the way he runs his government. There is a concern that he has mistakenly assumed that his
80-seat majority in Parliament means he doesnât have to make the case for what
heâs doing to his own backbenchers. And there is a feeling he is isolated and lacks friends in
Parliament to form a protective ring around him in troubled times. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Tories losing North Shropshire by-election As we've been reporting, the Lib Dems have taken a seat held by the Tories for nearly two centuries. At the last election in 2019, the Conservatives won North Shropshire with a majority of almost 23,000 votes. They took 62.7% of the vote. This graphic gives you a sense of how dominant the Tories have been in the seat. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Tory backbench MP Philip Dunne, who represents a Shropshire seat, says today's by-election result is ""very disappointing"" but not ""that surprising"" for a party in government. He says the result was ""exacerbated by a series of negative stories coming out of Whitehall during the course of this by-election, some of which were self-inflicted"". Asked whether Boris Johnson still retains his appeal to voters, Dunne tells BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The challenge for him will be to make sure it is"". He adds that this will require the PM to deliver on his manifesto promises at the 2019 election, and ""ensuring that we don't have banana skins to slip up on inadvertently"". Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Boris Johnson is in a very precarious position. And that's not just because of the monster by-election defeat in North Shropshire, but this weekhuge numbers of his own backbenchers didn't back himon a key part of his plans to deal with the pandemic. There wasthe reporton how the lavish redecoration of his flat above Downing Street was paid for. There is a difference of opinion inside the Conservative Party of whether or not this is a situation that can be recovered from. Some MPs think believe it's a situation past saving and are focusing on when and how a change at the top can be conducted. Others, however, don't believe it's terminal. Earlier, Johnson said one of his stock lines - that he takes responsibility for everything that happens in the government. That's not the same self-reflection that some of his colleagues would like him to do right now. The question for the next few weeks and months for Downing Street is: what is the PM's capacity for that self-reflection? The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson says Boris Johnson is ""drinking in the last chance saloon"" after the by-election result. The Tory peer tells BBC Radio 4's World at One there's been a ""general lack of grip"" and MPs were looking for a PM who had ""less of the drama"". She also says she feels for the Conservative candidate, who she says taken ""an almighty kicking"" because of events that were outside of his control. The Tory peer says Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, who got 12,032 votes, is an ""immensely qualified and competent individual"" - a former army medic, surgeon and barrister. ""I hope he's not left to carry the can,"" she says. This video can not be played North Shropshire by-election: the Lib Dem winner's victory speech as she tells Boris Johnson ""the party is over"". If you're just joining us this Friday lunchtime - we're bringing you live and continuous coverage after the Liberal Democrats took the safe Conservative seat of North Shropshire following yesterday's by-election. The vote was called after the constituency's Tory MP Owen Paterson resigned from Parliament having been accused of breaking lobbying rules. Liberal Democrat Helen Morgan will now represent the largely rural constituency at Westminster, having won an almost 6,000-vote majority. Sophie Madden and Riyah CollinsBBC News, West Midlands As Helen Morgan swept the Lib Dems to victory with a 6,000-vote majority, what went wrong for the Conservatives in this ""true blue"" area? This is a quiet corner of England - only 80,000 people live within the geographically huge constituency. There are no cities, only a handful of market towns. During the election campaign, voters made clear what mattered to them was local issues: farming, the NHS and improving public transport and connectivity. Mrs Morgan, an accountant, lives in Harmer Hill, a village just south of Wem. The Conservative candidate Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst hails from Birmingham and many voters questioned whether he could truly understand what makes this rural constituency tick Continue readinghere. Lynne and Keith Edwards, from Wem, were in Oswestry for market day and told the BBC of their ""surprise"" at the result. Lynne said she thought the Conservative candidate, Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, would be elected ""with a reduced majority"". She added: ""I think they're [voters] very fed up with what's gone on in the last few weeks, I think the Conservative guy had a really difficult job and with all that's being going on in Westminster, the parties and things like that. ""I think people are sending a bit of a message that perhaps we are fed up and they're telling Boris [Johnson] we want something different."" But she added she thinks Helen Morgan winning is a ""temporary blip"". Keith said: ""There's been a lot of publicity around Boris in the last few weeks, that undoubtedly had some effect, but how much, I don't know."" Asked what they'd like their new MP to tackle, he said: ""We'd like some interest locally, there was a lot of comment about Dr Shastri-Hurst being from Birmingham, we both thought he was an impressive guy, but people were very much attached to somebody local."" Allegations of lockdown parties in Whitehall have been on the lips of plenty of voters in North Shropshire - and after her election win, Lib Dem MP Helen Morgan told the PM the ""party is over"". Asked by a reporter outside a local pub if she had any plans herself to have a victory party later, Morgan laughs and says: ""Only with my own family."" Boris Johnson said he is ""responsible for everything the government does"" after his party lost the former safe seat of North Shropshire in yesterday's by-election.. Thursdayâs win by Helen Morgan saw a Conservative majority of 23,000 turned into a 6,000-vote majority for the Liberal Democrats. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Tories losing North Shropshire by-election Asked whether he should resign if it would help the Conservative Party, the prime minister replies: ""what we're focusing on is getting the job done."" He says he is ""focused on"" speeding up the government's vaccination programme. ""I think that is what people would want me to be focused on right now,"" he adds. On whether he takes personal responsibility for the defeat,
Boris Johnson says he accepts his job is to âget the focusâ on what matters to
people. Pressed again on whether he was responsible, he adds: âIâm
responsible for everything the government does, of course I take personal
responsibilityâ. Asked later whether he accepts responsibility for his
botched attempt to change Commons lobbying rules - which is what prompted the
by-election - he replies: âI doâ. ""I think my job is to get over what we're doing more
effectively,"" he adds, accepting that the row over parties in Downing
Street last year has ""obstructed"" the task of informing voters about
the government's agenda. He says that over the last few weeks, people have been
hearing about a âconstant litany of stuff about politiciansâ, and not about
their priorities. Boris Johnson has given his first reaction to the North Shropshire result, telling reporters during a visit to a vaccination centre that it was a ""very disappointing"" night for his party. âI totally understand peopleâs frustrations, I hear what the
voters are saying,"" he adds. âIn all humility, Iâve got to accept that verdictâ. But as Sir Roger Gale speaks another senior Tory backbench MP, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, says the Conservative party has âgot to calm downâ despite the ""bad"" result in North Shropshire. âThis is not a morning when we want to be contemplating a
big blame game, or a big change â we need to just work out what we need to do
in the future,"" he tells Sky News. Asked about Boris Johnson's position as leader, Clifton-Brown replies: âAt the moment I want him to succeed, I am giving him the benefit
of the doubt."" However, he says he wants the prime minister to ""think carefully how he governs this country"", and how to avoid repeating the ""self-inflicted own goals"" of recent months. BBC Newsnight's Lewis Goodall takes a look at what the North Shropshire by-election means for the Conservatives. This video can not be played More now from veteran Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale, who tells the BBC the by-election was ""a referendum on the performance of Downing Street"". Gale - who is an outspoken critic of the PM - says Johnson now has three weeks to ""get his house in order"" while Parliament breaks for Christmas. The North Thanet MP saysthe rebellion by 99 Tory MPsagainst a government vote this week showed the ""strength of feeling in Parliament"" - while this morning's result showed the strength of feeling in the country. Gale adds that people don't want or need a leadership election middle of the pandemic but says he would be surprised if Johnson fought the next election. Â© 2025 BBC.

Clothes sales back to pre-Covid levels in November,"Clothing sales were back to pre-Covid levels for the first time in November as consumers took advantage of Black Friday and started Christmas shopping early. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said total UK retail sales rose by 1.4% last month. Demand for fashion rebounded while shoppers also spent in computer stores and on toys and jewellery. But economists warned the lift could be dampened by the emergence of Omicron. Sales of clothing rose by 2.9% in November and were 3.2% higher than February 2020 before the UK entered its first lockdown to stop the spread of Covid. Overall retail sales beat expectations of 0.8% growth and were ahead of a 1.1% rise recorded in October. Five items that are going up in price and why Why is the cost of living going up? Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS, said: ""Clothing stores fared particularly well and have exceeded their pre-pandemic level for the first time. Computer, toy and jewellery retailers also reported robust sales this month."" However, online sales continued to slip as the economy emerged from lockdown. The proportion of online sales fell to 26.9% in November 2021, its lowest since March 2020. Ms Bovill said more consumers were choosing to visit the High Street and retail parks. Bethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics, said it ""was mainly due to a stronger-than-usual boost from Black Friday and people starting their Christmas shopping early"". But she added: ""That means it was unlikely to last, even before the Omicron outbreak further dampened sales volumes in December."" Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at investment firm Fidelity International, said: ""The lead up to the big day looks to be far from the Christmas bonanza high-street retailers had their hopes pinned on."" With inflation at a 10-year high, fears around the Omicron variant lowering footfall and ongoing staff shortages, Ms Montgomery said that it's going to be a ""rough ride"" through the next few months for retailers.

Royal Albert Hall boss notes huge drop in sales,"The Royal Albert Hall is a historic London venue The boss of the Royal Albert Hall has said the venue has seen a huge drop in sales since the spread of Omicron. Craig Hassall, chief executive officer of the historic London hall, is calling for ""a stronger government position"" to help the struggling arts industry. Equity, a trade union for performing arts workers, has written to the chancellor requesting financial support for those affected by cancellations. Shows across the UK are being cancelled and postponed due to Covid outbreaks. They include West End hits The Lion King and The Life of Pi, as well as The Sorcerer's Apprentice at Northern Stage, Jack and the Beanstalk at Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, and The Book of Mormon at the Palace, Manchester. Hassall told the BBC: ""Our Christmas sales were doing tremendously well until Omicron hit and then they absolutely plateaued and we are seeing a huge drop in sales. Craig Hassall is CEO of the Royal Albert Hall in London ""We've lost one show actually, but nothing beyond that. I know that the West End is really suffering from people with Covid, crew and so on, losing shows. ""We've been OK, touch wood, but the impact on sales is certainly being seen across our season."" Top theatres cancel shows after Covid outbreaks Venues report 'catastrophic' audience declines Masks required in more indoor venues in England Last week, face coverings were made compulsory in most indoor venues in England, under measures to tackle the new variant. People across the UK have also been advised to limit social gatherings, in the run-up to the festive period. Hassall added that he thought the government advice on the matter has been ""a little bit cloudy and a bit vague"". ""In terms of the Royal Albert Hall, we're not covered by Plan B because of our capacity. And yet we've asked people to wear masks and we have asked people to show their Covid status, and people are very compliant and very happy to do so. ""But I think a stronger government position would help people feel more confident to come out to places like the Royal Albert Hall, where they can feel safe and we know that people out will be safe in a place like ours with our cleaning regimes or ventilation protocols. ""But the government advice has been a bit woolly I'm sorry to say and that's not really helping things."" The Lion King is one of many shows across the country that has seen cancellations In response, a spokeswoman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told the BBC: ""Our unprecedented Â£2bn Culture Recovery Fund has given out Â£1.5bn in grants and loans, and almost Â£200m to the devolved administrations. The Â£300m third round of the fund is still open for applications, providing vital ongoing support for the cultural, heritage and creative sectors. ""We will keep the delivery of the programme under active review and consider how best to adapt it in line with the needs of the sector."" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has also urged organisations in need of support toapply to the fund for assistance,external. Ray Spencer, who plays Dame Bella in the pantomime Rapunzel at the Customs House Theatre in South Shields, Tyneside, told BBC Newcastle the production was ""20% down on what we'd normally expect at this time"". ""A lot of that has been schools, and organised parties from factories, shops, guilds, WIs (Women's Institutes) haven't come in the numbers they'd normally come,"" he said. Spencer, who is also the executive director of the theatre, told reporter Fergus Hewison: ""So, bottom line - that means in excess of Â£90,000, probably near Â£100,000 of lost income and eventually lost profit. ""What we do at Christmas, like many theatres - pantomime - is a third, or 40% of people's turnover. So to lose that sort of percentage is a massive blow for all the work that we do which is reliant on what we make for Christmas."" He added that if social distancing were to be introduced, it would be ""a disaster"". ""If we were to close again, we don't have the sort of reserves that we would like to have to be able to carry the building, which still has its overheads,"" he said. ""We would hope that the government could find some assistance to support organisations and everybody else forced to close."" Face masks are now mandatory in indoor venues like theatres and cinemas Jamie Eastlake is the owner of the N16 theatre company, which is rehearsing for its production of Cinderella at a bar in Blyth in Northumberland. He told BBC Newcastle a fairy godmother - or some cash from the chancellor - is needed to save theatre at the moment. ""Bookings are falling through the door, we're having cancellations left, right and centre. We have staff ill, we've had actors drop out, we've had to push productions back. The word nightmare doesn't really sum it up at the moment. ""We thought it was the ultimate nightmare being close down but this year seems to be even worse. There's a huge hole coming to us, we know that, and I think a lot of organisations know that as well."" He said their quietist time of year was between January and March, and that it would be ""incredibly difficult"" to fill the financial hole left by Covid without ""some level of support"". The calls for support come after theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber said no-one in the government listens"" to the fears of those within the theatre industry, which he describes as being ""decimated"". On Thursday night, his production of Cinderella was cancelled due to ""Covid-related absences"", as well as performances of hit musicals Hamilton and The Lion King in London. ""It has been a terrible few days and it is getting worse,""Lord Lloyd Webber wrote in the Daily Mail,external. ""It is simply heartbreaking for me to see our industry decimated by a situation beyond all of our control."" Gig tickets, Christmas and Covid: Can I get a refund? On Wednesday theatre director Sir Nicholas Hytner called for greater support for struggling entertainment and arts venues. The former artistic director of the National Theatre told Newsnight on Wednesday that venues were closing as actors and crews were coming down with Covid. Bookings, he noted, had ""fallen off a cliff"". ""We are in crisis mode at the moment,"" he said ""We now surely don't want to get into a situation where the government's investment last year [the Cultural Recovery Fund] is wasted because the sectors that it has supported collapse in the new year. ""We need to see short-term finance, we need to see loans, we need to see VAT looked at again, we need to see business rates looked at again."" English gig venues have been open without social distancing since July Elsewhere, Cabaret, featuring Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley, has axed some shows at London's Playhouse Theatre, while the The National Theatre has cancelled certain performances of Hex, based on the classic fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, and The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time. Jon Morgan, director of Theatres Trust said that while new government advice, urging caution around gatherings, ""did not directly affect theatres"" there had ""already been an impact on ticket sales and theatres are finding themselves in a precarious position"". ""Like the hospitality sector, the theatre sector will need additional economic support to help it survive this latest challenge,"" he added. Other entertainment industry bodies have also been speaking about the impact of Covid on their colleagues. Creative UK called for measures including a return of the furlough scheme and extension of the Culture Recovery Fund, while UK Music has written to Chancellor Rishi Sunak asking for ""urgent targeted financial support"".

Rail fares to rise at biggest rate for nine years,"Regulated rail fares in England will rise by 3.8% from March, in the biggest increase for nine years. These regulated prices make up about half of fares and include season tickets on most commuter routes. Increases are normally implemented on the first working day of every year, but have been delayed until March since 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The fare rises are based on the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation in July. This time, the government says it will not increase fares by the normal formula of RPI plus 1%, which it used this year when fares went up by 2.6%. Fares for rail services in Northern Ireland are set by state-owned operator Translink, which does not use RPI. The Scottish Government has not announced its plan for 2022. Wales usually matches changes made in England. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to increasing public transport use in Wales and competitively-priced fares are an important way to do this. We are considering the options available to us."" A 3.8% rise in England would lead to increases in the cost of annual season tickets such as: Brighton to London (any route): Up Â£194 to Â£5,302 Liverpool to Manchester (any route): Up Â£105 to Â£2,865 Rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: ""[This] strikes a fair balance, ensuring we can continue to invest record amounts into a more modern, reliable railway, ease the burden on taxpayers and protect passengers from the highest RPI in years. ""Delaying the changes until March 2022 offers people the chance to save money by renewing their fares at last year's price."" Operators are generally expected to match these rises for unregulated fares, although they have been hit hard by the cost of lower passenger numbers during the pandemic. With the cost of living going up, another price rise will inevitably prompt some grimaces - particularly for commuters considering a regular return to the office when the current working-from-home guidance eventually lifts. But demand for traditional season tickets was already falling before lockdowns caused rail usage to plummet. And it is leisure, not commuter use, that has led the recovery so far. The dilemma here is how to attract people back onto the railways, while also trying to address the financial impact of the pandemic on the industry. Raise prices too much and passengers won't want to return. The government says it is protecting people by going with July's RPI figure, even though inflation has risen markedly since then and the increase won't come in until March. The industry says it is trying to adapt to passengers' changing needs. So-called flexible season tickets - effectively a bulk purchase of tickets to be used over a set period - are part of that. Around 100,000 have been bought since they launched in late June. The government said Â£14bn of taxpayers' money had been spent to keep services running during the pandemic. It said the rise would help meet some of those costs as well as pay for service improvements. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""As some fares rise it is even more important that Great British Railways, when it is set up, gives life to the government's ambition to make rail fares better value for money. ""The need to boost passenger numbers and revenue through innovative rail ticket retailing and offers will be vital. Keeping costs under control will also be needed."" But Louise Haigh, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: ""This brutal Tory fare hike will be a nightmare before Christmas for millions of passengers. ""Families already facing soaring taxes and bills will now be clobbered with an eye-watering rise in the cost of the daily commute."" Inflation rose by 5.1%in the 12 months to November, the highest level in a decade, prompting the Bank of England to increase the UK interest rate for the first times in three years. The Department for Transport also announced the Book with Confidence scheme will be extended until the end of March next year. This allows passengers to change their travel plans up until the night before departure, without being charged a fee, or cancel their tickets and receive a refund in the form of rail vouchers.

Controversial Alzheimer's drug rejected by EU,"The European Medicines Agency has said no to approving a new drug for Alzheimer's disease in the EU. Aducanumab does not appear to be effective at treating adults with early-stage symptoms, the EMA said. Alzheimer's charities say they are disappointed by the decision because thousands of people are left with no treatment options. The drug - the first new treatment for 20 years - was controversiallyapproved in the US in June. At the time, many scientists said there was little evidence from trials of it being of benefit despite it targeting amyloid - a protein that forms abnormal clumps in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Biogen, the manufacturer of the drug, can ask for the EMA's decision to be re-examined within the next two weeks. It's not known whether the company will submit a separate application for approval to the UK regulator, the MHRA. The European Medicines Agency based its decision on two main studies of more than 3,000 patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease which compared the effects of a low dose and high dose of the drug with a dummy pill. The patients, who had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, had their symptoms assessed after 78 weeks of treatment. ""Results from the main studies were conflicting and did not show overall that aducanumab was effective at treating adults with early-stage Alzheimer's disease,"" the EMA said. ""In addition, the studies did not show that the medicine was sufficiently safe as images from brain scans of some patients showed abnormalities suggestive of swelling or bleeding, which could potentially cause harm,"" it added. The EMA concluded that the benefits of the drug did not outweigh its risks and recommended the refusal of a marketing authorisation. There are estimated to be nearly 8 million people living with dementia in the EU and around a million in the UK, with numbers expected to double by 2050. Alzheimer's disease is thought to be the cause of the majority of those cases. Hilary Evans, chief executive at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the announcement was ""bitterly disappointing news for people with Alzheimer's disease"". She added: ""Biogen must continue collecting essential data to clarify the safety and effectiveness of aducanumab. ""While further data collection is happening in the US, the UK is uniquely well-placed to deliver world-class clinical studies that could address unanswered questions about the drug."" Alzheimer's Society said there were more than 125 Alzheimer's drugs currently in clinical trials and more funding was needed to speed up access to them.

"'One more strike and he's out', Tory MP warns PM","This video can not be played Watch Lib Dem by-election winner Helen Morgan's victory speech The Conservatives have lost the North Shropshire seat they held for 115 years to the Liberal Democrats in a by-election blow to Boris Johnson. Winner Helen Morgan overturned a Tory majority of almost 23,000, declaring that the ""party is over"" for the PM. The result follows a torrid week for Mr Johnson, who has faced criticism over Downing Street parties and a rebellion by his own MPs over Covid measures. Tory MP Sir Roger Gale said the prime minister was on ""last orders"". ""One more strike and he's out,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the by-election ""has to be seen as a referendum on the prime minister's performance"". Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""I know that the voters of North Shropshire are fed up and they wanted to give us a kicking... We've heard that message loud and clear."" But he added: ""I don't think this amounts to a sea-change."" Analysis: Has Johnson lost his winning touch? Live: Lib Dems earn shock win The by-election followed the resignation of Owen Paterson, the MP for North Shropshire since 1997, who was found to have breached parliamentary rules on lobbying. The seat has been won by the Conservatives at every general election for nearly 200 years, although it was briefly held by a Liberal MP under its old name of Oswestry after a by-election in 1904. In her victory speech, Ms Morgan, who won by 5,925 votes, said: ""The people of North Shropshire have spoken on behalf of the British people. They have said loudly and clearly, 'Boris Johnson, the party is over.' ""Your government, run on lies and bluster, will be held accountable. It will be scrutinised, it will be challenged and it can and will be defeated."" Ms Morgan's victory takes the number of Lib Dem MPs up to 13, still significantly down from a high of more than 60 during the mid-2000s. The party lost dozens of its seats at the 2015 general election after being part of a coalition government with the Conservatives. But, at a celebration rally in Oswestry, part of the North Shropshire constituency, former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said millions of people around the UK ""have woken up this morning feeling that a bit of light has broken into the darkness"". He also held up a large blue balloon bearing the slogan ""Boris's bubble"", which Ms Morgan, formerly a chartered accountant, proceeded to burst with a foot-long pin. The government is going to try and say this is mid-term misery - and, yes, by-elections are a way the public can stick two fingers up to a government when they're cross. But let's be plain: this is an appalling result for the Conservatives, in a part of the country where the tradition of voting Tory is baked into the earth. This isn't a little slip up; it's a disaster. People on the ground say the Tory campaign was going OK, until all of the recent shenanigans in Downing Street emerged, and that that is when support fell off a cliff. Boris Johnson does have an extraordinary ability to bounce back. But there are people in the Conservative Party who are pencilling in the possibility of a summer leadership election. Things are febrile, and we shouldn't predict things with any certainty - but there's no doubt this is a really dangerous moment for the prime minister. Fourteen candidates stood in Thursday's by-election. Ms Morgan took 17,957 votes, with Conservative Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst amassing 12,032 and Labour's Ben Wood coming third with 3,686. The last-placed candidate, independent Yolande Kenward, received just three votes. The North Shropshire result saw a the seventh biggest swing - 34.2% - in a by-election since World War Two. It is the second loss of a former Conservative stronghold to the Lib Dems since the  general election, with the party seizing Chesham and Amersham, in Buckinghamshire, with a 25% swing in July. Earlier this month, the Toriesheld Old Bexley and Sidcup in a by-electionfollowing the death of MP James Brokenshire, but the majority was cut from nearly 19,000 to 4,478, with a 10% swing to Labour. The North Shropshire seat has existed in some form since the 1830s and, until Friday, had always had a Conservative MP. The area voted strongly in favour of Brexit in the 2016 referendum, but this did not stop the pro-EU Lib Dems taking the constituency. The by-election came just two days after Boris Johnsonexperienced his biggest rebellion in office,when 100 Conservative MPs voted against the government's proposals to introduce Covid passes in England. It also followedrows about a Number 10 Christmas party during lockdown restrictions last Decemberand the prime minister's appearance at a virtual quiz alongside two colleagues at about the same time. Before that, there had also been a fine for the Conservative Party over the financing of Mr and Mrs Johnson's renovation of the No 10 flat, and the fallout over Owen Paterson's departure,with the prime minister admitting some fault over the latter.,external This video can not be played Watch Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey's reaction to the result: ""We've brought new hope to the whole nation"" Reacting to his party losing North Shropshire, Dr Shastri-Hurst said: ""We are 11 years into Conservative government. Our elections are never an easy thing to do. ""But of course, we do need to reflect upon the result and I am sure as a party we will do that."" But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who is currently self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, said it was a ""watershed moment in our politics"". ""Millions of people are fed up with Boris Johnson and his failure to provide leadership throughout the pandemic and last night the voters of North Shropshire spoke for all of them,"" he added. Labour, which came second in North Shropshire at the 2019 election, saw its share of the vote fall from 22.1% to 9.7%. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Breakfast: ""We put the effort into it that was proportionate to our chances of winning. ""But clearly people wanted to send a message to the government that they're fed up with the incompetence, the sleaze, the kind of revelations we've seen over the last few weeks. ""The government has to take heed of that."" Correction 17th February 2022: This article originally reported that the Conservative Party held the North Shropshire seat for nearly 200 years. In fact the seat was held by a Liberal MP, under its old name of Oswestry, from 1904-1906, following a by-election and so we have amended the article to make clear that the seat was held by the Conservative Party for 115 years.

PM 'very disappointed' by Tory poll rout,"This video can not be played Watch Helen Morgan celebrate her victory by bursting ""Boris' bubble"" Senior Tories have urged Boris Johnson to make changes following a huge by-election defeat for the Conservatives. Ex-Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said No 10 needed discipline while another senior Tory said the PM needed to get ""a bit of a bloody grip"". Mr Johnson said he was ""disappointed"" with his party's performance in the North Shropshire vote. The Lib Dems who won the ultra-safe Tory seat, said voters were ""fed up"" with Mr Johnson's ""incompetence"". The party's candidate, Helen Morgan, overturned a Tory majority of almost 23,000 at the last general election to win by 5,925 votes, saying: ""The people of North Shropshire have spoken on behalf of the British people. They have said loudly and clearly, 'Boris Johnson, the party is over.'"" Their historic victory came after a week dominated by claims of Covid rule-breaking in No 10 and a revolt by Mr Johnson's own MPs over restrictions. The PM blamed a ""constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians"" in the media for the result. Tories lose seat they held for nearly 200 years No 10 inquiry chief faces questions over own 'party' Analysis: Has Johnson lost his winning touch? How did Tories turn off true blue North Shropshire? Although few have commented publicly, Conservative MPs are said to be divided over Mr Johnson's future. Iain Duncan Smith - who led the party for two years - told the BBC the government had lost focus as a result of stories about Downing Street parties. ""The prime minister needs to show really strongly that he doesn't just disapprove but is prepared to get rid of people who are breaking those rules,"" he said. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith says the PM ""gets there has been a series of things happening which should not have doneâ. He also criticised Conservative MPs calling for a Mr Johnson to be replaced saying ""I want my colleagues to stop playing games.... the party has to get behind him."" Veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale described the result ""as a referendum on the prime minister's performance"". And former Scottish Tory leader Baroness Davidson told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Mr Johnson was ""drinking in the last-chance saloon"". She said Conservative MPs were ""looking for a bit of a bloody grip"" and an end to the government's ""own goals"". This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson's reaction to the North Shropshire by-election defeat Responding to his party's defeat, the prime minister said: ""Clearly the vote in North Shropshire is very disappointing result. I totally understand people's frustrations. I hear what the voters are saying."" The defeat comes at the end of a torrid week for Mr Johnson, during which100 Conservative MPs rebelledover government proposals to introduce Covid passes in England. There have also beencriticisms over Downing Street Christmas parties during restrictions last December. Civil service boss Simon Case had been conducting an inquiry into potential rule-breaching events in No 10,but he is now expected to step asideafter claims an event was held in his own office last year. The prime minister put much of the blame for the by-election defeat on media coverage, saying that ""what the people have been hearing is just a constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians and stuff that isn't about them"". ""The job of the government is to make people like you [journalists] interested in the booster roll-out and skills and housing and everything else we're doing,"" he added. ""Unfortunately we haven't been able to get the focus on those issues."" Boris Johnson is in a very precarious position, not just because of the monster by-election defeat in North Shropshire. This week huge numbers of his own backbenchers didn't back him on a key part of his plans to deal with the pandemic, and there was a report on how the lavish redecoration of his flat above Downing Street was paid for. There is a difference of opinion inside the Conservative Party of whether or not this is a situation that can be recovered from. Some MPs think it's a situation past saving and are focusing on when and how a change at the top can be conducted. Others, however, don't believe it's terminal. Mr Johnson said one of his stock lines - that he takes responsibility for everything that happens in the government. That's not the same self-reflection that some of his colleagues would like from him right now. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who is isolating with Covid, said his party could now beat the Conservatives ""anywhere"", adding: "" I think people are so fed up with Boris Johnson, so fed up with his incompetence and his behaviour, I think they'll be really happy about that."" The by-election was called because previous North Shropshire MP Owen Paterson quit in November after being found guilty of breaking parliamentary rules on lobbying - trying to influence government policy - in return for money. Fourteen candidates stood,with Ms Morgan taking 17,957 votes, while Conservative Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst got 12,032 and Labour's Ben Wood came third with 3,686. Labour, which came second in the constituency at the 2019 election, saw its share of the vote fall from 22.1% to 9.7%. The North Shropshire result is the second loss of a former Conservative stronghold to the Lib Dems this year, with the party seizing Chesham and Amersham, in Buckinghamshire, in July.

"Omicron 'tsunami starting to hit', says Sturgeon","The Omicron variant is confirmed as the dominant form of the virus in Scotland Nicola Sturgeon says the 'tsunami is starting to hit' as case numbers increase more than 40% 4,336 new cases of Covid have been reported and 522 people were in hospital yesterday More than half of the population over the age of 18 has now had a booster jab Ms Sturgeon says if people don't act now on Covid guidance the NHS could be overwhelmed Of Â£100m in government support for business, Â£66m will go to the hospitality industry BBC Scotland News  That's all from the live page team today. Join us again next time.  Back at the first minister's briefing, The Daily Telegraph presses the first minister on what types
of âhigher risk settingsâ might be affected by any future Covid restrictions. Ms Sturgeon cites settings that are âindoors, [have] poorer ventilation"" or where people are ""coming together in small crowded places, often with alcohol involved.â She adds, âI donât want to be restricting or closing down
anywhere but I canât magic away this virus.â On the BBC programme, Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie says cases are rising ""exponentially"" across the population, and urges everyone to get their booster. She says that because of the lag in time between getting a booster and being fully protected, there are other things we need to do now - perhaps not going out, or taking a lateral flow if you do need to go out. If you go out now, you could catch Covid and have to isolate over Christmas. Or pass the virus on to someone else, she says. She adds that many people will end up catching Covid and having to isolate, which will have an impact on the smooth running of the country. Allow Twitter content?

On the BBC Scotland coronavirus update programme Tory MSP Dr Sandesh Gulhane says it's ""absolutely critical"" people get boosted. He says everyone should prioritise what matters to them the most. Dr Gulhane adds that government funding needs to find its way to businesses before Christmas, and he supports Ms Sturgeon's calls for more funding from the UK government to support businesses. He says it is ""absolutely imperative"" for the Scottish and UK governments to work together. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Bauer Radio asks why it is being left to concert promoters to take the decisions on whether events in the coming days should go ahead or not. Ms Sturgeon says, ""I canât say to a concert, 'cancel' because I canât then ensure
the financial support is there to compensate it. ""If I could do that I could give clearer advice to events
and businesses."" The first minister says the ""UK government needs to get
its finger out, it needs to step up and provide this support."" Sky
News asks if the UK government does provide further financial assistance to businesses
then will more Covid restrictions be more likely in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon says that's not necessarily the case. She says, ""I will continue to take decisions which I think are appropriate,
and I will be able to take decisions that I think are appropriate without
worrying about not being able to compensate businesses.â  STV's Gordon Chree asks if rising cases have already been ""priced in"" to the current advice about Christmas. If we see an increase in cases next week, could Christmas still be cancelled? The first minister answers that nothing - including a lockdown - is inevitable. She says we can drive cases down through behaviour, and we shouldn't be fatalistic. She stresses testing, vaccines, hygiene, ventilation and limiting contacts to help stay safe. Dr Smith says cases announced today are people who were infected 5-7 days ago. There could be an eight-fold increase in the numbers of people infected today, due to the virus' exponential growth. A further 4,336 new cases of Covid were reported in Scotland on Friday, of which 51% showed the so-called S-Gene dropout that is typical of the Omicron variant. Read more - Omicron now dominant virus variant in Scotland ""Everything we are doing just now is trying to encourage people to behave in a way that means we can all interact with our families on Christmas day and I'm not anticipating changing that. But we should interact with our families in a way that is safer than we might normally do Nicola Sturgeon David Wallace Lockhart, of BBC Scotland, asks Ms Sturgeon it is wise for two big football matches in Glasgow go ahead this weekend. The first minister says, ""My advice to people right now is please limit your social interactions,
wherever your social interactions may be. ""Had we the financial support
mechanism in place that we had earlier in the pandemic I would be able, perhaps, to give more straightforward advice to events to say donât let these events go
ahead right now, I canât do that when I canât compensate people. ""All I can do right now is ask people to modify their own
behaviour."" The first minister asks:  She asks everyone to look out for each other and stick at it. And she concludes by suggesting we all get in touch with someone who might be feeling down or lonely just now. People should not risk catching Covid if they want to spend Christmas with family, Ms Sturgeon says The first minister asks: ""Stay at home much more than you normally would, and stay at home as much as you can."" She says if what matters most to you is spending time with your loved ones on Christmas day, you shouldn't go out before then and risking catching Covid. The reality is, she says, mixing with others just now ""is a real and increasing risk"". She highlights that this new strain is much more infectious than previous strains. ""If someone in your group, or even just someone in the same venue as you has it, your chances of catching it are much higher than with the Delta variant,"" Ms Sturgeon adds. After Christmas, minimising your contacts will help reduce the January surge she says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The progress made in the booster vaccine programme is hailed by Ms Sturgeon. She says more than half of the population over the age of 18 has now had a booster jab. The drive will keep going to get ""as many people as possible by the times the bells strike on Hogmanay,"" adds the first minister. Ms Sturgeon stresses, ""it's never too late to get vaccinated"". Nicola Sturgeon says she will use a call with Boris Johnson
later to press for more financial support for Scotland's businesses. The first minister says a return to the type of state aid that
was in place earlier in the pandemic is what is needed. She says, âWith businesses already bleeding, every 24 hours
counts - there is no time to waste.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Sturgeon acknowledges that the hospitality and culture sectors are being severely impacted by her advice to stay at home and limit contacts. Of the Â£100m support for business she has previously announced, Â£66m of this will go to hospitality, Â£8m will go to the food and drink supply chain, Â£3m will go to weddings, Â£20m will go to the culture sector and Â£3m to the worst affected tourism businesses. She says she knows this money won't fully compensate affected businesses. She is to speak to Boris Johnson about getting more support for businesses. The first minister continues that the scale and immediacy of the challenge concerns her. She says even if Omicron turns out to be milder for many people, it will still cause serious illness, hospitalisation and death for some. Even if the number of people falling seriously ill is a smaller percentage of cases than with Delta, ""a smaller percentage of a much bigger number of infections will result in a massive number of cases needing hospital care"". If we don't act now the NHS could be overwhelmed, she adds. The first minister confirms that Omicron is now the dominant strain in Scotland and says this presents a challenge because it spreads faster than Delta. It could have an R-number which is possibly above four, she adds. She says this risks driving a much steeper increase in cases - in the past week, cases have increased by more than 40% which is expected to continue and accelerate. ""The tsunami I warned about a week ago is now starting to hit us,"" the first minister warns. The latest available data for Covid-19 in Scotland shows that as of 12:00 today:  Nicola Sturgeon says that due to the high volume of tests being processed the true number of cases might not be reflected in these figures. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she will provide an update on Omicron's spread, and reinforce the ""important requests"" she is making of everyone to stay at home as much as is feasible and limit their contacts. Omicron has replaced Delta as the dominant strain in Scotland, the first minister confirms. Humza Yousaf says expanding the booster jab rollout over the coming weeks will be ""extremely challenging"". The health secretary was speaking after he got his own booster
vaccination at the Arbroath Community Centre. ""It would be amiss
for me not to acknowledge and commend the enormous national effort which is
ongoing - the like of which has never been seen in peacetime,"" Mr Yousaf adds. âWith demand for
boosters being high Iâd like to reassure everyone we have plenty of supplies
and we are working hard with health boards to maximise vaccination capacity."" Today is the first day of new legal restrictions on businesses to help control the spread of Covid-19. The changes mean firms are legally required to take measures to minimise transmission amid concerns about the Omicron variant. This means shops and hospitality outlets have to put in measures to reduce crowding and queueing such as erecting screens and barriers. The wearing of face masks also has to be enforced. Read more.

Scotland and Wales warn of serious Omicron threat,"A further 93,045 Covid cases have been confirmed in the UK - another record high as the Omicron variant drives a spike in infections And another 111 deaths are reported within 28 days of a positive test Wales must introduce further restrictions because âthe storm of Omicron is coming our wayâ, First Minister Mark Drakeford says In a press conference at the same time, Nicola Sturgeon warns the ""tsunami is starting to hit"" Scotland From 27 December, nightclubs in Wales must close in response to the Omicron variant Social distancing will also be required in shops and workplaces In Scotland, people have already been advised to limit socialising to three households in the run-up to Christmas And President Biden warns unvaccinated Americans faces a winter of severe illness and death because of Omicron Thanks for joining us.

coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News New data on
Omicron has been released by the UK Health Security Agency based on people
infected so far. It shows that 18%
of people with Omicron infected someone else in their household, compared to
10% of people who tested positive with Delta. The percentage of
people infecting others outside their household was also higher for Omicron
than for Delta - nearly 9% compared to 3%. People are also
more likely to be reinfected with Omicron after having had a previous
coronavirus infection. And studies show
that lateral flow tests are just as good at detecting Omicron as they are at
detecting the Delta variant of the virus. As a result, health officials are urging people
to test regularly, particularly before attending social gatherings. Denmark's prime minister has announced that her government intends to propose new restrictions to curb
the rapid spread of coronavirus and the new Omicron variant,
which now accounts for a fifth of all cases registered in
the country. Denmark has seen cases rise rapidly over the past week and daily infections broke another
record on Friday as 11,194 Covid cases were recorded. The country has recorded a total of 9,009 Omicron infections so far. ""In record time, the rules of the game have again been
changed,"" Mette Frederiksen said at a news conference on Friday. The new restrictions, which will need approval from
parliament, include plans to close a host of venues such as theatres, cinemas,
entertainment parks and conference centres. Frederiksen also proposed to ban the serving of alcohol after 22:00 local time and urged Danes to limit their social contacts in the run up to Christmas. Despite the increase in cases, the country is in a better position than it was last Christmas, with death rates and hospital admissions significantly below the previous peak. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Seven Covid cases have been
recorded in Taiwan today, and while by international standards this number
might seem low, it is the highest number of cases in more than three months. There has been renewed concern
about a potential outbreak in Taiwan this week after clusters of cases were
identified at two quarantine hotels: one in Taipei and
one in Taoyuan. Outbreaks amongst people on the
same floors led to suspicions of cross-contamination, which have now been
confirmed. As a result, Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has
classified these cases as locally-transmitted. These new cases have led to the
CECC making it mandatory that all arrivals now undergo six Covid-19 tests. It
has also urged increased inspections and ventilation at quarantine hotels. Taiwan has consistently
recorded a single case or zero cases since 20 September. These latest developments come
shortly on the heels of Taiwan reopening its borders, to allow an influx of
people to return for the Lunar New Year. Relaxed rules were introduced
from Tuesday meaning that arrivals can stay a minimum of seven days at a quarantine
facility, rather than the previously-mandated 14-days. This is on the condition
that they self-isolate at home, and carry out regular PCR tests. Anna Baldwin had planned a family trip to Disneyland for Christmas From tonight only those with ""compelling reasons"" will be able to travel from the UK to France, meaning last-minute cancellations for families who had booked holidays. Mum-of-two Anna Baldwin is ""devastated"" a surprise trip to Disneyland for her sons' Christmas present won't be able to go ahead. As well as the cost of tests she's already paid for, Anna is also worried about the extra expense on things like food for a Christmas at home. Meanwhile, businesses have also been hit. Victor Dapremont, a sales manager for the Mademoiselle Hotel in Paris, says 80% of guests coming from England have cancelled their bookings, with Brits normally making up around a third of guests. Read more about the impact on holidaymakers and businesses here. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Boris Johnson and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have held talks on coronavirus funding amid the threat of the Omicron variant  - but no extra money is heading to Scotland at the moment. The BBC understands the Scottish government thinks the talks were constructive but inconclusive. More talks between the PM and devolved administrations are due this weekend. Earlier, Sturgeon said it would be ""unconscionable"" if more money was not allocated by the UK government ""very quickly"". The BBC has approached the UK Treasury for comment. Read more on the latest Covid situation in Scotlandhere. Rising Covid cases have left London's fire and rescue service with ""unprecedented"" staff shortages, the Fire Brigades Union says. According to London Fire Brigade statistics 40 fire engines, out of a total of 142, were unavailable on both the day and night shift on Thursday - a level also reached for at least parts of the 10, 11 and 15 December. The union says Covid has been skyrocketing in the service as the Omicron variant has taken hold in the capital, with almost 10% of operational firefighters now either having tested positive or self-isolating. It says Covid-related shortages are having a greater impact due to ""already low levels of fire and rescue staffing in the capital"". The union's London regional secretary Jon Lambe says Omicron is having a ""devastating impact"" on the London Fire Brigade. Cosmo (centre) will spend Christmas with a friend We've been hearing today from people who have tested positive for Covid who will now have to isolate over Christmas. Cosmo Wilson is among those who will be spending Christmas away from family - for the second year running - after testing positive for Covid. Last year the UK's travel restrictions meant he couldn't fly back to see his parents in Thailand, so he spent the festive season with friends in Nottingham instead. This year he had been planning to stay with his sister and their aunt and uncle, in Uckfield, East Sussex. But the 22-year-old waitertested positive this week and his self-isolation ends as the clock ticks past midnightinto Christmas Day. So he'll spend the day in London with a friend instead. Cosmo says seeing the positive test result was a ""jarring"" moment. ""The main feeling was just disbelief,"" he tells Newsbeat. The man heading an investigation into lockdown parties at Downing Street invited staff to a ""Christmas party"" in his office last year. Top civil servant Simon Case is due to report shortly on claims Covid rules were broken at events for staff in the run up to last Christmas. But the BBC has been told that Case's position as chairman of the inquiry is now under consideration. The Cabinet Office has been asked to comment. We'll bring you more on this developing story as we get it. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics We were expecting these case figures to go up - and we can expect them to go up further. The number of people getting tested is up about 20% in a week - but the case numbers are up about 40% in the same time. And we can expect that to go up further because when you look at London and Scotland - the two parts of the UK where Omicron is furthest advanced - cases are rising even faster there. So how long will it go on for? The modellers aren't sure yet. They're talking about peaks early in the new year - if you keep on doubling and doubling and doubling cases, there'll eventually be more people getting infected than there are people in the UK - so there is a limit on this. The real question - which still hasn't been answered - then becomes: how ill does it make people and how much pressure is it going to put on the healthcare system? Here are some graphics explaining the latest coronavirus situation in the UK. UK case numbers continued to climb today, with another 93,045 infections reported on Friday - a record high for a third consecutive day Deaths remain stable - but it's worth remembering this current spike in Omicron cases won't be reflected in these figures yet There are more than 7,000 Covid patients in hospital in the UK The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 132,836 or 38.6% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 4.5% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. A further 93,045
coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 111 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The UK
reported 88,376 cases yesterday. Molly Nancarrow felt ""very stressed, anxious and overwhelmed"" when her lateral flow test came back positive for Covid on Tuesday. ""I just can't believe this is happening,"" the 20-year-old tells Newsbeat. Molly, who's a student at the University of Gloucestershire, says it's ""heartbreaking""
to be missing the build-up to Christmas with her family in Bath because the days before 25 December make the day itself ""more magical"". ""It's what gets me in the Christmas mood, spending time with my family. Being on my own is going to make it a little bit harder."" Instead of going on walks and visiting Christmas markets with her mum, step-dad and brothers, Molly's going to spend time on FaceTime with them instead. She's waiting on a PCR test result, but no matter what comes back, she says she'll stay away from home until she's feeling better because her brothers are vulnerable. Read more of Molly's storyhere. Some more now on the study we reported on earlier from Imperial College London. Their researchers say the risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant is 5.4 times greater than with the Delta variant. The study suggests protection against reinfection by Omicron from past infection may be as low as 19%. According to the data, boosters are vital in controlling Omicron, and could provide around 85% protection against severe illness, as we reported a short while ago. But researchers say they may lose some effectiveness over time. They estimate the proportion of Omicron among all Covid cases between 29 November and 11 December was doubling every two days up to 11 December. Based on this, they also estimate the reproduction number (R) of Omicron was above 3, over the period studied. Read more Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Yesterday, China recorded its
100,000th case of Covid-19 since the very start of the pandemic. There have only been 56
locally-transmitted cases of the virus in the last 24 hours. The majority of
cases are in two hotspots: the eastern province of Zhejiang (which neighbours
Shanghai), and the northern reaches of Inner Mongolia. Cases have remained low in
recent months in China, due to the countryâs zero-Covid policy. This involves
locking down communities the moment one person tests positive, and mass-testing
large populations for any âsilent carriersâ. Officials have projected that
this strategy will remain in place until the spring. The country is now introducing
new restrictions ahead of the festive period. It is anticipating increased travel
over Christmas, and ahead of the 2022 Lunar New Year, which will fall on 1
February. Today, the Ministry of Culture
and Tourism is enforcing rules that cross-border provincial tourism be
suspended if any cases are detected in land border cities or ports, in order to
prevent cases at Chinaâs borders spreading more inland. Official media are also noting
today that many areas, including the cities of Beijing and Xiâan, are making it a
requirement that travellers in the new year show a negative Covid-19 test
within 48 hours of travel. Ronan O'Gara's La Rochelle side were due to travel to play Bath on Saturday before the travel ban We've just heard about Covid causing disruption in England's Premier League. Now, it's been announced that five Heineken Champions Cup fixtures between French and British Rugby Union teams have been postponed this weekend, as well as two games from the European Challenge Cup. The announcement follows the French government's decision on Thursday to ban all non-essential travel to and from the UK and to tighten testing requirements for travellers. The French sports ministry told Reuters they had been ""working on getting an exemption through meetings with the government's crisis unit"". Despite the decision, Welsh side Dragons will play Lyon tonight, with the French team due to return immediately after the game and before the border restrictions come into force. The blanket postponement may cause some controversy as it comes after Saturday's clash between Ospreys and Racing 92 was cancelled due to a number of positive Covid-19 cases in the Welsh side. Irish side Leinster had to forfeit their game against Montpellier for similar reasons. The Irish side is said to be furious after organisers handed them 28-0 defeat for their inability to fulfil the fixture. The UK has recorded 3,201 new cases of the Omicron variant, up from yesterday's figure of 1,691. It takes the total number of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK to 14,909 - although the true figure is believed to be much higher because not all labs can detect the variant and not everyone will come forward for testing. Football fans have their Covid passes checked at the Chelsea v Everton match Premier League clubs willmeet on Monday to discuss the escalating crisisaround the coronavirus pandemic with nine games postponed over the past week - including five already from this weekend's 10-match fixture list. Brentford boss Thomas Frank is leading calls for games to be postponed until Boxing Day to enable a reset, while others have asked for clarity on the situation. Meanwhile, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has cancelled a press conference after
returning an inconclusive coronavirus test result. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston says getting vaccinated is ""the socially
responsible thing to do"" after the English Football League confirmed on Thursday that one in four
players in its competitions had no intention to receive a single vaccine at this
stage. Shadow Sports Minister Jeff Smith echoes his call, saying that as ""role models"" he would urge
any footballers not yet vaccinated to do so. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News New data on
Omicron has been released by the UK Health Security Agency based on people
infected so far. It shows that 18%
of people with Omicron infected someone else in their household, compared to
10% of people who tested positive with Delta. The percentage of
people infecting others outside their household was also higher for Omicron
than for Delta - nearly 9% compared to 3%. People are also
more likely to be reinfected with Omicron after having had a previous
coronavirus infection. And studies show
that lateral flow tests are just as good at detecting Omicron as they are at
detecting the Delta variant of the virus. As a result, health officials are urging people
to test regularly, particularly before attending social gatherings. Denmark's prime minister has announced that her government intends to propose new restrictions to curb
the rapid spread of coronavirus and the new Omicron variant,
which now accounts for a fifth of all cases registered in
the country. Denmark has seen cases rise rapidly over the past week and daily infections broke another
record on Friday as 11,194 Covid cases were recorded. The country has recorded a total of 9,009 Omicron infections so far. ""In record time, the rules of the game have again been
changed,"" Mette Frederiksen said at a news conference on Friday. The new restrictions, which will need approval from
parliament, include plans to close a host of venues such as theatres, cinemas,
entertainment parks and conference centres. Frederiksen also proposed to ban the serving of alcohol after 22:00 local time and urged Danes to limit their social contacts in the run up to Christmas. Despite the increase in cases, the country is in a better position than it was last Christmas, with death rates and hospital admissions significantly below the previous peak. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Seven Covid cases have been
recorded in Taiwan today, and while by international standards this number
might seem low, it is the highest number of cases in more than three months. There has been renewed concern
about a potential outbreak in Taiwan this week after clusters of cases were
identified at two quarantine hotels: one in Taipei and
one in Taoyuan. Outbreaks amongst people on the
same floors led to suspicions of cross-contamination, which have now been
confirmed. As a result, Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has
classified these cases as locally-transmitted. These new cases have led to the
CECC making it mandatory that all arrivals now undergo six Covid-19 tests. It
has also urged increased inspections and ventilation at quarantine hotels. Taiwan has consistently
recorded a single case or zero cases since 20 September. These latest developments come
shortly on the heels of Taiwan reopening its borders, to allow an influx of
people to return for the Lunar New Year. Relaxed rules were introduced
from Tuesday meaning that arrivals can stay a minimum of seven days at a quarantine
facility, rather than the previously-mandated 14-days. This is on the condition
that they self-isolate at home, and carry out regular PCR tests. Anna Baldwin had planned a family trip to Disneyland for Christmas From tonight only those with ""compelling reasons"" will be able to travel from the UK to France, meaning last-minute cancellations for families who had booked holidays. Mum-of-two Anna Baldwin is ""devastated"" a surprise trip to Disneyland for her sons' Christmas present won't be able to go ahead. As well as the cost of tests she's already paid for, Anna is also worried about the extra expense on things like food for a Christmas at home. Meanwhile, businesses have also been hit. Victor Dapremont, a sales manager for the Mademoiselle Hotel in Paris, says 80% of guests coming from England have cancelled their bookings, with Brits normally making up around a third of guests. Read more about the impact on holidaymakers and businesses here. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Boris Johnson and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have held talks on coronavirus funding amid the threat of the Omicron variant  - but no extra money is heading to Scotland at the moment. The BBC understands the Scottish government thinks the talks were constructive but inconclusive. More talks between the PM and devolved administrations are due this weekend. Earlier, Sturgeon said it would be ""unconscionable"" if more money was not allocated by the UK government ""very quickly"". The BBC has approached the UK Treasury for comment. Read more on the latest Covid situation in Scotlandhere. Rising Covid cases have left London's fire and rescue service with ""unprecedented"" staff shortages, the Fire Brigades Union says. According to London Fire Brigade statistics 40 fire engines, out of a total of 142, were unavailable on both the day and night shift on Thursday - a level also reached for at least parts of the 10, 11 and 15 December. The union says Covid has been skyrocketing in the service as the Omicron variant has taken hold in the capital, with almost 10% of operational firefighters now either having tested positive or self-isolating. It says Covid-related shortages are having a greater impact due to ""already low levels of fire and rescue staffing in the capital"". The union's London regional secretary Jon Lambe says Omicron is having a ""devastating impact"" on the London Fire Brigade. Cosmo (centre) will spend Christmas with a friend We've been hearing today from people who have tested positive for Covid who will now have to isolate over Christmas. Cosmo Wilson is among those who will be spending Christmas away from family - for the second year running - after testing positive for Covid. Last year the UK's travel restrictions meant he couldn't fly back to see his parents in Thailand, so he spent the festive season with friends in Nottingham instead. This year he had been planning to stay with his sister and their aunt and uncle, in Uckfield, East Sussex. But the 22-year-old waitertested positive this week and his self-isolation ends as the clock ticks past midnightinto Christmas Day. So he'll spend the day in London with a friend instead. Cosmo says seeing the positive test result was a ""jarring"" moment. ""The main feeling was just disbelief,"" he tells Newsbeat. The man heading an investigation into lockdown parties at Downing Street invited staff to a ""Christmas party"" in his office last year. Top civil servant Simon Case is due to report shortly on claims Covid rules were broken at events for staff in the run up to last Christmas. But the BBC has been told that Case's position as chairman of the inquiry is now under consideration. The Cabinet Office has been asked to comment. We'll bring you more on this developing story as we get it. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics We were expecting these case figures to go up - and we can expect them to go up further. The number of people getting tested is up about 20% in a week - but the case numbers are up about 40% in the same time. And we can expect that to go up further because when you look at London and Scotland - the two parts of the UK where Omicron is furthest advanced - cases are rising even faster there. So how long will it go on for? The modellers aren't sure yet. They're talking about peaks early in the new year - if you keep on doubling and doubling and doubling cases, there'll eventually be more people getting infected than there are people in the UK - so there is a limit on this. The real question - which still hasn't been answered - then becomes: how ill does it make people and how much pressure is it going to put on the healthcare system? Here are some graphics explaining the latest coronavirus situation in the UK. UK case numbers continued to climb today, with another 93,045 infections reported on Friday - a record high for a third consecutive day Deaths remain stable - but it's worth remembering this current spike in Omicron cases won't be reflected in these figures yet There are more than 7,000 Covid patients in hospital in the UK The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 132,836 or 38.6% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 4.5% in the last seven days, compared

New Scottish Covid regulations come into forceBusinesses are now legally required to take extra measures to slow the spread of the Omicron variant.ScotlandComments,"New legal restrictions on businesses to help control the spread of Covid-19 have taken effect in Scotland. Firms are now legally required to take measures to minimise transmission amid concerns about the Omicron variant. Shops and hospitality outlets have to work to reduce crowding and queueing, erect screens and barriers and enforce the wearing of face masks. Scottish ministers have offered Â£100m of support to firms, and called on the UK government to provide more funds. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned on Thursday that furtherrestrictions on ""high risk"" sectors may be unavoidable. Hospitality 'takes Â£1bn hit' on Christmas parties Covid rules: What is advice and what is the law? Why doesn't Scotland have tougher Covid measures? Omicron is expected to be confirmed as the dominant strain of Covid-19 in Scotland on Friday, with Ms Sturgeon saying this would ""drive an even more rapid increase in cases"". The first minister said the new variant was spreading ""exceptionally fast"", warning that health services could be overwhelmed and that ""many people will become severely unwell and die"". Scots have been urged to limit social interactions in the build-up to Christmas, meeting with no more than three households at a time, and people have been encouraged to postpone work parties. This advice has not been backed up in law, as happened earlier in the pandemic, although Ms Sturgeon said people should not view it as being ""optional"". This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Omicron is spreading ""exceptionally fast"" in Scotland However, new curbs have now come into force for business owners and the operators of shops and hospitality venues. From a minute past midnight on Friday, businesses are required to ""have regard toguidance"" from the government,external, and to take ""reasonably practicable"" measures to minimise the spread of the virus. These include ""measures which limit close face to face interaction and maintain hygiene"" by changing the layout of premises and avoiding bottlenecks in entrances and corridors. Specificguidance for the tourism and hospitality sector,externalhas also been published, urging premises to revert to table service where possible, managing queueing areas so that customers can remain at least a metre apart, and to consider introducing one-way systems to ""reduce the pressure on pinch points within premises"". Hospitality outlets had voiced concerns about a wave of cancellations after people were urged to defer Christmas party plans, with claims the industry has already taken a Â£1bn hit. The Night Time Industries Association warned of ""mass business failures and bankruptcies"", while TV chef and restaurant owner Nick Nairn said ""really strong leadership"" was required with people in the industry ""starting to come apart at the edges"". Business operators across a range of sectors have been hit by recent advice to cancel Christmas parties and restrict social gatherings. Beautician Alana Forrest, owner of Pink Lily in Aberdeen, said: ""December is usually our busiest time of the year but since the advice to cancel Christmas parties we've had an influx of cancellations. This week alone we've had 30 that we know of. ""It has a huge impact on business, particularly for the make-up girls. They rely on people going to occasions. All 15 of the staff here are self-employed, so when there's a whole diary cancelled that's a person's wage for the week and there's nothing being put in place to support people. ""The majority of people are cancelling because they don't need things done for their Christmas parties, but also because people are having to self-isolate. ""It felt like we were almost back to normality and it's now a bit of a kick in the teeth again. There's not been any support put in place and because it's not law - it's just suggestions - they don't have to provide any sort of support for our industry. So many people are suffering again and there's no light at the end of the tunnel."" The Scottish and UK governments have become embroiled in a row over funding for business support, with calls for the furlough scheme to be reintroduced. The Treasury has provided Â£220m of immediate funding, but Scottish ministers contend that this had been brought forward from next year and had already been budgeted for. Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said the UK government should provide Â£500m immediately to fund grant support for Scottish businesses. Speaking to the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, Ms Forbes did not say whether the Scottish government wanted to close businesses if it secured UK government money - but said it ""could not rule out having to go further on any front"". She said: ""We know that we can't go further without additional funding - right now businesses are seeing a reduced amount of trade even though it isn't lockdown, so people voting with their feet because of the message to reduce transmission. ""The argument is even if we were to go any further, we would absolutely need greater financial support."" Ms Sturgeon wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday sayingurgent financial help was neededto protect firms from the ""economic shock"". The UK government said Mr Johnson would speak to Ms Sturgeon in the coming days, with a spokesman adding that ministers were ""working closely with the Scottish government on the shared challenge the new variant poses"". He added: ""We've acted rapidly to support and give the Scottish government the certainty to spend additional money in the coming weeks - exactly as they have asked in our discussions - and we will continue to listen carefully as that co-operation steps up.""

Thomas Schreiber stabbed Sir Richard at least five times, the court heard A cry of ""yes"" could be heard from the public gallery, where some members of the family were sitting, as the verdicts were read out. The judge, Mr Justice Garnham, told the defendant: ""The only sentence I can pass is of life imprisonment but for the offence of murder I have to set the minimum number of years and I also have to sentence you for the attempted murder of your mother."" Armed police were called to Moorhill, Sir Richard's home in Higher Langham that he shared with both Anne and Thomas Schreiber, at 19:30 BST on 7 April. This video can not be played Police were called to Sir Richard's Moorhill estate near Gillingham in Dorset Ms Schreiber was described as being ""barely conscious"" when she was found in the kitchen, before being carried out by police officers to waiting paramedics. Sir Richard was found dead outside his upstairs bedroom. He had been stabbed at least five times. Prosecutor Adam Feest QC told the court: ""Police didn't know what they would find. This was a ferocious and sustained attack on both victims.""

Sir Richard and Ms Schreiber were living with the defendant at the time of the attack The court heard Schreiber told a friend he ""couldn't stand"" Sir Richard. Millionaire murder accused 'couldn't stop' attack Hotelier murder accused incensed by row, jury told Hotelier died in ferocious attack, court told Another message from Schreiber said: ""My mind is consumed with hatred of the worst kind... I contemplate murdering them... I want them to suffer."" The fatal attack happened on the eighth anniversary of the death of Schreiber's father, David, who the court heard suffered from depression and had a drinking problem. Sir Richard had an estimated family fortune of Â£301m He separated from Ms Schreiber in about 2003. The court heard Sir Richard had given Schreiber and his two sisters Â£100,000 as deposits to buy a house, along with a monthly Â£1,000 allowance. Schreiber had previously admitted manslaughter and also pleaded guilty to driving a Range Rover dangerously on the A303, A4 and M3 in a high-speed chase as he fled to London after the attack.

"Omicron 'could hit 11,000 a day' in NI this monthThere are now 210 cases, but sources advise that the real number could be up to 10 times higher.Northern Ireland","Hospitals in Northern Ireland could be under even more pressure in January, say health officials Ministers have been warned there could be 11,000 Omicron variant cases each day in Northern Ireland in a worst-case scenario by the end of December. There are now 210 confirmed cases, but sources advise that the real number could be up to 10 times those detected. Health officials said a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. Projections about Covid patient numbers were shown to ministers on Thursday but no further restrictions were announced. Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan said ""more clarity"" was needed on the link between the variant and hospitalisations. The executive is next expected to meet on Wednesday. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there could be a ""clearer picture"" then about the variant and any action that may be required. Allow Twitter content?

A document given to ministers on Thursday stated that action may be needed for a ""reasonable chance"" of keeping hospital inpatient numbers below 1,000. It outlined that a ""significant intervention"" would be needed ""immediately after Christmas"" to help the health service. The document also explained that it was likely that a peak in coronavirus case numbers would occur in the third week of January, with hospital admissions peaking in late January or February. The paper added: ""The extent of the hospital peak will depend on the severity of Omicron illness but without further measures is likely to exceed numbers observed earlier in the epidemic, potentially by several fold."" The 11,000 cases a day figure, which was described as a modelling projection and ""not a prediction"", was included in a series of graphs presented by Stormont's chief medical officer. It was described as the worst case scenario if no further restrictions are imposed, and the vaccine booster rate remains at current levels. Ministers were also told that hospitalisation figures could reach 4,000 by January on the current trajectory. But they were warned the figures were based on the current available data, and much more information will become available over the weekend. Speaking after the executive meeting, Mr Givan said Northern Ireland was behind the curve of Omicron cases being experienced elsewhere in the UK. He also said he had been ""encouraged"" by the level of uptake of the Covid-19 booster jabs. ""We don't panic, we continue to put into practice our public health, we be careful over the Christmas period and we get as much information as we can which will help inform the executive at our next meeting next week,"" he said. Paul Givan said Northern Ireland was not in the same position as last Christmas due to the vaccine programme Mr Givan said he wanted flexibility from the UK Treasury for the devolved regions to access coronavirus funding depending on their individual circumstances. He said: ""If we're not getting any more funding then we have to look at our existing resources,"" he said. Covid-19 vaccine certificates have been introduced for entry to some venues Further data will emerge from experience in England and Scotland in the next fortnight, where community transmission of the variant is more advanced. The paper received by ministers also said hospital admissions in Northern Ireland declined modestly in the past week but hospital occupancy remained at a ""relatively high"" level. Intensive care units occupancy and deaths declined modestly in the past week, it added. It warned that Omicron will become dominant around the final week of December, potentially with ""very large numbers of cases"". The chief medical officer has said he is more concerned than at any other time in the pandemic. Six more coronavirus-related deaths and another 2,237 casesof the virus were recorded in Northern Ireland on Thursday. The situation has been exacerbated by a shortage of nursing staff, withthe Belfast Telegraph reporting that 575 nurses left the health service,externalin Northern Ireland between June and October. The potential for a surge in Omicron cases has led the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) to warn that a crisis could be looming. ""What we're seeing are the outworkings of an exhausted and burnt-out group of people who have been trying to hold the service together for a long time,"" said Rita Devlin of the RCN. Booster jabs on offer to over 18s in NI from Monday What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? ""People have just reached the end of their tether,"" she continued. ""In a crisis situation you can keep going with no breaks and working overtime but only for a short time. ""Our nurses are saying... [there] just seems to be no end to it."" The Covid-19 booster jab programme in Northern Ireland will open to all age groups from Monday Earlier on Thursday an organisation representing the bar and restaurant sector saidthe industry was ""in freefall"" as a result of new Covid rules. Colin Neill, of Hospitality Ulster, said factors including the spread of the Omicron variant and speculation about new restrictions had led to many people cancelling Christmas bookings. He said the situation was ""unsustainable"" and he called for the Stormont executive to offer financial support. At Thursday's meeting of the executive, ministers were briefed on the spread of the Omicron variant in Northern Ireland. They also heard details of the plan for a rapid roll-out of Covid-19 booster vaccinations. BBC News NI understands that from Monday all adults in Northern Ireland will be able to get a booster vaccination as long as their last dose was administered at least three months ago. Staffing cover for schools, which have been affected by a rise in coronavirus cases, was also expected to be discussed.

She says that because of the lag in time between getting a booster and being fully protected, there are other things we need to do now - perhaps not going out, or taking a lateral flow if you do need to go out. If you go out now, you could catch Covid and have to isolate over Christmas. Or pass the virus on to someone else, she says. She adds that many people will end up catching Covid and having to isolate, which will have an impact on the smooth running of the country. Allow Twitter content?

News asks if the UK government does provide further financial assistance to businesses
then will more Covid restrictions be more likely in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon says that's not necessarily the case. She says, ""I will continue to take decisions which I think are appropriate,
and I will be able to take decisions that I think are appropriate without
worrying about not being able to compensate businesses.â  STV's Gordon Chree asks if rising cases have already been ""priced in"" to the current advice about Christmas. If we see an increase in cases next week, could Christmas still be cancelled? The first minister answers that nothing - including a lockdown - is inevitable. She says we can drive cases down through behaviour, and we shouldn't be fatalistic. She stresses testing, vaccines, hygiene, ventilation and limiting contacts to help stay safe. Dr Smith says cases announced today are people who were infected 5-7 days ago. There could be an eight-fold increase in the numbers of people infected today, due to the virus' exponential growth. A further 4,336 new cases of Covid were reported in Scotland on Friday, of which 51% showed the so-called S-Gene dropout that is typical of the Omicron variant.

But we should interact with our families in a way that is safer than we might normally do Nicola Sturgeon David Wallace Lockhart, of BBC Scotland, asks Ms Sturgeon it is wise for two big football matches in Glasgow go ahead this weekend. The first minister says, ""My advice to people right now is please limit your social interactions,
wherever your social interactions may be. ""Had we the financial support
mechanism in place that we had earlier in the pandemic I would be able, perhaps, to give more straightforward advice to events to say donât let these events go
ahead right now, I canât do that when I canât compensate people. ""All I can do right now is ask people to modify their own
behaviour."" The first minister asks:  She asks everyone to look out for each other and stick at it. And she concludes by suggesting we all get in touch with someone who might be feeling down or lonely just now. People should not risk catching Covid if they want to spend Christmas with family, Ms Sturgeon says The first minister asks: ""Stay at home much more than you normally would, and stay at home as much as you can."" She says if what matters most to you is spending time with your loved ones on Christmas day, you shouldn't go out before then and risking catching Covid. The reality is, she says, mixing with others just now ""is a real and increasing risk"". She highlights that this new strain is much more infectious than previous strains. ""If someone in your group, or even just someone in the same venue as you has it, your chances of catching it are much higher than with the Delta variant,"" Ms Sturgeon adds. After Christmas, minimising your contacts will help reduce the January surge she says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The progress made in the booster vaccine programme is hailed by Ms Sturgeon. She says more than half of the population over the age of 18 has now had a booster jab. The drive will keep going to get ""as many people as possible by the times the bells strike on Hogmanay,"" adds the first minister. Ms Sturgeon stresses, ""it's never too late to get vaccinated"". Nicola Sturgeon says she will use a call with Boris Johnson
later to press for more financial support for Scotland's businesses. The first minister says a return to the type of state aid that
was in place earlier in the pandemic is what is needed. She says, âWith businesses already bleeding, every 24 hours
counts - there is no time to waste.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Sturgeon acknowledges that the hospitality and culture sectors are being severely impacted by her advice to stay at home and limit contacts. Of the Â£100m support for business she has previously announced, Â£66m of this will go to hospitality, Â£8m will go to the food and drink supply chain, Â£3m will go to weddings, Â£20m will go to the culture sector and Â£3m to the worst affected tourism businesses. She says she knows this money won't fully compensate affected businesses. She is to speak to Boris Johnson about getting more support for businesses. The first minister continues that the scale and immediacy of the challenge concerns her. She says even if Omicron turns out to be milder for many people, it will still cause serious illness, hospitalisation and death for some. Even if the number of people falling seriously ill is a smaller percentage of cases than with Delta, ""a smaller percentage of a much bigger number of infections will result in a massive number of cases needing hospital care"". If we don't act now the NHS could be overwhelmed, she adds. The first minister confirms that Omicron is now the dominant strain in Scotland and says this presents a challenge because it spreads faster than Delta. It could have an R-number which is possibly above four, she adds. She says this risks driving a much steeper increase in cases - in the past week, cases have increased by more than 40% which is expected to continue and accelerate. ""The tsunami I warned about a week ago is now starting to hit us,"" the first minister warns. The latest available data for Covid-19 in Scotland shows that as of 12:00 today:  Nicola Sturgeon says that due to the high volume of tests being processed the true number of cases might not be reflected in these figures. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she will provide an update on Omicron's spread, and reinforce the ""important requests"" she is making of everyone to stay at home as much as is feasible and limit their contacts. Omicron has replaced Delta as the dominant strain in Scotland, the first minister confirms. Humza Yousaf says expanding the booster jab rollout over the coming weeks will be ""extremely challenging"". The health secretary was speaking after he got his own booster
vaccination at the Arbroath Community Centre. ""It would be amiss
for me not to acknowledge and commend the enormous national effort which is
ongoing - the like of which has never been seen in peacetime,"" Mr Yousaf adds. âWith demand for
boosters being high Iâd like to reassure everyone we have plenty of supplies
and we are working hard with health boards to maximise vaccination capacity."" Today is the first day of new legal restrictions on businesses to help control the spread of Covid-19. The changes mean firms are legally required to take measures to minimise transmission amid concerns about the Omicron variant. This means shops and hospitality outlets have to put in measures to reduce crowding and queueing such as erecting screens and barriers. The wearing of face masks also has to be enforced. Read more.

And she concludes by suggesting we all get in touch with someone who might be feeling down or lonely just now. People should not risk catching Covid if they want to spend Christmas with family, Ms Sturgeon says The first minister asks: ""Stay at home much more than you normally would, and stay at home as much as you can."" She says if what matters most to you is spending time with your loved ones on Christmas day, you shouldn't go out before then and risking catching Covid. The reality is, she says, mixing with others just now ""is a real and increasing risk"". She highlights that this new strain is much more infectious than previous strains. ""If someone in your group, or even just someone in the same venue as you has it, your chances of catching it are much higher than with the Delta variant,"" Ms Sturgeon adds. After Christmas, minimising your contacts will help reduce the January surge she says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The progress made in the booster vaccine programme is hailed by Ms Sturgeon. She says more than half of the population over the age of 18 has now had a booster jab. The drive will keep going to get ""as many people as possible by the times the bells strike on Hogmanay,"" adds the first minister. Ms Sturgeon stresses, ""it's never too late to get vaccinated"". Nicola Sturgeon says she will use a call with Boris Johnson
later to press for more financial support for Scotland's businesses. The first minister says a return to the type of state aid that
was in place earlier in the pandemic is what is needed. She says, âWith businesses already bleeding, every 24 hours
counts - there is no time to waste.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Sturgeon acknowledges that the hospitality and culture sectors are being severely impacted by her advice to stay at home and limit contacts. Of the Â£100m support for business she has previously announced, Â£66m of this will go to hospitality, Â£8m will go to the food and drink supply chain, Â£3m will go to weddings, Â£20m will go to the culture sector and Â£3m to the worst affected tourism businesses. She says she knows this money won't fully compensate affected businesses. She is to speak to Boris Johnson about getting more support for businesses. The first minister continues that the scale and immediacy of the challenge concerns her. She says even if Omicron turns out to be milder for many people, it will still cause serious illness, hospitalisation and death for some. Even if the number of people falling seriously ill is a smaller percentage of cases than with Delta, ""a smaller percentage of a much bigger number of infections will result in a massive number of cases needing hospital care"". If we don't act now the NHS could be overwhelmed, she adds. The first minister confirms that Omicron is now the dominant strain in Scotland and says this presents a challenge because it spreads faster than Delta. It could have an R-number which is possibly above four, she adds. She says this risks driving a much steeper increase in cases - in the past week, cases have increased by more than 40% which is expected to continue and accelerate. ""The tsunami I warned about a week ago is now starting to hit us,"" the first minister warns. The latest available data for Covid-19 in Scotland shows that as of 12:00 today:  Nicola Sturgeon says that due to the high volume of tests being processed the true number of cases might not be reflected in these figures. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she will provide an update on Omicron's spread, and reinforce the ""important requests"" she is making of everyone to stay at home as much as is feasible and limit their contacts. Omicron has replaced Delta as the dominant strain in Scotland, the first minister confirms. Humza Yousaf says expanding the booster jab rollout over the coming weeks will be ""extremely challenging"". The health secretary was speaking after he got his own booster
vaccination at the Arbroath Community Centre. ""It would be amiss
for me not to acknowledge and commend the enormous national effort which is
ongoing - the like of which has never been seen in peacetime,"" Mr Yousaf adds. âWith demand for
boosters being high Iâd like to reassure everyone we have plenty of supplies
and we are working hard with health boards to maximise vaccination capacity."" Today is the first day of new legal restrictions on businesses to help control the spread of Covid-19. The changes mean firms are legally required to take measures to minimise transmission amid concerns about the Omicron variant. This means shops and hospitality outlets have to put in measures to reduce crowding and queueing such as erecting screens and barriers. The wearing of face masks also has to be enforced. Read more.

Tougher Welsh restrictions to come amid Omicron threat,"A further 93,045 Covid cases have been confirmed in the UK - another record high as the Omicron variant drives a spike in infections And another 111 deaths are reported within 28 days of a positive test Wales must introduce further restrictions because âthe storm of Omicron is coming our wayâ, First Minister Mark Drakeford says In a press conference at the same time, Nicola Sturgeon warns the ""tsunami is starting to hit"" Scotland From 27 December, nightclubs in Wales must close in response to the Omicron variant Social distancing will also be required in shops and workplaces In Scotland, people have already been advised to limit socialising to three households in the run-up to Christmas And President Biden warns unvaccinated Americans faces a winter of severe illness and death because of Omicron Thanks for joining us. Today's contributors were Becky Morton,
Doug Faulkner, Jo Couzens, Matt Murphy and Dulcie Lee. The live page was edited by Emma
Harrison and James Clarke. As ever, you can follow any major developments on the news site

coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News New data on
Omicron has been released by the UK Health Security Agency based on people
infected so far. It shows that 18%
of people with Omicron infected someone else in their household, compared to
10% of people who tested positive with Delta. The percentage of
people infecting others outside their household was also higher for Omicron
than for Delta - nearly 9% compared to 3%. People are also
more likely to be reinfected with Omicron after having had a previous
coronavirus infection. And studies show
that lateral flow tests are just as good at detecting Omicron as they are at
detecting the Delta variant of the virus. As a result, health officials are urging people
to test regularly, particularly before attending social gatherings. Denmark's prime minister has announced that her government intends to propose new restrictions to curb
the rapid spread of coronavirus and the new Omicron variant,
which now accounts for a fifth of all cases registered in
the country. Denmark has seen cases rise rapidly over the past week and daily infections broke another
record on Friday as 11,194 Covid cases were recorded. The country has recorded a total of 9,009 Omicron infections so far. ""In record time, the rules of the game have again been
changed,"" Mette Frederiksen said at a news conference on Friday. The new restrictions, which will need approval from
parliament, include plans to close a host of venues such as theatres, cinemas,
entertainment parks and conference centres. Frederiksen also proposed to ban the serving of alcohol after 22:00 local time and urged Danes to limit their social contacts in the run up to Christmas. Despite the increase in cases, the country is in a better position than it was last Christmas, with death rates and hospital admissions significantly below the previous peak. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Seven Covid cases have been
recorded in Taiwan today, and while by international standards this number
might seem low, it is the highest number of cases in more than three months. There has been renewed concern
about a potential outbreak in Taiwan this week after clusters of cases were
identified at two quarantine hotels: one in Taipei and
one in Taoyuan. Outbreaks amongst people on the
same floors led to suspicions of cross-contamination, which have now been
confirmed. As a result, Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has
classified these cases as locally-transmitted. These new cases have led to the
CECC making it mandatory that all arrivals now undergo six Covid-19 tests. It
has also urged increased inspections and ventilation at quarantine hotels. Taiwan has consistently
recorded a single case or zero cases since 20 September. These latest developments come
shortly on the heels of Taiwan reopening its borders, to allow an influx of
people to return for the Lunar New Year. Relaxed rules were introduced
from Tuesday meaning that arrivals can stay a minimum of seven days at a quarantine
facility, rather than the previously-mandated 14-days. This is on the condition
that they self-isolate at home, and carry out regular PCR tests. Anna Baldwin had planned a family trip to Disneyland for Christmas From tonight only those with ""compelling reasons"" will be able to travel from the UK to France, meaning last-minute cancellations for families who had booked holidays. Mum-of-two Anna Baldwin is ""devastated"" a surprise trip to Disneyland for her sons' Christmas present won't be able to go ahead. As well as the cost of tests she's already paid for, Anna is also worried about the extra expense on things like food for a Christmas at home. Meanwhile, businesses have also been hit. Victor Dapremont, a sales manager for the Mademoiselle Hotel in Paris, says 80% of guests coming from England have cancelled their bookings, with Brits normally making up around a third of guests. Read more about the impact on holidaymakers and businesses here. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Boris Johnson and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have held talks on coronavirus funding amid the threat of the Omicron variant  - but no extra money is heading to Scotland at the moment. The BBC understands the Scottish government thinks the talks were constructive but inconclusive. More talks between the PM and devolved administrations are due this weekend. Earlier, Sturgeon said it would be ""unconscionable"" if more money was not allocated by the UK government ""very quickly"". The BBC has approached the UK Treasury for comment. Read more on the latest Covid situation in Scotlandhere. Rising Covid cases have left London's fire and rescue service with ""unprecedented"" staff shortages, the Fire Brigades Union says. According to London Fire Brigade statistics 40 fire engines, out of a total of 142, were unavailable on both the day and night shift on Thursday - a level also reached for at least parts of the 10, 11 and 15 December. The union says Covid has been skyrocketing in the service as the Omicron variant has taken hold in the capital, with almost 10% of operational firefighters now either having tested positive or self-isolating. It says Covid-related shortages are having a greater impact due to ""already low levels of fire and rescue staffing in the capital"". The union's London regional secretary Jon Lambe says Omicron is having a ""devastating impact"" on the London Fire Brigade. Cosmo (centre) will spend Christmas with a friend We've been hearing today from people who have tested positive for Covid who will now have to isolate over Christmas. Cosmo Wilson is among those who will be spending Christmas away from family - for the second year running - after testing positive for Covid. Last year the UK's travel restrictions meant he couldn't fly back to see his parents in Thailand, so he spent the festive season with friends in Nottingham instead. This year he had been planning to stay with his sister and their aunt and uncle, in Uckfield, East Sussex. But the 22-year-old waitertested positive this week and his self-isolation ends as the clock ticks past midnightinto Christmas Day. So he'll spend the day in London with a friend instead. Cosmo says seeing the positive test result was a ""jarring"" moment. ""The main feeling was just disbelief,"" he tells Newsbeat. The man heading an investigation into lockdown parties at Downing Street invited staff to a ""Christmas party"" in his office last year. Top civil servant Simon Case is due to report shortly on claims Covid rules were broken at events for staff in the run up to last Christmas. But the BBC has been told that Case's position as chairman of the inquiry is now under consideration. The Cabinet Office has been asked to comment. We'll bring you more on this developing story as we get it. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics We were expecting these case figures to go up - and we can expect them to go up further. The number of people getting tested is up about 20% in a week - but the case numbers are up about 40% in the same time. And we can expect that to go up further because when you look at London and Scotland - the two parts of the UK where Omicron is furthest advanced - cases are rising even faster there. So how long will it go on for? The modellers aren't sure yet. They're talking about peaks early in the new year - if you keep on doubling and doubling and doubling cases, there'll eventually be more people getting infected than there are people in the UK - so there is a limit on this. The real question - which still hasn't been answered - then becomes: how ill does it make people and how much pressure is it going to put on the healthcare system? Here are some graphics explaining the latest coronavirus situation in the UK. UK case numbers continued to climb today, with another 93,045 infections reported on Friday - a record high for a third consecutive day Deaths remain stable - but it's worth remembering this current spike in Omicron cases won't be reflected in these figures yet There are more than 7,000 Covid patients in hospital in the UK The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 132,836 or 38.6% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 4.5% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. A further 93,045
coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 111 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The UK
reported 88,376 cases yesterday. Molly Nancarrow felt ""very stressed, anxious and overwhelmed"" when her lateral flow test came back positive for Covid on Tuesday. ""I just can't believe this is happening,"" the 20-year-old tells Newsbeat. Molly, who's a student at the University of Gloucestershire, says it's ""heartbreaking""
to be missing the build-up to Christmas with her family in Bath because the days before 25 December make the day itself ""more magical"". ""It's what gets me in the Christmas mood, spending time with my family. Being on my own is going to make it a little bit harder."" Instead of going on walks and visiting Christmas markets with her mum, step-dad and brothers, Molly's going to spend time on FaceTime with them instead. She's waiting on a PCR test result, but no matter what comes back, she says she'll stay away from home until she's feeling better because her brothers are vulnerable. Read more of Molly's storyhere. Some more now on the study we reported on earlier from Imperial College London. Their researchers say the risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant is 5.4 times greater than with the Delta variant. The study suggests protection against reinfection by Omicron from past infection may be as low as 19%. According to the data, boosters are vital in controlling Omicron, and could provide around 85% protection against severe illness, as we reported a short while ago. But researchers say they may lose some effectiveness over time. They estimate the proportion of Omicron among all Covid cases between 29 November and 11 December was doubling every two days up to 11 December. Based on this, they also estimate the reproduction number (R) of Omicron was above 3, over the period studied. Read more Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Yesterday, China recorded its
100,000th case of Covid-19 since the very start of the pandemic. There have only been 56
locally-transmitted cases of the virus in the last 24 hours. The majority of
cases are in two hotspots: the eastern province of Zhejiang (which neighbours
Shanghai), and the northern reaches of Inner Mongolia. Cases have remained low in
recent months in China, due to the countryâs zero-Covid policy. This involves
locking down communities the moment one person tests positive, and mass-testing
large populations for any âsilent carriersâ. Officials have projected that
this strategy will remain in place until the spring. The country is now introducing
new restrictions ahead of the festive period. It is anticipating increased travel
over Christmas, and ahead of the 2022 Lunar New Year, which will fall on 1
February. Today, the Ministry of Culture
and Tourism is enforcing rules that cross-border provincial tourism be
suspended if any cases are detected in land border cities or ports, in order to
prevent cases at Chinaâs borders spreading more inland. Official media are also noting
today that many areas, including the cities of Beijing and Xiâan, are making it a
requirement that travellers in the new year show a negative Covid-19 test
within 48 hours of travel. Ronan O'Gara's La Rochelle side were due to travel to play Bath on Saturday before the travel ban We've just heard about Covid causing disruption in England's Premier League. Now, it's been announced that five Heineken Champions Cup fixtures between French and British Rugby Union teams have been postponed this weekend, as well as two games from the European Challenge Cup. The announcement follows the French government's decision on Thursday to ban all non-essential travel to and from the UK and to tighten testing requirements for travellers. The French sports ministry told Reuters they had been ""working on getting an exemption through meetings with the government's crisis unit"". Despite the decision, Welsh side Dragons will play Lyon tonight, with the French team due to return immediately after the game and before the border restrictions come into force. The blanket postponement may cause some controversy as it comes after Saturday's clash between Ospreys and Racing 92 was cancelled due to a number of positive Covid-19 cases in the Welsh side. Irish side Leinster had to forfeit their game against Montpellier for similar reasons. The Irish side is said to be furious after organisers handed them 28-0 defeat for their inability to fulfil the fixture. The UK has recorded 3,201 new cases of the Omicron variant, up from yesterday's figure of 1,691. It takes the total number of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK to 14,909 - although the true figure is believed to be much higher because not all labs can detect the variant and not everyone will come forward for testing. Football fans have their Covid passes checked at the Chelsea v Everton match Premier League clubs willmeet on Monday to discuss the escalating crisisaround the coronavirus pandemic with nine games postponed over the past week - including five already from this weekend's 10-match fixture list. Brentford boss Thomas Frank is leading calls for games to be postponed until Boxing Day to enable a reset, while others have asked for clarity on the situation. Meanwhile, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has cancelled a press conference after
returning an inconclusive coronavirus test result. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston says getting vaccinated is ""the socially
responsible thing to do"" after the English Football League confirmed on Thursday that one in four
players in its competitions had no intention to receive a single vaccine at this
stage. Shadow Sports Minister Jeff Smith echoes his call, saying that as ""role models"" he would urge
any footballers not yet vaccinated to do so. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

The UK has recorded 3,201 new cases of the Omicron variant, up from yesterday's figure of 1,691. It takes the total number of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK to 14,909 - although the true figure is believed to be much higher because not all labs can detect the variant and not everyone will come forward for testing. Football fans have their Covid passes checked at the Chelsea v Everton match Premier League clubs willmeet on Monday to discuss the escalating crisisaround the coronavirus pandemic with nine games postponed over the past week - including five already from this weekend's 10-match fixture list. Brentford boss Thomas Frank is leading calls for games to be postponed until Boxing Day to enable a reset, while others have asked for clarity on the situation. Meanwhile, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has cancelled a press conference after
returning an inconclusive coronavirus test result. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston says getting vaccinated is ""the socially
responsible thing to do"" after the English Football League confirmed on Thursday that one in four
players in its competitions had no intention to receive a single vaccine at this
stage. Shadow Sports Minister Jeff Smith echoes his call, saying that as ""role models"" he would urge
any footballers not yet vaccinated to do so. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Join us again next time.  Back at the first minister's briefing, The Daily Telegraph presses the first minister on what types
of âhigher risk settingsâ might be affected by any future Covid restrictions. Ms Sturgeon cites settings that are âindoors, [have] poorer ventilation"" or where people are ""coming together in small crowded places, often with alcohol involved.â She adds, âI donât want to be restricting or closing down
anywhere but I canât magic away this virus.â On the BBC programme, Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie says cases are rising ""exponentially"" across the population, and urges everyone to get their booster. She says that because of the lag in time between getting a booster and being fully protected, there are other things we need to do now - perhaps not going out, or taking a lateral flow if you do need to go out. If you go out now, you could catch Covid and have to isolate over Christmas. Or pass the virus on to someone else, she says. She adds that many people will end up catching Covid and having to isolate, which will have an impact on the smooth running of the country. Allow Twitter content?

On the BBC Scotland coronavirus update programme Tory MSP Dr Sandesh Gulhane says it's ""absolutely critical"" people get boosted. He says everyone should prioritise what matters to them the most. Dr Gulhane adds that government funding needs to find its way to businesses before Christmas, and he supports Ms Sturgeon's calls for more funding from the UK government to support businesses. He says it is ""absolutely imperative"" for the Scottish and UK governments to work together. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Bauer Radio asks why it is being left to concert promoters to take the decisions on whether events in the coming days should go ahead or not. Ms Sturgeon says, ""I canât say to a concert, 'cancel' because I canât then ensure
the financial support is there to compensate it. ""If I could do that I could give clearer advice to events
and businesses."" The first minister says the ""UK government needs to get
its finger out, it needs to step up and provide this support."" Sky
News asks if the UK government does provide further financial assistance to businesses
then will more Covid restrictions be more likely in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon says that's not necessarily the case. She says, ""I will continue to take decisions which I think are appropriate,
and I will be able to take decisions that I think are appropriate without
worrying about not being able to compensate businesses.â  STV's Gordon Chree asks if rising cases have already been ""priced in"" to the current advice about Christmas. If we see an increase in cases next week, could Christmas still be cancelled? The first minister answers that nothing - including a lockdown - is inevitable. She says we can drive cases down through behaviour, and we shouldn't be fatalistic. She stresses testing, vaccines, hygiene, ventilation and limiting contacts to help stay safe. Dr Smith says cases announced today are people who were infected 5-7 days ago. There could be an eight-fold increase in the numbers of people infected today, due to the virus' exponential growth. A further 4,336 new cases of Covid were reported in Scotland on Friday, of which 51% showed the so-called S-Gene dropout that is typical of the Omicron variant. Read more - Omicron now dominant virus variant in Scotland ""Everything we are doing just now is trying to encourage people to behave in a way that means we can all interact with our families on Christmas day and I'm not anticipating changing that. But we should interact with our families in a way that is safer than we might normally do Nicola Sturgeon David Wallace Lockhart, of BBC Scotland, asks Ms Sturgeon it is wise for two big football matches in Glasgow go ahead this weekend. The first minister says, ""My advice to people right now is please limit your social interactions,
wherever your social interactions may be. ""Had we the financial support
mechanism in place that we had earlier in the pandemic I would be able, perhaps, to give more straightforward advice to events to say donât let these events go
ahead right now, I canât do that when I canât compensate people. ""All I can do right now is ask people to modify their own
behaviour."" The first minister asks:  She asks everyone to look out for each other and stick at it. And she concludes by suggesting we all get in touch with someone who might be feeling down or lonely just now. People should not risk catching Covid if they want to spend Christmas with family, Ms Sturgeon says The first minister asks: ""Stay at home much more than you normally would, and stay at home as much as you can."" She says if what matters most to you is spending time with your loved ones on Christmas day, you shouldn't go out before then and risking catching Covid. The reality is, she says, mixing with others just now ""is a real and increasing risk"". She highlights that this new strain is much more infectious than previous strains. ""If someone in your group, or even just someone in the same venue as you has it, your chances of catching it are much higher than with the Delta variant,"" Ms Sturgeon adds. After Christmas, minimising your contacts will help reduce the January surge she says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The progress made in the booster vaccine programme is hailed by Ms Sturgeon. She says more than half of the population over the age of 18 has now had a booster jab. The drive will keep going to get ""as many people as possible by the times the bells strike on Hogmanay,"" adds the first minister. Ms Sturgeon stresses, ""it's never too late to get vaccinated"". Nicola Sturgeon says she will use a call with Boris Johnson
later to press for more financial support for Scotland's businesses. The first minister says a return to the type of state aid that
was in place earlier in the pandemic is what is needed. She says, âWith businesses already bleeding, every 24 hours
counts - there is no time to waste.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Sturgeon acknowledges that the hospitality and culture sectors are being severely impacted by her advice to stay at home and limit contacts. Of the Â£100m support for business she has previously announced, Â£66m of this will go to hospitality, Â£8m will go to the food and drink supply chain, Â£3m will go to weddings, Â£20m will go to the culture sector and Â£3m to the worst affected tourism businesses. She says she knows this money won't fully compensate affected businesses. She is to speak to Boris Johnson about getting more support for businesses. The first minister continues that the scale and immediacy of the challenge concerns her. She says even if Omicron turns out to be milder for many people, it will still cause serious illness, hospitalisation and death for some. Even if the number of people falling seriously ill is a smaller percentage of cases than with Delta, ""a smaller percentage of a much bigger number of infections will result in a massive number of cases needing hospital care"". If we don't act now the NHS could be overwhelmed, she adds. The first minister confirms that Omicron is now the dominant strain in Scotland and says this presents a challenge because it spreads faster than Delta. It could have an R-number which is possibly above four, she adds. She says this risks driving a much steeper increase in cases - in the past week, cases have increased by more than 40% which is expected to continue and accelerate. ""The tsunami I warned about a week ago is now starting to hit us,"" the first minister warns. The latest available data for Covid-19 in Scotland shows that as of 12:00 today:  Nicola Sturgeon says that due to the high volume of tests being processed the true number of cases might not be reflected in these figures. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she will provide an update on Omicron's spread, and reinforce the ""important requests"" she is making of everyone to stay at home as much as is feasible and limit their contacts. Omicron has replaced Delta as the dominant strain in Scotland, the first minister confirms. Humza Yousaf says expanding the booster jab rollout over the coming weeks will be ""extremely challenging"". The health secretary was speaking after he got his own booster
vaccination at the Arbroath Community Centre. ""It would be amiss
for me not to acknowledge and commend the enormous national effort which is
ongoing - the like of which has never been seen in peacetime,"" Mr Yousaf adds. âWith demand for
boosters being high Iâd like to reassure everyone we have plenty of supplies
and we are working hard with health boards to maximise vaccination capacity."" Today is the first day of new legal restrictions on businesses to help control the spread of Covid-19. The changes mean firms are legally required to take measures to minimise transmission amid concerns about the Omicron variant. This means shops and hospitality outlets have to put in measures to reduce crowding and queueing such as erecting screens and barriers. The wearing of face masks also has to be enforced. Read more.

Today's contributors were Becky Morton,
Doug Faulkner, Jo Couzens, Matt Murphy and Dulcie Lee. The live page was edited by Emma
Harrison and James Clarke. As ever, you can follow any major developments on the news site
- just go to thefront page. And for more in-depth coverage, you can go to our dedicated
coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News New data on
Omicron has been released by the UK Health Security Agency based on people
infected so far. It shows that 18%
of people with Omicron infected someone else in their household, compared to
10% of people who tested positive with Delta. The percentage of
people infecting others outside their household was also higher for Omicron
than for Delta - nearly 9% compared to 3%. People are also
more likely to be reinfected with Omicron after having had a previous
coronavirus infection. And studies show
that lateral flow tests are just as good at detecting Omicron as they are at
detecting the Delta variant of the virus. As a result, health officials are urging people
to test regularly, particularly before attending social gatherings. Denmark's prime minister has announced that her government intends to propose new restrictions to curb
the rapid spread of coronavirus and the new Omicron variant,
which now accounts for a fifth of all cases registered in
the country. Denmark has seen cases rise rapidly over the past week and daily infections broke another
record on Friday as 11,194 Covid cases were recorded. The country has recorded a total of 9,009 Omicron infections so far. ""In record time, the rules of the game have again been
changed,"" Mette Frederiksen said at a news conference on Friday. The new restrictions, which will need approval from
parliament, include plans to close a host of venues such as theatres, cinemas,
entertainment parks and conference centres. Frederiksen also proposed to ban the serving of alcohol after 22:00 local time and urged Danes to limit their social contacts in the run up to Christmas. Despite the increase in cases, the country is in a better position than it was last Christmas, with death rates and hospital admissions significantly below the previous peak. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Seven Covid cases have been
recorded in Taiwan today, and while by international standards this number
might seem low, it is the highest number of cases in more than three months. There has been renewed concern
about a potential outbreak in Taiwan this week after clusters of cases were
identified at two quarantine hotels: one in Taipei and
one in Taoyuan. Outbreaks amongst people on the
same floors led to suspicions of cross-contamination, which have now been
confirmed. As a result, Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has
classified these cases as locally-transmitted. These new cases have led to the
CECC making it mandatory that all arrivals now undergo six Covid-19 tests. It
has also urged increased inspections and ventilation at quarantine hotels. Taiwan has consistently
recorded a single case or zero cases since 20 September. These latest developments come
shortly on the heels of Taiwan reopening its borders, to allow an influx of
people to return for the Lunar New Year. Relaxed rules were introduced
from Tuesday meaning that arrivals can stay a minimum of seven days at a quarantine
facility, rather than the previously-mandated 14-days. This is on the condition
that they self-isolate at home, and carry out regular PCR tests. Anna Baldwin had planned a family trip to Disneyland for Christmas From tonight only those with ""compelling reasons"" will be able to travel from the UK to France, meaning last-minute cancellations for families who had booked holidays. Mum-of-two Anna Baldwin is ""devastated"" a surprise trip to Disneyland for her sons' Christmas present won't be able to go ahead. As well as the cost of tests she's already paid for, Anna is also worried about the extra expense on things like food for a Christmas at home. Meanwhile, businesses have also been hit. Victor Dapremont, a sales manager for the Mademoiselle Hotel in Paris, says 80% of guests coming from England have cancelled their bookings, with Brits normally making up around a third of guests. Read more about the impact on holidaymakers and businesses here. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Boris Johnson and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have held talks on coronavirus funding amid the threat of the Omicron variant  - but no extra money is heading to Scotland at the moment. The BBC understands the Scottish government thinks the talks were constructive but inconclusive. More talks between the PM and devolved administrations are due this weekend. Earlier, Sturgeon said it would be ""unconscionable"" if more money was not allocated by the UK government ""very quickly"". The BBC has approached the UK Treasury for comment. Read more on the latest Covid situation in Scotlandhere. Rising Covid cases have left London's fire and rescue service with ""unprecedented"" staff shortages, the Fire Brigades Union says. According to London Fire Brigade statistics 40 fire engines, out of a total of 142, were unavailable on both the day and night shift on Thursday - a level also reached for at least parts of the 10, 11 and 15 December. The union says Covid has been skyrocketing in the service as the Omicron variant has taken hold in the capital, with almost 10% of operational firefighters now either having tested positive or self-isolating. It says Covid-related shortages are having a greater impact due to ""already low levels of fire and rescue staffing in the capital"". The union's London regional secretary Jon Lambe says Omicron is having a ""devastating impact"" on the London Fire Brigade. Cosmo (centre) will spend Christmas with a friend We've been hearing today from people who have tested positive for Covid who will now have to isolate over Christmas. Cosmo Wilson is among those who will be spending Christmas away from family - for the second year running - after testing positive for Covid. Last year the UK's travel restrictions meant he couldn't fly back to see his parents in Thailand, so he spent the festive season with friends in Nottingham instead. This year he had been planning to stay with his sister and their aunt and uncle, in Uckfield, East Sussex. But the 22-year-old waitertested positive this week and his self-isolation ends as the clock ticks past midnightinto Christmas Day. So he'll spend the day in London with a friend instead. Cosmo says seeing the positive test result was a ""jarring"" moment. ""The main feeling was just disbelief,"" he tells Newsbeat. The man heading an investigation into lockdown parties at Downing Street invited staff to a ""Christmas party"" in his office last year. Top civil servant Simon Case is due to report shortly on claims Covid rules were broken at events for staff in the run up to last Christmas. But the BBC has been told that Case's position as chairman of the inquiry is now under consideration. The Cabinet Office has been asked to comment. We'll bring you more on this developing story as we get it. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics We were expecting these case figures to go up - and we can expect them to go up further. The number of people getting tested is up about 20% in a week - but the case numbers are up about 40% in the same time. And we can expect that to go up further because when you look at London and Scotland - the two parts of the UK where Omicron is furthest advanced - cases are rising even faster there. So how long will it go on for? The modellers aren't sure yet. They're talking about peaks early in the new year - if you keep on doubling and doubling and doubling cases, there'll eventually be more people getting infected than there are people in the UK - so there is a limit on this. The real question - which still hasn't been answered - then becomes: how ill does it make people and how much pressure is it going to put on the healthcare system? Here are some graphics explaining the latest coronavirus situation in the UK. UK case numbers continued to climb today, with another 93,045 infections reported on Friday - a record high for a third consecutive day Deaths remain stable - but it's worth remembering this current spike in Omicron cases won't be reflected in these figures yet There are more than 7,000 Covid patients in hospital in the UK The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 132,836 or 38.6% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 4.5% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. A further 93,045
coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 111 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The UK
reported 88,376 cases yesterday. Molly Nancarrow felt ""very stressed, anxious and overwhelmed"" when her lateral flow test came back positive for Covid on Tuesday. ""I just can't believe this is happening,"" the 20-year-old tells Newsbeat. Molly, who's a student at the University of Gloucestershire, says it's ""heartbreaking""
to be missing the build-up to Christmas with her family in Bath because the days before 25 December make the day itself ""more magical"". ""It's what gets me in the Christmas mood, spending time with my family. Being on my own is going to make it a little bit harder."" Instead of going on walks and visiting Christmas markets with her mum, step-dad and brothers, Molly's going to spend time on FaceTime with them instead. She's waiting on a PCR test result, but no matter what comes back, she says she'll stay away from home until she's feeling better because her brothers are vulnerable. Read more of Molly's storyhere. Some more now on the study we reported on earlier from Imperial College London. Their researchers say the risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant is 5.4 times greater than with the Delta variant. The study suggests protection against reinfection by Omicron from past infection may be as low as 19%. According to the data, boosters are vital in controlling Omicron, and could provide around 85% protection against severe illness, as we reported a short while ago. But researchers say they may lose some effectiveness over time. They estimate the proportion of Omicron among all Covid cases between 29 November and 11 December was doubling every two days up to 11 December. Based on this, they also estimate the reproduction number (R) of Omicron was above 3, over the period studied. Read more Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Yesterday, China recorded its
100,000th case of Covid-19 since the very start of the pandemic. There have only been 56
locally-transmitted cases of the virus in the last 24 hours. The majority of
cases are in two hotspots: the eastern province of Zhejiang (which neighbours
Shanghai), and the northern reaches of Inner Mongolia. Cases have remained low in
recent months in China, due to the countryâs zero-Covid policy. This involves
locking down communities the moment one person tests positive, and mass-testing
large populations for any âsilent carriersâ. Officials have projected that
this strategy will remain in place until the spring. The country is now introducing
new restrictions ahead of the festive period. It is anticipating increased travel
over Christmas, and ahead of the 2022 Lunar New Year, which will fall on 1
February. Today, the Ministry of Culture
and Tourism is enforcing rules that cross-border provincial tourism be
suspended if any cases are detected in land border cities or ports, in order to
prevent cases at Chinaâs borders spreading more inland. Official media are also noting
today that many areas, including the cities of Beijing and Xiâan, are making it a
requirement that travellers in the new year show a negative Covid-19 test
within 48 hours of travel. Ronan O'Gara's La Rochelle side were due to travel to play Bath on Saturday before the travel ban We've just heard about Covid causing disruption in England's Premier League. Now, it's been announced that five Heineken Champions Cup fixtures between French and British Rugby Union teams have been postponed this weekend, as well as two games from the European Challenge Cup. The announcement follows the French government's decision on Thursday to ban all non-essential travel to and from the UK and to tighten testing requirements for travellers. The French sports ministry told Reuters they had been ""working on getting an exemption through meetings with the government's crisis unit"". Despite the decision, Welsh side Dragons will play Lyon tonight, with the French team due to return immediately after the game and before the border restrictions come into force. The blanket postponement may cause some controversy as it comes after Saturday's clash between Ospreys and Racing 92 was cancelled due to a number of positive Covid-19 cases in the Welsh side. Irish side Leinster had to forfeit their game against Montpellier for similar reasons. The Irish side is said to be furious after organisers handed them 28-0 defeat for their inability to fulfil the fixture. The UK has recorded 3,201 new cases of the Omicron variant, up from yesterday's figure of 1,691. It takes the total number of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK to 14,909 - although the true figure is believed to be much higher because not all labs can detect the variant and not everyone will come forward for testing. Football fans have their Covid passes checked at the Chelsea v Everton match Premier League clubs willmeet on Monday to discuss the escalating crisisaround the coronavirus pandemic with nine games postponed over the past week - including five already from this weekend's 10-match fixture list.

Thomas Schreiber stabbed Sir Richard at least five times, the court heard A cry of ""yes"" could be heard from the public gallery, where some members of the family were sitting, as the verdicts were read out. The judge, Mr Justice Garnham, told the defendant: ""The only sentence I can pass is of life imprisonment but for the offence of murder I have to set the minimum number of years and I also have to sentence you for the attempted murder of your mother."" Armed police were called to Moorhill, Sir Richard's home in Higher Langham that he shared with both Anne and Thomas Schreiber, at 19:30 BST on 7 April.

Sir Richard was found dead outside his upstairs bedroom. He had been stabbed at least five times. Prosecutor Adam Feest QC told the court: ""Police didn't know what they would find. This was a ferocious and sustained attack on both victims."" Schreiber had been harbouring ""feelings of resentment"" towards the couple, having been forced to live at Moorhill due to the pandemic, jurors were told.

I contemplate murdering them... I want them to suffer."" The fatal attack happened on the eighth anniversary of the death of Schreiber's father, David, who the court heard suffered from depression and had a drinking problem. Sir Richard had an estimated family fortune of Â£301m He separated from Ms Schreiber in about 2003. The court heard Sir Richard had given Schreiber and his two sisters Â£100,000 as deposits to buy a house, along with a monthly Â£1,000 allowance.

"HSBC fined Â£64m for anti-money laundering failingsThe UK financial regulator says the fine was for ""unacceptable"" risks at the banking giant.Business","Banking giant HSBC has been fined Â£63.9m by the UK's financial regulator for ""unacceptable failings"" of its anti-money laundering systems. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said weaknesses in HSBC's financial crime safeguards had been highlighted several times before action was taken. The bank has not disputed the findings and agreed to settle, resulting in its fine being being cut from Â£91m. HSBC's failings cover a period of eight years, from 2010 to 2018, the FCA said. The regulator said there was ""inadequate monitoring of money laundering and terrorist financing scenarios until 2014, and poor risk assessment of ""new scenarios"" after 2016. Europe's biggest bank was found to have had inappropriate testing and did not check the accuracy and completeness of data.

"HSBC fined Â£64m for anti-money laundering failingsThe UK financial regulator says the fine was for ""unacceptable"" risks at the banking giant.","Banking giant HSBC has been fined Â£63.9m by the UK's financial regulator for ""unacceptable failings"" of its anti-money laundering systems. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said weaknesses in HSBC's financial crime safeguards had been highlighted several times before action was taken.

New Scottish Covid regulations come into force,"New legal restrictions on businesses to help control the spread of Covid-19 have taken effect in Scotland. Firms are now legally required to take measures to minimise transmission amid concerns about the Omicron variant. Shops and hospitality outlets have to work to reduce crowding and queueing, erect screens and barriers and enforce the wearing of face masks. Scottish ministers have offered Â£100m of support to firms, and called on the UK government to provide more funds. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned on Thursday that furtherrestrictions on ""high risk"" sectors may be unavoidable. Hospitality 'takes Â£1bn hit' on Christmas parties Covid rules: What is advice and what is the law? Why doesn't Scotland have tougher Covid measures? Omicron is expected to be confirmed as the dominant strain of Covid-19 in Scotland on Friday, with Ms Sturgeon saying this would ""drive an even more rapid increase in cases"". The first minister said the new variant was spreading ""exceptionally fast"", warning that health services could be overwhelmed and that ""many people will become severely unwell and die"". Scots have been urged to limit social interactions in the build-up to Christmas, meeting with no more than three households at a time, and people have been encouraged to postpone work parties. This advice has not been backed up in law, as happened earlier in the pandemic, although Ms Sturgeon said people should not view it as being ""optional"". This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Omicron is spreading ""exceptionally fast"" in Scotland However, new curbs have now come into force for business owners and the operators of shops and hospitality venues. From a minute past midnight on Friday, businesses are required to ""have regard toguidance"" from the government,external, and to take ""reasonably practicable"" measures to minimise the spread of the virus. These include ""measures which limit close face to face interaction and maintain hygiene"" by changing the layout of premises and avoiding bottlenecks in entrances and corridors. Specificguidance for the tourism and hospitality sector,externalhas also been published, urging premises to revert to table service where possible, managing queueing areas so that customers can remain at least a metre apart, and to consider introducing one-way systems to ""reduce the pressure on pinch points within premises"". Hospitality outlets had voiced concerns about a wave of cancellations after people were urged to defer Christmas party plans, with claims the industry has already taken a Â£1bn hit. The Night Time Industries Association warned of ""mass business failures and bankruptcies"", while TV chef and restaurant owner Nick Nairn said ""really strong leadership"" was required with people in the industry ""starting to come apart at the edges"". Business operators across a range of sectors have been hit by recent advice to cancel Christmas parties and restrict social gatherings. Beautician Alana Forrest, owner of Pink Lily in Aberdeen, said: ""December is usually our busiest time of the year but since the advice to cancel Christmas parties we've had an influx of cancellations. This week alone we've had 30 that we know of. ""It has a huge impact on business, particularly for the make-up girls. They rely on people going to occasions. All 15 of the staff here are self-employed, so when there's a whole diary cancelled that's a person's wage for the week and there's nothing being put in place to support people. ""The majority of people are cancelling because they don't need things done for their Christmas parties, but also because people are having to self-isolate. ""It felt like we were almost back to normality and it's now a bit of a kick in the teeth again. There's not been any support put in place and because it's not law - it's just suggestions - they don't have to provide any sort of support for our industry. So many people are suffering again and there's no light at the end of the tunnel."" The Scottish and UK governments have become embroiled in a row over funding for business support, with calls for the furlough scheme to be reintroduced. The Treasury has provided Â£220m of immediate funding, but Scottish ministers contend that this had been brought forward from next year and had already been budgeted for. Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said the UK government should provide Â£500m immediately to fund grant support for Scottish businesses. Speaking to the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, Ms Forbes did not say whether the Scottish government wanted to close businesses if it secured UK government money - but said it ""could not rule out having to go further on any front"". She said: ""We know that we can't go further without additional funding - right now businesses are seeing a reduced amount of trade even though it isn't lockdown, so people voting with their feet because of the message to reduce transmission. ""The argument is even if we were to go any further, we would absolutely need greater financial support."" Ms Sturgeon wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday sayingurgent financial help was neededto protect firms from the ""economic shock"". The UK government said Mr Johnson would speak to Ms Sturgeon in the coming days, with a spokesman adding that ministers were ""working closely with the Scottish government on the shared challenge the new variant poses"". He added: ""We've acted rapidly to support and give the Scottish government the certainty to spend additional money in the coming weeks - exactly as they have asked in our discussions - and we will continue to listen carefully as that co-operation steps up.""

"Omicron storm coming, first minister warns","Social distancing will be a requirement again in response to Omicron Wales must brace itself for the ""storm of Omicron"", the first minister has warned. Nightclubs will close in Wales after 26 December in response to the rising number of cases of the variant. Social distancing will also be reintroduced in shops and workplaces. Mark Drakeford also said more decisions on Covid restrictions would be made on Monday - in particularwith regard to sports events. A return to other restrictions - like extended household bubbles and the rule of six in pubs - is not being ruled out after Christmas. As it happened: Friday's press conference Welsh festive sport verdict on Monday First estimate of booster jab impact on Omicron The first minister told BBC's Today programme: ""Wales is in the calm before the storm. We see the storm of Omicron coming our way and we need to prepare for it now."" He pleaded with people to have a smaller Christmas and issued guidance to people avoid meeting ""wider circles of friends"". The number of Omicron cases detected in Wales rose by 64 to 159 cases on Friday. It comes as the UK sawa record number of Covid casesfor a third day, exceeding 90,000. Mr Drakeford warned that London was already seeing an increase in people going to hospital with Covid. ""We have to be prepared for the same to happen here,"" he told a press conference. And he warned it was ""inescapable"" that a sharp increase in cases will impact the delivery of public services. Updated guidance will be issued for care home visits, and people on the shielding list will be written to with new advice on how to protect themselves. But it is not expected they will be asked to shield like at the start of the pandemic. The first minister said he had not introduced stricter measures immediately because the government's actions had to be ""proportionate and fair"" to everyone as Christmas was a ""special"" time of year. ""Our Omicron numbers are the lowest anywhere else in the UK,"" he said, adding providing people adhered to the latest advice given, a pathway had been created into Christmas. Business lobby group the CBI said the fresh restrictions on companies were a ""big setback"". Announcing a two-phased plan, the Welsh government said it was giving ""strong guidance"" for people to leave a day between social events and to meet outdoors over Christmas. But from 27 December new legal restrictions will come into force. What are the new Covid rules for Wales? How do I get a booster in Wales? Omicron: Is it milder despite dodging immunity? How can I tell I have Omicron? They include the two-metre rule in workplaces, and extra rules for businesses and services to protect customers and staff, such as limiting numbers in supermarkets, one-way systems and tighter controls at check-outs. Businesses will also be required to allow people to work from home wherever possible. Welsh ministers say they will make Â£60m available for firms impacted by the new restrictions. The cash is earmarked for January but is not designed to cover wages, as the furlough scheme did earlier in the pandemic. The Federation of Small Businesses welcomed the cash but demanded ""urgent clarity"" on whether it would be available to firms that have seen a loss of bookings ""at an alarming rate"". This video can not be played Covid help should not just be for England, says Mark Drakeford But Mr Drakeford said the ability to provide and sustain and longer-term support to businesses is ""severely constrained by the current position of the UK Treasury and its refusal to open vital support schemes, such as furlough"". Such schemes should be available for all UK nations when needed ""and not just at the point at when restrictions are introduced in England"", he added. Mr Drakeford said Omicron was the most serious development in the pandemic so far. ""People should think very carefully about who they are meeting and how they are meeting to keep themselves and others safe before Christmas,"" he added. In the run-up to Christmas, the Welsh government urged people to: Take a lateral flow test before going out, going Christmas shopping or visiting people Meet outdoors, or if meeting indoors ensure it is well ventilated Leave a day between social events Socially distance, wear a face covering and wash your hands Get vaccinated, and make getting a booster a priority if you have had an appointment The guidance does not go as far as Scotland where indoor social mixing is limited tothree households. The Welsh government appears to be caught between a rock and a hard place when it come to the imposition of additional Covid restrictions that they believe could be necessary to meet the threat the Omicron variant poses to the Welsh NHS. It seems clear that ministers believe that strict new restrictions should be introduced but, without UK treasury support for affected businesses, are wary of introducing measures that could hurt the already battered hospitality and retail sectors of the economy. All eyes will be on the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to see what help might be on offer but with the UK government already nursing a hangover after a backbench Commons rebellion on Covid passes, it seems unlikely that Downing Street will move as quickly and firmly as the Welsh government would like. While Welsh ministers probably do have the resources to offer some additional support for businesses, a new Covid wave could lead to increased financial pressure on the health and other public services as they seek to cover for staff absences and increased public demand. With ministerial meetings being held on an almost daily basis it seems unlikely that today's announcements are the last word on Christmas and new year restrictions - and more measures may well be announced in coming days. Nightclubs were reopened last summer Wales is the first UK nation to close a business sector in response to the Omicron wave. The decision to shut nightclubs means they will be closed for New Year's Eve. The Night Time Industries Association said it was ""angry and frustrated"" they had been singled out for closure and claimed there was a lack of evidence to show transmission of the virus was higher in nightspots. Chief executive Mike Kill said: ""We've implemented Covid passports and lateral flow tests even though it has cost us some trade so why are we being singled out and targeted? These further restrictions are a step too far. ""Isn't there a greater concern that people who would normally socialise on New Year's Eve will now displace to other unregulated settings without those controls?"" But the first minister said the decision ""is about protecting the health of people who otherwise would be putting themselves in harm's way"". Asked if the move punishes younger people, Mark Drakeford said: ""If you look at London and you look to see where the most rapid growth has been in the Omicron variant, it has been people in their twenties and thirties."" The announcement also sparked concern from Prof Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist at Swansea University. ""I don't want to sound like the Grinch but this is not going to stem the tide of Omicron cases in Wales - hospitalisations and hospital pressure will follow in weeks,"" he said. He argued that the minimum needed was what the Welsh government called""alert level one"",external- which would have seen a return to the rule of six indoors - with a brief break at Christmas. Sara Jones, Head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, urged customers to show ""consideration and patience"" as shops reintroduce measures, which are likely to reduce capacity. But Ian Price, CBI Wales director, said: ""As Omicron cases continue to rise it's only right the government prioritises public health, but fresh restrictions are a big setback for businesses, particularly in hospitality."" This video can not be played Care home staff say they are ""reliving"" first lockdown feelings Care homes in Wales said they are relieved visits are still allowed but feared another rise in cases would put extra strain on already ""tired"" staff. ""It's a balance to keep people safe but not take away that contact of visits,"" said Care Homes Wales chief executive Mary Wimbury. ""However some care homes are not just asking whether they have enough staff to manage visits, but are there enough staff to the care home running safely? ""Staff live in their local community and it's almost impossible to stop them catching the virus somehow. The worry is for their health but also the pressure it puts on the staff who are there and are very tired. ""Everyone is worried at how things will pan out."" Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh government needed to provide ""clarity"" on the money being offered to support businesses. He said the Welsh government had a lot more money available to help firms: ""There's Â£600m sitting in the Welsh government budget which is available to them to spend on COVID measures"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said all governments face a ""difficult balancing act"" in taking these decisions. ""We're in the position in Wales, fortunately at the moment, I think we have about 5% of the population and less than 1% of the confirmed Omicron cases. And that allows that breathing space in the run-up to Christmas, but obviously we are facing a very, very difficult situation thereafter."" The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said support for health services is also needed. ""The Liberal Democrats have called for a 6% rise in our wages to both health and care workers,"" she said.

before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News New data on
Omicron has been released by the UK Health Security Agency based on people
infected so far. It shows that 18%
of people with Omicron infected someone else in their household, compared to
10% of people who tested positive with Delta. The percentage of
people infecting others outside their household was also higher for Omicron
than for Delta - nearly 9% compared to 3%. People are also
more likely to be reinfected with Omicron after having had a previous
coronavirus infection. And studies show
that lateral flow tests are just as good at detecting Omicron as they are at
detecting the Delta variant of the virus. As a result, health officials are urging people
to test regularly, particularly before attending social gatherings. Denmark's prime minister has announced that her government intends to propose new restrictions to curb
the rapid spread of coronavirus and the new Omicron variant,
which now accounts for a fifth of all cases registered in
the country. Denmark has seen cases rise rapidly over the past week and daily infections broke another
record on Friday as 11,194 Covid cases were recorded. The country has recorded a total of 9,009 Omicron infections so far. ""In record time, the rules of the game have again been
changed,"" Mette Frederiksen said at a news conference on Friday. The new restrictions, which will need approval from
parliament, include plans to close a host of venues such as theatres, cinemas,
entertainment parks and conference centres. Frederiksen also proposed to ban the serving of alcohol after 22:00 local time and urged Danes to limit their social contacts in the run up to Christmas. Despite the increase in cases, the country is in a better position than it was last Christmas, with death rates and hospital admissions significantly below the previous peak. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Seven Covid cases have been
recorded in Taiwan today, and while by international standards this number
might seem low, it is the highest number of cases in more than three months. There has been renewed concern
about a potential outbreak in Taiwan this week after clusters of cases were
identified at two quarantine hotels: one in Taipei and
one in Taoyuan. Outbreaks amongst people on the
same floors led to suspicions of cross-contamination, which have now been
confirmed. As a result, Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has
classified these cases as locally-transmitted. These new cases have led to the
CECC making it mandatory that all arrivals now undergo six Covid-19 tests. It
has also urged increased inspections and ventilation at quarantine hotels. Taiwan has consistently
recorded a single case or zero cases since 20 September. These latest developments come
shortly on the heels of Taiwan reopening its borders, to allow an influx of
people to return for the Lunar New Year. Relaxed rules were introduced
from Tuesday meaning that arrivals can stay a minimum of seven days at a quarantine
facility, rather than the previously-mandated 14-days. This is on the condition
that they self-isolate at home, and carry out regular PCR tests. Anna Baldwin had planned a family trip to Disneyland for Christmas From tonight only those with ""compelling reasons"" will be able to travel from the UK to France, meaning last-minute cancellations for families who had booked holidays. Mum-of-two Anna Baldwin is ""devastated"" a surprise trip to Disneyland for her sons' Christmas present won't be able to go ahead. As well as the cost of tests she's already paid for, Anna is also worried about the extra expense on things like food for a Christmas at home. Meanwhile, businesses have also been hit. Victor Dapremont, a sales manager for the Mademoiselle Hotel in Paris, says 80% of guests coming from England have cancelled their bookings, with Brits normally making up around a third of guests. Read more about the impact on holidaymakers and businesses here. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Boris Johnson and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have held talks on coronavirus funding amid the threat of the Omicron variant  - but no extra money is heading to Scotland at the moment. The BBC understands the Scottish government thinks the talks were constructive but inconclusive. More talks between the PM and devolved administrations are due this weekend. Earlier, Sturgeon said it would be ""unconscionable"" if more money was not allocated by the UK government ""very quickly"". The BBC has approached the UK Treasury for comment. Read more on the latest Covid situation in Scotlandhere. Rising Covid cases have left London's fire and rescue service with ""unprecedented"" staff shortages, the Fire Brigades Union says. According to London Fire Brigade statistics 40 fire engines, out of a total of 142, were unavailable on both the day and night shift on Thursday - a level also reached for at least parts of the 10, 11 and 15 December. The union says Covid has been skyrocketing in the service as the Omicron variant has taken hold in the capital, with almost 10% of operational firefighters now either having tested positive or self-isolating. It says Covid-related shortages are having a greater impact due to ""already low levels of fire and rescue staffing in the capital"". The union's London regional secretary Jon Lambe says Omicron is having a ""devastating impact"" on the London Fire Brigade. Cosmo (centre) will spend Christmas with a friend We've been hearing today from people who have tested positive for Covid who will now have to isolate over Christmas. Cosmo Wilson is among those who will be spending Christmas away from family - for the second year running - after testing positive for Covid. Last year the UK's travel restrictions meant he couldn't fly back to see his parents in Thailand, so he spent the festive season with friends in Nottingham instead. This year he had been planning to stay with his sister and their aunt and uncle, in Uckfield, East Sussex. But the 22-year-old waitertested positive this week and his self-isolation ends as the clock ticks past midnightinto Christmas Day. So he'll spend the day in London with a friend instead. Cosmo says seeing the positive test result was a ""jarring"" moment. ""The main feeling was just disbelief,"" he tells Newsbeat. The man heading an investigation into lockdown parties at Downing Street invited staff to a ""Christmas party"" in his office last year. Top civil servant Simon Case is due to report shortly on claims Covid rules were broken at events for staff in the run up to last Christmas. But the BBC has been told that Case's position as chairman of the inquiry is now under consideration. The Cabinet Office has been asked to comment. We'll bring you more on this developing story as we get it. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics We were expecting these case figures to go up - and we can expect them to go up further. The number of people getting tested is up about 20% in a week - but the case numbers are up about 40% in the same time. And we can expect that to go up further because when you look at London and Scotland - the two parts of the UK where Omicron is furthest advanced - cases are rising even faster there. So how long will it go on for? The modellers aren't sure yet. They're talking about peaks early in the new year - if you keep on doubling and doubling and doubling cases, there'll eventually be more people getting infected than there are people in the UK - so there is a limit on this. The real question - which still hasn't been answered - then becomes: how ill does it make people and how much pressure is it going to put on the healthcare system? Here are some graphics explaining the latest coronavirus situation in the UK. UK case numbers continued to climb today, with another 93,045 infections reported on Friday - a record high for a third consecutive day Deaths remain stable - but it's worth remembering this current spike in Omicron cases won't be reflected in these figures yet There are more than 7,000 Covid patients in hospital in the UK The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 132,836 or 38.6% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 4.5% in the last seven days, compared
to the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. A further 93,045
coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 111 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The UK
reported 88,376 cases yesterday. Molly Nancarrow felt ""very stressed, anxious and overwhelmed"" when her lateral flow test came back positive for Covid on Tuesday. ""I just can't believe this is happening,"" the 20-year-old tells Newsbeat. Molly, who's a student at the University of Gloucestershire, says it's ""heartbreaking""
to be missing the build-up to Christmas with her family in Bath because the days before 25 December make the day itself ""more magical"". ""It's what gets me in the Christmas mood, spending time with my family. Being on my own is going to make it a little bit harder."" Instead of going on walks and visiting Christmas markets with her mum, step-dad and brothers, Molly's going to spend time on FaceTime with them instead. She's waiting on a PCR test result, but no matter what comes back, she says she'll stay away from home until she's feeling better because her brothers are vulnerable. Read more of Molly's storyhere. Some more now on the study we reported on earlier from Imperial College London. Their researchers say the risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant is 5.4 times greater than with the Delta variant. The study suggests protection against reinfection by Omicron from past infection may be as low as 19%. According to the data, boosters are vital in controlling Omicron, and could provide around 85% protection against severe illness, as we reported a short while ago. But researchers say they may lose some effectiveness over time. They estimate the proportion of Omicron among all Covid cases between 29 November and 11 December was doubling every two days up to 11 December. Based on this, they also estimate the reproduction number (R) of Omicron was above 3, over the period studied. Read more Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Yesterday, China recorded its
100,000th case of Covid-19 since the very start of the pandemic. There have only been 56
locally-transmitted cases of the virus in the last 24 hours. The majority of
cases are in two hotspots: the eastern province of Zhejiang (which neighbours
Shanghai), and the northern reaches of Inner Mongolia. Cases have remained low in
recent months in China, due to the countryâs zero-Covid policy. This involves
locking down communities the moment one person tests positive, and mass-testing
large populations for any âsilent carriersâ. Officials have projected that
this strategy will remain in place until the spring. The country is now introducing
new restrictions ahead of the festive period. It is anticipating increased travel
over Christmas, and ahead of the 2022 Lunar New Year, which will fall on 1
February. Today, the Ministry of Culture
and Tourism is enforcing rules that cross-border provincial tourism be
suspended if any cases are detected in land border cities or ports, in order to
prevent cases at Chinaâs borders spreading more inland. Official media are also noting
today that many areas, including the cities of Beijing and Xiâan, are making it a
requirement that travellers in the new year show a negative Covid-19 test
within 48 hours of travel. Ronan O'Gara's La Rochelle side were due to travel to play Bath on Saturday before the travel ban We've just heard about Covid causing disruption in England's Premier League. Now, it's been announced that five Heineken Champions Cup fixtures between French and British Rugby Union teams have been postponed this weekend, as well as two games from the European Challenge Cup. The announcement follows the French government's decision on Thursday to ban all non-essential travel to and from the UK and to tighten testing requirements for travellers. The French sports ministry told Reuters they had been ""working on getting an exemption through meetings with the government's crisis unit"". Despite the decision, Welsh side Dragons will play Lyon tonight, with the French team due to return immediately after the game and before the border restrictions come into force. The blanket postponement may cause some controversy as it comes after Saturday's clash between Ospreys and Racing 92 was cancelled due to a number of positive Covid-19 cases in the Welsh side. Irish side Leinster had to forfeit their game against Montpellier for similar reasons. The Irish side is said to be furious after organisers handed them 28-0 defeat for their inability to fulfil the fixture. The UK has recorded 3,201 new cases of the Omicron variant, up from yesterday's figure of 1,691. It takes the total number of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK to 14,909 - although the true figure is believed to be much higher because not all labs can detect the variant and not everyone will come forward for testing. Football fans have their Covid passes checked at the Chelsea v Everton match Premier League clubs willmeet on Monday to discuss the escalating crisisaround the coronavirus pandemic with nine games postponed over the past week - including five already from this weekend's 10-match fixture list. Brentford boss Thomas Frank is leading calls for games to be postponed until Boxing Day to enable a reset, while others have asked for clarity on the situation. Meanwhile, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has cancelled a press conference after
returning an inconclusive coronavirus test result. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston says getting vaccinated is ""the socially
responsible thing to do"" after the English Football League confirmed on Thursday that one in four
players in its competitions had no intention to receive a single vaccine at this
stage. Shadow Sports Minister Jeff Smith echoes his call, saying that as ""role models"" he would urge
any footballers not yet vaccinated to do so. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"âIf I lock this door, he diesâ","Every seven seconds - on average - a person was referred for NHS mental health support in England in September. In Burnley, that comes as no surprise to Pastor Mick - a drug-dealer-turned-lifesaver during Covid - who each day meets people struggling to survive. This article contains several references to suicide. Joanne was shaken to her core 18 months ago when her partner, Robert, died suddenly. ""It feels like it's my fault, because I didn't get the help quick enough for him,"" she says. Robert's mental health deteriorated during the first lockdown. He couldn't cope with being stuck at home and developed suicidal thoughts. Joanne says she rang a mental health team two weeks before his death asking for help - and was told someone would ring Robert the next day. But she says the call never came. Two weeks later, Robert took his own life. Joanne is speaking to us in Pastor Mick's new home in the heart of Burnley town centre - a former gym that closed during the pandemic. The building has been reborn as his church - and is called the Church on the Street. It's a big space. The original showers, lockers and mirrors are still there, but there are crucial new additions. There's a giant wooden cross by an altar and four new office rooms in the corner - used as a private quiet space for qualified mental health counsellors. It was Joanne who found Robert's body. Later that day, she got a call from the mental health team she'd contacted a fortnight before. Joanne has a photo of Robert on her tablet ""They were like: 'Can I speak to Robert?' ""I said, 'He's not here no moreâ¦ he's done the damage.'"" Joanne says the woman on the phone apologised and said they had been very busy. ""She said 'I'm so sorry to hear that, I wish I could have got back sooner.'"" Although Joanne doesn't blame the mental health team, she believes Robert could have been saved with early help. ""I think he'd have been all right - he'd have still been here."" More than a year on, Joanne is still haunted by death. Each word brings back painful memories, but she wants to share how she is feeling. ""I can see the flashbacks. I can see him every day in my head - when I get up, when I go to sleep."" She says one day everything just became too much for her. ""I rang Pastor Mick and he told me to come down. He's been great."" Church on the Street has been Joanne's salvation. She says it's a place where she and her family feel safe - and she's not the only one. Hundreds of others come here each week looking for hope. Sadly, Joanne's story is one Pastor Mick is all too familiar with. When Robert died, he says, two other young men took their lives in streets close to Robert's home. At the time, Mick was regularly handing out food parcels in a car park in Burnley. ""I just couldn't believe what was happening. I knew I'd have to do something more and that I needed somewhere - a home - to deal with the mess and devastation left behind by Covid."" Inside Mick's church - we spent a month there on and off - there's a friendly open-door policy. Mick wants others who have had troubles to find hope - just like he has. In his 20s,Mick was a drug dealerconsumed by cocaine and violence. He has now found faith and feeds the poor. The church is expanding quickly - it has its own food and clothes banks. Mick also liaises with the police, housing organisations, the local council and drug rehabilitation services. Watch - The Cost of Covid: A Year on the Front Line Twelve months in Burnley with Pastor Mick ""What we are doing here is free. The hot food is free, the coffee is free, the tea is free, the counselling is free,"" he explains. ""We are keeping people alive. Sometimes it just puts it off for another day, but it's another day of life, a lot of them die."" Mick is particularly concerned about the lack of access to mental health care for the most vulnerable - people who find it difficult to see their GPs, let alone get access to a bed in a support facility. ""The help available is negligible, the mental health system is on its backside."" Mick blames the Covid lockdowns and the many months of restrictions for making issues worse. In Burnley, he hears stories of people who, in isolation, have spiralled down - turning to drugs and alcohol. In September 2021, Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust says it recorded the highest monthly number of so-called ""Section 136"" detentions in its area. That's when police detain a person and take them to a place of safety if they appear to have a mental health disorder. There were 196 - more than six a day. In response, the trust says it has expanded its street triage services for people in crisis - in partnership with the police and ambulance services. Mick says every other person he meets is struggling with a mental health issue - whether it be anxiety, paranoia or just being unable to cope with everyday life. After a busy day, he closes the church - but then, just before he locks up, his phone rings. It's another person in need of help - called John. We can make out some of the conversation. He sounds manic, lost and angry and is threatening to kill himself. He believes there has been a great injustice and people are out to get him. Mick talks to John calmly and compassionately. ""Come and see me. I'm here, I'm waiting for you. There's a brew here for you, we can talk it through."" The deal has been agreed. John won't attempt to take his life and Mick will hang on for him. ""[If] I lock this door, he dies, that's a fact - so the door has to stay open."" When John arrives at the church, he's shouting, sweating and struggling to breathe. It's upsetting to see. John at the Church in the Street ""I know who they are,"" he says, shaking uncontrollably. ""They've been so horrible and nasty towards me. I've just had enough, it's been going on too long."" Mick gently guides him over to the middle of the room. ""Come on, I want you to take a deep breath,"" says Mick, holding John in his arms. ""Take a really deep breathâ¦ All rightâ¦ So tell me what the panic is?"" Fifteen minutes later, John is calmer. His breathing has stabilised and, with a cup of tea, he's eating a slice of warmed-up meat and potato pie. John tells us that just before his crisis he had called his GP panicking for a prescription - but had been told to call back in 48 hours. John is thankful - there was nowhere else for him to go. ""Nobody else has listened - he's the only one,"" he says pointing at Mick. Mick says if it hadn't been for BBC reports on his charitable work at the end of 2020, many people in Burnley wouldn't know they could turn to him - and finding a home for his new church might not even have been possible. ""This place is breathing new life, it's helping people. The people who don't make it through the door die."" We catch up with John the next day. He's smiling and like a different person. ""You don't know what to think, what to do, who to speak to,"" he says. ""People look at you like you belong in a lunatic asylum when you speak about your mental health."" John at home But John also reveals he hasn't seen a GP all year and has lost faith in mental health care - describing it as ""non-existent"". Mick has referred John to the local mental health crisis team, but John has been unable to see them. The Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust told us the use of its mental health urgent assessment centres from July to September 2021 was 75% higher than in the last three months of 2020. It also said that community mental health referrals in August this year - at nearly 600 per 100,000 adults - were nearly 50% higher than England's national average. Those statistics will come as no surprise to Father Alex who, like Pastor Mick, we first met a year ago. In his church, St Matthew's, pews have been replaced by tables and chairs and a place to cook hot food for those in need. ""We have examples of people waiting 16 weeks when they're in crisis for mental health support,"" he tells us. ""So people are being talked off bridges and given crisis care [phone] numbers."" Looking at Demi Lea and her two children - who have come for breakfast at St Matthew's - you'd never think they were struggling. But Demi Lea says she hasn't done a food shop for months and relies on food banks, charity, and handouts. Father Alex talking to Demi Lea She first referred herself for mental health support at the end of 2020, got a phone consultation in June and is now on a waiting list for therapy. But in August, her mental health got even worse after the death of her grandmother - who she used to rely on for support. ""I haven't been able to get on top of things - financially it's been tough,"" she says. ""I can barely function."" Since we met, Father Alex has managed to arrange counselling sessions for Demi Lea. She says she's extremely grateful. Back at the Church on the Street, we sit down again with an exhausted Mick at the end of a busy day. We chat with him and his colleague Kev - a support worker - about the deaths of two young men, rumoured to have taken their own lives the night before. Mick and Kev are shocked but not surprised - although they caution against speculation. As we talk, just like the night before, there are more emergencies. Over a 30-minute period, Mick gets three panicked phone calls. The first is from a mum whose son ran away from home saying he was going to kill himself. The second is from another worried mum whose child is also having suicidal thoughts. Mick says the struggle for these families is to be seen quickly by professionals. Then comes the third call. If you've been affected by the issues raised in this report,details of organisations offering information and support for addiction and feelings of despair are available viaBBC Action Line. ""I can't cope with life, I just don't want to live any more,"" says a woman's softly spoken voice. ""Nobody has listened, I just want to go to sleep and not wake up."" Mick, head in hands, tries to reassure her. ""I know that feeling,"" says Mick, ""but there is a light that is stronger than the darkness. We'll get you in here on Monday, we'll see you."" He then asks if she has taken any medication. ""Yes"" comes the reply - enough for an overdose. Kev dials for an ambulance straight away on his phone, while Mick keeps her conscious and talking on his. ""I just don't want to live, Mick, I'm in a dark tunnel and can't get out,"" says the woman. He pleads with her. ""There's always hope. Make sure your doors are unlocked."" Pastor Mick talks to the woman on his phone Mick stays on the line until the paramedics arrive and make sure she is safe. But how has he ended up taking emergency calls? What happens when he can't answer the phone? Is this more than he can cope with? He tells us there was a missed call one night when he was asleep - and the caller had left a worrying message. ""If you don't answer the phone, I'm going to kill myself."" Unfortunately, that person did take their own life, Mick explains - his voice breaking with emotion. A few days later when we arrive at the church one morning, we meet a man called Robbie who's 29. He has been on the streets all night, but is now sitting in the office going through his possessions - the clothes on his back and a couple of see-through plastic bags. He's showing Mick the medication he's been prescribed. During lockdown Robbie struggled and began hearing voices. One told him to jump from a well-known bridge in Burnley. Police managed to get to Robbie just in time to stop him and he was admitted to a psychiatric unit. Robbie shows his medication to Pastor Mick Since then, he's received six months of expert care at several psychiatric units in Lancashire - something he says has worked well. But yesterday, he was released without accommodation arranged. He says he was told to head to Burnley Borough Council's housing department, but by the time he got there it was closed. ""I just ended up walking around town all night and then as soon as this place opened I just came to Pastor Mick,"" says Robbie. ""Without this place I'd be dead."" Mick is incandescent. He's angry that the money spent on Robbie's care has now been wasted. ""He's been released from a psychiatric unit to the street with enough drugs to kill an elephant. It's a tragedy, it doesn't need to be like this."" Robbie begins to get upset. ""I feel confusion, suicidal - it's like they've designed it to make me do it because they don't want me here no more. But I'm just trying to better myself. I just want a better life, that's all I want. I'm sick of this."" The next night, Church on the Street paid for Robbie to stay in a hotel. The following night he was placed by Burnley council in a shared room in a B&B above a pub. But within 72 hours he had been readmitted to a psychiatric unit. During our visits to the church, we talk to Mick's volunteers about the struggle to get mental health support for those who desperately need it - including David Allen, a mental health counsellor with more than 20 years' experience. ""It's not just here in Burnley, it's all over the country. And the ones that suffer most are always at the bottom of the pile. They just feel left behind because they can't get any help."" Many self-medicate - he says - with drugs and alcohol. All of a sudden, in the street outside the church, there's another tense moment. Women scream after a man collapses. ""He's OD'd. Help, he's overdosed outside."" Pastor Mick moves quickly. There's now quite a crowd gathered - with children circling on bikes. Two police community support officers are talking into their radios. But Mick was the first on his hands and knees, talking to the unresponsive man and checking for a pulse. He rushes inside and asks Kev for the Naloxone, a medicine that rapidly reverses the effects of an opioid overdose - such as heroin. Mick tries to help the man outside the church entrance By the time Mick gets back to the man - needle in hand - the panic is over. The emergency medication wasn't needed and the man is back on his feet. Nevertheless it was still a traumatic moment for Mick - and he becomes emotional. ""People don't like to see [moments like] that but that's the reality of every city and every town in this country,"" he says. ""And I'm sorry if it offends people, but they're dying, and they can all be saved, every last one of them."" Pastor Mick and his colleagues are proud with what they have achieved this year - but they also fear what the pandemic might yet bring in terms of mental health problems. Health economist Dr Luke Munford - from the University of Manchester - says an alarm bell is ringing in many poorer areas of the UK. Urgent and emergency mental health referrals to crisis teams in East Lancashire almost quadrupled when you compare July 2019 to July 2021 - he told us - but the picture is ""similarly stark in other deprived parts of the country"". The Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust says it's receiving Â£11.6m of NHS funding over three years to help improve community mental health services. Pastor Mick's transformation from violent drug dealer to lifesaver during a pandemic is profound - a personal redemption. ""To be able to serve people who are dying has become the biggest privilege of my life,"" he says. ""I feel the best I've ever felt in my life, I feel free. It's made me a better, stronger person - a softer, gentler person."" NHS England told us they urge anyone who requires help with mental health to come forward.

"UK signs free trade deal with AustraliaMinisters say it will unlock Â£10.4bn of trade, but UK farmers have concerns about being undercut.Business","The deal will reduce extra costs and taxes on exports and imports between the two countries The UK has signed a free trade deal with Australia which it says will benefit consumers and businesses. It is described as the first post-Brexit deal negotiated from scratch and not ""rolled over"" from trade terms that the UK enjoyed while in the EU. The government estimated it would unlock Â£10.4bn of additional trade while ending tariffs on all UK exports. However, some UK farmers have expressed concern that they could be undercut by cheap imports. The government said the deal was also a gateway into the fast-growing Indo-Pacific region and would boost the UK's bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the largest free trade areas in the world. Australia has also praised the deal, its second-largest trade contract with another country. ""It's a truly historic agreement - it's a true free-trade agreement. Everyone wins,"" said Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan. The agreement, which was signed in a virtual ceremony by International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, is due to come into force next year. Farmers' opposition to UK-Australia trade deal grows How will the UK-Australia trade deal work? How many trade deals has the UK done? UK wants to join the club - but what is the CPTPP? Ms Trevelyan described it as ""a landmark moment in the historic and vital relationship between our two Commonwealth nations"". It demonstrated what the UK could achieve as ""an agile, independent sovereign trading nation"", she added. In a BBC interview, she rejected suggestions the deal would harm UK farmers. She said the deal had ""very clear safeguards"" and ""clear tariff quotas in the first 10 years"", as well as ""an overarching safeguard mechanism"". ""The reality is that Australia sends about 70% of its beef and sheep meat to the Asia-Pacific markets,"" she said. ""They're closer for them and they get great prices. So I'm not expecting there to be any dramatic surge into UK markets and I know that our citizens will continue to buy what they want, but I'm very pleased to do things that will open up consumer choice."" For Australia, the deal eliminates tariffs from 99% of its exports and makes it easier for Australians to live and work in the UK. It will also help boost sales of Australia's wine, beef and sugar. These goods have been boycotted by China - Australia's main export market - due to recent political tensions. A free trade deal aims to encourage trade - usually in goods but occasionally in services - by making it cheaper. This is often achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs - taxes or charges by governments for trading goods across borders. Trade agreements also aim to remove quotas - which are limits on the amount of goods which can be traded. Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be checked. Ms Trevelyan says this agreement is a blueprint for all the other countries that want to do trade deals with the UK, so they can - in her words - ""see just how expansive we want to be"". It has been welcomed by British companies that want to do more business in Australia, especially in services. Trade between the two countries will increase. But trade deals always work both ways. The UK has given Australia pretty much everything it wanted in terms of access to the UK agricultural market. Other larger economies will take note of that and want similar access in the future. The government insists that the concerns of British farmers have been taken into account, with transitional arrangements lasting for up to 15 years. The government also points to a series of environmental provisions in the deal, which makes reference to the Paris agreement on climate change. An explicit reference to the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C, though, has been dropped. Climate NGOs will not be impressed by that. It highlights the fact that trade deals involve compromise, but this agreement also needs to be seen in the perspective of the wider trade challenges the UK faces. The Department for International Trade's internal assessment is that the deal with Australia could increase the size of the UK economy by Â£2.3bn a year from 2035. But that's only 0.08% of GDP. In comparison, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that the long term loss from leaving the European Union could be about 4% of GDP. Shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour supported such a deal, but would scrutinise it very carefully to make sure it delivered the promised benefits. He added that the opposition would ""hold the government to promises made to farming communities, its pledges on environmental protections and on food and drink standards"". Among the main points of the deal listed by the UK government are: It gives UK firms guaranteed access to bid for an additional Â£10bn worth of Australian public sector contracts per year It allows young people to work and travel in Australia for up to three years at a time, removing previous visa rules It gives UK professionals including architects, scientists, researchers, lawyers and accountants access to Australian work visas without being subject to Australia's skilled occupation list. In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK was valued at Â£20.1bn, and both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably. Currently, trade in meat between the two countries is very small. Approximately only 0.15% of all Australian beef exports go to the UK. Last year, 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK came from Australia. What trade deals has the UK done so far? How will the UK-Australia trade deal work?

Tories lose seat they held for nearly 200 yearsThe Liberal Democrats' Helen Morgan takes North Shropshire in a by-election.Shropshire,"This video can not be played Watch Lib Dem by-election winner Helen Morgan's victory speech The Conservatives have lost the North Shropshire seat they held for 115 years to the Liberal Democrats in a by-election blow to Boris Johnson. Winner Helen Morgan overturned a Tory majority of almost 23,000, declaring that the ""party is over"" for the PM. The result follows a torrid week for Mr Johnson, who has faced criticism over Downing Street parties and a rebellion by his own MPs over Covid measures. Tory MP Sir Roger Gale said the prime minister was on ""last orders"". ""One more strike and he's out,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the by-election ""has to be seen as a referendum on the prime minister's performance"". Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""I know that the voters of North Shropshire are fed up and they wanted to give us a kicking... We've heard that message loud and clear."" But he added: ""I don't think this amounts to a sea-change."" Analysis: Has Johnson lost his winning touch? Live: Lib Dems earn shock win The by-election followed the resignation of Owen Paterson, the MP for North Shropshire since 1997, who was found to have breached parliamentary rules on lobbying. The seat has been won by the Conservatives at every general election for nearly 200 years, although it was briefly held by a Liberal MP under its old name of Oswestry after a by-election in 1904. In her victory speech, Ms Morgan, who won by 5,925 votes, said: ""The people of North Shropshire have spoken on behalf of the British people. They have said loudly and clearly, 'Boris Johnson, the party is over.' ""Your government, run on lies and bluster, will be held accountable. It will be scrutinised, it will be challenged and it can and will be defeated."" Ms Morgan's victory takes the number of Lib Dem MPs up to 13, still significantly down from a high of more than 60 during the mid-2000s. The party lost dozens of its seats at the 2015 general election after being part of a coalition government with the Conservatives. But, at a celebration rally in Oswestry, part of the North Shropshire constituency, former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said millions of people around the UK ""have woken up this morning feeling that a bit of light has broken into the darkness"". He also held up a large blue balloon bearing the slogan ""Boris's bubble"", which Ms Morgan, formerly a chartered accountant, proceeded to burst with a foot-long pin. The government is going to try and say this is mid-term misery - and, yes, by-elections are a way the public can stick two fingers up to a government when they're cross. But let's be plain: this is an appalling result for the Conservatives, in a part of the country where the tradition of voting Tory is baked into the earth. This isn't a little slip up; it's a disaster. People on the ground say the Tory campaign was going OK, until all of the recent shenanigans in Downing Street emerged, and that that is when support fell off a cliff. Boris Johnson does have an extraordinary ability to bounce back. But there are people in the Conservative Party who are pencilling in the possibility of a summer leadership election. Things are febrile, and we shouldn't predict things with any certainty - but there's no doubt this is a really dangerous moment for the prime minister. Fourteen candidates stood in Thursday's by-election. Ms Morgan took 17,957 votes, with Conservative Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst amassing 12,032 and Labour's Ben Wood coming third with 3,686. The last-placed candidate, independent Yolande Kenward, received just three votes. The North Shropshire result saw a the seventh biggest swing - 34.2% - in a by-election since World War Two. It is the second loss of a former Conservative stronghold to the Lib Dems since the  general election, with the party seizing Chesham and Amersham, in Buckinghamshire, with a 25% swing in July. Earlier this month, the Toriesheld Old Bexley and Sidcup in a by-electionfollowing the death of MP James Brokenshire, but the majority was cut from nearly 19,000 to 4,478, with a 10% swing to Labour. The North Shropshire seat has existed in some form since the 1830s and, until Friday, had always had a Conservative MP. The area voted strongly in favour of Brexit in the 2016 referendum, but this did not stop the pro-EU Lib Dems taking the constituency. The by-election came just two days after Boris Johnsonexperienced his biggest rebellion in office,when 100 Conservative MPs voted against the government's proposals to introduce Covid passes in England. It also followedrows about a Number 10 Christmas party during lockdown restrictions last Decemberand the prime minister's appearance at a virtual quiz alongside two colleagues at about the same time. Before that, there had also been a fine for the Conservative Party over the financing of Mr and Mrs Johnson's renovation of the No 10 flat, and the fallout over Owen Paterson's departure,with the prime minister admitting some fault over the latter.,external This video can not be played Watch Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey's reaction to the result: ""We've brought new hope to the whole nation"" Reacting to his party losing North Shropshire, Dr Shastri-Hurst said: ""We are 11 years into Conservative government. Our elections are never an easy thing to do. ""But of course, we do need to reflect upon the result and I am sure as a party we will do that."" But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who is currently self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, said it was a ""watershed moment in our politics"". ""Millions of people are fed up with Boris Johnson and his failure to provide leadership throughout the pandemic and last night the voters of North Shropshire spoke for all of them,"" he added. Labour, which came second in North Shropshire at the 2019 election, saw its share of the vote fall from 22.1% to 9.7%. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Breakfast: ""We put the effort into it that was proportionate to our chances of winning. ""But clearly people wanted to send a message to the government that they're fed up with the incompetence, the sleaze, the kind of revelations we've seen over the last few weeks. ""The government has to take heed of that."" Correction 17th February 2022: This article originally reported that the Conservative Party held the North Shropshire seat for nearly 200 years. In fact the seat was held by a Liberal MP, under its old name of Oswestry, from 1904-1906, following a by-election and so we have amended the article to make clear that the seat was held by the Conservative Party for 115 years.

Mexican actress shot dead while waiting for sonTania Mendoza was outside a football academy when a gunman opened fire before escaping.Latin America & Caribbean,"Tania Mendoza was shot dead outside a sporting complex while waiting for her 11-year-old son A Mexican actress and singer was shot dead while she waited to pick up her 11-year-old son from a football academy in the state of Morelos, reports say. Tania Mendoza was outside the sporting complex in the city of Cuernavaca with other parents when two armed men arrived on a motorbike on Tuesday. One of them shot her multiple times before escaping with his accomplice. At least 10 women were murdered in the country every day last year, according to official data. Human rights group Amnesty International said around a third of victims - 940 - were cases of femicide,external, or the intentional murder of women because of their gender, calling it a ""shocking epidemic"". Mendoza, who was 42, rose to fame in 2005 after a lead role in the film La Mera Reyna del Sur. She had also appeared in a number of soap operas but in recent years was dedicated to her career as a singer, and recorded five albums. In 2010, she was kidnapped with her husband and son, who was six months old, from the couple's car wash business. Since then, she had reported to the Morelos State Attorney General's Office several death threats. It is not yet clear who was behind Mendoza's murder, or any possible motive. After the shooting, police carried out an operation in search for the suspects, but no-one was arrested. The Attorney General's Office told Efe news agency the case would be investigated as femicide, although no details were given. CONTEXT:Hundreds join 'Day of Dead Women' march in Mexico EXPLAINER:How dangerous is Mexico? Mexico has long suffered with high levels of crime, with much of the violence linked to drug cartels. Femicide is increasingly a cause for concern but despite a growing movement to raise awareness of the issue, authorities have been unable to stop a rise in the killings.

"Nightclubs to shut in Wales after Boxing DayAnd social distancing will be a requirement in offices again, the Welsh government announces.","Social distancing will be a requirement again in response to Omicron Wales must brace itself for the ""storm of Omicron"", the first minister has warned. Nightclubs will close in Wales after 26 December in response to the rising number of cases of the variant. Social distancing will also be reintroduced in shops and workplaces. Mark Drakeford also said more decisions on Covid restrictions would be made on Monday - in particularwith regard to sports events. A return to other restrictions - like extended household bubbles and the rule of six in pubs - is not being ruled out after Christmas. As it happened: Friday's press conference Welsh festive sport verdict on Monday First estimate of booster jab impact on Omicron The first minister told BBC's Today programme: ""Wales is in the calm before the storm. We see the storm of Omicron coming our way and we need to prepare for it now."" He pleaded with people to have a smaller Christmas and issued guidance to people avoid meeting ""wider circles of friends"". The number of Omicron cases detected in Wales rose by 64 to 159 cases on Friday. It comes as the UK sawa record number of Covid casesfor a third day, exceeding 90,000. Mr Drakeford warned that London was already seeing an increase in people going to hospital with Covid. ""We have to be prepared for the same to happen here,"" he told a press conference. And he warned it was ""inescapable"" that a sharp increase in cases will impact the delivery of public services. Updated guidance will be issued for care home visits, and people on the shielding list will be written to with new advice on how to protect themselves. But it is not expected they will be asked to shield like at the start of the pandemic. The first minister said he had not introduced stricter measures immediately because the government's actions had to be ""proportionate and fair"" to everyone as Christmas was a ""special"" time of year. ""Our Omicron numbers are the lowest anywhere else in the UK,"" he said, adding providing people adhered to the latest advice given, a pathway had been created into Christmas. Business lobby group the CBI said the fresh restrictions on companies were a ""big setback"". Announcing a two-phased plan, the Welsh government said it was giving ""strong guidance"" for people to leave a day between social events and to meet outdoors over Christmas. But from 27 December new legal restrictions will come into force. What are the new Covid rules for Wales? How do I get a booster in Wales? Omicron: Is it milder despite dodging immunity? How can I tell I have Omicron? They include the two-metre rule in workplaces, and extra rules for businesses and services to protect customers and staff, such as limiting numbers in supermarkets, one-way systems and tighter controls at check-outs. Businesses will also be required to allow people to work from home wherever possible. Welsh ministers say they will make Â£60m available for firms impacted by the new restrictions. The cash is earmarked for January but is not designed to cover wages, as the furlough scheme did earlier in the pandemic. The Federation of Small Businesses welcomed the cash but demanded ""urgent clarity"" on whether it would be available to firms that have seen a loss of bookings ""at an alarming rate"". This video can not be played Covid help should not just be for England, says Mark Drakeford But Mr Drakeford said the ability to provide and sustain and longer-term support to businesses is ""severely constrained by the current position of the UK Treasury and its refusal to open vital support schemes, such as furlough"". Such schemes should be available for all UK nations when needed ""and not just at the point at when restrictions are introduced in England"", he added. Mr Drakeford said Omicron was the most serious development in the pandemic so far. ""People should think very carefully about who they are meeting and how they are meeting to keep themselves and others safe before Christmas,"" he added. In the run-up to Christmas, the Welsh government urged people to: Take a lateral flow test before going out, going Christmas shopping or visiting people Meet outdoors, or if meeting indoors ensure it is well ventilated Leave a day between social events Socially distance, wear a face covering and wash your hands Get vaccinated, and make getting a booster a priority if you have had an appointment The guidance does not go as far as Scotland where indoor social mixing is limited tothree households. The Welsh government appears to be caught between a rock and a hard place when it come to the imposition of additional Covid restrictions that they believe could be necessary to meet the threat the Omicron variant poses to the Welsh NHS. It seems clear that ministers believe that strict new restrictions should be introduced but, without UK treasury support for affected businesses, are wary of introducing measures that could hurt the already battered hospitality and retail sectors of the economy. All eyes will be on the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to see what help might be on offer but with the UK government already nursing a hangover after a backbench Commons rebellion on Covid passes, it seems unlikely that Downing Street will move as quickly and firmly as the Welsh government would like. While Welsh ministers probably do have the resources to offer some additional support for businesses, a new Covid wave could lead to increased financial pressure on the health and other public services as they seek to cover for staff absences and increased public demand. With ministerial meetings being held on an almost daily basis it seems unlikely that today's announcements are the last word on Christmas and new year restrictions - and more measures may well be announced in coming days. Nightclubs were reopened last summer Wales is the first UK nation to close a business sector in response to the Omicron wave. The decision to shut nightclubs means they will be closed for New Year's Eve. The Night Time Industries Association said it was ""angry and frustrated"" they had been singled out for closure and claimed there was a lack of evidence to show transmission of the virus was higher in nightspots. Chief executive Mike Kill said: ""We've implemented Covid passports and lateral flow tests even though it has cost us some trade so why are we being singled out and targeted? These further restrictions are a step too far. ""Isn't there a greater concern that people who would normally socialise on New Year's Eve will now displace to other unregulated settings without those controls?"" But the first minister said the decision ""is about protecting the health of people who otherwise would be putting themselves in harm's way"". Asked if the move punishes younger people, Mark Drakeford said: ""If you look at London and you look to see where the most rapid growth has been in the Omicron variant, it has been people in their twenties and thirties."" The announcement also sparked concern from Prof Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist at Swansea University. ""I don't want to sound like the Grinch but this is not going to stem the tide of Omicron cases in Wales - hospitalisations and hospital pressure will follow in weeks,"" he said. He argued that the minimum needed was what the Welsh government called""alert level one"",external- which would have seen a return to the rule of six indoors - with a brief break at Christmas. Sara Jones, Head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, urged customers to show ""consideration and patience"" as shops reintroduce measures, which are likely to reduce capacity. But Ian Price, CBI Wales director, said: ""As Omicron cases continue to rise it's only right the government prioritises public health, but fresh restrictions are a big setback for businesses, particularly in hospitality."" This video can not be played Care home staff say they are ""reliving"" first lockdown feelings Care homes in Wales said they are relieved visits are still allowed but feared another rise in cases would put extra strain on already ""tired"" staff. ""It's a balance to keep people safe but not take away that contact of visits,"" said Care Homes Wales chief executive Mary Wimbury. ""However some care homes are not just asking whether they have enough staff to manage visits, but are there enough staff to the care home running safely? ""Staff live in their local community and it's almost impossible to stop them catching the virus somehow. The worry is for their health but also the pressure it puts on the staff who are there and are very tired. ""Everyone is worried at how things will pan out."" Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh government needed to provide ""clarity"" on the money being offered to support businesses. He said the Welsh government had a lot more money available to help firms: ""There's Â£600m sitting in the Welsh government budget which is available to them to spend on COVID measures"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said all governments face a ""difficult balancing act"" in taking these decisions. ""We're in the position in Wales, fortunately at the moment, I think we have about 5% of the population and less than 1% of the confirmed Omicron cases. And that allows that breathing space in the run-up to Christmas, but obviously we are facing a very, very difficult situation thereafter."" The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said support for health services is also needed. ""The Liberal Democrats have called for a 6% rise in our wages to both health and care workers,"" she said.

North Shropshire: Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor Chatting to a few Tory MPs and ministers, there is a sense
that Boris Johnson is wounded but can survive, and probably has about four
months to sort things out. They expect to see changes to the personnel and the way
things work in Downing Street, and an attempt to sort out the whipsâ office â
which lots of MPs see as a major problem. They accept that the prime minister canât change his
character, but they think he could improve the way he runs his government. There is a concern that he has mistakenly assumed that his
80-seat majority in Parliament means he doesnât have to make the case for what
heâs doing to his own backbenchers. And there is a feeling he is isolated and lacks friends in
Parliament to form a protective ring around him in troubled times. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Tories losing North Shropshire by-election As we've been reporting, the Lib Dems have taken a seat held by the Tories for nearly two centuries. At the last election in 2019, the Conservatives won North Shropshire with a majority of almost 23,000 votes. They took 62.7% of the vote. This graphic gives you a sense of how dominant the Tories have been in the seat. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Tory backbench MP Philip Dunne, who represents a Shropshire seat, says today's by-election result is ""very disappointing"" but not ""that surprising"" for a party in government. He says the result was ""exacerbated by a series of negative stories coming out of Whitehall during the course of this by-election, some of which were self-inflicted"". Asked whether Boris Johnson still retains his appeal to voters, Dunne tells BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The challenge for him will be to make sure it is"". He adds that this will require the PM to deliver on his manifesto promises at the 2019 election, and ""ensuring that we don't have banana skins to slip up on inadvertently"". Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Boris Johnson is in a very precarious position.

If you're just joining us this Friday lunchtime - we're bringing you live and continuous coverage after the Liberal Democrats took the safe Conservative seat of North Shropshire following yesterday's by-election. The vote was called after the constituency's Tory MP Owen Paterson resigned from Parliament having been accused of breaking lobbying rules. Liberal Democrat Helen Morgan will now represent the largely rural constituency at Westminster, having won an almost 6,000-vote majority. Sophie Madden and Riyah CollinsBBC News, West Midlands As Helen Morgan swept the Lib Dems to victory with a 6,000-vote majority, what went wrong for the Conservatives in this ""true blue"" area? This is a quiet corner of England - only 80,000 people live within the geographically huge constituency. There are no cities, only a handful of market towns. During the election campaign, voters made clear what mattered to them was local issues: farming, the NHS and improving public transport and connectivity. Mrs Morgan, an accountant, lives in Harmer Hill, a village just south of Wem. The Conservative candidate Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst hails from Birmingham and many voters questioned whether he could truly understand what makes this rural constituency tick Continue readinghere. Lynne and Keith Edwards, from Wem, were in Oswestry for market day and told the BBC of their ""surprise"" at the result. Lynne said she thought the Conservative candidate, Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, would be elected ""with a reduced majority"". She added: ""I think they're [voters] very fed up with what's gone on in the last few weeks, I think the Conservative guy had a really difficult job and with all that's being going on in Westminster, the parties and things like that. ""I think people are sending a bit of a message that perhaps we are fed up and they're telling Boris [Johnson] we want something different."" But she added she thinks Helen Morgan winning is a ""temporary blip"". Keith said: ""There's been a lot of publicity around Boris in the last few weeks, that undoubtedly had some effect, but how much, I don't know."" Asked what they'd like their new MP to tackle, he said: ""We'd like some interest locally, there was a lot of comment about Dr Shastri-Hurst being from Birmingham, we both thought he was an impressive guy, but people were very much attached to somebody local."" Allegations of lockdown parties in Whitehall have been on the lips of plenty of voters in North Shropshire - and after her election win, Lib Dem MP Helen Morgan told the PM the ""party is over"". Asked by a reporter outside a local pub if she had any plans herself to have a victory party later, Morgan laughs and says: ""Only with my own family."" Boris Johnson said he is ""responsible for everything the government does"" after his party lost the former safe seat of North Shropshire in yesterday's by-election.. Thursdayâs win by Helen Morgan saw a Conservative majority of 23,000 turned into a 6,000-vote majority for the Liberal Democrats. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Tories losing North Shropshire by-election Asked whether he should resign if it would help the Conservative Party, the prime minister replies: ""what we're focusing on is getting the job done."" He says he is ""focused on"" speeding up the government's vaccination programme. ""I think that is what people would want me to be focused on right now,"" he adds. On whether he takes personal responsibility for the defeat,
Boris Johnson says he accepts his job is to âget the focusâ on what matters to
people. Pressed again on whether he was responsible, he adds: âIâm
responsible for everything the government does, of course I take personal
responsibilityâ. Asked later whether he accepts responsibility for his
botched attempt to change Commons lobbying rules - which is what prompted the
by-election - he replies: âI doâ. ""I think my job is to get over what we're doing more
effectively,"" he adds, accepting that the row over parties in Downing
Street last year has ""obstructed"" the task of informing voters about
the government's agenda. He says that over the last few weeks, people have been
hearing about a âconstant litany of stuff about politiciansâ, and not about
their priorities. Boris Johnson has given his first reaction to the North Shropshire result, telling reporters during a visit to a vaccination centre that it was a ""very disappointing"" night for his party. âI totally understand peopleâs frustrations, I hear what the
voters are saying,"" he adds. âIn all humility, Iâve got to accept that verdictâ. But as Sir Roger Gale speaks another senior Tory backbench MP, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, says the Conservative party has âgot to calm downâ despite the ""bad"" result in North Shropshire. âThis is not a morning when we want to be contemplating a
big blame game, or a big change â we need to just work out what we need to do
in the future,"" he tells Sky News. Asked about Boris Johnson's position as leader, Clifton-Brown replies: âAt the moment I want him to succeed, I am giving him the benefit
of the doubt."" However, he says he wants the prime minister to ""think carefully how he governs this country"", and how to avoid repeating the ""self-inflicted own goals"" of recent months. BBC Newsnight's Lewis Goodall takes a look at what the North Shropshire by-election means for the Conservatives. This video can not be played More now from veteran Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale, who tells the BBC the by-election was ""a referendum on the performance of Downing Street"". Gale - who is an outspoken critic of the PM - says Johnson now has three weeks to ""get his house in order"" while Parliament breaks for Christmas. The North Thanet MP saysthe rebellion by 99 Tory MPsagainst a government vote this week showed the ""strength of feeling in Parliament"" - while this morning's result showed the strength of feeling in the country. Gale adds that people don't want or need a leadership election middle of the pandemic but says he would be surprised if Johnson fought the next election. Â© 2025 BBC.
