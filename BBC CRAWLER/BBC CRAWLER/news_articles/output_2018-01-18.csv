Breaking|Breaking newsCalifornia children 'chained for months'California prosecutors detail allegations of horrific abuse by parents of 13 children held in shackles.1ma minute agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played David Turpin (R) and his wife Louise Turpin (L) deny charges of torture The parents accused of holding their 13 children in shackles at a California home have pleaded not guilty. David Turpin, 56, and Louise Turpin, 49, are facing charges of torture, abuse and false imprisonment. They were arrested after one daughter escaped from their home, where police later found some siblings chained to beds and severely malnourished. The couple appeared in court hours after prosecutors detailed the horrific abuse allegations against them. Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said the couple had allegedly punished their children by tying them up - first using ropes and later chaining them to their beds with padlocks. He said the alleged punishments would last weeks or months, and intensified over time. The 'happy family' charged with torture Prosecutors said circumstantial evidence showed the children were not released from their chains to go to the toilet. The teenager who escaped and alerted police to the house where her siblings were held captive had been hatching a plan to leave for two years, Mr Hestrin added. He detailed some of the gruesome allegations against the parents at a news conference on Thursday. The children were accustomed to frequent beatings, including strangulation They were only allowed one shower a year The children would stay awake all night until going to sleep at four or five in the morning and slept during the day They were not allowed to play with any toys but many were found inside the house in their original packaging If the children washed their hands above the wrist they were subjected to punishments, allegedly accused of ""playing with water"" The Turpin parents allowed their children to eat only one meal a day but the parents would sometimes buy food, like pumpkin pies, and place it where the children could see it but not eat it They have never seen a dentist and haven't visited a doctor in over four years The children lack basic knowledge of life, and did not know who a police officer was This video can not be played Shackled siblings: What we know about their lives James Cook, BBC News, Riverside, California This case has sent waves of revulsion across the US and beyond, and the small courtroom was packed as the defendants appeared. David and Louise Turpin were smartly dressed. They occasionally glanced at each other across a table weighed down by a copy of the California penal code and a sheaf of paper related to the case against them. A lawyer sat between them. Mr Turpin, with a distinctive mop of grey hair, was chained around the waist, his stomach protruding from beneath the metal links. His wife's mouth was turned down in a glum expression. The couple spoke only briefly and softly to confirm that they understood and accepted procedural details relating to their next hearing. The charges they deny are among the most serious any parent could face: amounting to a grievous betrayal of their own children, a betrayal which prosecutors allege went on for years, if not decades. The siblings themselves are said to be doing well but at least some of them have almost certainly suffered irreparable damage, both physical and mental from their ordeal. The children, who are aged between two and 29 , have been treated in hospital since being freed on Monday. The two-year-old was of normal weight but the other children were severely malnourished, authorities said. The 12-year-old weighed as much as an average seven-year-old and the 29-year-old weighed only 82lb (37kg). Several of the children have cognitive impairment and ""neuropathy, which is nerve damage, as a result of this extreme and prolonged physical abuse"", Mr Hestrin said. District Attorney Mike Hestrin said the couple chained their children as a form of punishment Though little is known about their education, some of the children were able to read and write.Mr Turpin also registered a private school in their California home, known as Sandcastle Day School. Police have obtained hundreds of journals that the children were allowed to write in and are looking through them for evidence. Before moving to California, the family lived in Texas. At one point, the parents allegedly lived in a different house from their children and would drop off food from time to time, officials said. If found guilty of the dozens of charges against them, the couple face 94 years to life in prison, Mr Hestrin added. Mr Turpin also faces one count of ""lewd act on a child under 14 years of age"". Can anyone open a school at home in California? The 13 children were found in an emaciated state in their filthy, foul-smelling house, police revealed earlier. Officers had at first thought all the children were minors but later realised some were frail and malnourished adults, they said. Mr Hestrin said that when officers arrived, three of the couple's children were chained to their beds. 12 counts of torture 1 count against David Turpin of a lewd act on a child 7 counts of abuse against a dependent adult 6 counts of child abuse/neglect 12 counts of false imprisonment Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Wolf escaped 'after gate left open',"This video can not be played The wolf, called Torak, was recaptured after about six hours on the run A wolf which went on the loose for about six hours after escaping from its enclosure has been safely recaptured. The animal, called Torak, was initially thought to have fled from the Wolf Conservation Trust's site in Beenham after strong winds damaged fencing. The sanctuary has now said his enclosure gate may have been left open deliberately. Thames Valley Police said the wolf travelled about eight miles before it was caught near the M4 motorway. The force announced Torak's capture at about 13:40 GMT. A spokesperson said: ""It was safely detained by officers and staff from the sanctuary, who had been working to recapture it.""

Teresa Palmer, who founded the sanctuary in Berkshire, helped encourage the 12-year-old wolf into a caged trailer. She said the gate at the front of Torak's enclosure was open. ""I think somebody deliberately opened the gate. A lot of people don't particularly believe in having animals in captivity."" Ms Palmer added: ""When we were near the wolf trust I was close to him but he was frightened and didn't want to be caught. ""The fact he went through a field of sheep shows he never would have been a danger to the public. ""Now he's given up. He's had his moment of freedom now."" Police tracked Torak from a helicopter with thermal imaging An animal capture expert who was tracking Torak said police would have shot to kill if the wolf had run on to the motorway. Mike Allison, from Animal Capture UK, said: ""That would have been the only option available to prevent human injury or loss of life."" But he added that Torak ""looks the most unaggressive wolf I have ever seen"". The animal fled from the Wolf Conservation Trust site in Beenham It's relief all round here in the village of Curridge where the wolf has been found and, more importantly, not a single shot fired. A dedicated team of animal catchers was on hand to fire a tranquiliser dart and were thankfully not needed. The Wolf Conservation Trust owners managed to bring Torak back into care safe and well. Dog owners who were out for a stroll near me have been asking if it's now safe to walk around here and the answer is yes. Life can get back to normal in this quaint little corner of Berkshire. Thames Valley Police earlier put out a text warning to residents and schools in Berkshire, urging them to stay inside. Officers had also advised members of the public not to approach the wolf if they saw it. After the wolf was captured, a spokesperson said: ""Schools, which were asked to keep pupils indoors, no longer need to do this."" Thames Valley Police sent local residents a text message warning of the wolf on the loose Torak had been spotted at various locations, some more than 10 miles to the west of the sanctuary. Local resident Daniel Brownlie told the BBC he ignored the wolf warning. He said: ""I had a local surgery appointment this morning as I'm off to Malawi at the end of the month. It was a decision between getting malaria tablets or getting eaten by a wolf. I took the risk."" One parent, Tony Roe, had earlier said police officers were outside his child's local primary school by 08:30 to usher pupils inside. He said: ""An officer on the school gate told me a wolf had escaped after wind blew down part of the fence.""

Government warned over 'dangerous' jail,"The category B prison is situated just north of the city centre and holds about 1060 inmates. The government has been ordered to make immediate improvements to Nottingham Prison after it was warned the jail was in a ""dangerous state"". The Chief Inspector of Prisons issued Justice Secretary David Gauke with an""urgent notification letter"",externaldemanding action within 28 days. This is the first time the process has been used since it was set up in November. Mr Gauke said an action plan would be published within the timeframe set. Live updates from the East Midlands It is thought eight inmates have killed themselves there in the past two years. Levels ofself-harm have also risen significantly. In his letter, the chief inspector Peter Clarke told Mr Gauke there would be ""further tragedies"" unless safety measures were put in place. He said he issued the urgent notification as it was the third time in a row that prison inspectors found the jail to be ""fundamentally unsafe"". Sharon Whitford's son Marc Maltby killed himself just days after starting a four-month sentence at the prison last year - the fifth death in a month. She toldRadio 4's Today programmeher son told her conditions were ""horrible"", with prisoners harming themselves, not getting food on time, living in ""mucky"" cells and not having attention paid to them by guards. ""It was uncontrollable - people were taking drugs, they were easy to get, and basically nobody really cared,"" she said. Ms Whitford explained there was ""no indication"" over how vulnerable her son's mental health was, and she is still waiting to find out the full details of how he died. ""When they're sent to prison it's for their own good and to keep them out of trouble and to keep them out of danger,"" she said. ""Obviously that's not being done, because my son's not coming home."" Under the ""urgent notification"" procedure, the justice secretary has to publicly commit to respond to the concerns raised within 28 days. The response must explain how outcomes for prisoners will be improved in the immediate and longer term. Justice Secretary David Gauke said prison officer numbers had been boosted Nottingham Prison, which is run by the public sector, opened in 1890 but was extensively modernised in 2010. It currently holds about 1,000 men. Mr Clarke wrote: ""Inspection findings at HMP Nottingham tell a story of dramatic decline since 2010."" He said there was ""irrefutable evidence"" of a failure to respond the previous inspection findings and it was ""extraordinary"" there had not been a more ""robust"" response. More than two-thirds of men at the jail said they had felt unsafe in the prison at some time. The former Scotland Yard counter-terrorism chief, who took over at the inspectorate two years ago, said there was no shortage of prison officers at Nottingham but more than half the staff had less than one year's experience. He said the jail needed ""urgent support"" from the Prison Service to ""build up competence, capability and resilience"". He said: ""It appears that the problems at Nottingham are intractable and that staff there are unable to improve safety despite the fact that this failing increases the vulnerability both of those who are held in the prison and of those who work there."" Mr Gauke said the chief inspector rightly identified the ""very difficult challenges and circumstances"" staff are facing at HMP Nottingham. He said: ""We have already provided more experienced staff to the prison and boosted the number of prison officers by more than 100. ""I will be looking closely at the issues faced by the prison and will publish an action plan within 28 days which will urgently drive improvement required.""

Trump denies changing view on Mexico wallThe president fires off tweets after his chief of staff had said campaign promises had evolved.1h40 minutes agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Testing began in December on President Trump's border wall prototypes Donald Trump has denied changing his views on a border wall after his top aide reportedly said the president was ""uninformed"" when he made the promise. White House chief of staff John Kelly told Fox News the president's opinions had evolved since his signature campaign pledge on the US-Mexico wall. Hours later, the president tweeted to say Mexico would still ""directly or indirectly"" pay for the wall. Mexico's foreign ministry said Thursday morning that the country would not pay. They also pushed back against Mr Trump's claim that Mexico is the ""most dangerous country in the world"". ""Even though Mexico has a significant problem with violence, it is plainly false that Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world,"" the ministry said. US media report that the White House chief of staff told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Wednesday that the US would never construct a wall along its entire southern border. Mr Kelly also reportedly said Mexico would never pay for the structure, as Mr Trump has repeatedly vowed. ""Campaigning is very different from governing,"" Mr Kelly said on Wednesday, of Mr Trump's former promise. But speaking to Fox News later the retired general insisted the president was committed to building 700 miles (1,100km) of additional wall along the nearly 2,000-mile border. Last year Mr Trump said his wall would cover 1,000 miles with natural obstacles taking care of the rest. John Kelly (L) was appointed as President Trump's chief of staff in July When Fox News asked Mr Kelly if he had called the president ""uninformed"", he did not deny it. Both the president and his chief of staff cited the estimated cost as $20bn (Â£14bn); Mr Trump had originally put the figure at $10-$12bn. Six things that could topple Trump's wall Mr Kelly said they were now looking at alternative ways to raise funds, including via possible visa fees or renegotiating theNafta trade dealbetween the US, Canada and Mexico. In Thursday morning's tweet, President Trump insisted Mexico would still pick up the costs, possibly ""through longer term reimbursement"". Allow Twitter content?

Body in freezer jury shown WhatsApp 'row',"Celine Dookhran was found dead in an empty house in Kingston Upon Thames A builder who raped and slashed the throat of his niece before ""stuffing"" her inside a freezer had a WhatsApp row with his wife while on the run from police, a court heard. Mujahid Arshid, 33, denies the rape and murder of 20-year-old Celine Dookhran. The court heard that during the messaging app exchange, his wife told him: ""You're dead to me"", to which he replied: ""So is Celine apparently."" Ms Dookhran was found on 19 July 2017 in a house in south-west London. The message exchange was read out at the Old Bailey by prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC as he outlined the case against the defendant. Mr Arshid is also accused of raping and trying to kill another woman in her 20s who cannot be identified for legal reasons. He enlisted the help of labourer Vincent Tappu, 28, to kidnap both women and bundle them bound and gagged into the boot of his pick-up truck, before driving them to a six-bedroom house he was renovating, the court was told. The surviving woman escaped and led police to Ms Dookhran's bloodied body at the empty house. Mujahid Arshid (left) and Vincent Tappu are charged with kidnapping Ms Dookhran and the second woman Mr Aylett QC told the court how officers used a crowbar to open a chest-height freezer at the property between Wimbledon and Kingston and discovered ""several toes poking out"" from underneath a dust sheet. He said Ms Dookhran was found ""face down"" in the freezer at an ""awkward angle consistent with her having been stuffed inside"", her arms covered in blood. ""Her body was extremely cold"" and she had ""obviously [been] dead for some time,"" Mr Aylett told the court. The court heard Mr Arshid was ""sexually fixated"" with both women and spent weeks planning his attacks. He and co-defendant Mr Tappu both deny the kidnap of Ms Dookhran and the second woman, conspiracy to falsely imprison them both, and possessing a firearm with intent, namely a Taser. Mr Tappu is accused of assisting in the initial kidnap, but is not said to have travelled to Kingston. Mr Arshid, of no fixed address, is further charged with sexual assault and assault by penetration against the second female. The trial continues.

'Warmest year without El NiÃ±o',"Manmade climate change is now dwarfing the influence of natural trends on the climate, scientists say. Last year was the second or third hottest year on record - after 2016 and on a par with 2015, the data shows. But those two years were affected by El NiÃ±o - the natural phenomenon centred on the tropical Pacific Ocean which works to boost temperatures worldwide. Take out this natural variability and 2017 would probably have been the warmest year yet, the researchers say. The acting director of theUK Met Office,external, Prof Peter Stott, told BBC News: ""It's extraordinary that temperatures in 2017 have been so high when there's no El NiÃ±o. In fact, weâve been going into cooler La NiÃ±a conditions. ""Last year was substantially warmer than 1998 which had a very big El NiÃ±o. ""It shows clearly that the biggest natural influence on the climate is being dwarfed by human activities â predominantly COâ emissions."" What is climate change? Record year for US natural disasters Coral reefs head for 'knock-out punch' El NiÃ±o sees higher sea-surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific which boosts warmth worldwide Figures were published on Thursday by the worldâs three main agencies monitoring global temperatures: the UK Met Office and the two US organisations - theUS space agency (Nasa),externalandNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa),external. Their datasets are compiled from many thousands of temperature measurements taken across the globe, from all continents and all oceans. Temperatures for 2017 and 2015 are virtually identical. Nasa rates 2017 the second hottest year, and Noaa and the Met Office judge it to be the third hottest since records began in 1850. The Met OfficeHadCRUT4 global temperature series,externalshows that 2017 was 0.99C (Â±0.1C) above ""pre-industrial"" levels â thatâs taken as the average over the period 1850-1900. It was 0.38 (Â±0.1C) above the 1981-2010 average. The Exeter-based agency calculates that the El NiÃ±o event spanning 2015-2016 contributed around 0.2C to the annual average for 2016. But that influence was gone by 2017. Nasa has done an additional statistical analysis that corrects its dataset for the effects of El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a - to smooth out the ""lumps and bumps"" these patterns introduce into the long-term trend. When this is done, 2017 becomes the warmest year on record. Nasa's Dr Gavin Schmidt said this ""idealised scenario"" underscored the central message: ""The warmth that we're seeing, and the trends that we're seeing, are independent of this variation in the Pacific and while the ins and outs of any particular year are affected by it - it's the long-term trend that's really pushing these numbers up."" Nasa says it is possible statistically to remove the natural warming and cooling effects that come from El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a. When this smoothing is done (red line), 2017 comes out warmer than any previous year. The grey columns denote major volcanic eruptions that ordinarily depress the warming trend. The World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said the long-term temperature trend was far more important than the ranking of individual years. ""That trend is an upward one,"" he said. âSeventeen of the 18 warmest years on record have all been during this century, and the degree of warming during the past three years has been exceptional. âArctic warmth has been especially pronounced and this will have profound and long-lasting repercussions on sea levels, and on weather patterns in other parts of the world.â Prof Tim Osborn from the University of East Anglia said climate models were now accurately predicting which places would warm fastest. He explained: âWeâre seeing greater warming over land and in the Arctic regions, and less warming in the sub-polar oceans. âThese are what we expect from our understanding of climate physics, and this is what we observe.â He said uncertainties arising from incomplete global coverage of weather stations had been included in the calculations. Last year was notable for some very extreme weather events, says Noaa Commenting on the figures, Bob Ward, from the Grantham Institute at the London School of Economics, pointed out that this year governments were due to start assessing the gap between their collective ambitions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the goals of the Paris climate agreement, to stabilise temperature rise below 2C, and as close to 1.5 as possible. âThe record temperature should focus the minds of world leaders, including President Trump, on the scale and urgency of the risks that people, rich and poor, face around the world from climate change,"" he said. Earlier this week, a study in the journal Nature concluded that climate change needed urgently to be tackled, but forecast that apocalyptic predictions of a temperature rise of 6C by 2100 would not come about. Prof Richard Allan from the University of Reading said: âRather than warming being inconsequential or catastrophic, as some have suggested, we can be sure societies are facing a dangerous temperature rise, but one which we still have time to fix. âThe conclusions confirm that human-caused climate change is a serious concern. âBut if we act now with sustained and substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, societies will still be able to avoid much of the most dangerous climate change predicted by computer simulations.â Other temperature analyses exist apart from the ""big three"", but these all tell broadly the same narrative. The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting issued its bulletin on 4 January.It called 2017 as the second warmest on record,external.

Deadly storm hits Netherlands and Germany,"This video can not be played Hurricane-strength gusts of up to 140km/h (90mph) caused transport chaos Eight people including two firefighters have been killed in storm-related accidents as hurricane-strength winds tear across northern Europe. Both firefighters were helping with clean-up efforts in Germany when they died. Many of those killed, in the Netherlands and in Germany, were hit by falling trees and debris. One died in a collision when his van was blown on to the other side of the road. The storm has now crossed to Poland. Facing gusts of up to 140km/h (90mph), Germany's train operator Deutsche Bahn cancelled all long-distance services for the rest of Thursday. Many regional services were also cancelled. Flights at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam - one of the busiest in Europe - were briefly suspended and two of its three departure halls were closed after roof plates were blown off the terminal building. In pictures: Storm rips through Europe People arriving at Schiphol told reporters they had experienced rough landings with some passengers around them throwing up. The storm, called Friederike in Germany, crossed the country from west to east before reaching Poland. This video can not be played As the storm heads eastward it will mix with snowfall, says the BBC Weather Centre's Sarah Keith-Lucas It caused high winds in the UK on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, bringing down trees and knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes. Meteorologists in Germany - where 65,000 homes are reportedly without power - warned people to stay indoors, and many schools are closed. Deutsche Bahn had already suspended rail traffic,externalin North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), neighbouring Rhineland-Palatinate state and Lower Saxony, when it announced a Germany-wide suspension of long-distance trains. Any regional trains still running have cut their speed because of the strong winds. A spokesman said it was the ""right decision"" due to the risk of trees falling on overhead wires and on tracks. Many domestic flights have also been cancelled. An emergency siren wailed in the city of Duisburg,external, warning residents that they should stay indoors, German news website WDR reported. Fierce winds blew this lorry's tarpaulin off on the motorway in Germany Twitter users posted photos of trucks and trees blown over by the gales. Many trees came down on railway lines. Police temporarily closed the centre of Almere, a Dutch city with about 200,000 residents lying just east of Amsterdam. They tweeted an alert warning people to stay at home because of risk from the storm. These cyclists in Rotterdam gave up trying to pedal through the storm A national transport website, VID, reported that at least 17 trucks had been blown over by the strong winds. The Dutch Railways (NS) and operator ProRail said overhead power lines had been damaged by the wind, as well as some railway tracks. An alert on the NS website said that ""at most, only a few trains"" would run throughout the evening.

Wolf escaped 'after gate left open'The animal is captured six hours after escaping from its enclosure at a conservation trust.13m13 minutes agoBerkshire,"This video can not be played The wolf, called Torak, was recaptured after about six hours on the run A wolf which went on the loose for about six hours after escaping from its enclosure has been safely recaptured. The animal, called Torak, was initially thought to have fled from the Wolf Conservation Trust's site in Beenham after strong winds damaged fencing. The sanctuary has now said his enclosure gate may have been left open deliberately. Thames Valley Police said the wolf travelled about eight miles before it was caught near the M4 motorway. The force announced Torak's capture at about 13:40 GMT. A spokesperson said: ""It was safely detained by officers and staff from the sanctuary, who had been working to recapture it.""

Teresa Palmer, who founded the sanctuary in Berkshire, helped encourage the 12-year-old wolf into a caged trailer. She said the gate at the front of Torak's enclosure was open. ""I think somebody deliberately opened the gate. A lot of people don't particularly believe in having animals in captivity."" Ms Palmer added: ""When we were near the wolf trust I was close to him but he was frightened and didn't want to be caught. ""The fact he went through a field of sheep shows he never would have been a danger to the public. ""Now he's given up. He's had his moment of freedom now."" Police tracked Torak from a helicopter with thermal imaging An animal capture expert who was tracking Torak said police would have shot to kill if the wolf had run on to the motorway. Mike Allison, from Animal Capture UK, said: ""That would have been the only option available to prevent human injury or loss of life."" But he added that Torak ""looks the most unaggressive wolf I have ever seen"". The animal fled from the Wolf Conservation Trust site in Beenham It's relief all round here in the village of Curridge where the wolf has been found and, more importantly, not a single shot fired. A dedicated team of animal catchers was on hand to fire a tranquiliser dart and were thankfully not needed. The Wolf Conservation Trust owners managed to bring Torak back into care safe and well. Dog owners who were out for a stroll near me have been asking if it's now safe to walk around here and the answer is yes. Life can get back to normal in this quaint little corner of Berkshire. Thames Valley Police earlier put out a text warning to residents and schools in Berkshire, urging them to stay inside. Officers had also advised members of the public not to approach the wolf if they saw it. After the wolf was captured, a spokesperson said: ""Schools, which were asked to keep pupils indoors, no longer need to do this."" Thames Valley Police sent local residents a text message warning of the wolf on the loose Torak had been spotted at various locations, some more than 10 miles to the west of the sanctuary. Local resident Daniel Brownlie told the BBC he ignored the wolf warning. He said: ""I had a local surgery appointment this morning as I'm off to Malawi at the end of the month. It was a decision between getting malaria tablets or getting eaten by a wolf. I took the risk."" One parent, Tony Roe, had earlier said police officers were outside his child's local primary school by 08:30 to usher pupils inside. He said: ""An officer on the school gate told me a wolf had escaped after wind blew down part of the fence.""

TV stars settle hacking claimsVic Reeves and Kate Thornton agree compensation with News Group Newspapers before going to court.3h3 hours agoUK,"Jim Moir, also known as Vic Reeves, and TV presenter Kate Thornton were among the phone hacking claimants The publishers of The Sun and the defunct News of the World have settled more claims for phone hacking. News Group Newspapers offered payments to Coronation Street actor Jimmi Harkishin, TV presenter Kate Thornton, comedian Vic Reeves and former Spice Girls manager Chris Herbert. The four claims were due to be heard at the High Court but were abandoned after payouts were offered. The alleged victims said the papers gathered information unlawfully. According to the claimants, journalists at the News of the World and the Sun used phone hacking and ""blagging"" - tricking businesses into releasing confidential information - to find stories about them. The four claimants said this led to the publication of 79 articles that they disputed. Reeves' claim was made was under his real name of Jim Moir. News Group Newspapers (NGN) has denied that phone hacking took place at The Sun and made no admissions in the latest settlement. But a total of 23 hacking claims against the newspaper group have now been settled. Civil claims against NGN have been moving through the courts since 2012 and have resulted in four aborted trials, costing NGN millions in legal fees. BBC home affairs producer Gaetan Portal, who was at the High Court, said that each of these latest cases incurred fees of about Â£450,000 to Â£500,000, on top of compensation believed to be a six-figure sum for each claim. Jimmi Harkishin has played local entrepreneur Dev Alahan in Coronation Street since 1999 As well as the four named cases, the court was due to hear two ""generic"" claims involving phone hacking at The Sun and allegations that senior executives at NGN conspired to destroy documents, computer equipment and millions of emails. It was alleged that James Murdoch, chairman of the company when it was known as News International, and chief executive Rebekah Brooks adopted a strategy to destroy materials in 2010 after they received court papers from lawyers representing the actress Sienna Miller. The destruction of emails allegedly continued into 2011 as the Metropolitan Police began its investigation into phone hacking. By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman ""It's deja vu all over again"" is a phrase attributed to the legendary American baseball coach Yogi Berra. It might also describe today's settlements. For six years, News Group Newspapers has settled claims for phone-hacking before they came to trial. Finally, the issue of whether the publisher is liable was due to be determined in a civil court with the cases due to start today... but it didn't. NGN has now settled around 1,000 civil claims for phone-hacking. If the cost estimate for a single claimant of Â£450,000 to Â£500,0000 given in court is typical, then the publisher is likely to have paid in the region of half a billion pounds in costs alone. Compensation payments would run into tens of millions more. And there are scores more claims in the pipeline including from Sir Elton John and the actor David Tennant. More concerning for NG though are the so-called 'generic' claims being brought by 'various claimants' alleging concealment and destruction of evidence by senior executives. They are much more difficult to settle. NGN has always maintained that emails were deleted as part of their normal IT systems management. David Sherborne, representing the claimants, said they made serious allegations of criminality against James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks over the destruction of material. Mr Justice Mann criticised both parties for the way the cases had been handled. He said: ""Settlement is a good thingâ¦ even at the court doorsâ¦ however for test cases it raises different issues."" He said that the cases had been a chance to settle the wider issues of whether there had been a ""deliberate cover-up"" and illegal activity at The Sun.

Pienaar: Why good relations matter,"Could France be the bridge between the UK and the EU? Prime ministers and presidents must sometimes get sick of summits. The salutes, the handshakes and kisses - President Macron is, after all, French - and the inevitable communiquÃ©s about the close and cherished relationship with this or that country. The novelty must, surely, wear off after the first dozen times or so. But here at Sandhurst military academy, as we wait for President Macron and his entourage, it feels as though this UK-French gathering matters more than most. Deals will be struck on border control and military co-operation here, but the importance of this summit exceeds the sum of its parts. Extra Â£44m for Calais border security Frank Gardner: What now for security ties? Bayeux Tapestry to be displayed in UK Border co-operation at Calais matters to both countries, obviously. So does security. Britain and France are Europe's two foremost military powers, both have suffered appalling terrorist outrages and both share a commitment to fighting Islamist jihadism wherever it is found. It almost seems odd that the heads of the British and French intelligence and security services have not met at the same table before now. The practical co-operation under discussion and being pledged here matters too. President Macron was greeted by the PM at Sandhurst Forty four million pounds to beef up the Channel border doesn't sound like much as a proportion of public spending, and it isn't. But the fences and CCTV improvements and the rest will make a difference and demonstrate Britain's commitment to pulling its weight as Mr Macron insists. French demands for wider British support for the regional economy won't be settled here. Goodwill can only be expected to stretch so far. Likewise, the military co-operation is more than purely symbolic. Three British Chinook helicopters is not a huge commitment but it adds a heavy lifting capacity the French lack in Mali, in their long-running confrontation with Islamist fighters. And yet there is much more at stake than the items on Thursday's agenda. The 11th Century Bayeux Tapestry portrays the invasion of England by William the Conqueror in 1066. France and its president, arguably the most politically secure leader in the EU just now, will be crucial to Britain's prospects of getting a decent deal from the European Union on Brexit. Whatever that deal looks like - and as things stand, the final shape of Brexit is a matter of pure guesswork - the UK's relationship with France will be important in determining Britain's clout as a global player. France may like the idea of acting as a bridge between the EU and the UK. In much the same way Theresa May suggested Britain could act as a link between Europe and the USA - before the ""Special Relationship"" began to stutter somewhat. So getting on well with France - Britain's great rival and closest neighbour for time out of mind - matters more now than it has since before the UK joined what was then the European Common Market in 1973. Oh, and whatever the longer term significance of this summit, we do get to see the Bayeux Tapestry without having to go abroad.

May meets Macron after Calais cash offer,"This video can not be played President Macron: ""I respect Brexit although I regret it"" France and the UK have signed a treaty to speed up the processing of migrants in Calais, French President Emmanuel Macron announced on his first UK visit. After talks with UK PM Theresa May at Sandhurst military academy, he said the treaty would offer a ""more humane approach"" and be ""more efficient"". But he suggested France would not bow to UK demands to include financial services in any post-Brexit trade deal. Mrs May praised the ""uniquely close relationship"" between the two nations. She said both leaders remained committed to the ""Le Touquet"" border agreement in Calais - the UK has announced an extra Â£44.5m to be spent on beefing up Channel border security. John Pienaar: Why getting on well with France matters Smiling Macron and May pose for selfie What now for UK-France security relations? Mr Macron said the Sandhurst Treaty signed on Thursday - the first joint treaty on the Calais border in 15 years - would ""enable us to improve the relationship and the management of the joint border"" and reduce the time taken to process migrants. It would mean the time taken to process migrants hoping to come to the UK from Calais, would be reduced from six months to one month for adults and 25 days for children. It ""will enable us both to have a more humane approach to these people and to be more efficient"" while also encouraging trade through the Channel ports, said the president. Mrs May said it was in Britain's national interest, as well as France's, to commit more resources to Calais security and stressed the two countries' joint commitments to defence and security measures. She said a combined joint expeditionary force would be ready to deploy up to 10,000 troops ""quickly and effectively to face any threat"" by 2020. Bayeux Tapestry to be displayed in UK In depth: The meteoric rise of Macron And the prime minister said a multi-million pound deal to build 36 A380 passenger aircraft for Emirates Airlines had been signed by Airbus, which has plants in France and the UK. She also confirmed thatthe Bayeux Tapestry will come to the UK in 2022- a gesture President Macron said he hoped would ""open a new chapter when it comes to our cultural co-operation and scientific co-operation"". ""We are making a new tapestry together,"" he said. This video can not be played Bayeux Tapestry explained... by kids The summit between Mrs May and Mr Macron, at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Berkshire, also featured the first meeting of the heads of Britain and France's five intelligence agencies, and is being attended by British cabinet ministers and their French counterparts. And with Brexit very much on the agenda for both nations, Mr Macron said that the history between the two countries could not be ""impacted by changes in institutions"". Challenged about his opposition to including financial services in any EU-UK free trade agreement, he said: ""I am here neither to punish nor to reward. I want to make sure that the single market is preserved because that is very much the heart of the EU."" He said if the UK wanted access to the single market, including financial services, ""be my guest. But it means that you need to contribute to the budget and acknowledge European jurisdiction"". Mrs May said she recognised that there would be ""a different relationship in future"" but added: ""I think the City of London will continue to be a major global financial centre. That is an advantage not just for the UK, it's actually good for Europe and good for the global financial system."" Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has hinted at the prospect of a second crossing for the English Channel -tweeting,external: ""Our economic success depends on good infrastructure and good connections. Should the Channel Tunnel be just a first step?"" A source close to the foreign secretary told the BBC that Mr Johnson had suggested to President Macron that a new ""fixed link"" between UK and France was needed. Other commitments include the deployment of three RAF Chinook helicopters in Mali, where French forces are fighting Islamist militants, and France sending more troops to reinforce a British contingent in Estonia on Nato's border with Russia. Downing Street said the RAF Chinooks would offer a ""niche capability"", providing logistical support for the French operation in Mali, but that Britain would not be committing combat troops. During last year's French election campaign, Mr Macron said he wanted to renegotiate or scrap the 2003 Le Touquet agreement, which established French border controls in Britain and UK controls in Calais. The agreement means undocumented migrants barred from entering the UK stay in France - many in makeshift camps. Up to 700 migrants are in the area, despite the camp known as the ""Jungle"" having been dismantled in 2016. The UK government is already thought to have spent more than Â£100m on security in the area over the past three years, and officials said the number of illegal attempts to enter the UK fell from 80,000 in 2015 to just over 30,000 last year. Other ""juxtaposed"" border controls are in operation at Eurostar stations in France and Belgium. By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Britain and France carry much the same weight in global affairs. Both sit at the world's most exclusive tables of power - the Security Council and the G7 - and the sizes of their populations and economies are broadly similar too. But while President Macron commands France, including his parliament, after last year's stunning electoral successes - the same cannot be said of Theresa May. Sharp disagreements over the UK border with France are difficult to resolve. Mrs May has conceded extra money for border security in Calais - and has separately offered Chinook helicopters to move French troops more safely over Mali. Mr Macron, meanwhile, has offered the loan of the Bayeux tapestry. But Brexit still threatens to overshadow all this bonhomie. When it comes to Europe, these two countries are pulling in radically different directions.

What now for UK-France relations?,"RAF helicopters to Mali, French troops to Estonia, spy chiefs sharing intelligence. When it comes to defence and security, the Anglo-French entente cordiale has rarely been closer as their political leaders meet for their annual summit. Building on the Lancaster House agreement of 2010 between the two countries' then leaders, David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy,a landmark summit is now being held between Theresa May and President Macron of France. With the UK's looming departure from the EU, Brexit, trade and migration will inevitably feature in their discussions. The French president has been pushing for Britain to accept more migrants from Calais and to pay more towards the upkeep of the two countries' joint Channel border controls. Historically, this annual summit has always been about security and this year is no exception. The continuing threat from the Islamic State group, the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan and West Africa, Russia's actions in the Baltics and Ukraine and the emergence of transatlantic differences over certain key issues such as Iran, are all reminders of the need to shore up bilateral ties between London and Paris, ahead of Brexit. Britain may be leaving the EU but it will remain a heavyweight partner for France when it comes to security issues. Migrant crisis: France's Macron visits Calais amid tensions UK and France to work together to tackle online extremism How France's president made his mark on the world stage French political analyst Dominique Moisi says: ""We are close allies and we are rivals - and precisely because the UK is leaving the EU we may be even more rivals. ""But the international context forces us to come closer to resist terrorism because of the vacuum left by the US."" So, what are the defence and security issues up for discussion at Sandhurst? Britain and France have an incredibly close partnership in confronting the shared threat of terrorist attacks inspired or directed by so-called Islamic State. So close, in fact, that this is the first ever meeting of ""The Quint"" - the heads of all five British and French spy agencies, both domestic and foreign. They will be discussing, among other things, the lessons learnt from last year's terror attacks in Manchester, Barcelona and London. There is a permanent 'open door' for French intelligence officers who need to visit MI5 headquarters at Thames House in London and a similar arrangement exists for British case officers visiting France's equivalent, the Direction GÃ©nÃ©rale de la SÃ©curitÃ© IntÃ©rieure (DGSI). MI5 officers were rushed to Paris in the wake of the 2015 Bataclan attack to help follow up intelligence leads and glean any possible lessons. As well as bilateral links like this, the primary mechanism for sharing intelligence between European partners is the Counter Terrorism Group (CTG). Heads of European agencies meet at least once a year, their subordinates more often. The concern over Brexit has long been the risk that Britain could be denied access to certain EU bodies, such as Europol. In fact, say insiders, the business of counter-terrorism is likely to continue as usual. Sir Julian King, EU Security Commissioner in Brussels, told me in October that the terrorist threat facing all of Europe was so great that no-one wanted to take any risks by reducing counter-terrorism cooperation with London. Theresa May, who was Home Secretary for six years until she became PM in 2016, will be keen to see this intelligence-sharing with Paris maintained and even increased. Lord Peter Ricketts, who was both national security adviser and then UK ambassador to Paris until 2016, says Anglo-French co-operation has improved dramatically since 2000. ""From what I saw as ambassador in Paris, the two counter-terrorism communities and law enforcement communities are now finding they've got things to learn from each other so it is not nearly as polarised as it was 15 years ago,"" he said. Despite recent UK defence cuts, Britain and France remain far ahead of other European nations when it comes to deploying combat forces overseas. In Mali and other Saharan nations, French forces have been battling a jihadist insurgency for five years. They've asked for British help, and now they are about to get it. Britain is to send three RAF Chinook transport helicopters to support the French operation in Mali, along with 50-60 support staff. French political analyst Dominique Moisi says: ""France wants to share responsibility with other European powers, convincing them that the Sahel is becoming a primary objective in the fight against terrorism, as it is receding in Syria and Iraq after the defeat against ISIS."" As if by way of return, France is to send troops to join the UK-led battle group in Estonia where 800 British soldiers are helping to guard Nato's eastern flank with Russia. This is all part of a growing military alliance between Europe's only two nuclear powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council. The two nations are working on a joint Unmanned Aerial System for future drones. A French Brigadier was put in charge of a UK division for two months while a British Army Brigadier did the same in France. Joint exercises are being held with a view to building up a combined intervention force of 10,000 troops by 2020. There is a precedent for that, which did not end well: Libya. The Nato air campaign in 2011 was initially successful, driving back the forces of Colonel Gaddafi which threatened to massacre the residents of Benghazi. Mr Cameron and Mr Sarkozy were briefly feted as saviours of that North African nation. Thereafter Libya deteriorated into chaos, and Western nations were reluctant to get drawn into any kind of occupation role after the experience in Iraq. So the end-result of any future interventions, whether in the Middle East, Asia or Africa, will need to be very carefully thought out. The cross-channel co-operation on domestic counter-terrorism is matched to some extent by the links between MI6 and its French counterpart, the DGSE. The UK's closest intelligence-gathering partner remains the US but it also has strong bilateral arrangements with France, Germany, Spain and other European nations' agencies. A former British intelligence officer says that old Anglo-French rivalries overseas had given way to shared goals. He said there was a common desire for Britain's expertise, such as in cyber, to remain accessible to European agencies after Brexit, effectively ring-fencing intelligence and counter-terrorism from ongoing arguments in other areas such as trade and migration. There is Brexit, says a Whitehall insider, and then there is security.

Drivers in Scotland and northern England were advise not to travel at all for part of the night. Meanwhile, in southern England, Essex Police tweeted this image, explaining the driver of this vehicle narrowly avoided injury on Mersea Road in Colchester. Overnight high winds caused a tree to fall on the white BMW (left of picture) in the early hours of Thursday morning in Chigwell, Essex. Graham Warnes was driving the red truck (right of picture) and says he drove through the top of the tree immediately after it came down. Both vehicles are write-offs but Graham says he and the other driver were lucky to walk away unhurt. Foleshill Community Fire Station also shared images from this scene in Coventry where the gable end of a three-storey townhouse was blown off as gusts of up to 83mph (134 kph) hit the country overnight. ""Luckily no injuries,"" they tweeted. The storm caused transport delays in parts of the UK. Rail company Greater Anglia tweeted this image of a tree down on a line between Stowmarket and Norwich. Greater Anglia advised people not to travel between Norwich and Ipswich, and from Marks Tey to Sudbury. Norfolk saw power cut off to more than 20,000 properties. A tree was also brought down near Greenwich Park in London, which fell through a wall and landed on a car on the other side, while a train hit a tree a few miles south in Sydenham. The area around the car and the fallen tree was cordoned off. In Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, Mark Reynolds says he woke to a horrendous sound early this morning and found his large poplar tree had come down on top of his childrenâs trampoline and swing.

Woman's body 'stuffed in freezer',"Celine Dookhran was found dead in an empty house in Kingston Upon Thames A builder who raped and slashed the throat of his niece before ""stuffing"" her inside a freezer had a WhatsApp row with his wife while on the run from police, a court heard. Mujahid Arshid, 33, denies the rape and murder of 20-year-old Celine Dookhran. The court heard that during the messaging app exchange, his wife told him: ""You're dead to me"", to which he replied: ""So is Celine apparently."" Ms Dookhran was found on 19 July 2017 in a house in south-west London. The message exchange was read out at the Old Bailey by prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC as he outlined the case against the defendant. Mr Arshid is also accused of raping and trying to kill another woman in her 20s who cannot be identified for legal reasons. He enlisted the help of labourer Vincent Tappu, 28, to kidnap both women and bundle them bound and gagged into the boot of his pick-up truck, before driving them to a six-bedroom house he was renovating, the court was told. The surviving woman escaped and led police to Ms Dookhran's bloodied body at the empty house. Mujahid Arshid (left) and Vincent Tappu are charged with kidnapping Ms Dookhran and the second woman Mr Aylett QC told the court how officers used a crowbar to open a chest-height freezer at the property between Wimbledon and Kingston and discovered ""several toes poking out"" from underneath a dust sheet. He said Ms Dookhran was found ""face down"" in the freezer at an ""awkward angle consistent with her having been stuffed inside"", her arms covered in blood. ""Her body was extremely cold"" and she had ""obviously [been] dead for some time,"" Mr Aylett told the court. The court heard Mr Arshid was ""sexually fixated"" with both women and spent weeks planning his attacks. He and co-defendant Mr Tappu both deny the kidnap of Ms Dookhran and the second woman, conspiracy to falsely imprison them both, and possessing a firearm with intent, namely a Taser. Mr Tappu is accused of assisting in the initial kidnap, but is not said to have travelled to Kingston. Mr Arshid, of no fixed address, is further charged with sexual assault and assault by penetration against the second female. The trial continues.

Pope marries couple on Chile flight,"The couple asked Pope Francis to simply bless their marriage, but he had other ideas Pope Francis has made history by performing a wedding ceremony for two flight attendants on board a plane travelling between cities in Chile. Paula Podest Ruiz, 39, and Carlos Ciuffardi Elorriga, 41, had been married earlier in a civil service but asked the Pope to bless their marriage. ""Do you want me to marry you?"" he said. The couple said they were unable to conduct a ceremony in their church in the Chilean capital, Santiago, after it was damaged in an earthquake in 2010. Pope Francis suggested performing the brief ceremony on his short flight from Santiago to the city of Iquique in northern Chile.

On Wednesday, Pope Francis visited the city of Temuco in Chile's southern Araucania region, where he called for unity in one of the country's longest-running conflicts. In a public address, the pontiff said that ""destructive violence"" between the indigenous Mapuche people and the state was not the answer. The region has experienced conflict for centuries, sparked by issues including ancestral land ownership and legal recognition for the Mapuche language and culture. Pope Francis has also used his trip to meet victims of sexual abuse by priests in Chile. He is wrapping up his visit to the country on Thursday with an open-air mass celebration in Iquique, before heading to Peru for the final leg of his two-nation trip.

Dylan Farrow: 'Allen's been lying so long',"Farrow said she was ""traumatised"" by the alleged event Dylan Farrow says she wishes Woody Allen had been charged over allegations he sexually abused her as a child. ""He's lying and he's been lying for so long,"" she told CBS's This Morning, inher first TV interview,externalabout her adoptive father. Allen repeated his denial of the claims and issued a new statement on Thursday saying: ""I never molested my daughter."" Several actors have recently distanced themselves from Allen, as Hollywood's sexual harassment scandal continues. Dylan Farrow: Outrage after 'years of being ignored' Farrow has long alleged that Allen sexually abused her when she was seven, in her mother Mia's country house. Allen said in his statement: ""Even though the Farrow family is cynically using the opportunity afforded by the Time's Up movement to repeat this discredited allegation, that doesn't make it any more true today than it was in the past."" Dylan said her mother Mia Farrow urged her to ""tell the truth"" In the CBS interview, Farrow said she was giving the interview because ""I want to show my face and tell my story. I want to speak out, literally."" She repeated her allegation that that on 4 August, 1992, ""I was taken to a small attic crawl space in my mother's country house in Connecticut by my father"". She said: ""He instructed me to lay down on my stomach and play with my brother's toy train that was set up. And he sat behind me in the doorway and as I played with the toy train, I was sexually assaulted."" Film director Allen was never charged, and Farrow told CBS she wishes charges had been filed following investigations at the time, because she would have ""had"" to take the stand. ""I do wish that they had, even if I'm just speaking in retrospect. I was already traumatised."" Farrow, now 32, was visibly emotional as she was shown a clip from US show 60 Minutes, dating back to 1992, in which Allen, now 82, vehemently denies the alleged molestation. When this claim was first made more than 25 years ago, it was thoroughly investigated by both the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital and New York State child welfare. They both did so for many months and independently concluded that no molestation had ever taken place. Instead, they found it likely a vulnerable child had been coached to tell the story by her angry mother during a contentious breakup. Dylan's older brother Moses has said that he witnessed their mother doing exactly that - relentlessly coaching Dylan, trying to drum into her that her father was a dangerous sexual predator. It seems to have worked - and, sadly, I'm sure Dylan truly believes what she says. But even though the Farrow family is cynically using the opportunity afforded by the Time's Up movement to repeat this discredited allegation, that doesn't make it any more true today than it was in the past. I never molested my daughter - as all investigations concluded a quarter of a century ago. Farrow told interviewer Gayle King her mother had taken her to the doctor following the alleged incident. When the doctor first asked her to point to where she had been touched, she pointed to her shoulder. She said she felt ""embarrassed"" but then did tell the doctor about the alleged abuse. Farrow also denied Allen's suggestion that her mother had ""coached"" her into to believing her father had molested her. ""Every step of the way, my mother has only encouraged me to tell the truth. She has never coached me,"" she said. Dylan saw a clip of actress Natalie Portman, saying she believed her, during the interview Farrow also alleged that Allen ""would follow me around. He was always touching me, cuddling me and if I ever said I want to go off by myself, he wouldn't let me"". The actors who have distanced themselves from Allen include Timothee Chalamet, whoannounced this week he will give his salary for appearing in Allen's next film, A Rainy Day in New York, to charity. His co-star, Rebecca Hall, also donated her fee to charity and said she ""regretted"" her decision to appear in the film. Other stars include Natalie Portman, Greta Gerwig, Ellen Page and Mira Sorvino. However, Alec Baldwin, who worked with Allen on Alice, Blue Jasmine and To Rome With Love, said the ""renunciation of him and his work"" was""unfair and sad"".,external Alec Baldwin also said it had been a privilege to work with Allen In Thursday's CBS interview, Farrow spoke about actors who have starred in her father's films and continue to stand by him. ""I'm not angry with them. ""I hope that... especially since so many of them have been vocal advocates of this Me Too and Time's Up movement, that they can acknowledge their complicity and maybe hold themselves accountable to how they have perpetuated this culture of silence in their industry. Time's Up: Women launch campaign to fight sexual harassment When asked how she thought they were complicit, Farrow replied: ""Because I have been saying this - I have been repeating my accusations unaltered for over 20 years and I have been systematically shut down, ignored or discredited or not believed. ""If they can't acknowledge the accusations of one survivor's, how are they going to stand for all of us?""

TV stars settle hacking claims,"Jim Moir, also known as Vic Reeves, and TV presenter Kate Thornton were among the phone hacking claimants The publishers of The Sun and the defunct News of the World have settled more claims for phone hacking. News Group Newspapers offered payments to Coronation Street actor Jimmi Harkishin, TV presenter Kate Thornton, comedian Vic Reeves and former Spice Girls manager Chris Herbert. The four claims were due to be heard at the High Court but were abandoned after payouts were offered. The alleged victims said the papers gathered information unlawfully. According to the claimants, journalists at the News of the World and the Sun used phone hacking and ""blagging"" - tricking businesses into releasing confidential information - to find stories about them. The four claimants said this led to the publication of 79 articles that they disputed. Reeves' claim was made was under his real name of Jim Moir. News Group Newspapers (NGN) has denied that phone hacking took place at The Sun and made no admissions in the latest settlement. But a total of 23 hacking claims against the newspaper group have now been settled. Civil claims against NGN have been moving through the courts since 2012 and have resulted in four aborted trials, costing NGN millions in legal fees. BBC home affairs producer Gaetan Portal, who was at the High Court, said that each of these latest cases incurred fees of about Â£450,000 to Â£500,000, on top of compensation believed to be a six-figure sum for each claim. Jimmi Harkishin has played local entrepreneur Dev Alahan in Coronation Street since 1999 As well as the four named cases, the court was due to hear two ""generic"" claims involving phone hacking at The Sun and allegations that senior executives at NGN conspired to destroy documents, computer equipment and millions of emails. It was alleged that James Murdoch, chairman of the company when it was known as News International, and chief executive Rebekah Brooks adopted a strategy to destroy materials in 2010 after they received court papers from lawyers representing the actress Sienna Miller. The destruction of emails allegedly continued into 2011 as the Metropolitan Police began its investigation into phone hacking. By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman ""It's deja vu all over again"" is a phrase attributed to the legendary American baseball coach Yogi Berra. It might also describe today's settlements. For six years, News Group Newspapers has settled claims for phone-hacking before they came to trial. Finally, the issue of whether the publisher is liable was due to be determined in a civil court with the cases due to start today... but it didn't. NGN has now settled around 1,000 civil claims for phone-hacking. If the cost estimate for a single claimant of Â£450,000 to Â£500,0000 given in court is typical, then the publisher is likely to have paid in the region of half a billion pounds in costs alone. Compensation payments would run into tens of millions more. And there are scores more claims in the pipeline including from Sir Elton John and the actor David Tennant. More concerning for NG though are the so-called 'generic' claims being brought by 'various claimants' alleging concealment and destruction of evidence by senior executives. They are much more difficult to settle. NGN has always maintained that emails were deleted as part of their normal IT systems management. David Sherborne, representing the claimants, said they made serious allegations of criminality against James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks over the destruction of material. Mr Justice Mann criticised both parties for the way the cases had been handled. He said: ""Settlement is a good thingâ¦ even at the court doorsâ¦ however for test cases it raises different issues."" He said that the cases had been a chance to settle the wider issues of whether there had been a ""deliberate cover-up"" and illegal activity at The Sun.

Chris Tarrant banned for drink-driving,"Chris Tarrant arrived at court with girlfriend Jane Bird Radio host and TV presenter Chris Tarrant was found to be over the drink-drive limit after he was reported to police by a fellow pub-goer. The star had been served four brandy and ports at the Bladebone Inn in Bucklebury, Berkshire, before driving home, Reading Magistrates Court heard. Tarrant, who admitted drink-driving, was banned from driving for a year. After the hearing, he told reporters: ""I made a mistake and I paid for it. I shouldn't have driven."" The Who Wants to be a Millionaire host was found to have 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 microgrammes. The 71-year-old said he ""honestly didn't think"" he had been over the legal limit when he got in his Mercedes to drive the short journey home, on 16 December. Prosecutor Hasrat Ali told the hearing that staff and drinkers at the pub were ""concerned that he had decided to drive home"". ""One member of the public had noticed that Mr Tarrant had stumbled near the bar area,"" she said. As a result of a discussion in the pub, a member of the public phoned the police. Thirteen minutes after the call was made, officers arrived at Tarrant's home in Bucklebury. Ms Ali said: ""He claimed that he had just drank three glasses of wine just prior to police arriving."" But the court was told by Ms Ali that, after failing a breath test and being taken to the police station, Tarrant ""gave a different version of events in the sense that it wasn't three glasses of wine that he had drunk, that in fact he had a large glass of brandy and a glass of wine"". Tarrant's counsel Simon Ray said the drinks that were bought in the pub were not all consumed by his client. He added that the TV presenter had a knee condition that explained the stumble. District Judge Shomon Khan said despite the ""relatively low reading"" nothing he could say would ""reduce the seriousness of the offence"". He also fined Tarrant Â£6,000.

Emily Maitlis fears stalker won't stop,"This video can not be played Emily Maitlis tells Emma Barnett about the impact her stalker has had on her life TV presenter Emily Maitlis says she fears her stalker will never stop harassing her. Two daysafter a former friend was jailed for breaching a restraining order, the Newsnight presenter compared living with two decades of harassment to having a chronic illness. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett Show, she said it had had a devastating impact on her family. ""You turn into this person who shouts at your kids for the wrong thing."" She also described her frustrations with the legal system and called for a new approach to treating stalkers. On Tuesday, Edward Vines was jailed for 45 months for breaching a restraining order, having first been convicted of harassing Maitlis in 2002. Maitlis said in the radio interview, broadcast on the Emma Barnett Show, that the thought of her stalker was ever-present. ""It just makes you jumpy - and that's stressful and it's tiring and it's time-consuming. ""Your head is somewhere else and you're having to think about things that are just ludicrous, like 'how do you get in and out of your front door' and 'how are they getting back from school?' ""It's not that you think everyone is out to kill you.  You recognise it as a paranoia. But it doesn't make it any easier. ""This has literally been going on for 20 years.  It feels like sort of a chronic illness. ""It's not that I ever believe it will stop or he will stop, or the system will manage to prevent it properly."" Edward Vines was issued with an indefinite restraining order in 2009 The journalist first met Vines, from Oxford, when they were students at Cambridge University. He was issued with an indefinite restraining order in 2009, which he was convicted of twice breaching last year. Stalking: Not just an EastEnders story Stalked by a stranger for seven years Murdered by her stalker Maitlis said: ""Whatever treatment he's had isn't working as a cure and he is obviously also a victim in this. ""He is unwell and has wasted half his life. Stalking is a weirdo glamorised term for what is essentially mental ill-health and so somewhere along the lines we have to change the mechanism."" She added: ""It's weird for the kids to have to see this stuff. They know as much as they want, they can read and they are online. My job is just to keep things really normal at home. ""I remember the first time the police came round and they pulled my husband aside and said 'You're the one we're worried about here'. ""Apparently there is a very natural course of behaviour, that the husband just goes out and decks the guy. ""Then of course you're in the worst possible position because your own husband is serving time instead of the perpetrator."" Vines met the Newsnight presenter when they were at Cambridge University The government has apologised to Maitlis after her stalker was able to write to her from prison. Vines wrote to her while in HMP Bullingdon and again while living in a bail hostel. Maitlis described this as ""bizarre beyond belief"", adding: ""It was something that should never have got through, but it is extraordinary to think that a stalker behind bars for corresponding can then carry on corresponding."" She said that on an individual basis, authorities and police had been ""really caring and helpful"" but there was a lack of co-ordination when dealing with victims. ""You give a statement and you give an impact statement;  you've got a prosecution and you've got a custodial sentence, and it's been meted out - and then 12 months later it happens all over again. ""By that time it's a different policeman or a different investigator or people have changed jobs and somebody turns up at your house and says 'Right so what's all this about?' or 'Where did it all begin?', and for somebody who's been through this to have to relive that, it's punishing and it's humiliating. ""It's the frustration of thinking, why isn't there a record of this? Why isn't there an electronic copy of this? Why didn't it stay in a system to get passed on?""

UK 'in grip of worst flu season since 2011',"The UK is in the grip of its worst flu season for seven years, figures show. All parts of the UK have seen rises in suspected flu cases since the turn of the year with Wales seeing the sharpest - close to a fourfold increase in GP visits to 64.9 cases per 100,000. The last time there was more flu circulating than this was in 2010-11 when swine flu, responsible for the pandemic of the year before, came back. Hospitals are also seeing ""very high"" rates of admissions, officials said. However, it appears the strain known as Aussie flu is not causing the most serious illnesses, according to the weekly report up to last Sunday from Public Health England. Instead - of the four strains circulating - a B strain, which does not normally cause high rates of severe illness, is responsible for about half the hospital cases. Prof Paul Cosford, of PHE, said while there was a lot of flu circulating it was ""not an epidemic"" - and there were signs the flu season may be beginning to peak as the rate of increase was slowing down. He also said that death rates seemed to be lower than they were in two of the last three winters. Flu symptoms can come on very quickly and can last for a week or more. Symptoms include a fever - temperature above 38C - aches, headache, tiredness, a chesty cough, tummy pain and loss of appetite. Children can also get pain in their ears and appear lacking in energy. Flu can be particularly unpleasant for certain people, such as the over-65s, pregnant women and those with other serious health conditions. The flu virus can live for many hours on hard surfaces and therefore practising good hand hygiene can limit the spread of germs and transmission of flu. People are advised to catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue, bin it, and then wash their hands afterwards to kill the germs. Having the vaccine, if you are eligible, is the best protection, health officials say. Despite the the rising levels of flu the NHS has begun to get on top of the pressures being seen in A&E units, NHS England said. A spokesman said pressures seemed to be ""abating"" and hospitals were ""generally coping"". It comes after the weekly data showed falls in the number of ambulances delayed waiting outside A&E and bed closures caused by the vomiting bug norovirus.

Nonetheless, hospitals remain incredibly busy with bed occupancy levels well above safe levels in most of the country. Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals bosses, said: ""We're still working at or beyond full stretch, resulting - at times - in care for patients that falls short of what trusts and their staff want to provide."" And officials warned the cold snap expected to hit the north of England over the next few days could lead to an increase in illnesses. The North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber have been put on the second highest level of alert with icy conditions and heavy snow forecast up to Sunday.

After meeting members of the public, they joined a festival celebrating Welsh culture inside the castle. They later travelled to the Star Hub leisure centre in Tremorfa to see how sport helps disadvantaged children. Royal fans inside the castle grounds brought balloons, flags and dogs to greet the couple, who arrived at about 14:20 GMT on Thursday. Prince Harry apologised to those waiting for their late arrival, saying ""blame the trains"". Prince Harry and Meghan Markle engagement photos Who is Meghan Markle?

As they cheered he gave a thumbs up. As the couple met Anne Daley, 60, and her sister Judy, 53, of Llandaff, Cardiff, they were taken with their dog, Camilla, who was wearing a tiara and perched in a pushchair. ""Why are you shaking?"" Prince Harry asked the dog. ""Is it the excitement or are you freezing cold?"" Camilla the dog was there to greet the couple This video can not be played Anne Daley and her sister Judy have some ideas for Ms Markle's hen do The couple also came across their namesakes, Megan Taylor, nine, and six-year-old Harry Smith, who presented them with a Welsh love spoon, an early wedding present from the people of Wales. Ms Markle, who will marry the prince at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 19 May, said: ""Oh my goodness, wow, it's beautiful, thank you very much."" As they went inside the castle for the celebration of Welsh culture, Prince Harry told his bride-to-be of his appreciation for Welsh singing. ""You are only going to hear the best singing in Wales,"" he said. ""At the Principality Stadium we have the best singing. People are in tune, which you can't say for most football stadiums."" The couple were presented with a traditional Welsh love spoon The personalised lovespoon is carved with the couple's initials This video can not be played Prince Harry and fiancee Meghan Markle were on their first official visit to Wales Ms Markle, wearing a pair of trousers by Cardigan-based The Hiut Denim Company, described the visit as ""so exciting"". ""I am so happy that we are here today,"" she said, in Cardiff Castle's stunning Arab room. ""It is a beautiful space."" The couple enjoyed performances inside the castle During the event, the pair heard performances from musicians and poets and met sportsmen and women, including adventurer Richard Parks, former Wales rugby player Scott Quinnell and Jonathan Ford, chief executive of the Football Association of Wales. The couple ate traditional Welsh cakes and Ms Markle said: ""Very good. Wow, it's great,"" before sampling a wedding cake made from Welsh cheese. Prince Harry is taking his American bride-to-be on a tour of the UK's towns and cities in the months leading up to their wedding so he can introduce her to her new home. His full title is Prince Henry of Wales - and Ms Markle could end up with a title linking her to Wales after the couple get married. In the unlikely event the Queen does not give the prince a dukedom on the morning of his marriage, Ms Markle would become Princess Henry of Wales after saying her vows. At the scene -Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent As the sun began to dip over Cardiff Castle, snow spat and the cold deepened. The loyalty of Harry'n'Meghan watchers was being tested. The not-quite-yet-royal couple were meant to be doing a walkabout just before two in the afternoon. But even being almost-Royalty does not protect one from that most prosaic of frustrations, a signal failure at Didcot. So by the time the show rolled into the castle's ground, the gathered children were singing to stay warm and the adults were maybe wondering quite why they had chosen this particular form of torture. But the crowd's patience was rewarded; the couple lingered as they strolled, chatting and taking gifts, enquiringly earnestly as to how long people had waited, smiling and laughing. It's fun - and easy - to be cynical about the whole thing; the flags being handed out, the dignitaries waiting nervously, the best laid plans being derailed by signal failures. But the couple are charismatic crowd-pleasers. And there is serious intent in these visits - there's the grandeur of a place like Cardiff Castle and then the more down to earth stuff at a leisure centre, involving sport and youngsters and social mobility, the stuff Harry cares about and wants to highlight everywhere he goes. People queued early to get a good spot in the castle grounds Fans who gathered to meet the couple said their story was like a ""fairytale"". Jenna Quilter, 18 from Creigiau, near Cardiff, said: ""It's fascinating that she's not the typical person you'd expect to become a future duchess and it's just really interesting to see the public reaction to her."" Abbie Smith, who is visiting Cardiff from Louisiana in the US, said: ""In America this is like a fairytale. I think it's really cool that she's from the States and gets to experience the royal lifestyle as well."" Haley Johnston, 26, from Charlotte, North Carolina, added: ""I'm also from the States and I married a British soldier so we have a few things in common."" Meghan Markle and Prince Harry later went to the Star Hub leisure centre Later on Thursday, the couple had a private tour of Star Hub, where they saw howStreetGames,external, an organisation the prince has worked with previously, is helping to make sport accessible to disadvantaged young people. Crowds waited outside the leisure centre in Tremorfa to see them. Niusha Tabrizi, nine, wrote a welcome in Welsh for the pair and said she was keen to see Ms Markle. ""I want to see how she looks,"" she added. Niusha Tabrizi waited with her parents in Tremorfa Ten year olds Lataya Marden and Annalise Marshall danced for the couple Youngsters gathered in Tremorfa to meet the couple Lataya Marden and Annalise Marshall, both 10, danced for the couple. Annalise said: ""It was fun and an exciting experience."" Lataya added: ""I thought it was amazing getting to meet Harry and Meghan. I was nervous before but it was an amazing."" Grace Jones, nine, who also danced, said: ""They asked how long have you been doing dancing. We shook hands with them. I was a little bit nervous but it was fun at the same time.""

Talks involving all five main parties will begin next Wednesday, 24 January. Karen Bradley, who wasappointed last week, was flanked by the TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney as she made the announcement. Mr Coveney said progress must be made in ""weeks rather than months"". Stormont deadlock: What you need to know Politicians eye life after Stormont What caused the stalemate? Mrs Bradley said ""time is short"" but there was one last opportunity to restore the Stormont executive. She said she believed an agreement was possible and that it was vital that all parties are involved. The talks will be short and intense and ""progress must be swift"", she added. ""The gaps are narrow but there are still significant differences to overcome.""

Significant progress had been made during previous rounds of talks, he said, suggesting an agreement was possible. Discussions between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©inground to a halt in October. Sinn FÃ©in's northern leader Michelle O'Neill said her party was willing to take part in the talks, adding it should be a ""short, sharp process"". The DUP's Simon Hamilton said he believed new talks would help the parties ""build on progress that has been built to date"". He added: ""While I am reluctant to talk about deadlines, it is more than apparent that time is short."" With no ministers in place, civil servants have been making the decisions on running public services Last week, the UUP, SDLP and Alliance Partyurged a quick resumption of talksto re-establish a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. Speaking to BBC Good Morning Ulster, Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann welcomed the suggestion to include all five parties. He said part of the difficulty in making progress was that it has been ""a two-party process since June"". Mr Swann reiterated his party's opposition to an Irish language act, one of the main sticking points in the talks. He said Sinn FÃ©in had to be ""realistic"" if it wanted to a part of the solution, saying its red lines were holding up the process. Allow Twitter content?

Alliance party leader Naomi Long gave a cautious welcome to the announcement of new talks but reiterated they need to be all-party with an independent mediator if they were to have any possibility of success. ""We not only need a change of pace in these talks but a marked change in attitude from the two largest parties, if we are to see the Assembly restored,"" she said. ""The appointment of an independent facilitator would be another significant step forward and we are disappointed that has not yet happened."" While the leader of the SDLP, Colum Eastwood, welcomed a new round of talks, he said his party ""will not negotiate blind"". ""The progress that was made between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, that we were all told about, needs to be published so the public and other parties can see how far they've got,"" he said.

Northern Ireland has been without an executive since last January, when the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in's power-sharing government broke down in a bitter row.

Thatcher set to lose out in statue battle,"The bronze statue has already been created Margaret Thatcher looks set to lose out to two pioneering feminists in the battle to be the first woman to have a statue in Parliament Square. Rival campaigns have battled for years to be first to put a statue of a woman in front of the Houses of Parliament. The race was won by advocates of suffragist and trade union leader Millicent Fawcett. She is set to join the 10 men in the square, including Sir Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela, later this year. A rival campaign, led by former Conservative MP Sir Neil Thorne, and backed by the first female Commons Speaker Baroness Boothroyd, argued Emmeline Pankhurst should have been immortalised in bronze instead, as she is far better known than Ms Fawcett. Westminster Council has not ruled out a statue to Ms Pankhurst in the square at some stage - provided campaigners move an existing statute of the suffragette leader that stands in nearby Victoria Gardens first, but they seem to be less convinced of the case for a Thatcher monument, even though it has already been created by sculptor Douglas Jennings. Advocates of a Lady Thatcher statue stayed out of the Pankhurst/Fawcett battle, despite a planning application for a monument to Britain's first woman prime minister being considered by Westminster Council at the same time. The council's planning committee is due to vote on the Thatcher proposal next Tuesday, but council officers have recommended refusal. Millicent Fawcett was a pioneering feminist The Royal Parks Agency, which owns the land, and the Metropolitan Police have expressed concern that a Thatcher statue would attract protests. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors also objected to having a statue of the Iron Lady near its Parliament Square headquarters because she was a ""controversial character"" who would be likely to be a target for vandalism and ""abuse"". ""This could easily extend to our building and, potentially, to our staff and professional members who use the building. ""There is a physical risk if projectiles are thrown at the statue and hit the building and/or individuals direct,"" said RICS in its submission to the council. The Emmeline Pankhurst statue is set to be moved But council sources say the biggest factor influencing the decision - apart from there already being too many statues in the area - is likely to be the fact that the Thatcher family had objected to the design. Officials also cited the ""10-year rule"", which suggests monuments to leaders should not be erected until at least a decade after their death, although this rule was broken to allow a statue of Nelson Mandela in 2007. Richard Beddoe, chairman of Westminster City Council planning, said: ""The council is unable to comment on outstanding planning applications. This scheme will be considered on its merits and in line with council policy at our planning committee on 23 January."" Pamela Cox: Why not have two statues? The Millicent Fawcett statue, designed by Turner Prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing, will commemorate the centenary of women winning the right to vote. The original design had to be amended as councillors were concerned Ms Fawcett - who is carrying a banner reading ""courage calls to courage everywhere"" - looked like she was hanging out washing,according to the Daily Telegraph.,external Ms Pankhurst favoured more radical and militant tactics than Ms Fawcett, who founded the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in 1897, in the battle to win women the vote. Historian and sociologist Pamela Cox, who presented two BBC documentary series' Shopgirls and Servants, argued that both women should be commemorated in bronze. ""There are so few statues of women in the capital - and indeed - across the country. We can surely afford to commemorate both de facto leaders of the women's suffrage campaign,"" said Ms Cox, in a submission to the council. But Westminster Council said the existing statue of Ms Pankhurst would have to be moved before they would consider erecting another one in the square opposite Parliament.

MPs reject chicken firm's biscuit gift,"Several committee members say they received tins similar to these MPs investigating food safety breaches at chicken supplier 2 Sisters Food Group have revealed they rejected Christmas gifts sent from its boss. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee said festive packages of biscuits were sent to several members. Its chairman said the unsolicited gifts were ""inappropriate"" and they had been returned or given to local food banks. 2 Sisters disputed the amount and said it was a ""goodwill gesture"", which they send to many external stakeholders. The committee held a month-long inquiry into the food group's actions after an undercover report from the Guardian and ITV Newsclaimed workers at its West Bromwich sitewere changing the slaughter dates to extend the shelf life of meat. In September, the Food Standards Agency and supermarkets Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer alsoannounced they would investigate the allegations. 2 Sisters is one of the UK's largest chicken suppliers but also provides biscuits, ready meals and frozen pizzas. Over the Christmas period, several committee members received care packages with a mixture of Fox's and other tins of biscuits. Labour's Paul Flynn, who sits on the committee, said the package contained ""around Â£100 worth"". But 2 Sisters says the total cost of the gift was nearer Â£20. There are 11 members in this committee They are made up of Conservatives, Labour, SNP and DUP MPs Its role is to examine the finances, administration and policy of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and its associated public bodies The committee can open inquiries into environmental and agricultural subjects which can last several months and call upon witnesses Last year,it published a report on food waste,externaldescribing it as a ""scandal"" and a ""disaster"" MPs are required to declare any gifts, benefits and hospitality over a value of Â£300. Chairman Neil Parish, a Conservative MP. said members had found the actions of Ranjit Singh Boparan, 2 Sisters' chief executive, ""very disappointing"". ""Sending gifts to committee members at a time when we are trying to rebuild trust in the poultry industry is most unhelpful. ""Mr Boparan should instead concentrate on restoring confidence in our poultry supply chains, and we are keen to work with him to do so."" He wrote to the 2 Sisters chief executive asking him to ""avoid similar gestures,externalin future"". A 2 Sisters Food Group spokesman said: ""Each gift was around eight packets of Fox's and Own Brand Biscuits, in addition to two tins or boxes of Fox's biscuits. ""The business sends these out every year as a goodwill gesture at Christmas to hundreds of external stakeholders. ""We have responded formally to Neil Parish on the above.""

Dispatch box first for female Muslim MP,"This video can not be played Nus Ghani was answering a question on access to train stations Nus Ghani has made history by becoming the first female Muslim minister to speak from the Commons dispatch box.

Trump denies changing view on Mexico wall,"This video can not be played Testing began in December on President Trump's border wall prototypes Donald Trump has denied changing his views on a border wall after his top aide reportedly said the president was ""uninformed"" when he made the promise. White House chief of staff John Kelly told Fox News the president's opinions had evolved since his signature campaign pledge on the US-Mexico wall. Hours later, the president tweeted to say Mexico would still ""directly or indirectly"" pay for the wall. Mexico's foreign ministry said Thursday morning that the country would not pay. They also pushed back against Mr Trump's claim that Mexico is the ""most dangerous country in the world"". ""Even though Mexico has a significant problem with violence, it is plainly false that Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world,"" the ministry said. US media report that the White House chief of staff told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Wednesday that the US would never construct a wall along its entire southern border. Mr Kelly also reportedly said Mexico would never pay for the structure, as Mr Trump has repeatedly vowed. ""Campaigning is very different from governing,"" Mr Kelly said on Wednesday, of Mr Trump's former promise. But speaking to Fox News later the retired general insisted the president was committed to building 700 miles (1,100km) of additional wall along the nearly 2,000-mile border. Last year Mr Trump said his wall would cover 1,000 miles with natural obstacles taking care of the rest. John Kelly (L) was appointed as President Trump's chief of staff in July When Fox News asked Mr Kelly if he had called the president ""uninformed"", he did not deny it. Both the president and his chief of staff cited the estimated cost as $20bn (Â£14bn); Mr Trump had originally put the figure at $10-$12bn. Six things that could topple Trump's wall Mr Kelly said they were now looking at alternative ways to raise funds, including via possible visa fees or renegotiating theNafta trade dealbetween the US, Canada and Mexico. In Thursday morning's tweet, President Trump insisted Mexico would still pick up the costs, possibly ""through longer term reimbursement"". Allow Twitter content?

Terminally ill man granted court appeal,"Noel Conway was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2014 A terminally ill man who wants to be helped to die has been granted permission to take his case to appeal. Two judges from the Court of Appeal said there should be a full hearing of 68-year-old Noel Conway's case. Mr Conway, a retired lecturer from Shropshire who has motor neurone disease, was too ill to attend court. Last October, the High Court rejected his challenge to the Suicide Act 1961 which he argues breaches his right to a ""peaceful and dignified death"". Mr Conway wants a doctor to be allowed to prescribe him a lethal dose of drugs. The Appeal Court granted permission for him to challenge the ruling and will give its reasons later. But the full appeal will not be heard until a later date. Mr Conway's barrister told the court that he had been given ""more than six months to live, but not much more"" and as a result would welcome the appeal being heard quickly. Before his illness Noel Conway was a keen skier, climber and cyclist Currently any doctor helping him to die would face up to 14 years in prison. Back in October, Lord Justice Sales, Mrs Justice Whipple and Mr Justice Garnhamrejected,externalhis case. His lawyers had argued he faced a stark choice, which was unfair and the law needed to change. They said he could either bring about his own death while still physically able to do so, or await death with no control over how and when it came.

Storm hits Dutch and German transport,"This video can not be played Hurricane-strength gusts of up to 140km/h (90mph) caused transport chaos Eight people including two firefighters have been killed in storm-related accidents as hurricane-strength winds tear across northern Europe. Both firefighters were helping with clean-up efforts in Germany when they died. Many of those killed, in the Netherlands and in Germany, were hit by falling trees and debris. One died in a collision when his van was blown on to the other side of the road. The storm has now crossed to Poland. Facing gusts of up to 140km/h (90mph), Germany's train operator Deutsche Bahn cancelled all long-distance services for the rest of Thursday. Many regional services were also cancelled. Flights at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam - one of the busiest in Europe - were briefly suspended and two of its three departure halls were closed after roof plates were blown off the terminal building. In pictures: Storm rips through Europe People arriving at Schiphol told reporters they had experienced rough landings with some passengers around them throwing up. The storm, called Friederike in Germany, crossed the country from west to east before reaching Poland. This video can not be played As the storm heads eastward it will mix with snowfall, says the BBC Weather Centre's Sarah Keith-Lucas It caused high winds in the UK on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, bringing down trees and knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes. Meteorologists in Germany - where 65,000 homes are reportedly without power - warned people to stay indoors, and many schools are closed. Deutsche Bahn had already suspended rail traffic,externalin North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), neighbouring Rhineland-Palatinate state and Lower Saxony, when it announced a Germany-wide suspension of long-distance trains. Any regional trains still running have cut their speed because of the strong winds. A spokesman said it was the ""right decision"" due to the risk of trees falling on overhead wires and on tracks. Many domestic flights have also been cancelled. An emergency siren wailed in the city of Duisburg,external, warning residents that they should stay indoors, German news website WDR reported. Fierce winds blew this lorry's tarpaulin off on the motorway in Germany Twitter users posted photos of trucks and trees blown over by the gales. Many trees came down on railway lines. Police temporarily closed the centre of Almere, a Dutch city with about 200,000 residents lying just east of Amsterdam. They tweeted an alert warning people to stay at home because of risk from the storm. These cyclists in Rotterdam gave up trying to pedal through the storm A national transport website, VID, reported that at least 17 trucks had been blown over by the strong winds. The Dutch Railways (NS) and operator ProRail said overhead power lines had been damaged by the wind, as well as some railway tracks. An alert on the NS website said that ""at most, only a few trains"" would run throughout the evening.

Pressure 'easing' on busy A&E units,"The UK is in the grip of its worst flu season for seven years, figures show. All parts of the UK have seen rises in suspected flu cases since the turn of the year with Wales seeing the sharpest - close to a fourfold increase in GP visits to 64.9 cases per 100,000. The last time there was more flu circulating than this was in 2010-11 when swine flu, responsible for the pandemic of the year before, came back. Hospitals are also seeing ""very high"" rates of admissions, officials said. However, it appears the strain known as Aussie flu is not causing the most serious illnesses, according to the weekly report up to last Sunday from Public Health England. Instead - of the four strains circulating - a B strain, which does not normally cause high rates of severe illness, is responsible for about half the hospital cases. Prof Paul Cosford, of PHE, said while there was a lot of flu circulating it was ""not an epidemic"" - and there were signs the flu season may be beginning to peak as the rate of increase was slowing down. He also said that death rates seemed to be lower than they were in two of the last three winters. Flu symptoms can come on very quickly and can last for a week or more. Symptoms include a fever - temperature above 38C - aches, headache, tiredness, a chesty cough, tummy pain and loss of appetite. Children can also get pain in their ears and appear lacking in energy. Flu can be particularly unpleasant for certain people, such as the over-65s, pregnant women and those with other serious health conditions. The flu virus can live for many hours on hard surfaces and therefore practising good hand hygiene can limit the spread of germs and transmission of flu. People are advised to catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue, bin it, and then wash their hands afterwards to kill the germs. Having the vaccine, if you are eligible, is the best protection, health officials say. Despite the the rising levels of flu the NHS has begun to get on top of the pressures being seen in A&E units, NHS England said. A spokesman said pressures seemed to be ""abating"" and hospitals were ""generally coping"". It comes after the weekly data showed falls in the number of ambulances delayed waiting outside A&E and bed closures caused by the vomiting bug norovirus.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Nonetheless, hospitals remain incredibly busy with bed occupancy levels well above safe levels in most of the country. Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals bosses, said: ""We're still working at or beyond full stretch, resulting - at times - in care for patients that falls short of what trusts and their staff want to provide."" And officials warned the cold snap expected to hit the north of England over the next few days could lead to an increase in illnesses. The North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber have been put on the second highest level of alert with icy conditions and heavy snow forecast up to Sunday.

Extra Â£44m for Calais border security,"This video can not be played President Macron: ""I respect Brexit although I regret it"" France and the UK have signed a treaty to speed up the processing of migrants in Calais, French President Emmanuel Macron announced on his first UK visit. After talks with UK PM Theresa May at Sandhurst military academy, he said the treaty would offer a ""more humane approach"" and be ""more efficient"". But he suggested France would not bow to UK demands to include financial services in any post-Brexit trade deal. Mrs May praised the ""uniquely close relationship"" between the two nations. She said both leaders remained committed to the ""Le Touquet"" border agreement in Calais - the UK has announced an extra Â£44.5m to be spent on beefing up Channel border security. John Pienaar: Why getting on well with France matters Smiling Macron and May pose for selfie What now for UK-France security relations? Mr Macron said the Sandhurst Treaty signed on Thursday - the first joint treaty on the Calais border in 15 years - would ""enable us to improve the relationship and the management of the joint border"" and reduce the time taken to process migrants. It would mean the time taken to process migrants hoping to come to the UK from Calais, would be reduced from six months to one month for adults and 25 days for children. It ""will enable us both to have a more humane approach to these people and to be more efficient"" while also encouraging trade through the Channel ports, said the president. Mrs May said it was in Britain's national interest, as well as France's, to commit more resources to Calais security and stressed the two countries' joint commitments to defence and security measures. She said a combined joint expeditionary force would be ready to deploy up to 10,000 troops ""quickly and effectively to face any threat"" by 2020. Bayeux Tapestry to be displayed in UK In depth: The meteoric rise of Macron And the prime minister said a multi-million pound deal to build 36 A380 passenger aircraft for Emirates Airlines had been signed by Airbus, which has plants in France and the UK. She also confirmed thatthe Bayeux Tapestry will come to the UK in 2022- a gesture President Macron said he hoped would ""open a new chapter when it comes to our cultural co-operation and scientific co-operation"". ""We are making a new tapestry together,"" he said. This video can not be played Bayeux Tapestry explained... by kids The summit between Mrs May and Mr Macron, at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Berkshire, also featured the first meeting of the heads of Britain and France's five intelligence agencies, and is being attended by British cabinet ministers and their French counterparts. And with Brexit very much on the agenda for both nations, Mr Macron said that the history between the two countries could not be ""impacted by changes in institutions"". Challenged about his opposition to including financial services in any EU-UK free trade agreement, he said: ""I am here neither to punish nor to reward. I want to make sure that the single market is preserved because that is very much the heart of the EU."" He said if the UK wanted access to the single market, including financial services, ""be my guest. But it means that you need to contribute to the budget and acknowledge European jurisdiction"". Mrs May said she recognised that there would be ""a different relationship in future"" but added: ""I think the City of London will continue to be a major global financial centre. That is an advantage not just for the UK, it's actually good for Europe and good for the global financial system."" Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has hinted at the prospect of a second crossing for the English Channel -tweeting,external: ""Our economic success depends on good infrastructure and good connections. Should the Channel Tunnel be just a first step?"" A source close to the foreign secretary told the BBC that Mr Johnson had suggested to President Macron that a new ""fixed link"" between UK and France was needed. Other commitments include the deployment of three RAF Chinook helicopters in Mali, where French forces are fighting Islamist militants, and France sending more troops to reinforce a British contingent in Estonia on Nato's border with Russia. Downing Street said the RAF Chinooks would offer a ""niche capability"", providing logistical support for the French operation in Mali, but that Britain would not be committing combat troops. During last year's French election campaign, Mr Macron said he wanted to renegotiate or scrap the 2003 Le Touquet agreement, which established French border controls in Britain and UK controls in Calais. The agreement means undocumented migrants barred from entering the UK stay in France - many in makeshift camps. Up to 700 migrants are in the area, despite the camp known as the ""Jungle"" having been dismantled in 2016. The UK government is already thought to have spent more than Â£100m on security in the area over the past three years, and officials said the number of illegal attempts to enter the UK fell from 80,000 in 2015 to just over 30,000 last year. Other ""juxtaposed"" border controls are in operation at Eurostar stations in France and Belgium. By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Britain and France carry much the same weight in global affairs. Both sit at the world's most exclusive tables of power - the Security Council and the G7 - and the sizes of their populations and economies are broadly similar too. But while President Macron commands France, including his parliament, after last year's stunning electoral successes - the same cannot be said of Theresa May. Sharp disagreements over the UK border with France are difficult to resolve. Mrs May has conceded extra money for border security in Calais - and has separately offered Chinook helicopters to move French troops more safely over Mali. Mr Macron, meanwhile, has offered the loan of the Bayeux tapestry. But Brexit still threatens to overshadow all this bonhomie. When it comes to Europe, these two countries are pulling in radically different directions.

Sinn FÃ©in's northern leader Michelle O'Neill said her party was willing to take part in the talks, adding it should be a ""short, sharp process"". The DUP's Simon Hamilton said he believed new talks would help the parties ""build on progress that has been built to date"".

With no ministers in place, civil servants have been making the decisions on running public services Last week, the UUP, SDLP and Alliance Partyurged a quick resumption of talksto re-establish a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. Speaking to BBC Good Morning Ulster, Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann welcomed the suggestion to include all five parties. He said part of the difficulty in making progress was that it has been ""a two-party process since June"". Mr Swann reiterated his party's opposition to an Irish language act, one of the main sticking points in the talks. He said Sinn FÃ©in had to be ""realistic"" if it wanted to a part of the solution, saying its red lines were holding up the process. Allow Twitter content?

""We not only need a change of pace in these talks but a marked change in attitude from the two largest parties, if we are to see the Assembly restored,"" she said. ""The appointment of an independent facilitator would be another significant step forward and we are disappointed that has not yet happened."" While the leader of the SDLP, Colum Eastwood, welcomed a new round of talks, he said his party ""will not negotiate blind"".

Facebook selfie leads to killerPolice discovered the weapon used to murder a Canadian teen in a photo she took with her friend.3h3 hours agoUS & Canada,"A belt worn by Cheyenne Antoine (L) can be seen as she poses with victim Brittney Gargol A Canadian woman has been convicted of killing her friend after police discovered the murder weapon used in a picture of the pair on social media. Cheyenne Rose Antoine, 21, pleaded guilty on Monday to killing Brittney Gargol, then 18, in March 2015. Gargol was found strangled to death near a landfill in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, with Antoine's belt near her body. Antoine was sentenced to seven years for manslaughter. She was identified as a suspect after she posted a selfie on Facebook of the two of them, showing her wearing the belt hours before Gargol died. The suspects snared by their tech use The show-offs caught out by social media The two were ""inseparable"" friends, reported the Toronto Sun,external- until Gargol was discovered dead on a road by a passerby in the early morning of 25 March 2015. Police said that no evidence could be found to verify the story Antoine first gave to them - which was that the pair had gone from a house party to some bars before Gargol left with an unidentified man, while Antoine went to see her uncle. Once the belt had established Antoine as a suspect, police used Facebook posts to help establish the real movements of the pair. Police realised that Antoine's Facebook post on Gargol's personal page the following morning - ""Where are you? Haven't heard from you. Hope you made it home safe"" - was a diversion. She had also asked her uncle to provide a false alibi. And eventually she confessed to a friend. Antoine now says the pair were drunk and high on marijuana when they got into a heated argument. She accepts she is responsible for strangling her best friend - although she says she doesn't actually remember the events. Yes, and that's why the judge agreed to a seven-year sentence when she pleaded guilty to manslaughter (rather than the second-degree murder she was originally charged with). ""I will never forgive myself. Nothing I say or do will ever bring her back. I am very, very sorry... It shouldn't have ever happened,"" she said in a statement through her lawyer. Her lawyer said her client had suffered years of abuse in the Saskatchewan care system and had gone to police to report abuse by foster parents a month before the killing. ""Honour your friend by becoming a positive member of the community,"" Judge Marilyn Gray told her, according to the Saskatoon Starphoenix,external. ""You owe it to her."" Before Antoine was sentenced, Gargol's aunt gave a victim impact statement to the court. ""Most days we can't stop thinking about Brittney, what happened that night, what she must have felt fighting for her life,"" Jennifer Gargol said. Outside court, her uncle Al Gargol said she was ""a wonderful young person that didn't deserve this and we truly miss her every day"", the Saskatoon Starphoenix said.

Parents subsidise 'free' nursery scheme,"This video can not be played Pre-school owner, Toby Evans, says he has asked parents for voluntary contributions Parents are subsidising a new flagship ""free"" nursery scheme for three- and four-year-olds in England from their own pockets, a survey suggests. Nurseries are making up losses by upping fees for younger children and charging for meals and nappies, a survey of 1,662 providers suggests. The survey, by the Pre-School Learning Alliance, suggests only a third are delivering the hours totally free. The government says it is investing Â£6bn in childcare by 2020. It added that any charges to parents on the scheme must be voluntary. The poll of nurseries, pre-schools and childminders is the first to be carried out since the 30-hour free childcare scheme came into effect in September, and has been shared exclusively with the BBC. Families where both parents are working more than 16 hours a week, but earning under Â£100,000 each, qualify for the scheme. It expands the number of free hours childcare for this age group from 15 a week. But nurseries and pre-schools have long warned they will struggle to make ends meet because the hourly rates they are receiving from the government are too low. Nurseries and pre-schools have already been cross-subsidising the previous entitlement of 15 hours a week with fees from non-government funded children. According to the survey, conducted online among alliance members, over a third said they were making up losses by upping fees for younger children. And charges for items such as meals and nappies are also being made at a third of the settings that responded. Most said the hourly rates they were receiving from the government were below what they charged parents not on the scheme and failed to cover their costs. And  a fifth thought they may not be financially sustainable by next year. Some already have closed their doors. And numerous local authorities are no longer promoting the scheme as ""free"", instead referring to the hours as ""funded"" in their advertising instead. One nursery told the alliance: ""Funding rate not increased for the seventh year, coupled with cost of increased pension contributions and increase in living wage and minimum wage, we are seriously concerned about our future survival."" More than three-quarters (some 77%) said if the funding stayed the same next year, it would have a negative impact on the business - 44% described that negative impact as ""significant"". Another provider said: ""It does not currently seem financially sustainable. If the funding rate does not increase, the only way we can still offer the places is by charging for extras, [in other words] charging for the gap in underfunding."" Chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance Neil Leitch said: ""It's clear from these findings that the government's flagship childcare policy is failing both providers and parents. ""Respondents have laid out in black and white that the 30 hours policy is simply not working, with a continued lack of adequate funding leaving many with no option but to pass the funding shortfall on to parents. ""This has left parents to pay the price for government underfunding through often unexpected charges for things like nappies, food and trips, while the government continues to claim that it's delivering on its promise of 'free' childcare."" He said that since the policy had been announced, the childcare sector had repeatedly said the scheme would not be sustainable in the long term. ""Thousands of parents and providers have now joined ourFair Future Funding campaign,externalto demonstrate their concerns. ""The government should not have needed more evidence of a childcare funding crisis - but here it is."" He added that if ministers did not want to leave parents picking up the tab, or more nursery closures, they needed to increase funding urgently. The National Day Nurseries Association chief executive Purnima Tanuku said: ""These are extremely worrying findings and sadly echo our own research over the last year. ""The government needs to be honest with providers and parents that 30 hours funded childcare is not 'free'. ""There is a significant shortfall between government funding rates and the cost to nurseries of providing childcare."" For example, in Suffolk the funding rate is Â£3.87 per child, per hour, compared to the Â£5.20 per child, per hour it costs to deliver a place. A Department for Education spokesperson said:  ""We are investing a record amount of around Â£6 billion every year by 2020 in childcare and have doubled the free childcare available to working parents to 30 hours a week, saving them up to Â£5,000 a year per child. ""Providers can choose whether to offer 30 hours and what pattern of days and hours they offer parents. We have always been clear that government funding is not intended to cover the costs of meals or additional services. ""However, while providers can charge parents for additional extras, this cannot be a condition of the child's place.""

Sun publisher settles hacking claims,"Jim Moir, also known as Vic Reeves, and TV presenter Kate Thornton were among the phone hacking claimants The publishers of The Sun and the defunct News of the World have settled more claims for phone hacking. News Group Newspapers offered payments to Coronation Street actor Jimmi Harkishin, TV presenter Kate Thornton, comedian Vic Reeves and former Spice Girls manager Chris Herbert. The four claims were due to be heard at the High Court but were abandoned after payouts were offered. The alleged victims said the papers gathered information unlawfully. According to the claimants, journalists at the News of the World and the Sun used phone hacking and ""blagging"" - tricking businesses into releasing confidential information - to find stories about them. The four claimants said this led to the publication of 79 articles that they disputed. Reeves' claim was made was under his real name of Jim Moir. News Group Newspapers (NGN) has denied that phone hacking took place at The Sun and made no admissions in the latest settlement. But a total of 23 hacking claims against the newspaper group have now been settled. Civil claims against NGN have been moving through the courts since 2012 and have resulted in four aborted trials, costing NGN millions in legal fees. BBC home affairs producer Gaetan Portal, who was at the High Court, said that each of these latest cases incurred fees of about Â£450,000 to Â£500,000, on top of compensation believed to be a six-figure sum for each claim. Jimmi Harkishin has played local entrepreneur Dev Alahan in Coronation Street since 1999 As well as the four named cases, the court was due to hear two ""generic"" claims involving phone hacking at The Sun and allegations that senior executives at NGN conspired to destroy documents, computer equipment and millions of emails. It was alleged that James Murdoch, chairman of the company when it was known as News International, and chief executive Rebekah Brooks adopted a strategy to destroy materials in 2010 after they received court papers from lawyers representing the actress Sienna Miller. The destruction of emails allegedly continued into 2011 as the Metropolitan Police began its investigation into phone hacking. By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman ""It's deja vu all over again"" is a phrase attributed to the legendary American baseball coach Yogi Berra. It might also describe today's settlements. For six years, News Group Newspapers has settled claims for phone-hacking before they came to trial. Finally, the issue of whether the publisher is liable was due to be determined in a civil court with the cases due to start today... but it didn't. NGN has now settled around 1,000 civil claims for phone-hacking. If the cost estimate for a single claimant of Â£450,000 to Â£500,0000 given in court is typical, then the publisher is likely to have paid in the region of half a billion pounds in costs alone. Compensation payments would run into tens of millions more. And there are scores more claims in the pipeline including from Sir Elton John and the actor David Tennant. More concerning for NG though are the so-called 'generic' claims being brought by 'various claimants' alleging concealment and destruction of evidence by senior executives. They are much more difficult to settle. NGN has always maintained that emails were deleted as part of their normal IT systems management. David Sherborne, representing the claimants, said they made serious allegations of criminality against James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks over the destruction of material. Mr Justice Mann criticised both parties for the way the cases had been handled. He said: ""Settlement is a good thingâ¦ even at the court doorsâ¦ however for test cases it raises different issues."" He said that the cases had been a chance to settle the wider issues of whether there had been a ""deliberate cover-up"" and illegal activity at The Sun.

Wolf escapes as wind blows down fences,"This video can not be played The wolf, called Torak, was recaptured after about six hours on the run A wolf which went on the loose for about six hours after escaping from its enclosure has been safely recaptured. The animal, called Torak, was initially thought to have fled from the Wolf Conservation Trust's site in Beenham after strong winds damaged fencing. The sanctuary has now said his enclosure gate may have been left open deliberately. Thames Valley Police said the wolf travelled about eight miles before it was caught near the M4 motorway. The force announced Torak's capture at about 13:40 GMT. A spokesperson said: ""It was safely detained by officers and staff from the sanctuary, who had been working to recapture it.""

Teresa Palmer, who founded the sanctuary in Berkshire, helped encourage the 12-year-old wolf into a caged trailer. She said the gate at the front of Torak's enclosure was open. ""I think somebody deliberately opened the gate. A lot of people don't particularly believe in having animals in captivity."" Ms Palmer added: ""When we were near the wolf trust I was close to him but he was frightened and didn't want to be caught. ""The fact he went through a field of sheep shows he never would have been a danger to the public. ""Now he's given up. He's had his moment of freedom now."" Police tracked Torak from a helicopter with thermal imaging An animal capture expert who was tracking Torak said police would have shot to kill if the wolf had run on to the motorway. Mike Allison, from Animal Capture UK, said: ""That would have been the only option available to prevent human injury or loss of life."" But he added that Torak ""looks the most unaggressive wolf I have ever seen"". The animal fled from the Wolf Conservation Trust site in Beenham It's relief all round here in the village of Curridge where the wolf has been found and, more importantly, not a single shot fired. A dedicated team of animal catchers was on hand to fire a tranquiliser dart and were thankfully not needed. The Wolf Conservation Trust owners managed to bring Torak back into care safe and well. Dog owners who were out for a stroll near me have been asking if it's now safe to walk around here and the answer is yes. Life can get back to normal in this quaint little corner of Berkshire. Thames Valley Police earlier put out a text warning to residents and schools in Berkshire, urging them to stay inside. Officers had also advised members of the public not to approach the wolf if they saw it. After the wolf was captured, a spokesperson said: ""Schools, which were asked to keep pupils indoors, no longer need to do this."" Thames Valley Police sent local residents a text message warning of the wolf on the loose Torak had been spotted at various locations, some more than 10 miles to the west of the sanctuary. Local resident Daniel Brownlie told the BBC he ignored the wolf warning. He said: ""I had a local surgery appointment this morning as I'm off to Malawi at the end of the month. It was a decision between getting malaria tablets or getting eaten by a wolf. I took the risk."" One parent, Tony Roe, had earlier said police officers were outside his child's local primary school by 08:30 to usher pupils inside. He said: ""An officer on the school gate told me a wolf had escaped after wind blew down part of the fence.""

PFI deals 'costing taxpayers billions',"Highways England is considering using private finance for the Â£1.3bn tunnel near Stonehenge Financing projects such as schools and hospitals privately costs taxpayers billions of pounds more than public sector alternatives, parliament's spending watchdog says. A report suggests a group of schools cost 40% more to build and a hospital 70% more to construct than if they were financed by government borrowing. TheNational Audit Office report,externalidentifies costs and benefits of PFI. The Treasury said it only approved PFI contracts that were value for money. The collapse of Carillion, which was working on numerous PFI projects, has renewed criticism of such schemes. The NAO report, which was written before the collapse of Carillion, found 716 public projects were active under PFI and its successor PF2, with annual costs amounting to Â£10.3bn in 2016/17. PFI projects will cost the taxpayer a further Â£199bn by the 2040s, it said. The watchdog said the cost of raising capital was higher for PFI projects compared with government-raised funds, and found there were other additional costs. However, the government said PFI projects improved public services, offered better value for money and shifted risk away from the public sector. A spokesperson said the Treasury disagreed with the NAO's analysis that privately financed projects were 40% more expensive, because the NAO had not looked at all the more than 700 PFI schemes in operation. The 40% figure comes from an analysis of 12 current privately financed school building projects in north west England, as measured against the NAO's estimate of the costs if they had been financed publicly. Mapping Carillion's biggest construction projects Carillion was left with just Â£29m before going bankrupt PFI contracts were first introduced under John Major's Conservative government. Under such deals, private consortiums build facilities such as schools, hospitals and roads, in return for regular payments over as many as 30 years. Liverpool City Council is paying more than Â£4m each year for Parklands High School which stands empty and unused. The secondary school which boasts sports hall, canteen and science labs was used for only ten years before it was put into special measures by Ofsted, and closed down in 2014. It is now dubbed a ""ghost school"" by locals. The school cost an estimated Â£24 million to build and between now and the end of the contract 2028, will incur a bill of Â£47 million, which includes interest, debt and facilities management payments. PFI use proliferated under Tony Blair's Labour government, but PFIs fell out of favour after the 2008 financial crisis, as the cost of private finance increased and as questions were raised over their efficacy. Since then, the Departments for Health and Education have used the new PF2s which the Treasury argues are more transparent and ""better value for money"". ""Taxpayer money is protected... as the risks of construction and long-term maintenance of a project are transferred to the private sector,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. However, the NAO said there had never been a ""robust evaluation"" of  the benefits. It said the expected spend on one group of schools financed by PF2 were around 40% higher than the costs of a similar project financed by government borrowing. It also said Treasury Committee analysis from 2011 estimated the cost of a privately financed hospital was 70% higher than a comparative project in the public sector. The watchdog highlighted the increased cost of borrowing which it said was 2% to 3.75% higher for PFIs compared to state borrowing. ""Small changes to the cost of capital can have a significant impact on costs,"" the report said. ""Paying off a debt of Â£100m over 30 years with interest of 2% costs Â£34m in interest. At 4% this more than doubles to Â£73m."" Last year Greater Manchester chose to end a Â£3bn PFI contract with a private sector consortium 17 years early citing ""cost savings"" The report also identified other reasons for higher costs at PFIs including insurance, fees for external advisors, fees for arranging borrowing and the cost of producing and auditing accounts. The report said PFI was designed to limit uncertainty over cost over-runs and provide incentives for better long-term maintenance of assets. But Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the NAO had found ""little evidence"" that PFI's benefits offset its additional costs. ""I am concerned that Treasury has re-launched PFI under new branding, without doing anything about most of its underlying problems,"" she said. ""We need more investment in our schools and hospitals but if we get the contracts wrong, taxpayers pay the price."" But she said many local bodies were now ""shackled to inflexible PFI contracts that are exorbitantly expensive to change."" The GMB union said it showed PFI to be ""a catastrophic waste of taxpayers' money"" and that it should mean ""the game is up for PFI"". At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the government to end the ""costly racket"" of private sector firms running public services.

Under such deals, private consortiums build facilities such as schools, hospitals and roads, in return for regular payments over as many as 30 years. Liverpool City Council is paying more than Â£4m each year for Parklands High School which stands empty and unused. The secondary school which boasts sports hall, canteen and science labs was used for only ten years before it was put into special measures by Ofsted, and closed down in 2014. It is now dubbed a ""ghost school"" by locals. The school cost an estimated Â£24 million to build and between now and the end of the contract 2028, will incur a bill of Â£47 million, which includes interest, debt and facilities management payments. PFI use proliferated under Tony Blair's Labour government, but PFIs fell out of favour after the 2008 financial crisis, as the cost of private finance increased and as questions were raised over their efficacy. Since then, the Departments for Health and Education have used the new PF2s which the Treasury argues are more transparent and ""better value for money"". ""Taxpayer money is protected... as the risks of construction and long-term maintenance of a project are transferred to the private sector,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. However, the NAO said there had never been a ""robust evaluation"" of  the benefits. It said the expected spend on one group of schools financed by PF2 were around 40% higher than the costs of a similar project financed by government borrowing. It also said Treasury Committee analysis from 2011 estimated the cost of a privately financed hospital was 70% higher than a comparative project in the public sector. The watchdog highlighted the increased cost of borrowing which it said was 2% to 3.75% higher for PFIs compared to state borrowing. ""Small changes to the cost of capital can have a significant impact on costs,"" the report said. ""Paying off a debt of Â£100m over 30 years with interest of 2% costs Â£34m in interest. At 4% this more than doubles to Â£73m."" Last year Greater Manchester chose to end a Â£3bn PFI contract with a private sector consortium 17 years early citing ""cost savings"" The report also identified other reasons for higher costs at PFIs including insurance, fees for external advisors, fees for arranging borrowing and the cost of producing and auditing accounts. The report said PFI was designed to limit uncertainty over cost over-runs and provide incentives for better long-term maintenance of assets. But Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the NAO had found ""little evidence"" that PFI's benefits offset its additional costs. ""I am concerned that Treasury has re-launched PFI under new branding, without doing anything about most of its underlying problems,"" she said. ""We need more investment in our schools and hospitals but if we get the contracts wrong, taxpayers pay the price."" But she said many local bodies were now ""shackled to inflexible PFI contracts that are exorbitantly expensive to change."" The GMB union said it showed PFI to be ""a catastrophic waste of taxpayers' money"" and that it should mean ""the game is up for PFI"". At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the government to end the ""costly racket"" of private sector firms running public services.

Terminally ill man granted court appealNoel Conway wins the right to challenge a High Court decision against changing the law on assisted dying.8m8 minutes agoHealth,"Noel Conway was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2014 A terminally ill man who wants to be helped to die has been granted permission to take his case to appeal. Two judges from the Court of Appeal said there should be a full hearing of 68-year-old Noel Conway's case. Mr Conway, a retired lecturer from Shropshire who has motor neurone disease, was too ill to attend court. Last October, the High Court rejected his challenge to the Suicide Act 1961 which he argues breaches his right to a ""peaceful and dignified death"". Mr Conway wants a doctor to be allowed to prescribe him a lethal dose of drugs. The Appeal Court granted permission for him to challenge the ruling and will give its reasons later. But the full appeal will not be heard until a later date. Mr Conway's barrister told the court that he had been given ""more than six months to live, but not much more"" and as a result would welcome the appeal being heard quickly. Before his illness Noel Conway was a keen skier, climber and cyclist Currently any doctor helping him to die would face up to 14 years in prison. Back in October, Lord Justice Sales, Mrs Justice Whipple and Mr Justice Garnhamrejected,externalhis case. His lawyers had argued he faced a stark choice, which was unfair and the law needed to change. They said he could either bring about his own death while still physically able to do so, or await death with no control over how and when it came.

Sun publisher settles hacking claimsTV's Vic Reeves and Kate Thornton agree compensation with News Group Newspapers before going to court.7m7 minutes agoUK,"Jim Moir, also known as Vic Reeves, and TV presenter Kate Thornton were among the phone hacking claimants The publishers of The Sun and the defunct News of the World have settled more claims for phone hacking. News Group Newspapers offered payments to Coronation Street actor Jimmi Harkishin, TV presenter Kate Thornton, comedian Vic Reeves and former Spice Girls manager Chris Herbert. The four claims were due to be heard at the High Court but were abandoned after payouts were offered. The alleged victims said the papers gathered information unlawfully. According to the claimants, journalists at the News of the World and the Sun used phone hacking and ""blagging"" - tricking businesses into releasing confidential information - to find stories about them. The four claimants said this led to the publication of 79 articles that they disputed. Reeves' claim was made was under his real name of Jim Moir. News Group Newspapers (NGN) has denied that phone hacking took place at The Sun and made no admissions in the latest settlement. But a total of 23 hacking claims against the newspaper group have now been settled. Civil claims against NGN have been moving through the courts since 2012 and have resulted in four aborted trials, costing NGN millions in legal fees. BBC home affairs producer Gaetan Portal, who was at the High Court, said that each of these latest cases incurred fees of about Â£450,000 to Â£500,000, on top of compensation believed to be a six-figure sum for each claim. Jimmi Harkishin has played local entrepreneur Dev Alahan in Coronation Street since 1999 As well as the four named cases, the court was due to hear two ""generic"" claims involving phone hacking at The Sun and allegations that senior executives at NGN conspired to destroy documents, computer equipment and millions of emails. It was alleged that James Murdoch, chairman of the company when it was known as News International, and chief executive Rebekah Brooks adopted a strategy to destroy materials in 2010 after they received court papers from lawyers representing the actress Sienna Miller. The destruction of emails allegedly continued into 2011 as the Metropolitan Police began its investigation into phone hacking. By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman ""It's deja vu all over again"" is a phrase attributed to the legendary American baseball coach Yogi Berra. It might also describe today's settlements. For six years, News Group Newspapers has settled claims for phone-hacking before they came to trial. Finally, the issue of whether the publisher is liable was due to be determined in a civil court with the cases due to start today... but it didn't. NGN has now settled around 1,000 civil claims for phone-hacking. If the cost estimate for a single claimant of Â£450,000 to Â£500,0000 given in court is typical, then the publisher is likely to have paid in the region of half a billion pounds in costs alone. Compensation payments would run into tens of millions more. And there are scores more claims in the pipeline including from Sir Elton John and the actor David Tennant. More concerning for NG though are the so-called 'generic' claims being brought by 'various claimants' alleging concealment and destruction of evidence by senior executives. They are much more difficult to settle. NGN has always maintained that emails were deleted as part of their normal IT systems management. David Sherborne, representing the claimants, said they made serious allegations of criminality against James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks over the destruction of material. Mr Justice Mann criticised both parties for the way the cases had been handled. He said: ""Settlement is a good thingâ¦ even at the court doorsâ¦ however for test cases it raises different issues."" He said that the cases had been a chance to settle the wider issues of whether there had been a ""deliberate cover-up"" and illegal activity at The Sun.

'Text bomb' is latest Apple bugSecurity expert says bug affecting Apple's iPhone and Mac computers is 'nasty' and a nuisance.8h8 hours agoTechnology,"Apple has not yet commented on the latest bug A new ""text bomb"" affecting Apple's iPhone and Mac computers has been discovered. Abraham Masri, a software developer, tweeted about the flaw which typically causes an iPhone to crash and in some cases restart.

Mr Masri said he ""always reports bugs"" before releasing them. Apple has not yet commented on the issue. On a Mac, the bug reportedly makes the Safari browser crash, and causes other slowdowns.

Chris Tarrant guilty of drink-driving,"Chris Tarrant arrived at court with girlfriend Jane Bird Radio host and TV presenter Chris Tarrant was found to be over the drink-drive limit after he was reported to police by a fellow pub-goer. The star had been served four brandy and ports at the Bladebone Inn in Bucklebury, Berkshire, before driving home, Reading Magistrates Court heard. Tarrant, who admitted drink-driving, was banned from driving for a year. After the hearing, he told reporters: ""I made a mistake and I paid for it. I shouldn't have driven."" The Who Wants to be a Millionaire host was found to have 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 microgrammes. The 71-year-old said he ""honestly didn't think"" he had been over the legal limit when he got in his Mercedes to drive the short journey home, on 16 December. Prosecutor Hasrat Ali told the hearing that staff and drinkers at the pub were ""concerned that he had decided to drive home"". ""One member of the public had noticed that Mr Tarrant had stumbled near the bar area,"" she said. As a result of a discussion in the pub, a member of the public phoned the police. Thirteen minutes after the call was made, officers arrived at Tarrant's home in Bucklebury. Ms Ali said: ""He claimed that he had just drank three glasses of wine just prior to police arriving."" But the court was told by Ms Ali that, after failing a breath test and being taken to the police station, Tarrant ""gave a different version of events in the sense that it wasn't three glasses of wine that he had drunk, that in fact he had a large glass of brandy and a glass of wine"". Tarrant's counsel Simon Ray said the drinks that were bought in the pub were not all consumed by his client. He added that the TV presenter had a knee condition that explained the stumble. District Judge Shomon Khan said despite the ""relatively low reading"" nothing he could say would ""reduce the seriousness of the offence"". He also fined Tarrant Â£6,000.

A&E safety risks 'unacceptable',"This video can not be played Dr Tim Rogerson said pressures get worse every year, but this winter was the worst staff had seen Emergency hospital consultants in Wales have written to the first minister claiming safety is being compromised ""to an unacceptable degree"". The group said they recognised funding constraints but said both NHS Wales and the social care sector were ""severely and chronically under-resourced"". December figures show the lowest level of A&E performance since March 2016 but attendances were 5.4% higher than 2017. The Welsh Government said it had been ""open"" about the challenges of winter. Care delay meant five more weeks in hospital Behind the scenes at A&E at Wales' biggest hospital Pressure 'easing' on busy A&E units in England Reality Check: Is NHS funding worse in Wales? 'Revolution' in health and social care urged In December: 78.9% of patients spent less than four hours in all emergency care facilities from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge - the target is 95%. This is 1.5% lower than December 2016 3,741 patients spent 12 hours or more in an emergency care facility, an increase of 769 patients compared to the same month in 2016 70% of ""red"" ambulance calls arrived within eight minutes (against a 65% target) - there were 2,282 of these calls out of nearly 45,000 emergency calls The letter follows a similar onewritten by mostly English hospital consultants to Prime Minister Theresa May last week.,external It said it did not dispute the effort that had gone into winter planning but ""unfortunately our experience from the clinical front line is that these plans have fallen well short of what was required to maintain adequate care for our patients"". The letter from the consultants in Wales goes on to say: ""We have neither sufficient staff nor sufficient beds (in either acute hospitals or the community) to cope with the needs of an ageing population."" They said emergency departments in Wales were ""in some ways"" worse than in England.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you cannot see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external Examples given include staff arriving for work to find patients in the emergency department who were there the previous day and ""multiple"" staff in tears because they feel they cannot deliver the care patients need. The consultants also claimed the four-hour target figures for best performing hospitals in Wales were ""similar to some of our worst performing hospitals in England"". However, official figures show there a number of trusts in England which perform worse than Wales' best performing hospitals. There is a significant variation between the best and worst within Wales - with Morriston in Swansea consistently the worst with only 60% of A&E patients seen within fours; Wrexham Maelor is not far behind on 62.1%. Of the best performing, the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff has slightly improved year-on-year with 81.1% seen within four hours; Prince Charles in Merthyr is the best of the major A&E departments on 82.3%. Retired nurse Ann Steward's late husband, Edward, spent four days on a trolley at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. The 81-year-old was in the last stages of oesophageal cancer and was admitted in October 2017 after he started haemorrhaging. ""He was on a trolley from midday on the Wednesday until early afternoon on the Saturday. ""About 85% of patients with oesophageal cancer actually die of haemorrhaging and that was my great fear. It was terrible. ""As soon as they started to give him the blood transfusion it spurted out over the floor and over the food trolley. My daughter Sian cleaned the food trolley herself. No-one came to clean it. ""He cried on the Friday because he was in so much pain. He couldn't move. To see your husband of 60 years crying like that was so upsetting for all of us."" She said Mr Steward was only given a bed on the Saturday after asking again for one and he was discharged the following Wednesday before being admitted to a hospice where he died on 2 January. ""I feel it's so sad to see that things have deteriorated so badly within nursing itself that it's come to the stage it is at the moment,"" she added. A spokesman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said the family could contact the health board to discuss any concerns. The assessment ward at Wales' biggest A&E department in Cardiff - it was busy due to flu in the week after Christmas One of the signatories, Dr Tim Rogerson, a consultant in emergency medicine at Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital said about the picture across Wales: ""We're on our knees as far as emergency care [is concerned]. ""We have patients coming into emergency departments that are already full. ""There's good evidence that if patients are seen in emergency departments which are crowded, that are full, their treatment is delayed. ""That can actually cause an increase in the length of stay, it can make their illness more severe and in some cases it can cause death, so for safety and patient care we're very, very worried."" The consultants' letter calls on First Minister Carwyn Jones to address issues ""as a matter of urgency"", including reviewing the number of beds available for acute care and a ""significant increase"" in funding for social care. This video can not be played Maria Whale and husband John recount her 12-hour experience after breaking her hip Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said: ""Despite the busiest December on record for our A&E departments and the busiest ever month for the Welsh Ambulance Service, our NHS has continued to perform under exceptional pressure in delivering emergency and scheduled care."" He said the ambulance target was ""comfortably achieved"" in December. A&E attendances above the 1m mark in Wales Winter pressures: What about my area? NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall andMr Gething have already apologised for postponed routine operationsdue to ""exceptional"" demand. On patient care, Dr Goodhall said: ""I think there will be times when the patients are not receiving the care or the access that we would want to move them through the system and it is absolutely true that there will have been some very difficult shifts and periods for staff."" Patterns have been difficult to estimate with increases in demand at different times to those seen last winter. The ambulance service saw a rise of almost 50% in the number of red calls it attended on New Year's Eve and out of hours services were 30% busier on some days. The Welsh Ambulance Service was said to have had a record number of the most urgent calls in December NHS Wales said it had freed up an extra 400 beds over the winter - the equivalent of a new hospital. But Dr David Bailey, chairman of the British Medical Association in Wales, said the lack of spare capacity in hospitals was an issue. ""We get issues with flu every year and more people get sick in winter every year. None of these are unexpected but we need more capacity. ""The problem is the NHS is not really set up to cope with spikes in demands and every spike takes three times longer to recover from."" This video can not be played Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said lessons had to be learned Dr Graham Shortland, medical director at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, said the key was managing patient flow. ""Can we reduce demand through the front door? Can we process patients more quickly in this department? ""Can we move them on to the ward and ultimately move them back quickly, home or to the care of their family?"" But the Welsh Government said it had provided funding to help ease the problems this winter. ""NHS Wales' organisations have been planning for the winter period for some months supported by Â£50m funding from us to help them balance emergency and planned activity,"" a Welsh Government spokesman said. ""Despite cuts to our overall budget we have continued to protect spending on health and social services. Health spending per person grew by 5% in Wales in 2016-17. This is the fastest growth of the four UK countries.""

Facebook selfie leads to killer,"A belt worn by Cheyenne Antoine (L) can be seen as she poses with victim Brittney Gargol A Canadian woman has been convicted of killing her friend after police discovered the murder weapon used in a picture of the pair on social media. Cheyenne Rose Antoine, 21, pleaded guilty on Monday to killing Brittney Gargol, then 18, in March 2015. Gargol was found strangled to death near a landfill in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, with Antoine's belt near her body. Antoine was sentenced to seven years for manslaughter. She was identified as a suspect after she posted a selfie on Facebook of the two of them, showing her wearing the belt hours before Gargol died. The suspects snared by their tech use The show-offs caught out by social media The two were ""inseparable"" friends, reported the Toronto Sun,external- until Gargol was discovered dead on a road by a passerby in the early morning of 25 March 2015. Police said that no evidence could be found to verify the story Antoine first gave to them - which was that the pair had gone from a house party to some bars before Gargol left with an unidentified man, while Antoine went to see her uncle. Once the belt had established Antoine as a suspect, police used Facebook posts to help establish the real movements of the pair. Police realised that Antoine's Facebook post on Gargol's personal page the following morning - ""Where are you? Haven't heard from you. Hope you made it home safe"" - was a diversion. She had also asked her uncle to provide a false alibi. And eventually she confessed to a friend. Antoine now says the pair were drunk and high on marijuana when they got into a heated argument. She accepts she is responsible for strangling her best friend - although she says she doesn't actually remember the events. Yes, and that's why the judge agreed to a seven-year sentence when she pleaded guilty to manslaughter (rather than the second-degree murder she was originally charged with). ""I will never forgive myself. Nothing I say or do will ever bring her back. I am very, very sorry... It shouldn't have ever happened,"" she said in a statement through her lawyer. Her lawyer said her client had suffered years of abuse in the Saskatchewan care system and had gone to police to report abuse by foster parents a month before the killing. ""Honour your friend by becoming a positive member of the community,"" Judge Marilyn Gray told her, according to the Saskatoon Starphoenix,external. ""You owe it to her."" Before Antoine was sentenced, Gargol's aunt gave a victim impact statement to the court. ""Most days we can't stop thinking about Brittney, what happened that night, what she must have felt fighting for her life,"" Jennifer Gargol said. Outside court, her uncle Al Gargol said she was ""a wonderful young person that didn't deserve this and we truly miss her every day"", the Saskatoon Starphoenix said.

Wolf escapes as wind blows down fencesResidents have been warned about the escaped animal and children are being kept inside schools.15m15 minutes agoBerkshire,"This video can not be played The wolf, called Torak, was recaptured after about six hours on the run A wolf which went on the loose for about six hours after escaping from its enclosure has been safely recaptured. The animal, called Torak, was initially thought to have fled from the Wolf Conservation Trust's site in Beenham after strong winds damaged fencing. The sanctuary has now said his enclosure gate may have been left open deliberately. Thames Valley Police said the wolf travelled about eight miles before it was caught near the M4 motorway. The force announced Torak's capture at about 13:40 GMT. A spokesperson said: ""It was safely detained by officers and staff from the sanctuary, who had been working to recapture it.""

Teresa Palmer, who founded the sanctuary in Berkshire, helped encourage the 12-year-old wolf into a caged trailer. She said the gate at the front of Torak's enclosure was open. ""I think somebody deliberately opened the gate. A lot of people don't particularly believe in having animals in captivity."" Ms Palmer added: ""When we were near the wolf trust I was close to him but he was frightened and didn't want to be caught. ""The fact he went through a field of sheep shows he never would have been a danger to the public. ""Now he's given up. He's had his moment of freedom now."" Police tracked Torak from a helicopter with thermal imaging An animal capture expert who was tracking Torak said police would have shot to kill if the wolf had run on to the motorway. Mike Allison, from Animal Capture UK, said: ""That would have been the only option available to prevent human injury or loss of life."" But he added that Torak ""looks the most unaggressive wolf I have ever seen"". The animal fled from the Wolf Conservation Trust site in Beenham It's relief all round here in the village of Curridge where the wolf has been found and, more importantly, not a single shot fired. A dedicated team of animal catchers was on hand to fire a tranquiliser dart and were thankfully not needed. The Wolf Conservation Trust owners managed to bring Torak back into care safe and well. Dog owners who were out for a stroll near me have been asking if it's now safe to walk around here and the answer is yes. Life can get back to normal in this quaint little corner of Berkshire. Thames Valley Police earlier put out a text warning to residents and schools in Berkshire, urging them to stay inside. Officers had also advised members of the public not to approach the wolf if they saw it. After the wolf was captured, a spokesperson said: ""Schools, which were asked to keep pupils indoors, no longer need to do this."" Thames Valley Police sent local residents a text message warning of the wolf on the loose Torak had been spotted at various locations, some more than 10 miles to the west of the sanctuary. Local resident Daniel Brownlie told the BBC he ignored the wolf warning. He said: ""I had a local surgery appointment this morning as I'm off to Malawi at the end of the month. It was a decision between getting malaria tablets or getting eaten by a wolf. I took the risk."" One parent, Tony Roe, had earlier said police officers were outside his child's local primary school by 08:30 to usher pupils inside. He said: ""An officer on the school gate told me a wolf had escaped after wind blew down part of the fence.""

Angelina Jolie gene testing for all?Testing everyone for cancer risk genes would save lives and is cost effective say doctors.10h10 hours agoHealth,"Testing all women for the ""Angelina Jolie gene"", even if not considered at risk, would prevent cancers, save lives and is cost effective, say doctors. The Hollywood actress had her breasts, ovaries and fallopian tubes removed due to the high risk of cancer in her case. Women tend to be offered testing for the corrupted gene if cancer runs in the family. However, the team at Queen Mary University of London says there are added benefits in testing everyone. When women are diagnosed they can be monitored more closely for cancer and many, like Angelina Jolie, have preventive surgery. Breast cancer survival 'unaffected by faulty gene' The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, estimated the impact of screening all 27 million women over 30 in the UK. They said it would: prevent 64,500 more breast cancers prevent 17,500 more ovarian cancers save 12,300 more lives The study also said mass screening would be cost-effective for the health service. Dr Ranjit Manchanda, a consultant gynaecological oncologist and one of the researchers, told the BBC: ""It [would] prevent many more cancers and save many more lives. ""But this is the first step in the process. We can't offer it immediately in the general population. We still need to understand how to deliver it."" Challenges include how to test so many people and how to offer genetic counselling to women affected. Mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 can impair the body's ability to repair damage to DNA in its cells. This can greatly increase the risk of developing cancers. On average, women have a 2% chance of getting ovarian cancer in their lifetime. But in those with BRCA mutations, the chances can increase to between 10% and 60%. Women have a 12.5% risk of getting breast cancer in their lifetime. This goes up to between 45% and 90% with BRCA mutations. Royal Marsden Hospital - Beginners Guide to BRCA,external Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of women's cancer charity The Eve Appeal, said: ""The impact that this study could have on healthcare in the future for these cancers is promising and an exciting step forward in prevention."" Samia al Qadhi, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Care, said the findings were fascinating, but there were still many questions to answer. She said: ""Being tested for a faulty gene is absolutely no walk in the park - preparing for possible life-changing results for a whole family is overwhelming and emotionally draining. ""Support for people tested and for the tough decisions that can follow must be at the heart of any plans for population screening."" The UK's National Screening Committee said it would look at the findings ""with interest"".

'Text bomb' is latest Apple bugSecurity expert says bug affecting Apple's iPhone and Mac computers is 'nasty' and a nuisance.7h7 hours agoTechnology,"Apple has not yet commented on the latest bug A new ""text bomb"" affecting Apple's iPhone and Mac computers has been discovered. Abraham Masri, a software developer, tweeted about the flaw which typically causes an iPhone to crash and in some cases restart. Simply sending a message containing a link which pointed to Mr Masri's code on programming site GitHub would be enough to activate the bug - even if the recipient did not click the link itself. Mr Masri said he ""always reports bugs"" before releasing them. Apple has not yet commented on the issue. On a Mac, the bug reportedly makes the Safari browser crash, and causes other slowdowns. But users should not be alarmed. Security expert Graham Cluleywrote on his blog that the bug,externaldoes not present anything to be particularly worried about - it's merely very annoying. On a Mac computer, the bug reportedly makes the Safari browser crash, and causes other slowdowns ""Something about the so-called ChaiOS bug's code gives your Apple device a brainstorm,"" he wrote. ""Ashamed about the mess it gets itself in, Messages decides the least embarrassing thing to do is to crash. ""Nasty. But, thankfully, more of a nuisance than something that will lead to data being stolen from your computer or a malicious hacker being able to access your files."" After the link did the rounds on social media, Mr Masri removed the code from GitHub, therefore disabling the ""attack"" unless someone was to replicate the code elsewhere. ""I'm not going to re-upload it,"" he said. ""I made my point. Apple needs to take such bugs more seriously."" Bugs in Apple's software have been a recurring problem of late. In November it apologised to its customers for a glaring password flaw which meant its latest Mac operating system could be accessed without a password. Less serious but highly frustrating was a bug that autocorrected the letter ""I"" into a strange symbol.

Residents hit with Â£2m 'Grenfell' billCroydon leaseholders face the bill to replace cladding similar to that used on Grenfell Tower.12h12 hours agoLondon,"Citiscape is on the corner of Frith Road and Drummond Road in Croydon Residents of a privately-owned London tower block with the same cladding as Grenfell Tower may be forced to pay up to Â£2m for replacement panels. Citiscape in Croydon was one of228 buildings to fail safety testsafter thedisaster which claimed 71 lives. With 95 flats affected, each household share could be between Â£13,300 and Â£31,300, to be paid in instalments,the Guardian newspaper reported,external. First Port Property Services said safety was its ""first priority"". Alexandra Blanc, 37, who bought her flat in 2014, said she received a letter asking her to pay more than she earns in a year over a six-week period. ""This situation has become out of control,"" she said. ""I'm very worried about the prospect of losing my flat. I have contacted estate agents to try and sell it but they told me this flat will never sell under those circumstances."" Richard, the relative of a 95-year-old resident, said it was ""unreasonable to make such a demand from a pensioner receiving only the state pension, being barely sufficient to cover the winter bills and his daily upkeep"". The fire at Grenfell Tower killed 71 people in June 2017 First Port said it was ""committed to minimising"" costs while ensuring residents were ""safe and supported"". It added: ""As the property manager, we are discharging our responsibilities under the leasehold agreements and working with residents as closely as possible to find a solution to this very complex situation."" The firm previously told leaseholders the cost of replacing the cladding was likely to be covered through increased service charges. ""We know that this work and the costs are unwelcome. However, as your property manager, our first priority has to be your safety,"" the firm said in a letter. A First Port spokesman said:  ""The Government has pledged to offer support to owners and residents of high-rise buildings. ""However, given the pressing need to undertake these essential safety works and the potential costs to leaseholders, we and others in the property industry welcome any clarity the government can provide on what support will be made available."" A housing ministry spokesman said: ""All of the councils and housing associations we are in discussions with have said they are not going to pass on the costs of essential fire safety measures to individual flat owners within their buildings. ""We are clear we would like to see private sector landlords follow the lead of the social sector and not pass on the costs."" The case is to be taken to a first-tier property tribunal which will determine who should foot the bill on 6 February.

Trump 'has changed view on Mexico wall',"This video can not be played Testing began in December on President Trump's border wall prototypes Donald Trump has denied changing his views on a border wall after his top aide reportedly said the president was ""uninformed"" when he made the promise. White House chief of staff John Kelly told Fox News the president's opinions had evolved since his signature campaign pledge on the US-Mexico wall. Hours later, the president tweeted to say Mexico would still ""directly or indirectly"" pay for the wall. Mexico's foreign ministry said Thursday morning that the country would not pay. They also pushed back against Mr Trump's claim that Mexico is the ""most dangerous country in the world"". ""Even though Mexico has a significant problem with violence, it is plainly false that Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world,"" the ministry said. US media report that the White House chief of staff told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Wednesday that the US would never construct a wall along its entire southern border. Mr Kelly also reportedly said Mexico would never pay for the structure, as Mr Trump has repeatedly vowed. ""Campaigning is very different from governing,"" Mr Kelly said on Wednesday, of Mr Trump's former promise. But speaking to Fox News later the retired general insisted the president was committed to building 700 miles (1,100km) of additional wall along the nearly 2,000-mile border. Last year Mr Trump said his wall would cover 1,000 miles with natural obstacles taking care of the rest. John Kelly (L) was appointed as President Trump's chief of staff in July When Fox News asked Mr Kelly if he had called the president ""uninformed"", he did not deny it. Both the president and his chief of staff cited the estimated cost as $20bn (Â£14bn); Mr Trump had originally put the figure at $10-$12bn. Six things that could topple Trump's wall Mr Kelly said they were now looking at alternative ways to raise funds, including via possible visa fees or renegotiating theNafta trade dealbetween the US, Canada and Mexico. In Thursday morning's tweet, President Trump insisted Mexico would still pick up the costs, possibly ""through longer term reimbursement"". Allow Twitter content?

Bus inferno in Kazakhstan kills 52,"The Kazakh authorities said five people had escaped the blaze including the two drivers A bus has caught fire in north-western Kazakhstan, killing 52 people, the interior ministry has said. Five people managed to get out and were treated by rescue workers on the spot, reports said. The accident happened at 10:30 local time on Thursday (04:30 GMT) in the Irgiz district of Aktobe region. The bus is thought to have been carrying Uzbek citizens to or from Russia along the Samara-Shymkent route, said local media. The route, which is about 2,200km (1,300 miles) long, is frequently used by Uzbek migrant labourers travelling to construction sites in Russia, observers say. Kazakhstan country profile Third of Uzbek workforce 'in jobs abroad' The emergency services ministry told AFP news agency that 55 passengers and two drivers had been aboard the bus. ""Five passengers received medical assistance. The remainder were killed,"" it said in a statement. One of the drivers said the passengers were Uzbek nationals and the vehicle was registered in Kazakhstan, ministry official Ruslan Imankulov told AFP. He said the blaze spread very quickly through the Setra bus. It is unclear what caused the blaze. Emergency officials have opened a telephone hotline for worried relatives.

Travel disruption as high winds hit UK,"This video can not be played An Essex pub and a play centre in Suffolk lost their roofs, while trees were uprooted in Norfolk Engineers will work through the night to restore power to hundreds of homes, after severe gales brought disruption to much of the UK on Thursday. More than 140,000 properties in eastern England suffered earlier power cuts after 83mph (134kph) gusts damaged power lines, UK Power Networks said. Across the UK, high winds brought down trees and damaged homes. A weather warning for snow and ice is in place for Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England until Friday. In Norfolk and Suffolk, 3,500 homes are still without power. And the Queen was left to have her tea and cakes in the dark when her annual appointment with the Sandringham WI wasdisrupted by a power cut. Chairwoman Yvonne Browne, who decided to go ahead with the event despite losing heating and lighting at West Newton village hall, said the Queen was ""laughing and smiling"" throughout.

Angelina Jolie gene testing for all?,"Testing all women for the ""Angelina Jolie gene"", even if not considered at risk, would prevent cancers, save lives and is cost effective, say doctors. The Hollywood actress had her breasts, ovaries and fallopian tubes removed due to the high risk of cancer in her case. Women tend to be offered testing for the corrupted gene if cancer runs in the family. However, the team at Queen Mary University of London says there are added benefits in testing everyone. When women are diagnosed they can be monitored more closely for cancer and many, like Angelina Jolie, have preventive surgery. Breast cancer survival 'unaffected by faulty gene' The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, estimated the impact of screening all 27 million women over 30 in the UK. They said it would: prevent 64,500 more breast cancers prevent 17,500 more ovarian cancers save 12,300 more lives The study also said mass screening would be cost-effective for the health service. Dr Ranjit Manchanda, a consultant gynaecological oncologist and one of the researchers, told the BBC: ""It [would] prevent many more cancers and save many more lives. ""But this is the first step in the process. We can't offer it immediately in the general population. We still need to understand how to deliver it."" Challenges include how to test so many people and how to offer genetic counselling to women affected. Mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 can impair the body's ability to repair damage to DNA in its cells. This can greatly increase the risk of developing cancers. On average, women have a 2% chance of getting ovarian cancer in their lifetime. But in those with BRCA mutations, the chances can increase to between 10% and 60%. Women have a 12.5% risk of getting breast cancer in their lifetime. This goes up to between 45% and 90% with BRCA mutations. Royal Marsden Hospital - Beginners Guide to BRCA,external Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of women's cancer charity The Eve Appeal, said: ""The impact that this study could have on healthcare in the future for these cancers is promising and an exciting step forward in prevention."" Samia al Qadhi, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Care, said the findings were fascinating, but there were still many questions to answer. She said: ""Being tested for a faulty gene is absolutely no walk in the park - preparing for possible life-changing results for a whole family is overwhelming and emotionally draining. ""Support for people tested and for the tough decisions that can follow must be at the heart of any plans for population screening."" The UK's National Screening Committee said it would look at the findings ""with interest"".

'Extreme caution' urged on roads,"The A75 became blocked by jacknifed lorries at a number of points including Gatehouse of Fleet Drivers across Scotland are being advised to ""travel with caution"" after the rush hour passed with minimal disruption on the roads. It steps down Police Scotland advice to stage two after being escalated to stage four ""do not travel"" overnight. A yellow Met Office weather warning for snow and ice is now in place for much of the country until Saturday morning. Police asked drivers ""not to be complacent"" and to keep checking for latest updates on the situation Ch Supt Stewart Carle said: ""Road conditions have improved overnight with less snow falling than was expected. ""As a result of this, and motorists heeding our messages and driving to the conditions this morning, we are now able to advise everyone that despite there no longer being a high risk of disruption, there is still a need for all drivers to take extra caution. ""This means that you should continue to make sure you have sufficient fuel for your journey, and have supplies such as warm clothing, food, water and a fully charged mobile phone, before heading out."" Drivers have been asked not to become complacent as weather warnings remain in place He said nobody should ever put themselves at risk on the road and always give consideration to delaying travel or using public transport. ""The yellow warning for snow and ice is now in place, and with our partners we will continue to keep you updated whether conditions improve or worsen, and if there are any incidents that affect the road network,"" he said.

Four oil slicks seen around sunken tanker,"The toil tanker sank on Sunday An oil spill from an Iranian tanker that sank off China has spread into four separate slicks covering an area of 100 sq km (39 sq miles), say Chinese authorities. The Sanchi was carrying 136,000 tons of ultra-light crude oil when it collided with another vessel 260km off Shanghai on 6 January. It burned for a week before exploding and sinking on Sunday. The crew of 32 are all confirmed or presumed dead. Earlier satellite imagery had shown just two oil slicks. But the latest figures from China's State Oceanic Administration, which monitored the area on Wednesday, said there were now four, ranging in size from 48 sq km to 5.5 sq km. Both the crude oil that was carried on the Sanchi and the fuel that was used to power the vessel could cause devastating damage to marine life. Most condensate oils are colourless Condensate oil, the ultra-light crude oil carried on the ship, differs from the thick black oil slicks usually associated with a spill. It is toxic, low in density and considerably more explosive than regular crude. Most condensates are also colourless and generate a toxic underwater slick that is almost invisible from the surface. China's Ministry of Transport had on Wednesday announced that a salvage team had located the vessel at a depth of 115m (377ft). It said it was preparing to send underwater robots to explore the area. The ministry added that a marine patrol ship had arrived at the site, and crew had begun assessing ways to detect leaks and stop the flow of oil.

Bus fire in Kazakhstan kills 52,"The Kazakh authorities said five people had escaped the blaze including the two drivers A bus has caught fire in north-western Kazakhstan, killing 52 people, the interior ministry has said. Five people managed to get out and were treated by rescue workers on the spot, reports said. The accident happened at 10:30 local time on Thursday (04:30 GMT) in the Irgiz district of Aktobe region. The bus is thought to have been carrying Uzbek citizens to or from Russia along the Samara-Shymkent route, said local media. The route, which is about 2,200km (1,300 miles) long, is frequently used by Uzbek migrant labourers travelling to construction sites in Russia, observers say. Kazakhstan country profile Third of Uzbek workforce 'in jobs abroad' The emergency services ministry told AFP news agency that 55 passengers and two drivers had been aboard the bus. ""Five passengers received medical assistance. The remainder were killed,"" it said in a statement. One of the drivers said the passengers were Uzbek nationals and the vehicle was registered in Kazakhstan, ministry official Ruslan Imankulov told AFP. He said the blaze spread very quickly through the Setra bus. It is unclear what caused the blaze. Emergency officials have opened a telephone hotline for worried relatives. A local journalist, Askar Aktileu, posted a picture of the burned-out wreckage on his Instagram page. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

South Korea 'clear-eyed' about North talksThis comes amid warnings Pyongyang might be playing for time to continue its nuclear arms activity.5h5 hours agoAsia,"This video can not be played South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha: ""We understand North Korea better than anybody"" South Korea says it will continue high-level talks with North Korea with ""clear eyes"" amid global warnings that Pyongyang might be playing for time to continue its nuclear-arms programme. ""We have to make the most"" of the opportunity, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told the BBC. The two Koreas earlier agreed to march under a ""unified Korea"" flag at next month's Winter Olympics in the South. The talks come as the US and its allies vowed to keep pressure on the North. On Wednesday US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said sanctions were ""really starting to hurt"", expressing confidence that the pressure would eventually force the North to the negotiating table over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Last year,US President Donald Trump said that America would destroy North Koreaif forced to defend itself or its allies. Also on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said the world should not be blinded by Pyongyang's recent ""charm offensive"". ""It is not the time to ease pressure or to reward North Korea,"" Mr Kono said, Reuters news agency reported. ""The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working."" Meanwhile, President Trump accused Russia of undermining international sanctions against North Korea. ""Russia is not helping us at all with North Korea,"" he told Reuters. ""What China is helping us with, Russia is denting."" North Korea crisis in 300 words Ms Kang told the BBC: ""I think we understand North Korea better than anybody, having dealt with North Korea for decades, having had series of discussions off and on. ""We haven't had any significant engagement in the recent past - but this is an opportunity. North and South met for the first high-level talks in two years - against a backdrop of mounting military tension ""You can have all kinds of theories of why there are here (at the talks). There are, obviously, calculations going on the part of the North Korea decision-makers as to their actions. ""But in the end we have to make the most of it."" Ms Kang also said South Korea and its allies were ""very much on the same page"" regarding the longer term - the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. And the foreign minister said Seoul wanted more humanitarian aid to be sent to North Korea as sanctions were beginning to take effect. If the plans are realised, a hundreds-strong North Korean delegation - including 230 cheerleaders, 140 orchestral musicians and 30 taekwondo athletes - could attend the Winter Olympics. The ""reunited"" flag symbolises aspirations in both the North and South to end the nearly seven decades of division It will mean the opening of the cross-border road for the first time in almost two years. The two countries have also agreed to field a joint team for the sport of women's ice hockey. It would be the first time athletes from both Koreas have competed together. The Games will take place in February in Pyeongchang. The North has also agreed to send a smaller, 150-member delegation to the Paralympics in March. The agreement will have to be approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting on Saturday, because North Korea has missed registration deadlines or failed to qualify. South Korea will also need to find ways to host the North Korean delegation without violating UN Security Council sanctions outlawing cash transfers to Pyongyang and blacklisting certain senior North officials. Winter Olympics: How good is North Korea at sport? North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive South Korea's hockey coach and conservative newspapers have expressed concern about the prospect of a united hockey team, saying it could damage South Korea's chances of winning a medal. Tens of thousands of people are said to have signed online petitions urging President Moon Jae-in to scrap the plan. But the liberal leader told South Korean Olympic athletes on Wednesday that the North's participation in the Games would help improve inter-Korean relations. The talks came after tensions on the Korean peninsula reached their highest point in decades. This is because North Korea has made rapid advances in its nuclear and conventional weapons programmes in recent years. Its latest ballistic missile test, in November, sparked a series of fresh sanctions from the UN targeting petrol shipments and travel. Soon afterwards North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was ""open to dialogue"". In a New Year speech, he said he was considering sending a team to the Winter Olympics. The breakthrough announcement that the North would be sending a delegation came on 9 January. It was also agreed that a military hotline between the nations, suspended for nearly two years, would be reinstated. Analysts say the sudden and dramatic change after months of tension between the Koreas is a positive sign. But few believe Pyongyang has any intention of giving up its nuclear arsenal or halting tests. Experts say Kim Jong-un has become increasingly fearful that the US is planning a military strike against him, and has decided he must do something to de-escalate tensions. South Korea's president must try to engage the North in genuine dialogue, while not upsetting his very sceptical American ally. It remains to be seen whether the inter-Korean talks can provide a starting point for tackling bigger problems - there may be a lull during the Olympics, but what happens after that is far from clear. Previous efforts at rapprochement - notably the Sunshine Policy 20 years ago - did not lead to peace.

"Parents subsidise 'free' nursery schemeThe government's 30-hour 'free' nursery scheme is being subsidised by parents, a survey suggests.4h4 hours agoFamily & Education","This video can not be played Pre-school owner, Toby Evans, says he has asked parents for voluntary contributions Parents are subsidising a new flagship ""free"" nursery scheme for three- and four-year-olds in England from their own pockets, a survey suggests. Nurseries are making up losses by upping fees for younger children and charging for meals and nappies, a survey of 1,662 providers suggests. The survey, by the Pre-School Learning Alliance, suggests only a third are delivering the hours totally free. The government says it is investing Â£6bn in childcare by 2020. It added that any charges to parents on the scheme must be voluntary. The poll of nurseries, pre-schools and childminders is the first to be carried out since the 30-hour free childcare scheme came into effect in September, and has been shared exclusively with the BBC. Families where both parents are working more than 16 hours a week, but earning under Â£100,000 each, qualify for the scheme. It expands the number of free hours childcare for this age group from 15 a week. But nurseries and pre-schools have long warned they will struggle to make ends meet because the hourly rates they are receiving from the government are too low. Nurseries and pre-schools have already been cross-subsidising the previous entitlement of 15 hours a week with fees from non-government funded children. According to the survey, conducted online among alliance members, over a third said they were making up losses by upping fees for younger children. And charges for items such as meals and nappies are also being made at a third of the settings that responded. Most said the hourly rates they were receiving from the government were below what they charged parents not on the scheme and failed to cover their costs. And  a fifth thought they may not be financially sustainable by next year. Some already have closed their doors. And numerous local authorities are no longer promoting the scheme as ""free"", instead referring to the hours as ""funded"" in their advertising instead. One nursery told the alliance: ""Funding rate not increased for the seventh year, coupled with cost of increased pension contributions and increase in living wage and minimum wage, we are seriously concerned about our future survival."" More than three-quarters (some 77%) said if the funding stayed the same next year, it would have a negative impact on the business - 44% described that negative impact as ""significant"". Another provider said: ""It does not currently seem financially sustainable. If the funding rate does not increase, the only way we can still offer the places is by charging for extras, [in other words] charging for the gap in underfunding."" Chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance Neil Leitch said: ""It's clear from these findings that the government's flagship childcare policy is failing both providers and parents. ""Respondents have laid out in black and white that the 30 hours policy is simply not working, with a continued lack of adequate funding leaving many with no option but to pass the funding shortfall on to parents. ""This has left parents to pay the price for government underfunding through often unexpected charges for things like nappies, food and trips, while the government continues to claim that it's delivering on its promise of 'free' childcare."" He said that since the policy had been announced, the childcare sector had repeatedly said the scheme would not be sustainable in the long term. ""Thousands of parents and providers have now joined ourFair Future Funding campaign,externalto demonstrate their concerns. ""The government should not have needed more evidence of a childcare funding crisis - but here it is."" He added that if ministers did not want to leave parents picking up the tab, or more nursery closures, they needed to increase funding urgently. The National Day Nurseries Association chief executive Purnima Tanuku said: ""These are extremely worrying findings and sadly echo our own research over the last year. ""The government needs to be honest with providers and parents that 30 hours funded childcare is not 'free'. ""There is a significant shortfall between government funding rates and the cost to nurseries of providing childcare."" For example, in Suffolk the funding rate is Â£3.87 per child, per hour, compared to the Â£5.20 per child, per hour it costs to deliver a place. A Department for Education spokesperson said:  ""We are investing a record amount of around Â£6 billion every year by 2020 in childcare and have doubled the free childcare available to working parents to 30 hours a week, saving them up to Â£5,000 a year per child. ""Providers can choose whether to offer 30 hours and what pattern of days and hours they offer parents. We have always been clear that government funding is not intended to cover the costs of meals or additional services. ""However, while providers can charge parents for additional extras, this cannot be a condition of the child's place.""

Bonuses for Carillion bosses are blockedFormer executives at the failed construction firm will not get severance payments or bonuses.8h8 hours agoBusiness,"Bosses and directors of Carillion will not get bonuses or severance payments, the government has said. The Insolvency Service said no such payments had been made since the construction firm collapsed on Monday. The announcement comes as work on Carillion's public sector construction sites is paused pending decisions about their future. However, work on most of its private sector service contracts, such as catering and cleaning, will carry on. Carillion's customers want existing services to continue until new suppliers can be found and will provide funding to retain staff for the moment. Several former executives of the firm would have received pay and benefits this year. Carillion had agreed to keep paying former chief executive Richard Howson a Â£660,000 salary and Â£28,000 in benefits until October as part of his departure deal. Former finance chief Zafar Khan, who left Carillion in September, was due to receive Â£425,000 in base salary for 12 months Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane was due to be paid his Â£750,000 salary until July, despite being due to leave next month. On Wednesday, Business Secretary Greg Clark met representatives of some banks to seek assurances that they would support small businesses affected by the Carillion collapse. Afterwards, he said UK lenders were ready to give ""tailored support"" and flexibility when it came to repayments. About 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector face an uncertain future and are waiting to learn whether they will be able to get hold of money owed to them. HMRCsaid it will also help affected contractors,external, offering them more time to pay tax bills and providing workers with cash support through the tax credits system. Mapping Carillion's biggest construction projects Carillion was left with just Â£29m before going bankrupt 'Sites are silent and virtually deserted' Carillion apprentices among casualties At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit out at the ""wildly excessive"" bonuses paid to Carillion directors. He also accused the government of negligence, saying it awarded contracts to Carillion even when it became clear the company had problems. Mr Corbyn also called on the government to end the ""costly racket"" of private sector firms running public services. Mrs May said a third of government contracts with Carillion were agreed by the previous Labour administration, adding she wanted to provide ""good quality public services, delivered at best value to the taxpayer"". Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict Earlier GMB union boss Tim Roache had said the government's response to the Carillion crisis had been ""inadequate and inept"". He said that his union had called on Mr Clark to set up a task force to help private sector companies and employees affected by Carillion's collapse. He called on other private sector companies to take on affected workers without a change in their terms and conditions - a process that he admitted would not be a short one.

He toldBBC 5 live Breakfastthey had withdrawn the cleaner they had working full-time in a local prison. ""We'd been chasing them for money, we hadn't been paid since July and when we heard the rumours about a week-and-a-half ago that Carillion were in a lot of trouble, we really pressed. ""Fortunately for ourselves, we did actually get paid the money that was owed to us for the work that she'd done between August and November. ""We've pulled our cleaner out at the moment and we're just still waiting to hear from them what's happening next before we send her back in again. ""It looks like we are going to lose the December invoice money that we've sent them and obviously the first two weeks of January. ""It's been an ongoing battle since we've been in there to get paid and we're not prepared to take the risk while they're in liquidation. ""Until we see something in black and white saying that, 'Yes, you will get paid on these set terms,' then we will consider sending our cleaner back in again."" Carillion went into liquidation on Monday after rescue talks with its lenders and the government failed to reach a deal. The UK's second-biggest construction company ran into trouble after losing money on big contracts and running up debt of about Â£1.5bn. The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, including 20,000 in the UK, and the government has said staff and contractors working on public sector contracts will continue to be paid.

South Korea 'clear-eyed' about North talks,"This video can not be played South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha: ""We understand North Korea better than anybody"" South Korea says it will continue high-level talks with North Korea with ""clear eyes"" amid global warnings that Pyongyang might be playing for time to continue its nuclear-arms programme. ""We have to make the most"" of the opportunity, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told the BBC. The two Koreas earlier agreed to march under a ""unified Korea"" flag at next month's Winter Olympics in the South. The talks come as the US and its allies vowed to keep pressure on the North. On Wednesday US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said sanctions were ""really starting to hurt"", expressing confidence that the pressure would eventually force the North to the negotiating table over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Last year,US President Donald Trump said that America would destroy North Koreaif forced to defend itself or its allies. Also on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said the world should not be blinded by Pyongyang's recent ""charm offensive"". ""It is not the time to ease pressure or to reward North Korea,"" Mr Kono said, Reuters news agency reported. ""The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working."" Meanwhile, President Trump accused Russia of undermining international sanctions against North Korea. ""Russia is not helping us at all with North Korea,"" he told Reuters. ""What China is helping us with, Russia is denting."" North Korea crisis in 300 words Ms Kang told the BBC: ""I think we understand North Korea better than anybody, having dealt with North Korea for decades, having had series of discussions off and on. ""We haven't had any significant engagement in the recent past - but this is an opportunity. North and South met for the first high-level talks in two years - against a backdrop of mounting military tension ""You can have all kinds of theories of why there are here (at the talks). There are, obviously, calculations going on the part of the North Korea decision-makers as to their actions. ""But in the end we have to make the most of it."" Ms Kang also said South Korea and its allies were ""very much on the same page"" regarding the longer term - the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. And the foreign minister said Seoul wanted more humanitarian aid to be sent to North Korea as sanctions were beginning to take effect. If the plans are realised, a hundreds-strong North Korean delegation - including 230 cheerleaders, 140 orchestral musicians and 30 taekwondo athletes - could attend the Winter Olympics. The ""reunited"" flag symbolises aspirations in both the North and South to end the nearly seven decades of division It will mean the opening of the cross-border road for the first time in almost two years. The two countries have also agreed to field a joint team for the sport of women's ice hockey. It would be the first time athletes from both Koreas have competed together. The Games will take place in February in Pyeongchang. The North has also agreed to send a smaller, 150-member delegation to the Paralympics in March. The agreement will have to be approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting on Saturday, because North Korea has missed registration deadlines or failed to qualify. South Korea will also need to find ways to host the North Korean delegation without violating UN Security Council sanctions outlawing cash transfers to Pyongyang and blacklisting certain senior North officials. Winter Olympics: How good is North Korea at sport? North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive South Korea's hockey coach and conservative newspapers have expressed concern about the prospect of a united hockey team, saying it could damage South Korea's chances of winning a medal. Tens of thousands of people are said to have signed online petitions urging President Moon Jae-in to scrap the plan. But the liberal leader told South Korean Olympic athletes on Wednesday that the North's participation in the Games would help improve inter-Korean relations. The talks came after tensions on the Korean peninsula reached their highest point in decades. This is because North Korea has made rapid advances in its nuclear and conventional weapons programmes in recent years. Its latest ballistic missile test, in November, sparked a series of fresh sanctions from the UN targeting petrol shipments and travel. Soon afterwards North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was ""open to dialogue"". In a New Year speech, he said he was considering sending a team to the Winter Olympics. The breakthrough announcement that the North would be sending a delegation came on 9 January. It was also agreed that a military hotline between the nations, suspended for nearly two years, would be reinstated. Analysts say the sudden and dramatic change after months of tension between the Koreas is a positive sign. But few believe Pyongyang has any intention of giving up its nuclear arsenal or halting tests. Experts say Kim Jong-un has become increasingly fearful that the US is planning a military strike against him, and has decided he must do something to de-escalate tensions. South Korea's president must try to engage the North in genuine dialogue, while not upsetting his very sceptical American ally. It remains to be seen whether the inter-Korean talks can provide a starting point for tackling bigger problems - there may be a lull during the Olympics, but what happens after that is far from clear. Previous efforts at rapprochement - notably the Sunshine Policy 20 years ago - did not lead to peace.

Taxpayers 'owe Â£199bn for PFI deals',"Highways England is considering using private finance for the Â£1.3bn tunnel near Stonehenge Financing projects such as schools and hospitals privately costs taxpayers billions of pounds more than public sector alternatives, parliament's spending watchdog says. A report suggests a group of schools cost 40% more to build and a hospital 70% more to construct than if they were financed by government borrowing. TheNational Audit Office report,externalidentifies costs and benefits of PFI. The Treasury said it only approved PFI contracts that were value for money. The collapse of Carillion, which was working on numerous PFI projects, has renewed criticism of such schemes. The NAO report, which was written before the collapse of Carillion, found 716 public projects were active under PFI and its successor PF2, with annual costs amounting to Â£10.3bn in 2016/17. PFI projects will cost the taxpayer a further Â£199bn by the 2040s, it said. The watchdog said the cost of raising capital was higher for PFI projects compared with government-raised funds, and found there were other additional costs. However, the government said PFI projects improved public services, offered better value for money and shifted risk away from the public sector. A spokesperson said the Treasury disagreed with the NAO's analysis that privately financed projects were 40% more expensive, because the NAO had not looked at all the more than 700 PFI schemes in operation. The 40% figure comes from an analysis of 12 current privately financed school building projects in north west England, as measured against the NAO's estimate of the costs if they had been financed publicly. Mapping Carillion's biggest construction projects Carillion was left with just Â£29m before going bankrupt PFI contracts were first introduced under John Major's Conservative government. Under such deals, private consortiums build facilities such as schools, hospitals and roads, in return for regular payments over as many as 30 years. Liverpool City Council is paying more than Â£4m each year for Parklands High School which stands empty and unused. The secondary school which boasts sports hall, canteen and science labs was used for only ten years before it was put into special measures by Ofsted, and closed down in 2014. It is now dubbed a ""ghost school"" by locals. The school cost an estimated Â£24 million to build and between now and the end of the contract 2028, will incur a bill of Â£47 million, which includes interest, debt and facilities management payments. PFI use proliferated under Tony Blair's Labour government, but PFIs fell out of favour after the 2008 financial crisis, as the cost of private finance increased and as questions were raised over their efficacy. Since then, the Departments for Health and Education have used the new PF2s which the Treasury argues are more transparent and ""better value for money"". ""Taxpayer money is protected... as the risks of construction and long-term maintenance of a project are transferred to the private sector,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. However, the NAO said there had never been a ""robust evaluation"" of  the benefits. It said the expected spend on one group of schools financed by PF2 were around 40% higher than the costs of a similar project financed by government borrowing. It also said Treasury Committee analysis from 2011 estimated the cost of a privately financed hospital was 70% higher than a comparative project in the public sector. The watchdog highlighted the increased cost of borrowing which it said was 2% to 3.75% higher for PFIs compared to state borrowing. ""Small changes to the cost of capital can have a significant impact on costs,"" the report said. ""Paying off a debt of Â£100m over 30 years with interest of 2% costs Â£34m in interest. At 4% this more than doubles to Â£73m."" Last year Greater Manchester chose to end a Â£3bn PFI contract with a private sector consortium 17 years early citing ""cost savings"" The report also identified other reasons for higher costs at PFIs including insurance, fees for external advisors, fees for arranging borrowing and the cost of producing and auditing accounts. The report said PFI was designed to limit uncertainty over cost over-runs and provide incentives for better long-term maintenance of assets. But Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the NAO had found ""little evidence"" that PFI's benefits offset its additional costs. ""I am concerned that Treasury has re-launched PFI under new branding, without doing anything about most of its underlying problems,"" she said. ""We need more investment in our schools and hospitals but if we get the contracts wrong, taxpayers pay the price."" But she said many local bodies were now ""shackled to inflexible PFI contracts that are exorbitantly expensive to change."" The GMB union said it showed PFI to be ""a catastrophic waste of taxpayers' money"" and that it should mean ""the game is up for PFI"". At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the government to end the ""costly racket"" of private sector firms running public services.

"A&E safety risks 'unacceptable'Hospital safety is being ""compromised to an unacceptable degree"", Welsh emergency consultants warn.4m5 minutes agoWales","This video can not be played Dr Tim Rogerson said pressures get worse every year, but this winter was the worst staff had seen Emergency hospital consultants in Wales have written to the first minister claiming safety is being compromised ""to an unacceptable degree"". The group said they recognised funding constraints but said both NHS Wales and the social care sector were ""severely and chronically under-resourced"". December figures show the lowest level of A&E performance since March 2016 but attendances were 5.4% higher than 2017. The Welsh Government said it had been ""open"" about the challenges of winter. Care delay meant five more weeks in hospital Behind the scenes at A&E at Wales' biggest hospital Pressure 'easing' on busy A&E units in England Reality Check: Is NHS funding worse in Wales? 'Revolution' in health and social care urged In December: 78.9% of patients spent less than four hours in all emergency care facilities from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge - the target is 95%. This is 1.5% lower than December 2016 3,741 patients spent 12 hours or more in an emergency care facility, an increase of 769 patients compared to the same month in 2016 70% of ""red"" ambulance calls arrived within eight minutes (against a 65% target) - there were 2,282 of these calls out of nearly 45,000 emergency calls The letter follows a similar onewritten by mostly English hospital consultants to Prime Minister Theresa May last week.,external It said it did not dispute the effort that had gone into winter planning but ""unfortunately our experience from the clinical front line is that these plans have fallen well short of what was required to maintain adequate care for our patients"". The letter from the consultants in Wales goes on to say: ""We have neither sufficient staff nor sufficient beds (in either acute hospitals or the community) to cope with the needs of an ageing population."" They said emergency departments in Wales were ""in some ways"" worse than in England.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you cannot see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external Examples given include staff arriving for work to find patients in the emergency department who were there the previous day and ""multiple"" staff in tears because they feel they cannot deliver the care patients need. The consultants also claimed the four-hour target figures for best performing hospitals in Wales were ""similar to some of our worst performing hospitals in England"". However, official figures show there a number of trusts in England which perform worse than Wales' best performing hospitals. There is a significant variation between the best and worst within Wales - with Morriston in Swansea consistently the worst with only 60% of A&E patients seen within fours; Wrexham Maelor is not far behind on 62.1%. Of the best performing, the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff has slightly improved year-on-year with 81.1% seen within four hours; Prince Charles in Merthyr is the best of the major A&E departments on 82.3%. Retired nurse Ann Steward's late husband, Edward, spent four days on a trolley at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. The 81-year-old was in the last stages of oesophageal cancer and was admitted in October 2017 after he started haemorrhaging. ""He was on a trolley from midday on the Wednesday until early afternoon on the Saturday. ""About 85% of patients with oesophageal cancer actually die of haemorrhaging and that was my great fear. It was terrible. ""As soon as they started to give him the blood transfusion it spurted out over the floor and over the food trolley. My daughter Sian cleaned the food trolley herself. No-one came to clean it. ""He cried on the Friday because he was in so much pain. He couldn't move. To see your husband of 60 years crying like that was so upsetting for all of us."" She said Mr Steward was only given a bed on the Saturday after asking again for one and he was discharged the following Wednesday before being admitted to a hospice where he died on 2 January. ""I feel it's so sad to see that things have deteriorated so badly within nursing itself that it's come to the stage it is at the moment,"" she added. A spokesman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said the family could contact the health board to discuss any concerns. The assessment ward at Wales' biggest A&E department in Cardiff - it was busy due to flu in the week after Christmas One of the signatories, Dr Tim Rogerson, a consultant in emergency medicine at Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital said about the picture across Wales: ""We're on our knees as far as emergency care [is concerned]. ""We have patients coming into emergency departments that are already full. ""There's good evidence that if patients are seen in emergency departments which are crowded, that are full, their treatment is delayed. ""That can actually cause an increase in the length of stay, it can make their illness more severe and in some cases it can cause death, so for safety and patient care we're very, very worried."" The consultants' letter calls on First Minister Carwyn Jones to address issues ""as a matter of urgency"", including reviewing the number of beds available for acute care and a ""significant increase"" in funding for social care. This video can not be played Maria Whale and husband John recount her 12-hour experience after breaking her hip Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said: ""Despite the busiest December on record for our A&E departments and the busiest ever month for the Welsh Ambulance Service, our NHS has continued to perform under exceptional pressure in delivering emergency and scheduled care."" He said the ambulance target was ""comfortably achieved"" in December. A&E attendances above the 1m mark in Wales Winter pressures: What about my area? NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall andMr Gething have already apologised for postponed routine operationsdue to ""exceptional"" demand. On patient care, Dr Goodhall said: ""I think there will be times when the patients are not receiving the care or the access that we would want to move them through the system and it is absolutely true that there will have been some very difficult shifts and periods for staff."" Patterns have been difficult to estimate with increases in demand at different times to those seen last winter. The ambulance service saw a rise of almost 50% in the number of red calls it attended on New Year's Eve and out of hours services were 30% busier on some days. The Welsh Ambulance Service was said to have had a record number of the most urgent calls in December NHS Wales said it had freed up an extra 400 beds over the winter - the equivalent of a new hospital. But Dr David Bailey, chairman of the British Medical Association in Wales, said the lack of spare capacity in hospitals was an issue. ""We get issues with flu every year and more people get sick in winter every year. None of these are unexpected but we need more capacity. ""The problem is the NHS is not really set up to cope with spikes in demands and every spike takes three times longer to recover from."" This video can not be played Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said lessons had to be learned Dr Graham Shortland, medical director at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, said the key was managing patient flow. ""Can we reduce demand through the front door? Can we process patients more quickly in this department? ""Can we move them on to the ward and ultimately move them back quickly, home or to the care of their family?"" But the Welsh Government said it had provided funding to help ease the problems this winter. ""NHS Wales' organisations have been planning for the winter period for some months supported by Â£50m funding from us to help them balance emergency and planned activity,"" a Welsh Government spokesman said. ""Despite cuts to our overall budget we have continued to protect spending on health and social services. Health spending per person grew by 5% in Wales in 2016-17.

"Man City knew of abuse, Bennell trial toldAn alleged victim of ex-football coach Barry Bennell says a chief scout was aware of abuse claims.10h10 hours agoUK","Senior figures at Manchester City knew about sexual abuse happening at the club, a victim giving evidence against former football coach Barry Bennell has said in court. Mr Bennell, who worked as a coach for various youth teams, denies sexually abusing 11 boys between 1979 and 1990. He has admitted one count of indecent abuse of the same victim, who played for a junior Manchester City team. The victim told Liverpool Crown Court he wanted the club to apologise. He said in his evidence that he thought chief scout Ken Barnes knew about the alleged abuse. Mr Barnes played for City between 1950 and 1961. He died in 2010. The man, the fifth complainant to give evidence against Mr Bennell in the trial, also named Mike Grimsley, who managed a Manchester City youth team, as another staff member he believed was aware of claims made against Mr Bennell. He claimed he was abused more than 100 times by Mr Bennell, who is now known as Richard Jones, over a period of four years. He said: ""I want an apology off Manchester City and anyone else, if possible,"" adding that he had asked a specialist lawyer to help him investigate the club. When cross-examined by defence lawyer, Eleanor Laws, the man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - denied seeking compensation. ""If you think I am going to put myself through this, talk about being raped over 100 times, put myself through two-and-a-half years of this for damages, you are wrong,"" he said. He also denied speaking to other alleged victims about seeking compensation, saying they spoke to each other for support. ""It's almost like a suicide watch,"" he added. Ms Laws asked the alleged victim if he had called an NSPCC helpline, set up in November 2016, to tell them Dario Gradi, former manager of Crewe Alexandra where Mr Bennell was a coach, had been aware of the abuse. He told the court that he could not recall doing so. A further witness giving evidence in the trial, who also cannot be named, said he knew of four people who had worked with Mr Bennell who then went on to take their own lives. He added: ""Whether they have taken their lives due to Barry solely I don't know but all I know is how it's had an impact on me and how it could impact on other people."" He said one of the four people who had taken their own lives was Gary Speed, the former Wales manager who hanged himself in 2011. He said he had tried to contact Mr Speed's parents, because he had read in a newspaper that they had not been able to get closure because they had no explanation for his death. Mr Bennell is appearing in court via videolink due to illness. The trial is expected to last eight weeks.

Extra Â£44m for Channel border security,"This video can not be played President Macron: ""I respect Brexit although I regret it"" France and the UK have signed a treaty to speed up the processing of migrants in Calais, French President Emmanuel Macron announced on his first UK visit. After talks with UK PM Theresa May at Sandhurst military academy, he said the treaty would offer a ""more humane approach"" and be ""more efficient"". But he suggested France would not bow to UK demands to include financial services in any post-Brexit trade deal. Mrs May praised the ""uniquely close relationship"" between the two nations. She said both leaders remained committed to the ""Le Touquet"" border agreement in Calais - the UK has announced an extra Â£44.5m to be spent on beefing up Channel border security. John Pienaar: Why getting on well with France matters Smiling Macron and May pose for selfie What now for UK-France security relations? Mr Macron said the Sandhurst Treaty signed on Thursday - the first joint treaty on the Calais border in 15 years - would ""enable us to improve the relationship and the management of the joint border"" and reduce the time taken to process migrants. It would mean the time taken to process migrants hoping to come to the UK from Calais, would be reduced from six months to one month for adults and 25 days for children. It ""will enable us both to have a more humane approach to these people and to be more efficient"" while also encouraging trade through the Channel ports, said the president. Mrs May said it was in Britain's national interest, as well as France's, to commit more resources to Calais security and stressed the two countries' joint commitments to defence and security measures. She said a combined joint expeditionary force would be ready to deploy up to 10,000 troops ""quickly and effectively to face any threat"" by 2020. Bayeux Tapestry to be displayed in UK In depth: The meteoric rise of Macron And the prime minister said a multi-million pound deal to build 36 A380 passenger aircraft for Emirates Airlines had been signed by Airbus, which has plants in France and the UK. She also confirmed thatthe Bayeux Tapestry will come to the UK in 2022- a gesture President Macron said he hoped would ""open a new chapter when it comes to our cultural co-operation and scientific co-operation"". ""We are making a new tapestry together,"" he said. This video can not be played Bayeux Tapestry explained... by kids The summit between Mrs May and Mr Macron, at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Berkshire, also featured the first meeting of the heads of Britain and France's five intelligence agencies, and is being attended by British cabinet ministers and their French counterparts. And with Brexit very much on the agenda for both nations, Mr Macron said that the history between the two countries could not be ""impacted by changes in institutions"". Challenged about his opposition to including financial services in any EU-UK free trade agreement, he said: ""I am here neither to punish nor to reward. I want to make sure that the single market is preserved because that is very much the heart of the EU."" He said if the UK wanted access to the single market, including financial services, ""be my guest. But it means that you need to contribute to the budget and acknowledge European jurisdiction"". Mrs May said she recognised that there would be ""a different relationship in future"" but added: ""I think the City of London will continue to be a major global financial centre. That is an advantage not just for the UK, it's actually good for Europe and good for the global financial system."" Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has hinted at the prospect of a second crossing for the English Channel -tweeting,external: ""Our economic success depends on good infrastructure and good connections. Should the Channel Tunnel be just a first step?"" A source close to the foreign secretary told the BBC that Mr Johnson had suggested to President Macron that a new ""fixed link"" between UK and France was needed. Other commitments include the deployment of three RAF Chinook helicopters in Mali, where French forces are fighting Islamist militants, and France sending more troops to reinforce a British contingent in Estonia on Nato's border with Russia. Downing Street said the RAF Chinooks would offer a ""niche capability"", providing logistical support for the French operation in Mali, but that Britain would not be committing combat troops. During last year's French election campaign, Mr Macron said he wanted to renegotiate or scrap the 2003 Le Touquet agreement, which established French border controls in Britain and UK controls in Calais. The agreement means undocumented migrants barred from entering the UK stay in France - many in makeshift camps. Up to 700 migrants are in the area, despite the camp known as the ""Jungle"" having been dismantled in 2016. The UK government is already thought to have spent more than Â£100m on security in the area over the past three years, and officials said the number of illegal attempts to enter the UK fell from 80,000 in 2015 to just over 30,000 last year. Other ""juxtaposed"" border controls are in operation at Eurostar stations in France and Belgium. By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Britain and France carry much the same weight in global affairs. Both sit at the world's most exclusive tables of power - the Security Council and the G7 - and the sizes of their populations and economies are broadly similar too. But while President Macron commands France, including his parliament, after last year's stunning electoral successes - the same cannot be said of Theresa May. Sharp disagreements over the UK border with France are difficult to resolve. Mrs May has conceded extra money for border security in Calais - and has separately offered Chinook helicopters to move French troops more safely over Mali. Mr Macron, meanwhile, has offered the loan of the Bayeux tapestry. But Brexit still threatens to overshadow all this bonhomie. When it comes to Europe, these two countries are pulling in radically different directions.

'Sites are silent and deserted',"The timetables of big UK building projects have been thrown into doubt by the collapse of Carillion. Major new hospitals in Liverpool and the West Midlands face further delays after the liquidation of the UK's second biggest construction firm. Work has yet to restart on those sites, causing uncertainty among workers and contractors about the next steps. Other firms will also need to step in to finish road and rail projects spanning the UK. Carillion leaves behind major transport projects in places including Aberdeen and Yorkshire after its collapse on Monday. But the biggest concerns are for the new Royal Liverpool Hospital and the Midland Metropolitan Hospital. Carillion directors to be investigated Apprentices given notice after collapse 'Not alone in hitting problems' Toby Lewis, chief executive of the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, said local healthcare partners were ""anxious to re-establish timescale clarity"" for the Midland Metropolitan Hospital. The overdue 669-bed hospital is ""two-thirds built"" and ministers have reassured staff that it remains a priority, he said. The Liverpool hospital is closer to completion and will be finished, but its opening date is unclear after it was pushed back again by Carillion in December, according to the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust. It looks all quiet at the site of the new Â£335m Royal Hospital in Liverpool. Despite all the lights being on in the building, there appeared to be no work taking place. One person on site, who did not want to be identified, said there were 100 staff there - both Carillion and subcontractors. He said they had been told that another company would come in to oversee the work on the new hospital and that work would start again next week. Workers and subcontractors were briefed today and ""reassured that any work that they undertake going forward will be paid for"", according to the local hospital trust. But the statement makes no mention of any back pay. Looking at defaced signs to be found around the outside of site, this seems to be a major concern. The new Midlands Metropolitan Hospital is two thirds complete Normally buzzing with workers and activity, the 16-acre site where a new hospital is being built in Smethwick, near Birmingham, is nearly deserted. A Carillion worker, who did not want to be named, said there were normally some 500 sub-contractors on site, but today there were about 20 people in total. ""It's quiet here because most of the sub contractors have not come because they are worried about the job,"" they said. The worker, who said he learned the firm had gone into liquidation from its Facebook page, added he will get paid for this week and next but after that did not know what would happen. The man, and another worker who had been with Carillion for more than 10 years, hope the project will continue and keep them on. Pressure is mounting on a number of other Carillion construction contracts. In South Yorkshire, there is concern about the tram-train project between Rotherham and Sheffield, which was already over budget and behind schedule. Labour MP Sarah Champion said: ""We're already two years over time, we're already 400% over budget, and I just don't want the government to see this as an excuse - with Carillion going who are the main deliverer - to actually can it."" Some of Carillion's other contracts in England and Wales include: A contract for widening the A14 in Cambridgeshire Regeneration of a former brewery in Sunderland, which has ceased with immediate effect Removing roundabouts on the A55 in North Wales The Scottish government has sought to reassure drivers that a major roads project in Aberdeen will not necessarily be delayed by Carillion's demise. Economy Secretary Keith Brown said Carillion's partners were committed to filling the shortfall in the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) project.

âLittle evidenceâ of PFI advantages,"Highways England is considering using private finance for the Â£1.3bn tunnel near Stonehenge Financing projects such as schools and hospitals privately costs taxpayers billions of pounds more than public sector alternatives, parliament's spending watchdog says. A report suggests a group of schools cost 40% more to build and a hospital 70% more to construct than if they were financed by government borrowing. TheNational Audit Office report,externalidentifies costs and benefits of PFI. The Treasury said it only approved PFI contracts that were value for money. The collapse of Carillion, which was working on numerous PFI projects, has renewed criticism of such schemes. The NAO report, which was written before the collapse of Carillion, found 716 public projects were active under PFI and its successor PF2, with annual costs amounting to Â£10.3bn in 2016/17. PFI projects will cost the taxpayer a further Â£199bn by the 2040s, it said. The watchdog said the cost of raising capital was higher for PFI projects compared with government-raised funds, and found there were other additional costs. However, the government said PFI projects improved public services, offered better value for money and shifted risk away from the public sector. A spokesperson said the Treasury disagreed with the NAO's analysis that privately financed projects were 40% more expensive, because the NAO had not looked at all the more than 700 PFI schemes in operation. The 40% figure comes from an analysis of 12 current privately financed school building projects in north west England, as measured against the NAO's estimate of the costs if they had been financed publicly. Mapping Carillion's biggest construction projects Carillion was left with just Â£29m before going bankrupt PFI contracts were first introduced under John Major's Conservative government. Under such deals, private consortiums build facilities such as schools, hospitals and roads, in return for regular payments over as many as 30 years. Liverpool City Council is paying more than Â£4m each year for Parklands High School which stands empty and unused. The secondary school which boasts sports hall, canteen and science labs was used for only ten years before it was put into special measures by Ofsted, and closed down in 2014. It is now dubbed a ""ghost school"" by locals. The school cost an estimated Â£24 million to build and between now and the end of the contract 2028, will incur a bill of Â£47 million, which includes interest, debt and facilities management payments. PFI use proliferated under Tony Blair's Labour government, but PFIs fell out of favour after the 2008 financial crisis, as the cost of private finance increased and as questions were raised over their efficacy. Since then, the Departments for Health and Education have used the new PF2s which the Treasury argues are more transparent and ""better value for money"". ""Taxpayer money is protected... as the risks of construction and long-term maintenance of a project are transferred to the private sector,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. However, the NAO said there had never been a ""robust evaluation"" of  the benefits. It said the expected spend on one group of schools financed by PF2 were around 40% higher than the costs of a similar project financed by government borrowing. It also said Treasury Committee analysis from 2011 estimated the cost of a privately financed hospital was 70% higher than a comparative project in the public sector. The watchdog highlighted the increased cost of borrowing which it said was 2% to 3.75% higher for PFIs compared to state borrowing. ""Small changes to the cost of capital can have a significant impact on costs,"" the report said. ""Paying off a debt of Â£100m over 30 years with interest of 2% costs Â£34m in interest. At 4% this more than doubles to Â£73m."" Last year Greater Manchester chose to end a Â£3bn PFI contract with a private sector consortium 17 years early citing ""cost savings"" The report also identified other reasons for higher costs at PFIs including insurance, fees for external advisors, fees for arranging borrowing and the cost of producing and auditing accounts. The report said PFI was designed to limit uncertainty over cost over-runs and provide incentives for better long-term maintenance of assets. But Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the NAO had found ""little evidence"" that PFI's benefits offset its additional costs. ""I am concerned that Treasury has re-launched PFI under new branding, without doing anything about most of its underlying problems,"" she said. ""We need more investment in our schools and hospitals but if we get the contracts wrong, taxpayers pay the price."" But she said many local bodies were now ""shackled to inflexible PFI contracts that are exorbitantly expensive to change."" The GMB union said it showed PFI to be ""a catastrophic waste of taxpayers' money"" and that it should mean ""the game is up for PFI"". At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the government to end the ""costly racket"" of private sector firms running public services.

Tesco backtracks on Clubcard rewards,"Tesco is delaying a cut to its biggest Clubcard rewards after it faced a backlash from customers. The supermarket announced on Monday that the value of its reward vouchers was changing immediately, provoking an angry response on social media. It has now pushed back a drop in the most generous rewards until June. Shoppers collect points for money spent with the supermarket and these become vouchers, which can be used for things such as days out or restaurant meals. Under thechanges announced on Monday, vouchers worth four times their face value were cut to three times their value. But Tesco has now agreed to delay that change until 10 June to give shoppers more time to spend them. The company said it had ""listened to customers' feedback"" on the timetable. Martin Lewis, founder of the Money Saving Expert website, said it seemed that Tesco had responded to ""all the anger that's been out there and the campaigning"". ""They've done the right thing and they're giving those people who have been saving up to get their four-times vouchers some time to redeem them,"" he told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours. Pizza Express, Cafe Rouge and London Zoo are among the places that accept four-time vouchers, according to Money Saving Expert. Tesco said it would inform customers about the change over the next few days. Customers who redeemed such vouchers at three times their face value will be refunded, the supermarket said.

Sean CurranParliamentary correspondent The government suffered a defeat in the Lords on Wednesday after a former head of the judiciary criticised plans to give ministers the power to create new criminal offences. Lord Judge, who is a former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, told peers that proposals to let ministers create new money laundering offences without having to get a new bill passed by parliament were ""constitutionally troublesome"". There was cross-party support for a proposal to amend the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill so that ministers would not be able to create new money laundering offences. The government was defeated by 264 votes to 184 - a majority of 80 votes. On Monday peers defeated the government when they removed ministers' ability to create offences under the Bill's sanctions enforcement powers. Facebook has told the Government's fake news inquiry it will expand its investigation into whether Russian agents attempted to influence the Brexit vote. In a letter to Damian Collins, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, Facebook UK policy chief Simon Milner said the social media giant would now search for ""clusters engaged in coordinated activity around the Brexit referendum"" that appear to have originated in Russia. Mr Collins, who has previously criticised Facebook for doing ""no work"" in looking for Russian interference on their platform during the 2016 referendum, welcomed the move. Facebook said security experts would begin their investigation promptly but may take several weeks to produce results. Bitcoin is stillhovering around the $10,000 mark,externalthis evening, but Neil Wilson of ETX Capital also thinks it has further to fall: The break below $10,000 marked an important breach of key technical and psychological levels. This very much feels like a tipping point for Bitcoin and if the optimism really has gone the next leg lower could conceivably take us back to the narrow (for Bitcoin) range it traded Nov 21-24th, when it was bouncing around just above $8,000.â  Back to Carillion for a moment. Several banks are offering small firms overdraft extensions, payment holidays and fee waivers, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. Chairman Mike Cherry says: ""The emergency measures put in place by banks for customers hit by Carillion's collapse will provide some respite at a desperate time for hundreds of small firms. Many hundreds more are still yet to feel the knock-on impacts of the giant's demise. ""It's critical that they also receive support in the months ahead. We now need to establish a Carillion task force dedicated to helping all affected small firms and workers to recover and get back on their feet."" More on those leaked 2009 memo from RBS, as tweetd by Times financial editor Patrick Hosking. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has said the ""Just Hit Budget!"" memo was ""written by a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank"". Allow Twitter content?

Royal Bank of Scotland boss Ross McEwan will appear in front of MPs later this month to answer questions on the lender's treatment of small businesses after more damning details of the scandal emerged. The Treasury Select Committee confirmed that Mr McEwan will appear alongside chairman Sir Howard Davies on 30 January for a grilling on the bank'scontroversial Global Restructuring Group(GRG). There is also a backbench business debate scheduled tomorrow in the Commons on the treatment of small businesses by GRG called by Clive Lewis, Labour's shadow Treasury minister. It comes after Mr McEwan was asked by the committee chair Nicky Morgan to disclose previously unpublished memos, one of which allegedly reveals that staff were encouraged to extract money from struggling small businesses. Ministers planned carefully for the possible collapse of Carillion, which provides maintenance services to more than 50 prisons in England, says the Ministry of Justice's permanent secretary. Richard Heaton told the Public Accounts Committee that the company had not been providing ""a perfect service"" and that steps were being taken to manage that. Carillion was awarded facilities management contracts in 2015 for about half the prison estate at a cost of almost Â£100m over the past two years. Mr Heaton said he would not speculate on whether the contracts would be brought in-house, but admitted that direct management input would make things easier and probably reduce the risk of riots. The FTSE 100 has ended 0.4% lower at 7,725 points, dragged lower by a 9% slide in Burberry. Informa, which has made a bid for rival UBM, dipped 5.8% as investors reacted negatively to the terms of the proposed tie-up. FTSE 250-listed UBM soared almost 12%, however. Rolls-Royce was the day's biggest blue-chip riser, up 5.4%. Education Select Committee chairman Robert Halfon has demanded to know what impact the collapse of Carillion will have on schools and the 1,400 apprenticeships run by the firm. In a letter to Education Secretary Damian Hinds he said: ""Given the scale and nature of the services provided by Carillion to almost 900 schools and colleges, it is essential that the impacts of the firm's collapse are understood and steps taken to ensure the continuity of services such as school catering and facilities management across the country.""

If you're searching for a reason to dislike Bitcoin, look no further thanthis comment piece by Guardian technology reporter Alex Hern,external. ""Mining"" Bitcoins consumes a vast amount of electricity every year - more power than New Zealand's annual requirements and equivalent to one million transatlantic flights, he writes. In simplified terms, bitcoin mining is a competition to waste the most electricity possible by doing pointless arithmetic quintillions of times a second. The more electricity you burn, and the faster your computer, the higher your chance of winning the competition. The prize? 12.5 bitcoin â still worth over $100,000 â plus all the transaction fees paid in the past 10 minutes, which according analystsâ estimates is another $2,500 or so. This is a winner-takes-all game, where the prize is guaranteed to be paid to one, and only one, miner every 10 minutes. Burning more electricity increases your chances of winning, but correspondingly decreases everyone elseâs â and so they have a motivation to burn more electricity in turn.""  Â© 2025 BBC.

Banks 'undermine' Carillion survival,"This video can not be played The Carillion collapse: What does it mean? Carillion was in talks with the government since October as part of a desperate bid to stave off collapse, according to the chief executive. Keith Cochrane says the construction giant was left with just Â£29m in cash by the time it went bust on Monday. Until the last moments, directors still believed a rescue was possible, but banks became more demanding, he said. The details are included in a document Mr Cochrane has prepared as part of the insolvency process. His statement sets out attempts to save Britain's second-biggest construction company after three profits warnings and a collapse in the share price. Efforts to sell off parts of the business failed and Carillion's banks became more demanding, only agreeing fresh funding under tight new conditions that the company was unable to meet, the statement discloses. There had been regular meetings with the government and its advisers in the final few months of 2017, Mr Cochrane says. But on 31 December a ""formal request"" was made for support from the government. Are you a Carillion employee or contractor? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. ''Sites are silent and virtually deserted' Carillion apprentices given notice 'They've literally locked the gate' Watershed moment for privatisation? Carillion: Not alone in hitting problems Even as late as last weekend, directors believed that ""a constructive dialogue"" was underway with banks and the government about providing short-term funding. Directors wanted the government to ""guarantee"" more funding for four months while Carillion continued its restructuring, and be allowed to defer tax payments. Both requests were refused, according to Mr Cochrane. But his document adds that ""certain of the group's lenders took unilateral action which in the company's view undermined the group's efforts to conserve cash"". He singles out Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) as one of the banks that wanted to impose tough new lending conditions. RBS said in a statement to the BBC that it had ""provided considerable support and forbearance to Carillion over many months"". ""The judgement of the bank was that the restructuring plan put forward by the company was not viable and therefore we took the difficult decision not to extend further funding and increase our exposure to the business."" Running out of cash and owing more than Â£1.3bn to its banks, Carillion declared itself insolvent on Monday. Rather than attempt an orderly administration of Carillion in the hope of salvaging something from the business, the Official Receiver was appointed to liquidate the business. Accountants EY and PwC both rejected requests to become administrators because there was no money left to keep the company ticking over, Mr Cochrane says. Meanwhile, Treasury minister Liz Truss told the Commons on Tuesday that ""it would be completely wrong for a public company that got itself in this state to be bailed out by the state"". Business Secretary Greg Clark has asked for an investigation by the Official Receiver to be broadened and fast-tracked. The conduct of directors in charge at the time of the company's failure and previous directors will be examined. ""It is important we quickly get the full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation,"" said Mr Clark. ""Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously."" At the same time, the role of Carillion's auditor, KPMG, will be examined by the Financial Reporting Council. The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, 20,000 in the UK, and had 450 contracts with the UK government. The government has said that staff and contractors working on public sector service contracts will continue to be paid. But there is concern that big projects, including the construction of hospitals and roads, will be delayed while the details are worked out. There are also big worries for an estimated 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector. Many are owed money and are waiting to find out if they will get any of it back. Andy Bradley is the managing director of Flora-tec, which is owed Â£800,000 by Carillion for landscaping services. ""The government actively encouraged businesses like mine... to get involved in public sector contracts, to make sure the little guy got a slice of the pie. ""When Carillion started to get into trouble last year we were considering that we would scale back our involvement with them. ""However... the government continued to give them billion-pound contract after billion-pound contract and that said to me, as a small supplier, that the government had done their due diligence. ""We were following the government lead... only to be given a sucker punch. ""I had to make 10 people redundant yesterday. That's 10 people with mortgages, car loans, all that stuff. It's an absolute disgrace."" On Monday, the government said that firms working on Carillion's private contracts would be paid for another 48 hours. Butthe latest statement from the Insolvency Service,externalindicates there might be more flexibility. It says that the liquidator is talking to Carillion's private sector clients about which services will continue; however contracts will be ended if the client no longer wants to pay for them. ""No one has been dismissed at this point and staff will continue to be paid for the work they perform,"" a spokesperson for the Insolvency Service said. Carillion was hit by cost overruns on big projects, problems with contracts in the Middle East and a large deficit in the company pension scheme. Chief executive Richard Howson stepped down in Julylast year after a profit warning. There has been much criticism over the size of Mr Howson's pay award in 2016 which, including bonuses, totalled about Â£1.5m. Finance director Richard Adam, who retired in December 2016 after nine years at Carillion, received almost Â£1.1m in salary and bonuses in 2016. Are you a Carillion employee or contractor?
