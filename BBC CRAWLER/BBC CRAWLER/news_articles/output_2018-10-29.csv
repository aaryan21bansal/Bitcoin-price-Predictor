Bulgaria smashes 'fake passport scam',"A Bulgarian passport allows the holder to travel and work throughout the EU Prosecutors in Bulgaria say they have smashed a passport scam which saw thousands fraudulently acquire Bulgarian citizenship - and with it, the right to travel and work throughout the European Union. More than 20 people have been arrested, including officials. Applicants are said to have paid up to $5,690 (Â£4,445) for fake certificates of Bulgarian origin. Police have raided the offices of the State Agency for Bulgarians Abroad. Staff at the agency were allegedly involved in selling fake certificates to buyers in nearby non-EU countries. Bulgaria country profile Many of the false applications are believed to have come from states with sizeable ethnic Bulgarian minorities, including Moldova, Macedonia and Ukraine. Some reports suggest the agency was issuing about 30 dubious certificates a week. Prosecutors say they are investigating the agency's work on counts including bribe-taking, forgery and abuse of office.

Fracking halted by largest tremor at site,"Cuadrilla were fracking at an exploration site in Preston New Road, Little Plumpton Fracking at the UK's only active shale gas site has been halted for a third time by the largest tremor to be recorded there. The 1.1 magnitude tremor at the site in Little Plumpton, Lancashire, was the strongest since work began at the site two weeks ago. It followed two seismic movements of 0.8 on Friday and Saturday. Fracking firm Cuadrilla said Monday's tremor was no cause for concern, but it would halt fracking for 18 hours. Drilling for shale gas at the site started on 15 October after a legal challenge failed. It was suspended on Friday and again on Saturday following tremors of 0.8 magnitude, which are categorised as a ""red"" event by the monitoring system regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority. Any tremor measuring 0.5 or above means fracking must be temporarily stopped while tests are carried out. A Cuadrilla spokesman said: ""As we have said many times this level is way below anything that can be felt at surface and a very long way from anything that would cause damage or harm. ""In line with regulations, hydraulic fracturing has paused for 18 hours now, during which seismicity will continue to be closely monitored by ourselves and the relevant regulators.Â ""Well integrity has been checked and verified."" According to the British Geological Survey, earthquakes with magnitude of less than two are not usually felt and, if they are, it is only by people very close to the earthquake. Second 0.8 tremor at fracking site Fracking suspended following earthquake Fracking halted by earth tremor A 2.3 magnitude tremor on the Fylde coast seven years ago was probably caused by shale gas test drilling,a study found. Cuadrilla said earlier this month it would spend at least three months fracking two horizontal wells and then test to see if the gas flow was commercially viable. Anti-fracking campaigners argue the process of fracking to extract shale gas poses risks to the environment. The campaigners had tried to stop the process with an injunction bid but failed.

Kuenssberg: Budget's political aim,"Chancellor Philip Hammond posing for pics outside 11 Downing Street Numbers matter. And it was the first draft of the healthier numbers from the number crunchers, the Office for Budget Responsibility, that allowed the chancellor, and the prime minister alongside him, to try something that politically could matter a lot. The Office for Budget Responsibility's statistics arrived at No 10 and No 11 Downing Street (where the PM and the chancellor are based) in the immediate run up to the Tory party conference. That's what allowed Theresa May to claim boldly on the platform in Birmingham that austerity was over, even though she was careful to include a paragraph that pointed to next year's mammoth Spending Review, rather than straight away. But at the start of this month, the prime minister and the chancellor got the clear message from the Office for Budget Responsibility that the economy was in better shape than they had believed. That has allowed them to pursue what was described by one insider as moving to 'Tories 2.0 after Tories 1.0, 2010-2018' when the squeeze was most definitely on. Hammond: 'Austerity coming to an end' At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Budget Live: Rolling updates on reaction Tech giants face digital services tax Hammond hails better borrowing figures Yes, in the Budget the chancellor provided some immediate and expensive sticking plasters for bits of the state that are creaking very badly right now - changes to universal credit that should mean fewer people lose when moving on to the new benefit; Â£650m for social care; another Â£1bn for defence; Â£400m for schools, slightly more than that for potholes and another Â£500m for the housing infrastructure fund. But the clues as to what happens in the years to come are the real story of the day. If, and of course it's a big if, the OBR turns out to be right, and of course, the Brexit process doesn't collapse into chaos, then Philip Hammond says from next year the amount of cash government departments get will on average start going up again, after years and years and years when that average was going in the other direction. It's far from spend, spend, spend - but it is certainly the promise of a change of direction. And it's a claim from Philip Hammond and Theresa May that they can, while in office, reverse the political pendulum. After eight years where some parts of the state, and therefore many members of the public, have felt the sharp end of reducing budgets, it's far from certain that the public are ready to be convinced. And with huge question marks over Brexit, a restless party, and no majority in Parliament,  it is quite a feat to try to pull off. Remember Pastygate?

Kuenssberg: Budget big picture emerges,"The dust hasn't quite settled but we're a good few hours on from when the chancellor squeezed himself back down onto the government front bench, in between a pleased-looking prime minister and his ever-enthusiastic colleague Liz Truss, his number two at the Treasury. A few hours when certainly not everything has become clear, no doubt a few nasties will crawl out from under the rocks through the course of tomorrow according to Budget tradition, but the broad shape of the Budget and its impact are becoming clear. Hammond: 'Austerity coming to an end' Tech giants face digital services tax First off, it is, on the face of it, a big change in direction - a Tory chancellor talking about turning on the spending taps again, rather than how to scrimp and save. You'll see headlines about the 'biggest giveaway' in a generation. That's accurate in terms of the overall numbers, and the sense that government departments on average from next year will see spending go up not down. And it's different certainly to see a Conservative resident of No 11 putting that ahead of finishing off the attempts to clear the deficit. This chancellor is in fact seemingly content to let the deficit float up. That would have, until relatively recently, been considered heresy round his way. Politically, it's a big change of priority and has allowed the government to change its rhetoric substantially. But if you look carefully, a huge amount of that money will be gobbled up quickly by the health service. After that, by some calculations, there simply won't be much to go around - and some departments might even still face cuts. This sets the stage for a brutal spending review next year with Cabinet ministers, apart from the health secretary Matt Hancock, still vying to be the ones who can get their hands on extra money. For those who fail, and more importantly those who rely on the services delivered by their departments and local councils, the spending squeeze won't have come to an end at all. Budget calculator 2018 - what it means for you How the budget affects you if you're young For spending hawks like the chancellor however, together with his next door neighbour in Number 10, today is perhaps about grappling with a political reality - that the public appetite for austerity is much diminished, if not completely exhausted. But this is a return to spending, not an enormous splurge. Ministers will still have to contend with tight limits on spending and the economy is still predicted to grow at a pretty sluggish rate. Offering tax cuts more quickly by raising income tax thresholds immediately after Brexit will put money into millions of voters' pockets, perhaps just at the right time (remember though those tax cuts put a lot more in the wallets of the wealthy than basic rate payer). And as a senior Cabinet minister claimed this afternoon, the Budget creates a new, ""useful"" dividing line (yes one of those old Westminster chestnuts) with the Labour Party in the months and years to come. Instead of the basic - Tory cuts versus Labour spending - after today, both parties would spend more on public services but the Tories will do it without raising taxes. That, they hope, could become a persuasive Tory pitch to most voters in the middle, who don't want to hand over a lot more of their incomes to the government, but don't want to see teachers disappearing at their school, potholes in their roads, or wait for hours at A&E. That hope could be just that, a hope. The forecasts on which today's Budget is based could turn out to be as wrong as those that have gone before. Eight years of a squeeze on spending, particularly in local government, can't be unpicked overnight. The questions about Brexit persist, not just over the economy but over the chancellor and prime minister's futures too. If the next few months unfurl as they hope, and they are still around, it is now clear where they would like to put down their anchor. But it's up to the rest of the EU, the wider fortunes of the economy, and ultimately the public, to determine if they can.

What is the migrant caravan?,"Many of the migrants took their children with them on the trek Thousands of migrants have arrived at the US-Mexico border after travelling more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) from Central America. They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Many of them say their goal is to settle in the US despite warnings by US officials that anyone found entering the country illegally will face arrest, prosecution and deportation. More than 7,000 Central American migrants have arrived at the US-Mexico border after crossing Mexico and parts of Central America, according to official figures released by the Mexican Interior Ministry. They are staying in temporary shelters in the border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali. The migrants have been given shelter, but Tijuana's mayor has warned that the city will not be able to provide for them for long Those now in Tijuana are part of a migrant caravan which left the crime-ridden Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on 13 October. The group, made up mainly of Hondurans, was joined along the way by other migrants from Guatemala and El Salvador. There are also other smaller groups of migrants which have not yet reached the US border. More than 400 are in a shelter in Mexico City and more than 250 are in the northern Mexican state of Sinaloa. There are also four groups of Salvadoreans who have left their home country since the end of October. They are in different parts of Guatemala and Mexico, heading towards the US border. In total the number of migrants expected to reach the border is predicted to reach 10,000. The migrants say they are leaving their respective countries in the hope of building a better future for themselves and their families. Some say they have been threatened or extorted by criminal gangs operating in their hometowns. Many are travelling with their children whom they do not want to fall prey to the gangs. Others hope to get jobs abroad which pay enough for them to send money to their relatives who stayed behind. Many say their dream is to reach the US. Some of them have relatives there already whom they hope to join, others have chosen it as their destination because they think they will earn higher salaries there than in Latin America. Long before the first members of the caravan reached the US border, President Donald Trump labelled the migrant caravan as ""an invasion"". Ahead of the mid-term elections in the US, he tweeted dozens of time about the migrants alleging that ""many gang members and some very bad people are mixed into the caravan heading to our southern border"" and warning that ""our military is waiting for you"". This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan On 2 November, just days before the mid-terms, he told voters at a rally that ""if you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you'd better vote Republican"". Concertina wire has been strung across parts of the border to fortify it He also deployed about 5,800 troops to the southern border to ""harden"" it, including adding concertina wire to some stretches of the border fence, a photo of which he tweeted on 19 November.

If an asylum seeker enters the US illegally, they are still entitled to a hearing of their claim. But those seeking a better quality of life - even if they are fleeing devastating poverty - are not considered refugees and do not have the same protections. The alternative is to stay in Mexico. Outgoing Mexican President President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto has said that those wanting to stay would be welcome and offered jobs, providing they agreed to register and comply with Mexican laws. Some of the migrants have registered and queued at an employment fair to sign up for work Some migrants have also returned to their places of origin. According to the latest figures provided by Honduran officials, 7,000 Hondurans have turned back during their trek north and returned to Honduras. Some Hondurans have cast doubt on this figure but Director of Honduras's National Institute of Immigration Carolina Menjivar has insisted that it is accurate.

Fake news follows caravan,"This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan A row raging over the migrant caravan travelling towards the United States is being fuelled by misinformation and false statements online. Thousands of migrants have got as far as Mexico, after the caravan which set out from Honduras has travelled north and grown in size. The caravan's progress towards the US southern border has become the subject of intense speculation and discussion on social media. A number of false or misleading assertions are among those to be shared widely. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, President Trump asserted that ""unknown Middle Easterners"" were ""mixed in"" with the caravan heading north. However, on Tuesday he acknowledged there was no proof of those claims. ""There's no proof of anything. But there could very well be,"" the president said. His initial assertion came shortly after Fox and Friends host Pete Hegseth reported claims that Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales had told a local newspaper they had caught more than 100  Islamic State group fighters in the country. Reporters on the ground, including BBC correspondent Aleem Maqbool, have not seen ""unknown Middle Easterners"" among the migrants heading north. Allow Twitter content?

Fake news follows migrant caravan,"This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan A row raging over the migrant caravan travelling towards the United States is being fuelled by misinformation and false statements online. Thousands of migrants have got as far as Mexico, after the caravan which set out from Honduras has travelled north and grown in size. The caravan's progress towards the US southern border has become the subject of intense speculation and discussion on social media.

His initial assertion came shortly after Fox and Friends host Pete Hegseth reported claims that Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales had told a local newspaper they had caught more than 100  Islamic State group fighters in the country.

US sends thousands of troops to border,"This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan The Pentagon is sending over 5,200 troops to the border with Mexico as thousands of Central American migrants walk towards the US in a caravan. General Terrence O'Shaughnessy said Operation Faithful Patriot would focus on Texas, Arizona and California. President Donald Trump earlier said the ""invasion"" of migrants would find the US military waiting for them. He also told Fox News that ""tent cities"" would be built to house migrants seeking asylum in the US. ""If they apply for asylum, we're going to hold them until such time as their trial takes place. We're going to hold them, we're going to build tent cities, we're gonna build tents all over the place,"" he said in an interview on Monday. There are already 2,100 National Guard members at the border, sent after a previous request by Mr Trump in April. What is the migrant caravan heading to US? Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' Fake news follows migrant caravan Both sides of the US political divide have been accused of using the migrants for electoral gain just a week before Americans go to the polls. In mid-term elections on 6 November, President Trump's Republican Party will seek to keep both houses of Congress out of Democratic hands. The migrants are still around 1,000 miles (1,600km) from the US border. Gen O'Shaughnessy said the troops would be deployed by the end of the week with weapons, helicopters, aeroplanes, barriers and miles of razor wire to support border patrol agents. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington After a week in which guns and bombs dominated the headlines, Donald Trump seeks to return the focus on the migrants making their way through Mexico toward the US border. Their numbers may be dipping thanks to an offer of Mexican asylum and the length of the journey, but the president is sounding the alarm. The deployment of 5,000 soldiers to the border will probably have little tangible impact, given that the migrants plan to file legal requests for asylum. The urgency is questionable as well, given that it could be months before they arrive at the border. What the announcement represents, however, is clear. The president seeks to paint the refugees as a national threat that he alone is willing to counter. At the moment immigration is not among the top concerns of American voters. The president, perhaps seeking political advantage, has eight days to change that. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commissioner Kevin McAleenan also addressed Monday's news conference. He told reporters the migrants were estimated to be several weeks away from reaching the US border. The figure of 5,200 military personnel is higher than the 800 troops it was initially predicted would be sent. The total military deployment means the number of troops at the south-western border will exceed the US troops currently in Syria and Iraq, the Wall Street Journal notes. Mr Trump tweeted on Monday: ""Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border. ""Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. ""This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!"" Many of the migrants say they plan to seek asylum in the US. US riot police in a drill at the US-Mexico international bridge There is a legal obligation under international law to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they say they fear violence in their home countries. Those seeking asylum must be fleeing due to a serious fear of persecution in their home country. Under international law, these are considered refugees. If an asylum seeker enters the US illegally, they are still entitled to a hearing of their claim. Mostly Honduran migrants cross a river that separates Guatemala and Mexico on Monday Economic migrants are those seeking a better quality of life - and even if they are fleeing devastating poverty, they are not considered refugees and do not have the same protections. Mr Trump is not the first president to send troops to the border with Mexico. President Barack Obama sent some 1,200 National Guard soldiers to guard the boundary, while President George W Bush deployed about 6,000 troops to help Border Patrol in what was called Operation Jump Start. Both deployments lasted for about a year. Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan. Video, 00:02:43Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan Thousands of migrants reach Mexico.

Tragic end to city's fairytale,"Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was a ""chairman of the community"", according to Leicester City ambassador Alan Birchenall When a reclusive Thai billionaire took control of an ailing East Midlands football club in 2010, few could have predicted the fairytale that would follow. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha'sdeath in a helicopter crashoutside the King Power Stadium capped a tragic end to a remarkable eight years. On the football side, it included Leicester City's promotion from the Championship and peaked with the 5,000-1 outsiders' astonishingPremier League title winin 2016. But Mr Vichai's contribution to the city went beyond what happened on the pitch. During his stewardship of the club he donated Â£2m to the Leicester Children's Hospital charity, Â£1m to the Foxes Foundation for community causes and Â£1m to Leicester University's medical department. Those generous gestures - as well as the club's success - led to the tycoon being hailed as part of the city's fabric. Leicester's mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said Mr Vichai ""didn't just buy a football club and run it from a distance - he became a part of the city and became much loved here"". Sir Peter praised his ""philanthropic donations"" but also smaller gestures such as providing free scarves, clappers, flags anddoughnutsat the King Power Stadium. Hundreds of bouquets of flowers and tributes have been left at the King Power Stadium Dr Sanjiv Nichani, a consultant paediatrician at University Hospital Leicester Children's Hospital, told BBC Radio 5 live Mr Vichai had become ""part of the fabric of Leicester, a giant of Leicester history"" due to his charitable efforts. In Thailand, where Mr Vichai made his fortune, his profile was ""rather different"" to the image of a benevolent billionaire he had cultivated in the UK. BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head described his company King Power's monopoly of Thai duty-free sales as ""very controversial"". The company had faced allegations of corruption over Â£323mreportedly owed to the Thai government, but the case was dismissed in September. However, in Leicester, Mr Vichai was loved almost unconditionally, as the outpouring of emotion since his death in the crash on Saturday night shows. Leicester players pay tribute to owner What we know so far Leicester helicopter crash victims named Worth an estimated Â£2.9bn ($3.8bn), he was chairman of duty-free company King Power International Group which bought then-Championship side Leicester in 2010 for Â£39m. After some early struggles the Foxes were promoted to the Premier League in 2014. They flirted with relegation in their first season back in the top-flight, eventually finishing 14th. That saw the club begin the 2015-16 campaign with odds of 5,000-1 to win the league. But led by Italian manager Claudio Ranieri, the Foxes claimed an unlikely first top division title in their history, inone of the greatest sporting stories of all time. This video can not be played Leicester lift the Premier League trophy The following season, the club reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League and is now established as a mainstay of the Premier League. Mr Vichai's death in the crash, alongside his staff members Nusara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare, and pilots and partners Eric Swaffer and Izabela Roza Lechowicz, has left a city in shock. The billionaire's Â£2m donation helped fund a new children's hospital in the city and has seen Mr Vichai hailed by Karamjit Singh, chairman of Leicester's Hospitals. Who was Leicester's billionaire owner? The greatest sporting story of all time? Mr Singh said: ""Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was a very special individual, not only with his involvement with the football club, but he made a real effort to engage with the fans and the community of Leicester. ""This is evident with the outpouring of emotion across the city and beyond. ""We remain extremely grateful for the very generous donation he made towards our new children's hospital; he knew how to make the impossible possible and has left behind a legacy which we are committed to keeping alive."" University of Leicester graduate Muhamid Pathan said Mr Vichai ""gave so much to the city - unforgettable memories and enormous charitable donations"". Allow Twitter content?

""My thoughts are just like everyone in Leicestershire, whether you are a football fan or not, it's so sad and all the others in the helicopter... our thoughts go out to them,"" he told 5 live. Leicestershire Live'sLeicester City editor Rob Tanner said,externalthe wider impact of Mr Vichai's community donations had been felt across the county. He wrote: ""They may not come from Leicester, but they became part of the community through the Foxes Foundation, raising thousands and even contributing millions of their own money to worthwhile causes across the county, services that everyone could use and benefit from, not just football fans.""

Ahmed: Big spender Hammond,"There was one big challenge for the chancellor today - map out a plan for ""ending austerity"" as demanded by the prime minister. Ending rather than ended is probably the most accurate analysis - with plans for many billions of pounds of extra spending. Some might say Philip Hammond has discovered his inner Gordon Brown. The public finances are in better shape - borrowing is Â£11.9bn lower this year than expected. But as the official watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, put it: ""The Budget spends the fiscal windfall rather than saving it."" This is the largest ""fiscal loosening"" - extra spending by the government not matched by tax rises - since 2010. The chancellor said that public spending would increase by 1.2% a year over five years from 2020. Public spending will rise by Â£30bn by 2023-24, a significant stimulus to be spent on the NHS and on raising the amount people can earn before they start paying tax. That is in sharp contrast to the five year ""austerity"" plan announced in 2010, which saw cuts of 3% a year, and 2015, which included cuts of 1.3% a year. To pay for that, Mr Hammond will allow borrowing to to be sustained at around Â£20bn a year. Little talk today of ""balancing the books"" or the risk of a bad Brexit deal. At-a-glance summary What it means for you Hammond hails better borrowing figures Tech giants face digital services tax There is better news on the economy. The OBR upgraded its forecast for growth for the next two years, which means the government is likely to enjoy higher tax revenues. But growth is still relatively weak, falling back to levels low by historic standards from 2020. The test for Mr Hammond is this. Will the better news on the public finances and high levels of employment be maintained? If it isn't then the plans for extra spending will look very heroic indeed.

Will Budget save the High Street?,"Almost one in five shops in Doncaster is empty 2018 has been an annus horribilis for the High Street. Big names like Toys R Us and Maplin have gone bust, while others like Debenhams and House of Fraser have closed city and town centre sites. Thousands of stores have shut, costing tens of thousands of jobs. Cries to save the High Street have become more shrill with every empty unit. Many retailers have cried foul in the face of a perfect storm. There has been new competition from online firms that employ fewer staff and pay far lower business rates. There are two ways you can level the playing field. Cut charges for the traditional retailers or increase them for online traders. Mr Hammond has done a bit of both. Tech giants face digital services tax Hammond: Austerity coming to an end At-a-glance summary: Budget key points As trailed over the weekend, he has spent Â£900m knocking a third off the business rates bill of 500,000 small retailers. Very welcome to those who have premises with a rateable value below Â£51,000. Second - he unveiled a new Â£400m digital services tax to be levied on the tech giants (those with revenues over Â£500m - here's looking at you Facebook and Google) on the money they make on digital services like advertising and streaming entertainment (but not online sales). So will these two measures save the high street? Probably not - at least not on their own. While some tenants and landlords welcomed today's move, the business rates discount for small retailers would certainly not have saved any of the high profile retail busts this year. Rateable values on prominent High Street sites are usually a lot higher than the Â£51,000 threshold. Industry body the British Retail Consortium was underwhelmed. Chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""Rather than tinkering around the edges, struggling high streets require wholesale reform of business rates in order to thrive. The issue remains that the business rates burden is simply too high."" The tax on digital services is a bold step at first sight - going it alone in taxing the very same companies that the UK is trying to woo to invest in the UK. However, it's possible - even likely - that this digital tax will never see the light of day. Its introduction is delayed until 2020 - by which time the OECD group of countries has promised to come up with its own plans to tax the digital economy. The chancellor explicitly said he reserved the right to adopt their proposals if they look like gaining international acceptance. So, while he looks like a trailblazer, he would prefer safety in numbers. That's not to say that the rest of the world isn't serious about figuring out how to tax technology companies - they are, and their proposals may be more aggressive than Philip Hammond's. But it's unlikely that the measures in today's Budget are enough for him to be considered as the saviour of the High Street.

Academic on UAE spying charge bailedDurham University PhD student Matthew Hedges is accused of spying while on a research trip.Tyne & Wear,"Daniela Tejada has repeatedly rejected suggestions her husband, Matthew Hedges, is a spy A British academic accused of spying by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been released on bail. Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old PhD student at Durham University, was arrested on 5 May in Dubai and has reportedly been held in solitary confinement for almost six months. He denies spying for the UK government. Mr Hedges has been told to remain in the UAE until his next court appearance on 21 November and has not had his passport returned to him. He is being made to wear an ankle monitor and was warned that, if instructed, he may have to return to jail. Mr Hedges' wife Daniela Tejada said he was tired and ""shocked by everything"" but was in a good mood and ""glad to be breathing fresh air"". Speaking to the BBC, she called the move a ""great step"" but said she was ""still hoping for justice"". ""However, I cannot allow myself to get too excited by this information as Matt is not fully free yet,"" she added. More than 100 academics from around the world have signed a petition demanding the release of Mr Hedges Mr Hedges was detained at Dubai Airport as he was leaving the country following a research trip. His family said he had been researching the impact of the Arab Spring on the UAE's foreign policy and security strategy when he was arrested. Mr Hedges and his family said he was entirely innocent of the charges. His wife, who lives in Exeter, added: ""Above everything, I hope that justice will be done and Matt is granted his rightful freedom, something that he's been unjustly denied in the last six months. ""My main concern is his safety and I'd like to request the FCO [Foreign Office] and UAE authorities ensure that he's protected during this time."" A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said it was ""monitoring developments closely and have made the Emirati authorities aware of all our concerns"". ""Our staff are in close contact with Matthew's wife, Daniela, offering her all possible support at what we appreciate is a hugely difficult time,"" she added.

Angela Merkel to step down in 2021The decision by Germany's veteran chancellor comes after a series of regional election setbacks.Europe,"Mrs Merkel gave a news conference on Monday Germany's Angela Merkel has said she will step down as chancellor in 2021, following recent election setbacks. ""I will not be seeking any political post after my term ends,"" she told a news conference in Berlin. She also said she would not seek re-election as leader of the centre-right CDU party in December. She has held the post since 2000. The CDU was severely weakened in Sunday's poll in the state of Hesse, the latest in a series of setbacks. Both the CDU and its national coalition partners, the Social Democrats, were 10 percentage points down on the previous poll there. The election comes just weeks afterMrs Merkel's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, suffered huge losses in a state parliament vote. A career in pictures Chancellor Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Merkel's three challenges Angela Merkel's leadership woes Parties like the left-leaning Greens and the far-right, anti-immigration AfD have grown in national support following the 2017 general election, as backing for the major centre parties has waned. By Jenny Hill, BBC's Berlin correspondent Angela Merkel did her best to maintain her famous poker face but at times she looked rather sad as she announced what amounted to an official - albeit drawn-out - farewell to German politics. She has always insisted that if she is to lead Germany, she must also lead her party. The announcement is intended to silence critics in her party and win back the voters who have deserted the CDU in favour of parties like AfD and the Greens, but it also reflects her dwindling grip on power. Much depends on her successor as party leader. If it is a loyalist - like Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer - Germany might see a smooth transition to a new chancellor, possibly allowing Mrs Merkel to see out her term. But the vultures are circling. Already an old rival, Friedrich Merz, has announced his candidacy. If one of Mrs Merkel's adversaries prevails as party leader, her chancellorship becomes uncomfortable and possibly untenable. Mrs Merkel said she took ""full responsibility"" for poor performance. ""As chancellor and leader of the CDU I'm politically responsible for everything, for successes and for failures,"" she said. ""When people are telling us what they think of how the government was formed and what they think of our work during the first seven months of this parliament... then it is a clear signal that things can't carry on as they are. ""The time has come to open a new chapter."" Mrs Merkel is a veteran political figure, pictured here with former Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1997 She also made it clear she would not handpick her successor as party leader and would ""accept any democratic decision taken by my party"". Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer would be the obvious choice for Merkel loyalists to replace her. She is currently the party secretary. However, Health Minister Jens Spahn, a leading critic of the chancellor's open-door migration policies, has also announced his candidacy. And Friedrich Merz, a former leader of the CDU-CSU parliamentary group and an old rival to Mrs Merkel, has thrown his hat into the ring. Mrs Merkel's CDU plunged 11 percentage points to 27% in Sunday's elections in the central state of Hesse, according to preliminary results. This was the party's worst showing in the state since 1966. The SPD, which is in coalition with the CDU nationally, fell by a similar amount to 19.8%. The Greens saw their share of the vote rise substantially to 19.5% in Hesse The main beneficiaries were the Greens, who paradoxically share power with the CDU in the state and have now drawn level with the SPD, and the far-right AfD, who rose to 13%. The Hesse vote follows a pattern of losses for the two main parties, with the AfD doing particularly well in eastern states. Also on 14 October, the CDU's Bavarian ally, the CSU, lost its absolute majority in the state's parliament which it has dominated since 1957. Like in Hesse, the SPD also lost badly and the Greens and AfD surged. While the Greens appear to have benefited from the SPD's slump in support, it seems clear that the centre-right has lost voters to the AfD. Part of the reason could be anger at Mrs Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders to large numbers of migrants, a move which the AfD has vehemently opposed. Outcry at far-right child informer scheme Bavaria orders crosses in state buildings Germany's far right march en masse Massive losses for Merkel's Bavaria ally Bavaria conservatives lose their fizz as election looms Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

White House rejects blame for shooting,"This video can not be played Sanders: ""The President adores Jewish Americans as part of his own family"" The White House has rejected suggestions that President Donald Trump's rhetoric could be to blame for a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Monday it was ""outrageous"" to suggest that Mr Trump was at all responsible for the 11 deaths on Saturday. She said the president and first lady will visit Pennsylvania on Tuesday. The alleged gunman, Robert Bowers, has appeared in court in a wheelchair. 'He was a beautiful person, a beautiful soul' Would you tackle a gunman? 'Jewish oasis' mourns a mass shooting The mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue is being called the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history. ""The president is not responsible for these acts,"" Mrs Sanders said repeatedly during Monday's news conference when a reporter put it to her that Mr Trump's rhetoric could have played a part in the Pittsburgh attack, or a recent mail bomb scare. ""I think it's irresponsible to blame the president and members of his administration for those heinous acts."" The press secretary's voice cracked with emotion as she spoke of how the president ""adores"" Jewish Americans. The suspect was not a Trump supporter - he accused the president in online posts of doing nothing to stop an ""infestation"" by Jews. Mr Trump has condemned the shooting, saying there ought to be no tolerance for anti-Semitism. A Jewish social justice organisation accused the president in an open letter of giving succour to white nationalists. ""President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism,"" Bend the Arc said in the letter, which now has more than 43,000 signatures. It noted the president has frequently criticised immigrants and Muslims. However, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who leads a congregation at the Tree of Life synagogue, said the president was always welcome. ""I'm a citizen, and he's my president, he's certainly welcome,"" Mr Myers said on ABC's Meet the Press. The alleged gunman was ranting against Jews even as he was treated by Jewish medical staff at the hospital for wounds he received in a gun battle with police. Jeffery Cohen, president of Allegheny General Hospital, told WTAE-TV: ""He's taken into my hospital and he's shouting 'I want to kill all the Jews!' ""And the first three people who are taking care of him are Jewish. Ain't that a kick in the pants?"" Just before the attack, the alleged gunman railed on social media against a Jewish refugee relief organisation. The suspect accused the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) of bringing violent ""invaders"" into the country. Mark Hetfield, head of HIAS, said on Monday: ""President Trump didn't mention that. ""Hateful words always lead to hateful acts. And that's exactly what happened here. Words matter. And they especially matter when they come from the president of the United States."" By Jane O'Brien, BBC News Robert Bowers arrived in court in Pittsburgh shackled to a wheelchair and wearing a blue shirt. His hands were untied to enable him to sign his name. It's OK, I can scribble, the 46-year-old truck driver said. He spoke little, giving his name, acknowledging the charges against him and stating he could not afford a lawyer. He was slightly hunched and looked down when addressed by the judge. The defendant faces federal murder and assault charges that could carry the death penalty. The hearing lasted only a few minutes to set a date for Thursday, when the prosecution will bring evidence. Who is Robert Bowers? This video can not be played Rabbi Doris Dyen: 'I'm broken and I can't pray' Eight men and three women ranging in age from 54 to 97 were killed at the Tree of Life synagogue. Several had attended the place of worship since childhood. Two brothers, and a husband and wife are among the dead. Joyce Fienberg, 75 Richard Gottfried, 65 Rose Mallinger, 97 Jerry Rabinowitz, 66 Cecil Rosenthal, 59 David Rosenthal, 54, brother of Cecil Bernice Simon, 84 Sylvan Simon, 86, husband of Bernice Daniel Stein, 71 Melvin Wax, 88 Irving Younger, 69 The first funerals will be held on Tuesday, for Cecil and David Rosenthal. More on the victims A woman reacts at a makeshift memorial outside the Tree of Life synagogue following Saturday's shooting Mr Bowers allegedly stormed the Tree of Life temple in the Squirrel Hill neighbourhood of Pittsburgh, shouting: ""All Jews must die!"" The FBI says three handguns and an AR-15 rifle, used in many of the nation's mass shootings, were recovered at the scene. He owned all the weapons legally, officials say. Survivor Barry Werber, 76, said he hid in a dark storage closet during the rampage. ""I don't know why he thinks the Jews are responsible for all the ills in the world, but he's not the first and he won't be the last,"" Mr Werber told AP news agency. ""Unfortunately, that's our burden to bear. It breaks my heart.""

What do housing measures mean?,"More help for first-time buyers and plans for homes on the High Street have been announced in the Budget. Most first-time buyers of shared ownership properties will now no longer pay stamp duty, under the measures. Chancellor Philip Hammond also said that the Help to Buy scheme would end in 2023 - an extension of two years. Mr Hammond said the housing market needed to be fixed, adding it was key to boosting UK productivity and living standards. The UK is facing a shortage of housing. The number of homes on the marketis at a 10-year lowandfewer peopleare taking out mortgages. So what has the chancellor said he is going to do about it? In last year's Autumn Budget, thechancellor abolished stamp duty- a tax you pay if you buy property or land - for first-time buyers buying a home worth up to Â£300,000. It has so far helped 121,500 people, the chancellor said, and the number of first-time buyers is at an 11-year high. Now, stamp duty will also be abolished for first-time buyers of shared ownership properties - when someone buys between 25% and 75% of a home and then rents the rest of it. It will apply to all shared ownership homes worth up to Â£500,000 and backdated to anyone who has bought one since last year's Budget. There are more than 200,000 shared ownership properties in the UK. Kevin Roberts, the director of the Mortgage Club at financial services firm Legal & General, said the move showed the government ""clearly recognises the benefits"" of shared ownership and he hoped the announcement would boost awareness of the scheme. The Budget also announced thatthe Help to Buy scheme- which sees the government loan money to first-time buyers - will come to an end in 2023. It was originally due to end in April 2021, but received a two-year extension. At-a-glance summary What it means for you Tech giants face digital services tax Kamal Ahmed: Big spender Hammond Budget calculator As part of his Â£1.5bn boost to help the UK's struggling High Streets, Mr Hammond announced he was creating a Â£675m fund to help councils transform their main retail zones. Part of this money could be spent on turning unused High Street shops or commercial buildings into homes, he said. ""If British High Streets are to remain at the centre of our community life, they will need to adapt,"" Mr Hammond said. He also said the government was going to consult on how to simplify the process of converting commercial buildings into homes. The Federation of Master Builders, representing construction firms, said Mr Hammond had taken ""positive steps"" to address the housing crisis. Brian Berry, chief executive of the FMB, estimates as many as 300,000 to 400,000 new homes could be created by making use of empty space above shops on High Streets. He urged councils to work with local builders and developers to make the use of this ""wasted space"". But Labour MP Helen Hayes said she was concerned at the chancellor's plans to simplify the process of converting commercial buildings into homes, saying that relaxing planning regulations had created ""appalling"" housing.

Mr Hammond promised an extra Â£500m for the Housing Infrastructure Fund - a pot of money that local councils can apply to for help with building homes. This extra cash should help build 650,000 more homes, he said. The government has also struck deals with nine housing associations to deliver 13,000 homes across England. And the chancellor wants to see more SMEs - small and medium-sized enterprises - building houses, so has announced up to Â£1bn of British business bank guarantees. Mr Hammond also said he was providing money to help up to 500 neighbourhoods to allocate land for housing and sell the homes to local people at a discount. He also confirmed that the cap on councils, which limits their ability to borrow money to build council houses, would be scrapped. Theresa May hadalready promised the cap would be scrappedin her Conservative Party conference speech. Mr Hammond's announcements come afteranalysis earlier this year suggestedthat house-building across half of England was slower than it was before the 2008 financial crash.

'Controlling' wife murderer gets 23 years,"Kema Salum attacked Leyla Mtumwa at their north London home A ""controlling bully"" who strangled his wife and then stabbed her 49 times in front of her young son has been jailed for a minimum of 23 years for her murder. Kema Salum, 39, admitted killing 35-year-old Leyla Mtumwa at their home in Haringey, north London, in March. Salum, from Tanzania, had been living in Britain on a six-month visa after marrying Ms Mtumwa in east Africa. He was given a life sentence at the Old Bailey. Salum became jealous when his wife went out with friends the night before the murder, the court heard. Shortly before 07:00 on 30 March he began strangling her in a ""violent rage"" at their home in Kirkstall Avenue. He then paused his attack, went into the kitchen, and came back with a knife. Kema Salum had been living in Britain on a six-month visa He used it to stab Ms Mtumwa in the head, neck, body and arms as her 12-year-old son screamed at him to stop, the court was told. When Salum was arrested, he told officers he had acted in self defence. Ms Mtumwa was pronounced dead at the scene. Initially Salum denied murder, butchanged his plea during a hearing in September. The court heard Salum had been ""extremely violent"" towards his ex-wife in the past. Judge Richard Marks QC described the defendant as an ""arrogant, controlling bully"". He said: ""This was a consistent attack of very considerable force which, although relatively short-lived, must have caused Leyla very substantial suffering before she died."" Det Ch Insp Dave Whellams, who led the investigation, said Salum's ""true motive... still remains unknown"". ""Sadly we may never know what happened in the lead up to the attack,"" he said. ""However, I hope today's sentence brings Leyla's family some measure of comfort and closure.""

Will Hammond's Budget save the High Street?,"Almost one in five shops in Doncaster is empty 2018 has been an annus horribilis for the High Street. Big names like Toys R Us and Maplin have gone bust, while others like Debenhams and House of Fraser have closed city and town centre sites. Thousands of stores have shut, costing tens of thousands of jobs. Cries to save the High Street have become more shrill with every empty unit. Many retailers have cried foul in the face of a perfect storm. There has been new competition from online firms that employ fewer staff and pay far lower business rates. There are two ways you can level the playing field. Cut charges for the traditional retailers or increase them for online traders. Mr Hammond has done a bit of both. Tech giants face digital services tax Hammond: Austerity coming to an end At-a-glance summary: Budget key points As trailed over the weekend, he has spent Â£900m knocking a third off the business rates bill of 500,000 small retailers. Very welcome to those who have premises with a rateable value below Â£51,000. Second - he unveiled a new Â£400m digital services tax to be levied on the tech giants (those with revenues over Â£500m - here's looking at you Facebook and Google) on the money they make on digital services like advertising and streaming entertainment (but not online sales). So will these two measures save the high street? Probably not - at least not on their own. While some tenants and landlords welcomed today's move, the business rates discount for small retailers would certainly not have saved any of the high profile retail busts this year. Rateable values on prominent High Street sites are usually a lot higher than the Â£51,000 threshold. Industry body the British Retail Consortium was underwhelmed. Chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""Rather than tinkering around the edges, struggling high streets require wholesale reform of business rates in order to thrive. The issue remains that the business rates burden is simply too high."" The tax on digital services is a bold step at first sight - going it alone in taxing the very same companies that the UK is trying to woo to invest in the UK. However, it's possible - even likely - that this digital tax will never see the light of day. Its introduction is delayed until 2020 - by which time the OECD group of countries has promised to come up with its own plans to tax the digital economy. The chancellor explicitly said he reserved the right to adopt their proposals if they look like gaining international acceptance. So, while he looks like a trailblazer, he would prefer safety in numbers. That's not to say that the rest of the world isn't serious about figuring out how to tax technology companies - they are, and their proposals may be more aggressive than Philip Hammond's. But it's unlikely that the measures in today's Budget are enough for him to be considered as the saviour of the High Street.

Six ways the Budget will impact young people,"The day we've been waiting for all year has finally come around - thebudget's been announced. Ok - that might be a stretch but the government has outlined what it's going to do with its money for the next few years. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond stood in Parliament for more than an hour explaining all the changes he's making to the country's finances. Here are some of the most important bits that may affect you. Nope, we can't talk about anything right now without mentioning Brexit. The Chancellor announced that he's keeping an extra Â£500m back in case Brexit goes badly. That means he's got about Â£4.4bn stashed away to pay for any problems the UK has as a result of Brexit. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, we'll get an emergency budget before the scheduled leave day of 29 March. That's the last time we'll mention Brexit - promise. First, here's how your pay will be affected. The amount of your wage you get tax-free - known as the personal allowance - is going up from Â£11,850 to Â£12,500 a year from April 2019. Philip Hammond says that will mean most people will get around an average of Â£130 more a year in their pay packets. The national living wage (the minimum amount over-24s can earn) is also going up, from Â£7.83 to Â£8.21 an hour. The national minimum wage (for 18 to 24-year-olds) will increase, although the Chancellor didn't announce by exactly how much. Earlier in the year, Prime Minister Theresa May announced an extra Â£20.5bn would go to the NHS in England over the next five years. Now, Philip Hammond has explained where some of that money will go, including Â£2bn towards mental health spending. He's announced a new 24-hour mental health hotline. He's also spoken about more ""mental health ambulances"" - special vehicles used to treat people having a mental health episode. Jeremy Corbyn says the chancellor's promise to spend more on mental health is not enough. He says experts reckon the new money is ""only half of what is needed"". What is universal credit - and what's the problem? Universal credit is a system to merge six major benefits together, including unemployment and housing benefits. But many people have had a difficult time going from benefits to universal credit. Payments have been delayed, which have left some people out of pocket as they make the transitions. To try to smooth this, Philip Hammond has announced an extra Â£1bn for the next five years. Austerity is the series of budget cuts and tax rises made by the government since 2010, which includedcuts to departmentslike transport and local government. The ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end,"" said Philip Hammond in his budget speech. He's announced that government spending will start going back up again. But just saying it doesn't mean that austerity suddenly goes away. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in response: ""Austerity is not over."" He added: ""This budget won't undo the damage done by eight years of austerity."" A new tax will be introduced on big tech companies, which would include firms like Google and Facebook. The Chancellor says it will come into force in 2020, and will raise about Â£400m a year. But it may never actually come into place, as a group of rich countries - including the UK - is alsoplanninga similar tax. So if that tax comes in, the UK's tax won't be used. Make sense? Jeremy Corbyn says that tax is ""too little, too late"". Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

Woman blows herself up in Tunis,"At least nine people were injured when a 30-year-old woman blew herself up in the centre of Tunisia's capital, Tunis, the interior ministry says. Describing the blast as a ""terrorist explosion"", the ministry said the woman had had no previous known militant background. Eight of those hurt in the explosion on Avenue Habib Bourguiba, which runs through the middle of the city, were police officers. No deaths have been reported. No group has said it is behind the attack. The attack comes at a time when the country's vital tourism industry is starting to show signs of recovery, more than three years after two deadly terror attacks decimated visitor numbers. The first, an attack on the capital's Bardo Museum in March 2015, left 22 people dead. Just a few months later, in June, another 38 people were killed in a resort in Sousse. Africa Live: updates on this and other stories How Sousse attack changed Tunisia's security Pictures from the scene of the attack show a large number of emergency service personnel in the area. The explosion was 200 metres (220 yards) from the French Embassy and on the same road as the interior ministry, local journalist Souhail Khmira told the BBC. He arrived at the scene 15 minutes after the blast and says a cloud of black smoke was visible from far away. Shops, he said, were shut on what is usually one of the busiest streets in the capital, and police had barricaded the street. It is understood that a police checkpoint was the target, reports the BBC's North Africa correspondent, Rana Jawad. Tunisia has been under a state of emergency since 2015 when a suicide bomber killed 12 security agents on a bus for presidential guards, reports AFP news agency. This state of emergency was extended earlier this month until November 6, ahead of elections planned for next year, AFP adds.

And for those who can't get enough of this Budget, you can findall the official documents here,external. Goodnight. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says only if you consider ""a very tight definition"" of what austerity means. ""Arguably he's just about got to the absolute minimal definition of ending austerity but it's certainly nothing like a bonanza for the rest of the public services,"" he told the BBC. He adds that ""most of the planned welfare cuts are still on the books"". Philip Hammond was, perhaps uncharacteristically, in a very jovial mood. Not known for humour - in public, at least - the chancellor managed to raise a few laughs during his Budget speech. Here's his best gags, courtesy of the Press Association. The last Budget to be held on a Monday was in 1962 and Mr Hammond said: ""I
was six years old, tensions between Russia and the United States were rising and
a former foreign secretary turned chancellor delivered a Budget amid Cabinet
revolt...  I could swear I remember my parents turning to me and saying:
'Philip, one day, that can be you'."" By holding the statement on Monday rather than the usual Wednesday, the chancellor said he avoided a Halloween Budget which could have produced ""Hammo
House of Horrors"" headlines. But ""I have not avoided the blood-curdling
threats, the anguished wailing, and the strange banging of furniture that's
usually associated with Wednesday - I have kindly been invited to a special
meeting of the 1922 Committee this evening"". In a display of toilet humour, the chancellor promised that councils can
""relieve themselves"" with a tax break on public lavatories, although he did
not want to get ""bogged down"" on the subject. It was, he noted, one of the few
announcements that had not ""leaked"". In a nod to Mr McDonnell's recent accident, suffered tripping over fly-tipped
waste, the chancellor promised cash to deal with the issue ""although I cannot
guarantee that Â£10m is going to be enough to stop him falling flat on his
face in the future"". After announcing plans for a Â£400m digital services tax, Mr Hammond
also managed a quick jibe at Sir Nick Clegg, who has taken a senior role with
Facebook, joking that ""I am already looking forward to my call from the former
leader of the Liberal Democrats"". Hidden in theBudget Red Book,external(on page 80!) is news of a new prize-linked saving scheme for credit unions. The Budget document said: ""Credit unions play an important role in
facilitating savings and offering affordable borrowing to their members. ""To help people increase
their financial resilience while boosting awareness and membership of these community
organisations, the Budget commits to launching a pilot of a new prize-linked saving scheme for
credit unions."" More details will follow - such as timings and amounts - but the Treasury presumably hopes it could be a boost  for the sector. Matt Bland of the Association of British Credit Unions told the BBC: ""We're excited by the announcement. Credit unions are all about encouraging people to save and prize-linked savings is an interesting way to encourage savers."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scotch Whisky Association said the Chancellor's decision to continue the freeze on spirits duty was a ""welcome show of support"" for the industry. The measure means the price of a typical bottle is 30p lower than if it had risen by inflation, according to the Treasury. The duty rate on spirits remains Â£28.74 per litre of pure alcohol. Of the Â£14.15 average price of a bottle of Scotch whisky, Â£10.41 is collected in tax through excise duty and VAT, the SWA said. Hundreds of thousands of private-sector contractors face higher tax and National Insurance (NI) bills from April 2020, after today's Budget. The crackdown is the biggest revenue-raising measure in this year's budget. Ian Hyde, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, says it's a ""huge cost burden"" and a ""significant shift of risk"" for businesses which rely on contractors. âMany contractors have highly specialised skills and
it is crucial that these skills can be easily circulated amongst businesses.
However, these new rules may result in businesses scaling back their use of
contractors, slowing this transfer of skills from one business to another. âThe ultimate winner from these new rules is HMRC
which will now have thousands of businesses doing their policing for them, but
at what cost?,"" he asks. Read more here Simon JackBBC Business Editor 2018
has been an annus horribilis for the high street. Many
high street retailers have cried foul in the face of new
competition from online firms that employ fewer staff and pay far lower
business rates. There
are two ways you can level the playing field. Cut
charges for the traditional retailers or increase them for online traders. Mr
Hammond has done a bit of both. He has spent Â£900m knocking a third off the business rates billof 500,000 small retailers. Very welcome to those who have

make on digital services like advertising and streaming entertainment (but not
online sales). So will these two measures save the high
street? Probably not â at least not on their own. Read more here Mark Stokes at Deloitte has more exclusive analysis of today's Budget for the BBC: The Government will extend the stamp duty relief for first-time buyers to purchases of shared ownership properties worth up to Â£500,000. That means qualifying
purchasers will pay no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 paid on the purchase of their
home and 5% on the remainder up to the cap of Â£500,000. In welcome news for taxpayers who have bought homes that would have qualified
since the last Budget in November 2017, the rules will be backdated with
taxpayers able to claim a refund. A consultation will be published in January 2019 on the potential
introduction of a further 1% stamp duty charge on purchases of residential property
by non-UK residents. This follows significant changes to the taxation of
non-residents investing in UK residential real estate over recent years to
align their tax position with UK residents. The Budget offered nothing for those ""massacred"" by the Universal Credit welfare reforms, according to Frank Field, chair of the Commons' Work and Pensions Committee. He told the Commons cuts for families would get ""worse next year and worse the year after and worse the year after that"". He added: ""The Chancellor did make some very important additions to the Universal Credit Budget and I'm grateful, as all of us must be who've seen our constituents massacred by this benefit. ""But there are four big changes he has yet to announce if we are to be satisfied that the rollout of Universal Credit can roll out safely to every one of our constituents."" BBC World News Stephanie Flanders, former BBC economics correspondent and now a senior editor at Bloomberg, says the Prime Minister wanted ""a really big Budget"". But she points out that with the UK preparing to leave the EU on 29 March, that simply wasn't possible. ""It can't really be a watershed Budget, because we are months before this big question,"" she says. Philip Hammond didn't mention any negatives from Brexit, even going to far as to talk about a Brexit dividend, Ms Flanders adds.

Rory Cellan-JonesBBC technology correspondent Faced
with public anger over the low tax paid in the UK by the likes of Google,
Amazon and Facebook, the government has talked time and again of imposing some
kind of levy on the tech giants. The
problem has been designing it so that it doesn't stifle innovation from new
firms and coordinating action with other countries so that businesses aren't
put off investing in the UK. The
Chancellorâs solution is to target a Digital Services Tax at a narrow set of what
are described as digital business platform services - specifically search
engines, online marketplaces and social media firms. Which sounds like Google,
Amazon and Facebook. He
also makes it clear he hopes that by 2020 when the tax is due to be
introduced, a global agreement on a tax on digital turnover will have been
agreed. That
may be optimistic according to the trade body techUK, which warns that going it
alone would be costly. But
there is in any case still plenty to be sorted out about how the
new tax will work - and whether it can be as precisely targeted as the Treasury
seems to think. The Chancellor will be hoping that an international agreement rides to his rescue before the UK tax has to be imposed. BBC Radio 5 live Frank Jay owns a chilli shop in Leeds city centre. He tells BBC Radio 5 Live he is interested in the business rate relief announced by the chancellor for small retailers in England: ""I was pleasantly surprised. When I started the chilli shop, when we hit business rates, wow that was a big chunk of our income. And we were not getting anything from it - it was the difference between making the rent and not making the rent sometimes. ""So this has come as a big relief.  I'd prefer them to go further for small businesses to protect our high street, and go all the way and have [no business rates] for a couple of years, but yeah I'm much happier."" Anne Redston, professor of tax law at Kingâs College London, details two important changes in today's Budget relating to insolvent businesses: The Budget announced two important changes when businesses
are insolvent. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is an unsecured
creditor of an insolvent business, so is in the same position as anyone else
who is owed money by that business. But from April 2020, HMRC will be first in the queue, with a
priority right to recover any PAYE, employee national insurance contributions
(NICs), VAT and deductions made under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS). The governmentâs reasoning is that VAT, PAYE, employee NICs
and CIS are all money deducted from customers and employees, and held in trust
by the business. This new preferential creditor rule therefore does not apply
to corporation tax or employer NICs. The new rules will mean money is more likely to be
recovered from insolvent businesses than has been the

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has produced a rather handy word cloud to tell us. Unsurprisingly, deputy speaker, people and British all feature prominently.

Public spending will rise by Â£30bn by 2023-24 - a significant stimulus to be spent on the NHS and on raising the amount people can earn before they start paying tax. That is in sharp contrast to the five-year ""austerity"" plan announced in 2010, which saw cuts of 3% a year, and 2015, which included cuts of 1.3% a year. To pay for that, Mr Hammond will allow borrowing to to be sustained at about Â£20bn a year. Little talk today of ""balancing the books"" or the risk of a bad Brexit deal.

"Mother, son reunited after 1987 abduction","This video can not be played Lyneth Mann-Lewis comments on being reunited with her son after he was abducted 31 years ago A Canadian mother has been reunited with her son who was abducted in 1987 as a toddler. Jermaine Allan Mann was allegedly taken by his father when he was 21 months old during a scheduled visit in Toronto. He and his father lived under assumed names in the US until late last week, when his father was caught allegedly using falsified documents. The arrest brought an end to efforts by police in both countries to find the boy who went missing 31 years ago. Jermaine Allan Mann, now 33, had been told that his mother had died when he was a baby. Over the weekend, his mother Lyneth Mann-Lewis flew to the US for their reunification. On Monday, she described the seemingly endless hours between learning her son had been found and their first meeting. ""Words couldn't express what I felt,"" she said. ""The words 'Your son is alive, we found him' - that is breathtaking."" She said the first thing she did before she even spoke to her son was to grab hold of him. ""I wanted to see if he was real. I said 'Oh my God, my baby,'"" she said. They spoke for hours, she said, and she made sure to cook him a meal before she flew back to Canada. How was Jermaine Allan Mann found? Allan Mann, 66,  is alleged to have abducted his son on 24 June, 1987 during a scheduled visitation in Canada. He and Ms Mann-Lewis had separated the year before.

On 26 October, Mr Mann was arrested in Vernon, Connecticut, about 12 miles (20km) from Hartford, the state's capital. Mr Mann, a dual Canadian and Ghanaian citizen, is alleged to have obtained counterfeit birth certificates for himself and his son that claimed the pair were from Texas. The day out that reunited a boy with his family Mum jailed for abducting daughters The birth certificates were recently flagged as fake when Mr Mann used them as part of an application for a rental unit in federally subsidised housing. He was later identified using facial recognition software. He is facing charges of making false statements in the US. He also faces extradition to Canada on an abduction charge on completion of his prosecution south of the border. None of the allegations against Mr Mann have been tested in court. Ms Mann-Lewis said she and Jermaine now had ""the time to move forward"" as a family.

Gay teen beaten on bus in hate crimeKydis Zellinger was repeatedly punched in the face by a man shouting homophobic slurs.Bristol,"Kydis Zellinger was attacked on the bus in a homophobic hate crime An 18-year-old gay man was viciously beaten up on the bus going home ""for being different"", a court heard. Kydis Zellinger was repeatedly punched in the face by a man shouting homophobic abuse in the hate crime. Mr Zellinger said he was ""scared for his life"" in the prolonged attack in south Bristol on 15 October. Paul Austin, 27, of Inns Court, Bristol, pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced, at Bristol Magistrates Court earlier, to 18 weeks in jail. Mr Zellinger, who had been making his way home at the time of the attack, was in tears as he told the court: ""I can't understand why any human being could attack another in this way. ""I don't understand what I'd done to upset him - the only thing I can think of is he has a problem with my sexuality."" Austin started shouting at Mr Zellinger when the teenager climbed aboard the number 76 bus in the Redcliffe Hill area of Bristol on 15 October. He followed Mr Zellinger to the upper deck of the bus and punched him in the face while shouting homophobic insults. When Mr Zellinger tried to get off the bus, Austin repeatedly punched him in the face, head and neck. The victim was left with two black eyes, cuts, bruises and swelling on his face and inside his mouth. Mr Zellinger told the court he felt ""emotionally drained and vulnerable"" and ""frightened to go out"". ""I want this male to face up to what he's done and realise his actions are not acceptable, to hurt people in this way just for being different,"" he said. Magistrates condemned the ""sustained and repeated and unprovoked assault, motivated by hostility to the victim's sexuality"". Austin had previously pleaded guilty to one count of assault by beating and was sentenced to 18 weeks in jail. At the time of the offence he was on bail for a separate assault in August and was given an eight-week sentence to run concurrent.

Toilet humour from Hammond,"This video can not be played Philip Hammond: ""This is virtually the only announcement in this Budget that hasnât leaked."" Owners will no longer pay business rates on public toilets, the chancellor has said. Philip Hammond revealed the policy in his Budget speech, joking it was virtually the only announcement that had not been ""leaked"". The relief will apply to any standalone facilities available for public use, whether publicly or privately owned. The British Toilet Association has estimated that 40% of public toilets have disappeared in the past decade. More than 600 public toilets across the UK have stopped being maintained by councils since 2010 and in 37 areas major councils no longer run any,according to figures obtained by the BBC. Budget: Rolling coverage At-a-glance: The Budget key points What the Budget means for you Local authorities are not legally required to provide toilets, so they are often closed as councils look to cut costs. Public toilets have traditionally been liable for business rates in the same way as other non-domestic premises such as shops and offices. MPs groaned as Mr Hammond made a string of toilet jokes, including saying that local authorities could at last ""relieve themselves"". The chancellor also promised to help High Street shopsby cutting business rates by a third for all retailers in England with a rateable value of Â£51,000 or less.

Six ways Budget will impact young people,"The day we've been waiting for all year has finally come around - thebudget's been announced. Ok - that might be a stretch but the government has outlined what it's going to do with its money for the next few years. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond stood in Parliament for more than an hour explaining all the changes he's making to the country's finances. Here are some of the most important bits that may affect you. Nope, we can't talk about anything right now without mentioning Brexit. The Chancellor announced that he's keeping an extra Â£500m back in case Brexit goes badly. That means he's got about Â£4.4bn stashed away to pay for any problems the UK has as a result of Brexit. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, we'll get an emergency budget before the scheduled leave day of 29 March. That's the last time we'll mention Brexit - promise. First, here's how your pay will be affected. The amount of your wage you get tax-free - known as the personal allowance - is going up from Â£11,850 to Â£12,500 a year from April 2019. Philip Hammond says that will mean most people will get around an average of Â£130 more a year in their pay packets. The national living wage (the minimum amount over-24s can earn) is also going up, from Â£7.83 to Â£8.21 an hour. The national minimum wage (for 18 to 24-year-olds) will increase, although the Chancellor didn't announce by exactly how much. Earlier in the year, Prime Minister Theresa May announced an extra Â£20.5bn would go to the NHS in England over the next five years. Now, Philip Hammond has explained where some of that money will go, including Â£2bn towards mental health spending. He's announced a new 24-hour mental health hotline. He's also spoken about more ""mental health ambulances"" - special vehicles used to treat people having a mental health episode. Jeremy Corbyn says the chancellor's promise to spend more on mental health is not enough. He says experts reckon the new money is ""only half of what is needed"". What is universal credit - and what's the problem? Universal credit is a system to merge six major benefits together, including unemployment and housing benefits. But many people have had a difficult time going from benefits to universal credit. Payments have been delayed, which have left some people out of pocket as they make the transitions. To try to smooth this, Philip Hammond has announced an extra Â£1bn for the next five years. Austerity is the series of budget cuts and tax rises made by the government since 2010, which includedcuts to departmentslike transport and local government. The ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end,"" said Philip Hammond in his budget speech. He's announced that government spending will start going back up again. But just saying it doesn't mean that austerity suddenly goes away. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in response: ""Austerity is not over."" He added: ""This budget won't undo the damage done by eight years of austerity."" A new tax will be introduced on big tech companies, which would include firms like Google and Facebook. The Chancellor says it will come into force in 2020, and will raise about Â£400m a year. But it may never actually come into place, as a group of rich countries - including the UK - is alsoplanninga similar tax. So if that tax comes in, the UK's tax won't be used. Make sense? Jeremy Corbyn says that tax is ""too little, too late"". Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

Crashed jet 'had prior instrument error',"This video can not be played Debris found from Lion Air crash in sea The Indonesian jet which crashed shortly after take-off had suffered instrument problems the day before, according to a technical log obtained by the BBC. A technical log from a flight from Bali to Jakarta on Sunday said an instrument was ""unreliable"" and the pilot had to hand over to the first officer. The Boeing 737 airliner crashed into the sea with 189 people on board. It went down after taking off from Jakarta. There is no sign of survivors. The BBC has so far been unable to reach Lion Air, the low-cost airline which owns the plane, for comment. Flight JT 610 was headed for the western city of Pangkal Pinang on Monday when it came down. Rescuers have recovered some bodies and personal items, including baby shoes. Families are being told to go to a hospital to identify the dead. How could a brand new plane crash? Mourning siblings and mystery couple on ill-fated plane Images from the Lion Air plane crash The incident is reported to be the first major accident involving a Boeing 737 Max - an updated version of the 737. A technical log obtained by the BBC from the plane's previous flight suggests that the airspeed reading on the captain's instrument was unreliable, and the altitude readings differed on the captain's and first officer's instruments. ""Identified that CAPT [captain's] instrument was unreliable and handover control to FO [first officer],"" the log reads. ""Continue NNC of Airspeed Unreliable and ALT disagree."" The crew decided to continue their flight and landed safely at Jakarta. Belongings - including a handbag - and debris are being recovered from the suspected crash site Earlier Lion Air Chief Executive Edward Sirait said the plane had had an unspecified ""technical issue"" when flying from Denpasar in Bali to Jakarta, but he added that this had been ""resolved"". ""If the plane was broken, it would have been impossible to clear the plane to fly from Denpasar,"" he said. ""When we received the flight crew's report, we immediately fixed the problem."" The airline operates 11 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes but the others have not had a similar technical problem and there is no plan to ground the fleet, he added. Flight JT 610 took off from Jakarta at 06:20 on Monday (23:30 GMT on Sunday). It was due to arrive at Depati Amir airport in Pangkal Pinang an hour later but 13 minutes into the flight, authorities lost contact. The pilot had asked to return to Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta airport, officials say. The head of Indonesia's disaster agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, has tweeted images of debris and personal belongings that came from the aircraft and had been found floating in the sea.

Air disasters timeline Lion Air said in a statement that the pilot and co-pilot had had more than 11,000 flight hours between them. Three of the crew on board were trainee flight attendants and one was a technician. Relatives of the passengers arrive at the crisis centre at Jakarta airport Twenty employees from Indonesia's finance ministry were also on board, the BBC has learned. A ministry spokesperson said they had worked at the finance ministry offices in Pangkal Pinang but had been in Jakarta for the weekend. The 737 Max series are the fastest-selling planes in Boeing's history and there are four models - the Max 7, Max 8, Max 9 and Max 10. The Boeing 737 Max 8 has been in commercial use since 2016. The aircraft involved in the crash was made in 2018. It is a single-aisle plane used for short-haul travel. In a statement, Boeing expressed sympathy for the victims and families,externaland said it stood ""ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation"". Australia told government workers and contractors to stop using the airline until the findings of the investigation were out. Indonesia, a vast archipelago, is heavily reliant on air travel but many of its airlines have a poor safety record. This Lion Air plane landed in the sea off Bali in 2013, but all passengers and crew survived Established in 1999, Lion Air operates domestic flights as well as international routes to South East Asia, Australia and the Middle East. It has had issues of safety and poor management in the past and was banned from flying into European airspace until 2016. In 2013, Lion Air flight 904 crashed into the sea on landing at Bali's International Airport.All 108 people on board survived. In 2004, flight 538 from Jakarta crashed and broke up on landing at Solo City, killing 25 people. In 2011 and 2012 a number of pilots were found in possession of methamphetamines, in one incident hours before a flight.

KKK display treated as 'hate crime',"The picture was taken a few doors down from the Bangladesh Islamic Centre in Newtownards A report of a group of people dressed as Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members in Newtownards, County Down, is being treated by police as a hate crime. Pictures emerged of the group posing near an Islamic prayer house. The pictures were taken on Saturday night on Greenwell Street. The incident was reported to police at about 17:00 GMT on Sunday. Strangford MLAs have condemned the incident. PSNI Insp Richard Murray said: ""Hate crime, in all its forms, is totally unacceptable. The Chief Constable, George Hamilton, toldBBC NI's The Nolan Showthe incident was ""disgusting and distasteful"". ""There's no place for it anywhere in Northern Ireland. We will investigate it and report the evidence to the PPS,"" he added. This video can not be played A group of people dressed in KKK outfits in County Down BBC News NI has obtained footage of men dressed in KKK outfits in a JD Wetherspoon pub in the town. JD Wetherspoon spokesperson Eddie Gershon said the group was ""refused entry by door staff, but pushed past them into the pub"". He said: ""They were told by bar staff that they would not be served. They remained in the pub for five minutes, unserved, and then left."" Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said the picture of the people dressed as members of the white supremacist group was a ""clear demonstration of aggression"" and ""that is a hate crime."" The picture appears to have been taken a few doors down from the Bangladesh Islamic Centre in Newtownards. In August last year,a pig's head was left on the doorstep of the centre. DUP MLA Peter Weir tweeted that the pictures showed ""malevolent intent"". Ulster Unionist Mike Nesbitt tweeted he was ""disgusted"" and would pass the picture to the PSNI Chief Constable.

Belfast Islamic Centre executive treasurer Dr Raied Al-Wazzan said the small Muslim community in Newtownards had been left shaken by the incident. ""They could have gone to anywhere in Newtownards, anywhere in Northern Ireland dressing in any uniform, but to go in front of an Islamic prayer room, it's totally making people afraid,"" he told The Nolan Show. ""They are afraid to come out or even to go there."" Dr Al-Wazzan acknowledged that it could have been a Halloween prank, and called upon those involved to come forward and identify themselves. ""If they keep it quiet for the next 24 hours, that means it was a deliberate act,"" he said. ""If this is just a joke, these people should come forward and identify themselves. ""To go there specifically wearing that costume in front of the Islamic centre is not acceptable. It's similar to somebody wearing a Nazi uniform and going in front of a Jewish synagogue."" Belfast Islamic Centre executive treasurer Dr Raied Al-Wazzan said the small Muslim community in Newtownards had been left shaken One man, who did not want to be named, lives near a bar in Newtownards and told the BBC he saw the group go into it. ""We were disturbed by mens' voices. I looked out the blinds and saw men in KKK costumes. One was giving a fascist salute. They looked like proper KKK outfits - they had the flap that covers the face,"" he said. ""They were shouting and posing outside the pub. ""At about 02:00 GMT they came out of the bar so they had been allowed into it in their costumes. ""It's insensitive - it's not a laugh and it's not just about Halloween. ""Last year, a pig's head was thrown through the door of the Islamic centre. ""This is ethnically diverse town. What if a black family had been walking home from a Halloween party and been confronted with that? ""I was disgusted and also was saddened by the reaction on social media."" Ms Armstrong, who has an office near where the photographs are said to have been taken, said the KKK represented a ""brand of hatred not wanted or welcome in the area"". She told BBC's Good Morning Ulster that people in the area were ""disgusted"". ""They were people who purchased KKK robes,"" she said. ""They were wearing hoods and carrying crosses and they happened to go outside the Islamic prayer house, they were in bars in the town, expressing religious intolerance - and that's a hate crime. ""Some are saying this is just a Halloween jape. No it's not. Everyone knows what the KKK stands for"" she added.

Rotherham child sex abuse gang guilty,"Clockwise from top left: Iqlak Yousaf, Nabeel Kurshid, Mohammed Imran Ali Akhtar, Tanweer Ali, Salah Ahmed El-Hakam and Asif Ali were found guilty after a trial Seven men have been found guilty of grooming and exploiting young girls, including one who was sexually abused by ""at least 100 Asian men"" before the age of 16. Sheffield Crown Court heard how the men targeted and exploited the teenagers before subjecting them to acts of a ""degrading and violent nature"". They abused five young girls over a seven year period in Rotherham. The gang were convicted of offences including rape and indecent assault. One girl described being bitten and raped by two of the men in Sherwood Forest while ""high as a kite"" on drugs. Mohammed Imran Ali Akhtar, 37, Asif Ali, 33, Tanweer Ali, 37, Salah Ahmed El-Hakam, 39, Nabeel Kurshid, 35, Iqlak Yousaf, 34, and a seventh man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted after a trial. An eighth man, Ajmal Rafiq, 39, was found not guilty of one count of false imprisonment and one count of indecent assault. The men are due to be sentenced on 16 November. The convictions are the latest to come out of Operation Stovewood, the National Crime Agency's (NCA) investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, which has identified more than 1,500 victims. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire All the offences took place in and around Rotherham between 1998 and 2005 During a trial lasting more than eight weeks the jury heard the men, who are all of British Pakistani heritage, preyed on the girls' vulnerability before they were sexually assaulted and passed on to other men. Prosecutor Michelle Colborne QC said the girls had been ""lured by the excitement of friendship with older Asian youths"" but were then ""targeted, sexualised and in some instances subjected to acts of a degrading and violent nature"". She said: ""None of them had the maturity to understand that they were being groomed and exploited, often believing that sex of some kind was a necessary price for friendship."" Operation Stovewood is the largest law enforcement investigation into non-familial child sexual exploitation in the UK. It began in 2014 after a report found at least 1,400 children in Rotherham were the victims of abuse between 1997 and 2013. It is run by the NCA, which is working with 296 alleged victims, has identified 151 suspects and is running 22 ongoing investigations. More than 150 officers work on the operation and there are plans to recruit another 100. It is jointly funded by South Yorkshire Police and the Home Office and when up to full strength will cost Â£15m a year to run. It has led to 14 convictions so far, and 24 more people have been charged with offences. The court head the men used alcohol, drugs, threats and violence to control the girls. On girl said Ali Akhtar regularly threatened to dump her in remote locations if she did not have sex with him and his friends and on one occasion he abandoned her by the side of a motorway. The same girl said Ali Akhtar would take her to meet older Asian taxi drivers who would then abuse her. Another recounted how as Tanweer Ali raped her in the back of a car he told her: ""It's better you just get it over and done with and then you can go back home"". Victims were assaulted and abused in locations across Rotherham, including Clifton Park The court heard some of the girls had already been exploited by other men in Rotherham. The girls were abused in locations across Rotherham, the court heard, including at the tip in Rawmarsh, in a supermarket car park, and at Clifton Park and Ulley Country Park. One girl, who was 14 at the time, was given cannabis and driven to Sherwood Forest by Nabeel Kurshid, Iqlak Yousaf and a third man. The men then took turns raping her, warning her that if she did not do as she was told she would be left there. Ms Colborne said the girl became pregnant as a result of the attack and was forced to have a termination. 14 men have now been convicted as a result of Operation Stovewood The men denied the offences, claiming either the girls were lying or what had happened had been consensual. However, in July 2015 Ali Akhtar was recorded by one of the victims as he tried to find out if she had spoken to the police. In the recording he said: ""The thing is that was a wrong time when Shatan [the devil] whispers to you and says to you: 'Enjoy life, take drugs'. He wants you to do haram [acts forbidden by Allah]."" He went on to suggest that other girls had come forward in order ""to get some coin"". Mike Duffy of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: ""These men deliberately preyed on young, vulnerable teenagers, grooming and exploiting them. ""They denied the abuse but evidence put forward by the CPS, including the victim's accounts of the incidents, resulted in the jury finding them guilty. ""I would like to thank the victims who came forward and bravely supported this prosecution."" Mohammed Imran Ali Akhtar, 37, of Godstone Road, Rotherham, was found guilty of one rape, one charge of aiding and abetting rape, three indecent assaults, one charge of procuring a girl under 21 to have unlawful sexual intercourse with another and one sexual assault Nabeel Kurshid, 35, of Weetwood Road, Rotherham, was found guilty of two rapes and one indecent assault Iqlak Yousaf, 34, Tooker Road, Rotherham, was found guilty of two rapes and two indecent assaults Tanweer Ali, 37, of Godstone Road, Rotherham, was found guilty of two rapes, two indecent assaults and one charge of false imprisonment Salah Ahmed El-Hakam, 39, Tudor Close, Sheffield, was found guilty of one rape Asif Ali, 33, of Clough Road, Rotheham, was found guilty of two indecent assaults A seventh defendant, who cannot be named, was found guilty of two rapes Rotherham abuse girls 'were easy targets' Jail for man who raped grooming victim Three men jailed in Rotherham abuse case Crime agency begins abuse inquiry National Crime Agency Life-saving nasal spray used on woman suffering potentially lethal drug overdose in South Yorkshire first Fracking: Formal plans for fracking project on Yorkshire coast to be submitted âimminentlyâ 28 remarkable photos take you around Yorkshire in 1969 North Yorkshire snow: Council bosses defend response to snow as some roads are still unusable Doncaster Music Festival to rename stage in honour of photographer after death Council staff and gritters on standby to deal with floods and freezing temperature Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Gay teen beaten on bus in hate crime,"Kydis Zellinger was attacked on the bus in a homophobic hate crime An 18-year-old gay man was viciously beaten up on the bus going home ""for being different"", a court heard. Kydis Zellinger was repeatedly punched in the face by a man shouting homophobic abuse in the hate crime. Mr Zellinger said he was ""scared for his life"" in the prolonged attack in south Bristol on 15 October. Paul Austin, 27, of Inns Court, Bristol, pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced, at Bristol Magistrates Court earlier, to 18 weeks in jail. Mr Zellinger, who had been making his way home at the time of the attack, was in tears as he told the court: ""I can't understand why any human being could attack another in this way. ""I don't understand what I'd done to upset him - the only thing I can think of is he has a problem with my sexuality."" Austin started shouting at Mr Zellinger when the teenager climbed aboard the number 76 bus in the Redcliffe Hill area of Bristol on 15 October. He followed Mr Zellinger to the upper deck of the bus and punched him in the face while shouting homophobic insults. When Mr Zellinger tried to get off the bus, Austin repeatedly punched him in the face, head and neck. The victim was left with two black eyes, cuts, bruises and swelling on his face and inside his mouth. Mr Zellinger told the court he felt ""emotionally drained and vulnerable"" and ""frightened to go out"". ""I want this male to face up to what he's done and realise his actions are not acceptable, to hurt people in this way just for being different,"" he said. Magistrates condemned the ""sustained and repeated and unprovoked assault, motivated by hostility to the victim's sexuality"". Austin had previously pleaded guilty to one count of assault by beating and was sentenced to 18 weeks in jail. At the time of the offence he was on bail for a separate assault in August and was given an eight-week sentence to run concurrent.

Social network goes offline after shooting,"Gab was launched in August 2016 and used to use a frog logo A Twitter-rival used by the man accused of a gun attack on a US synagogue has gone offline after several technology services withdrew support from it. Gab describes itself as a defender of ""free speech and expression"" with nearly 800,000 users. It has faced criticism in the past for providing an outlet for far-right figureheads and conspiracy theorists banned from other social networks. Theservice has said,externalit has ""zero tolerance"" for terrorism and violence. It has, however, acknowledged that a verified account whose details matched those of the alleged Tree of Life Synagogue shooter had been active on its service. The account, registered to Robert Bowers, had posted several anti-Semitic messages on the platform. And in a final update had written: ""Screw your optics, I'm going in,"" shortly before the Pittsburgh attack. Gab said it was ""ready and willing to work with law enforcement"" and noted that the suspect ""also had accounts on other social networks"". It said ""high volumes"" of criminal activity were present on other social media platforms. And it specifically criticised Twitter forhaving hosted posts from anti-Semites,externaland""Isis cells"",external, adding no-one was calling for its competitor's closure. Even so, some of the technology companies who have severed their relationship with Gab said they were uncomfortable with its behaviour . Pittsburgh shooting: Survivors relive synagogue ordeal Gab user's anti-Semitic posts removed Gab: Free speech haven or alt-right safe space? Among them is PayPal, which banned the company from using its money-transfer service on Saturday. Eleven people were killed in Saturday's attack ""When a site is explicitly allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action,"" PayPal said in a statement. Internet domain registrar GoDaddy also explained why it had given Gab just 24 hours to find another provider. ""In response to complaints received over the weekend, GoDaddy investigated and discovered numerous instances of content on the site that both promotes and encourages violence against people,"" a spokesman told BBC News. Gab has reported that afurther three technology companies,external, which have not publicly commented, had also banned or suspended it: Samsung-owned Joyent, which provides web-hosting services Stripe, an online payments processor Medium, the blogging platform, which Gab had used to publish a statement about the synagogue attack In addition, Gab hassuggested that Twitter might soon block it,external. Gab's website currently shows this message ""Show the world that your TOS [terms of service] means nothing and your rules are enforced subjectively at will,"" it posted. This is not the first time Gab has clashed with others. Apple and Google have both banned its app from their stores and Microsoft stopped hosting the platform on its Azure cloud computing platform in September. But Gab has said that it still has ""plenty of options, resources and support"" after the latest setback and is ""working around to clock"" to get back online. Critics have described the site as a ""haven"" for the far-right, since many controversial figures have moved there after being banned from Twitter and Facebook. Among them are conspiracy theorist Alex Jones; the founder of the neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer, Andrew Anglin; and the anti-Islam group Britain First. Gab says it welcomes all speech and members should mute accounts they do not want to see Not everything is allowed on Gab. Its terms and conditions do not allow direct threats of violence. And founder Andrew Torba has previously blogged disavowing political violence. Posts that break US laws - such as copyright content and images of child abuse - are also not allowed. A small number of Gab users have complained that the platform does not allow cartoon depictions of children in sexual situations. The company has told those people to go ""somewhere else"" Gab does not carry advertising. Instead, members can pay for a Pro membership that unlocks several features, including video live-streaming Apple has never allowed Gab on its App Store, citing pornographic content and hate speech. Gab was available on the Google Play store until August 2017, when Google removed it citing hate speech. The company has produced versions of its app with content filters switched on by default but Apple and Google have not allowed this on their app stores. Gab has described this as Silicon Valley censorship Gab has faced censorship accusations of its own. In 2017, its web domain registrar ordered it to delete a post mocking Heather Heyer, a woman killed in protest-related violence in Charlottesville. Faced with the threat of losing its web domain, Gab deleted the post and sought a new domain registrar. Its cloud service provider, Microsoft, also ordered it to delete two anti-Semitic posts. However, these were subsequently removed by the writer himself. Gab has said it wants to develop its own decentralised infrastructure so that it can avoid censorship Microsoft steps in over anti-Semitic posts Google faces lawsuit over Gab removal Gab: Free speech haven or alt-right safe space?

Passenger plane crashes in sea off Jakarta,"This video can not be played Debris found from Lion Air crash in sea An Indonesian airliner has crashed into the sea with 189 people on board. The Boeing 737, owned by the low-cost airline Lion Air, went down after taking off from the capital Jakarta. Flight JT 610 was headed for the western city of Pangkal Pinang. Rescuers have recovered some bodies and personal items, including baby shoes. There is no sign of survivors. The cause of the crash, which involved a plane that had been in operation since August, remains unclear. The incident is reported to be the first major accident involving a Boeing 737 Max - an updated version of the 737. ""We need to find the main wreckage,"" said Bambang Suryo, operational director of the search and rescue agency. ""I predict there are no survivors, based on body parts found so far."" Belongings - including a handbag - and debris are being recovered from the suspected crash site Families are being told to go to a hospital to identify the dead. Flight JT 610 took off from Jakarta at 06:20 on Monday (23:30 GMT on Sunday). It was due to arrive at Depati Amir airport in Pangkal Pinang an hour later but 13 minutes into the flight, authorities lost contact. The pilot had asked to return to Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta airport, officials say. How could a brand new plane crash? Images from the Lion Air plane crash Lion Air Chief Executive Edward Sirait said the plane had an unspecified ""technical issue"" on a previous flight, but he said that this had been ""resolved"". The airline operates 11 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes but the others have not had a similar technical problem and there is no plan to ground the fleet, he added. Relatives of the passengers arrive at the crisis centre at Jakarta airport The head of Indonesia's disaster agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, has tweeted images of debris and personal belongings that came from the aircraft and had been found floating in the sea.

How likely are you to survive a plane crash? Air disasters timeline by Rebecca Henschke, BBC Indonesia correspondent, Jakarta Relatives of those on board are waiting anxiously for any news at a crisis centre at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma airport, their faces stained with tears. At a desk under a white tent, Lion Air staff are taking down their details. At the top of the forms, they are asked to specify their relationship to the missing - husband, mother, child. Murtado Kurniawan's wife was on the plane. They are newly married and she was making the journey for work. ""I can't live without her, I love her,"" he says through tears. ""The last thing I said to her, was 'be careful'. I always worry about her when she goes away. When I saw on TV that the plane had crashed, my whole body went weak."" Murtado Kurniawan's wife was on board Dede dropped her niece Fiona Ayu and her family off at the airport on Monday morning, to make the short journey home. Fiona is trying to get pregnant via IVF and her family thought it would be good for her to get some rest. ""The airline kept telling us to wait and wait for news, but the images on social media and television are very bad,"" Dede says. ""But I am still holding out hope that she will come back, I am praying and praying for that."" Lion Air said in a statement that the pilot and co-pilot had more than 11,000 flight hours between them. Three of the crew on board were trainee flight attendants and one was a technician. Twenty employees from Indonesia's finance ministry were also on board, the BBC has learned. A ministry spokesperson said they worked at the finance ministry offices in Pangkal Pinang but had been in Jakarta for the weekend. The 737 Max series are the fastest-selling planes in Boeing history, and there are four models - the Max 7, Max 8, Max 9 and Max 10. The Boeing 737 Max 8 has been in commercial use since 2016. The aircraft involved in the crash was made in 2018. It is a single aisle plane used for short-haul travel. In a statement, Boeing expressed sympathy for the victims and families,externaland said it ""stands ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation"". Australia told government workers and contractors to stop using the airline until the findings of the investigation were out. Indonesia, a vast archipelago, is heavily reliant on air travel, but many of its airlines have a poor safety record. This Lion Air plane landed in the sea off Bali in 2013, but all passengers and crew survived Established in 1999, Lion Air operates domestic flights as well as international routes to South East Asia, Australia and the Middle East. It has had issues of safety and poor management in the past and was banned from flying into European airspace until 2016. In 2013, Lion Air flight 904 crashed into the sea on landing at Bali's International Airport.All 108 people on board survived. In 2004, flight 538 from Jakarta crashed and broke up on landing at Solo City, killing 25 people. In 2011 and 2012 a number of pilots were found in possession of methamphetamines, in one incident hours before a flight.

Corbyn - Budget is full of broken promises,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has condemned a ""broken promises Budget"" and dismissed the government's claims to be ending austerity. He accused the government of focusing on ""ideological tax cuts"" and called for a pay rise for public sector workers. ""What we heard today were half measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on,"" he said. The chancellor said Labour lacked the ""discipline"" to manage the economy. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Hammond: 'Austerity coming to an end' Budget 2018: Live updates Philip Hammond's Budget included a Â£1bn investment to help welfare claimants transfer to new consolidated benefit universal credit - but Mr Corbyn said cuts were still ""hardwired"" into the system. ""The reality is austerity is not over,"" he said, adding that ""chunks of the deficit"" had been moved to NHS and local authority budgets. Philip Hammond did not look impressed by Jeremy Corbyn's response to his Budget He also dismissed a pledge of extra money for social care as a ""drop in the ocean"" and said the government was still not offering enough money for the NHS despite its commitment of an extra Â£20bn over the next five years. Labour has promised to increase spending by Â£50bn - raised by tax rises on high earners - as the first stage of its pledge to ""reverse"" austerity. And Mr Corbyn promised to raise investment ""across the board"". The Labour leader said uncertainty over Brexit was ""making things even worse"", saying some Conservatives ""fantasise"" about a ""race to the bottom"" on rights and regulations once the UK left the EU.

Analysis: Big spender,"There was one big challenge for the chancellor today - map out a plan for ""ending austerity"" as demanded by the prime minister. Ending rather than ended is probably the most accurate analysis - with plans for many billions of pounds of extra spending. Some might say Philip Hammond has discovered his inner Gordon Brown. The public finances are in better shape - borrowing is Â£11.9bn lower this year than expected. But as the official watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, put it: ""The Budget spends the fiscal windfall rather than saving it."" This is the largest ""fiscal loosening"" - extra spending by the government not matched by tax rises - since 2010. The chancellor said that public spending would increase by 1.2% a year over five years from 2020. Public spending will rise by Â£30bn by 2023-24, a significant stimulus to be spent on the NHS and on raising the amount people can earn before they start paying tax. That is in sharp contrast to the five year ""austerity"" plan announced in 2010, which saw cuts of 3% a year, and 2015, which included cuts of 1.3% a year. To pay for that, Mr Hammond will allow borrowing to to be sustained at around Â£20bn a year. Little talk today of ""balancing the books"" or the risk of a bad Brexit deal. At-a-glance summary What it means for you Hammond hails better borrowing figures Tech giants face digital services tax There is better news on the economy. The OBR upgraded its forecast for growth for the next two years, which means the government is likely to enjoy higher tax revenues. But growth is still relatively weak, falling back to levels low by historic standards from 2020. The test for Mr Hammond is this. Will the better news on the public finances and high levels of employment be maintained? If it isn't then the plans for extra spending will look very heroic indeed.

How are young people affected?,"The day we've been waiting for all year has finally come around - thebudget's been announced. Ok - that might be a stretch but the government has outlined what it's going to do with its money for the next few years. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond stood in Parliament for more than an hour explaining all the changes he's making to the country's finances. Here are some of the most important bits that may affect you. Nope, we can't talk about anything right now without mentioning Brexit. The Chancellor announced that he's keeping an extra Â£500m back in case Brexit goes badly. That means he's got about Â£4.4bn stashed away to pay for any problems the UK has as a result of Brexit. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, we'll get an emergency budget before the scheduled leave day of 29 March. That's the last time we'll mention Brexit - promise. First, here's how your pay will be affected. The amount of your wage you get tax-free - known as the personal allowance - is going up from Â£11,850 to Â£12,500 a year from April 2019. Philip Hammond says that will mean most people will get around an average of Â£130 more a year in their pay packets. The national living wage (the minimum amount over-24s can earn) is also going up, from Â£7.83 to Â£8.21 an hour. The national minimum wage (for 18 to 24-year-olds) will increase, although the Chancellor didn't announce by exactly how much. Earlier in the year, Prime Minister Theresa May announced an extra Â£20.5bn would go to the NHS in England over the next five years. Now, Philip Hammond has explained where some of that money will go, including Â£2bn towards mental health spending. He's announced a new 24-hour mental health hotline. He's also spoken about more ""mental health ambulances"" - special vehicles used to treat people having a mental health episode. Jeremy Corbyn says the chancellor's promise to spend more on mental health is not enough. He says experts reckon the new money is ""only half of what is needed"". What is universal credit - and what's the problem? Universal credit is a system to merge six major benefits together, including unemployment and housing benefits. But many people have had a difficult time going from benefits to universal credit. Payments have been delayed, which have left some people out of pocket as they make the transitions. To try to smooth this, Philip Hammond has announced an extra Â£1bn for the next five years. Austerity is the series of budget cuts and tax rises made by the government since 2010, which includedcuts to departmentslike transport and local government. The ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end,"" said Philip Hammond in his budget speech. He's announced that government spending will start going back up again. But just saying it doesn't mean that austerity suddenly goes away. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in response: ""Austerity is not over."" He added: ""This budget won't undo the damage done by eight years of austerity."" A new tax will be introduced on big tech companies, which would include firms like Google and Facebook. The Chancellor says it will come into force in 2020, and will raise about Â£400m a year. But it may never actually come into place, as a group of rich countries - including the UK - is alsoplanninga similar tax. So if that tax comes in, the UK's tax won't be used. Make sense? Jeremy Corbyn says that tax is ""too little, too late"". Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

Tech giants face digital services tax,"Technology giants will be forced to pay tax on the sales they generate in the UK, under new plans announced in the Budget. Chancellor Philip Hammond plans to introduce a digital services tax from April 2020 following a consultation. He said ""established tech giants"" will be targeted rather than start-ups. Companies such as Amazon and Facebook have been criticised for the small amount of tax they pay in the UK. Both the 36-member OECD and the European Commission have been trying to reach a consensus on imposing a digital tax on social media platforms, internet marketplaces and search engines. However, Mr Hammond said that progress was ""painfully slow"". He said: ""It is clearly not sustainable or fair that digital platform businesses can generate substantial value in the UK without paying tax here."" Live reaction to Budget Hammond: 'Austerity coming to an end' Budget key points: At-a-glance Hammond hails better borrowing figures Budget calculator The digital services tax is a levy against social media platforms, internet marketplaces and search engines. The chancellor is proposing a 2% tax rate against the sales that large digital companies make in the UK. Chancellor Philip Hammond hopes the digital services tax will raises as much as Â£440m a year At the moment, these firms pay taxes on UK profits, which is a much smaller figure than revenues. The Treasury forecasts that the tax will generate Â£275m in 2019-20, rising to Â£370m in the following year. It then expects that digital services tax receipts will reach Â£400m in 2021-22 and Â£440m the year after. Mr Hammond said that the digital services tax would be imposed on companies that are profitable and generate ""at least Â£500m a year in global revenue"". Although he did not name them, US technology giants Amazon, Google and Facebook have been criticised for the relatively small amount of tax they pay in the UK. Amazon's UK paid Â£1.7m in taxes last year despite profits almost trebling to Â£72.3m Mr Hammond emphasised that start-ups would be protected from the levy. However, Julian David, chief executive of industry body TechUK, said the proposed Â£500m threshold was ""low"" and ""and risks capturing much smaller companies than anticipated"". ""This approach risks undermining the UK's reputation as the best place to start a tech business or to invest,"" he added. Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google has been contacted for comment. Mr Hammond has earmarked April 2020 for the new levy. However, it may not even go ahead if Europe moves ahead with its own digital levy which would tax firms at a 3% rate. Zubin Patel, corporate tax partner at accountancy firm Deloitte, said: ""There will be further consultation on the detail of the proposal, which is temporary and subject to formal review in 2025."" The Treasury also said earlier this year that a levy on digital companies' UK sales would be implemented until an international deal could be reached. The OECD intends to provide an update on its plans in 2019 with the aim of producing a final report the following year. Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at accountancy firm EY, says the fact that Mr Hammond has committed to reviewing the UK digital services tax in 2025 indicates ""that he thinks that it may take quite a while for the OECD to gain any consensus on the international stage"". By Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent Faced with public anger over the low tax paid in the UK by the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook, the government has talked time and again of imposing some kind of levy on the tech giants. The problem has been designing it so that it doesn't stifle innovation from new firms, as well as co-ordinating action with other countries so that businesses aren't put off investing in the UK. The chancellor's solution is to target a digital services tax at a narrow set of what are described as digital business platform services - specifically search engines, online marketplaces and social media firms. Which sounds like Google, Amazon and Facebook. The chancellor also makes it clear that he hopes that by 2020 when the tax is due to be introduced a global agreement on a tax on digital turnover will have been agreed. That may be optimistic according to the trade body TechUK, which warns that going it alone would be costly. But there is in any case still plenty to be sorted out about how the new tax will work - and whether it can be as precisely targeted as the Treasury seems to think. The chancellor will be hoping that an international agreement rides to his rescue before the UK tax has to be imposed. Mr Hammond has been frustrated at the lack of progress internationally over introducing a digital tax and his Budget proposal shows that the UK is willing to strike out on its own. Laurence Field, corporate tax partner at advisory firm Crowe UK, said that global firms ""don't have votes, so are an easy target"". ""Playing tough with the digital services tax is politically attractive even if this causes conflicts with other tax jurisdictions,"" he said. However, the move could risk provoking the US at a time when the UK is trying to forge closer trade links before Brexit. Dan Neidle, a tax partner at law firm Clifford Chance, said: ""Given the dominance of the US tech giants, it is hard to see the Trump administration taking kindly to the digital sales tax as the UK sets out its stall for the best possible trade deal with the US.""

MoD gets extra ÃÂ£1bn,"The money will also go on Dreadnought - the UK's nuclear deterrent submarine programme The chancellor has pledged an extra Â£1bn, between now and the end of next year, to boost the UK's defences. In his Budget speech, Philip Hammond said the plan was to modernise key areas such as anti-submarine warfare and expertise in cyber offensives. The extra Â£1bn for defence comes on top of an Â£800m increase in the summer. But it is a ""drop in the ocean"" that will not resolve the ""hollowing out"" of armed forces, according to a former head of the Royal Navy. It also falls short of a suggested Â£20bn increasethat was proposed in Juneby the Commons defence select committee. The committee said the Ministry of Defence's budget should rise from 2% of GDP (Â£40bn) to 3% (Â£60bn). Speaking after Mr Hammond's Budget speech, Labour peer Admiral Lord West of Spithead said the cash, although welcome, is not enough. Lord West, who headed the Navy from 2002 to 2006, added that if more money was not forthcoming, it would be a ""real, real problem for UK defence"". Allow Twitter content?

Its submarines will carry the Trident nuclear missiles when the current Vanguard class is scrapped.

Schools to get ÃÂ£400m 'extra kit' boost,"Schools in England are to receive a one-off Â£400m to buy ""that extra bit of kit"", the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has announced in his Budget. The money is worth, on average, Â£10,000 per primary school and Â£50,000 per secondary school, he said. Unions said Mr Hammond's gesture would ""infuriate"" head teachers. His announcement comes as England's school leaders have been campaigning for better funding for schools, saying their budgets have been squeezed. Responding to the chancellor's Â£400m one-off cash injection, Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""While we welcome any increased investment in schools, the Â£400m 'bonus' announced today hardly scratches the surface of what is needed. Head teachers' polite protest over funding Hammond: 'Austerity coming to an end' At-a-glance summary: Budget key points ""The chancellor's comment that this money will help schools to 'buy the little extras they need' shows a complete misunderstanding of the prevailing funding pressures. ""Many schools don't have enough money to provide a full curriculum or individual support to pupils, let alone provide 'little extras'. What they desperately need is improved core funding. ""It is a sign of the government's priorities that it is spending more on fixing potholes than on fixing the school funding crisis."" School leaders' union NAHT said: ""This is a Budget that will infuriate school leaders. Schools and young people are most definitely much too far down the government's list of priorities. ""There's more money for potholes than for pupils. For schools and young people, austerity is most certainly not over."" Jules White, head of Tanbridge House School in Horsham and leader of theWorth Less campaign,external, told the BBC: ""Never mind Mr Hammond's 'extras' - schools can't afford the essentials. Jules White says head teachers' concerns have ""fallen on deaf ears"" ""Every head teacher has made clear to the chancellor and the government that our schools have been bled dry in recent years. ""We've appealed for help with our budgets and especially for support children with special needs and for the most disadvantaged pupils. It's all fallen on deaf ears. ""Parents, governors and professional associations have all politely requested help for school budgets. They've been completely ignored, too. Are we all wrong?"" Schools say their budgets have been squeezed  by unfunded pay rises, national insurance payments, other cost pressures and rising pupil numbers. Mr Hammond also announced that he would give Â£1.7m for educational programmes in schools to mark the 75th anniversary of the Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camps. He said the fund was to ensure ""the next generation hears the stories of those who survived the holocaust, and of the British soldiers who liberated... because the terrible events in Pittsburgh this weekend remind that the battle against anti-Semitism did not end with the defeat of Nazi Germany"". Phil Lyons, chief executive of the National Holocaust Centre, said: ""We are very pleased that the Treasury has committed additional funds to Holocaust education. ""We are privileged to work with survivors of the Holocaust who, in sharing their experiences, enable young people to be challenged by the consequences of hate and the enormity of genocide.

What Budget means for you,"The final Budget before the UK leaves the EU has been delivered by Chancellor Philip Hammond - preparing the country for what he says is a ""new chapter"" for the economy. Lots of measures that will affect the money in your pocket have been announced in the speech which lasted for well over an hour. Here is what it means for you. A total of 31 million people pay income tax in the UK: 18 million men and 13 million women. Some 25.6 million of these taxpayers pay income tax at the basic rate. The amount you can earn each year before this basic rate of income tax is paid - called the personal allowance - stands at Â£11,850 at the moment. In April, a year earlier than expected, this will change so the first Â£12,500 of earnings will be free from income tax. The higher rate of tax, which starts to be paid at Â£46,350 at the moment, will start at Â£50,000 in April, also 12 months earlier than was originally pledged. This will be a boost to the take-home pay of millions of people. Accountants Deloitte said this would mean an annual tax saving of Â£130 for basic rate taxpayers, Â£860 for higher rate taxpayers and Â£600 for additional rate taxpayers. However, changes to National Insurance could reduce those gains for higher rate taxpayers to around Â£500. This will cost the Treasury Â£2.8bn in the next financial year. These levels will be frozen the following year, but significantly will rise in line with inflation thereafter. That means, as people earn more, they will not automatically be dragged into a higher tax band. The wayincome tax is levied is different in Scotland, owing to its devolved powers. At the moment. the starter rate also begins when annual earnings reach Â£11,850, but this will have to rise to Â£12,500 next year. The higher rate currently starts at Â£43,430 and will be set in Scotland. Any changes will be announced in the Scottish Budget in December. Yes, there has been quite a debate within the Conservative Party about how this is being introduced. Universal Credit is a single monthly payment for people on a low income or who are out of work. It replaces some of the benefits and tax credits that are seen today, such as housing benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance. This is a hugely complex welfare reform, potentiallyaffecting millions of people in different waysin the future - with winners and losers. Various transition measures will be introduced over the next five years, but no details have been released as yet. However, the chancellor said that work allowances would be increased when the roll out of Universal Credit is complete. The allowance is the amount somebody can earn before their benefit payment is affected. In the July 2015 Budget, George Osborne cut the work allowances in Universal Credit. Many working-age benefits are three years through a four-year freeze by April, and this is unchanged. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. Full coverage: Budget 2018 explained At-a-glance summary Budget calculator Kamal Ahmed: Big spender Hammond The level of the National Living Wage, currently Â£7.83 an hour, will increase at a faster rate than the rising cost of living. So the National Living Wage, which is for workers aged 25 and over, will rise to Â£8.21 an hour in April. Prime Minister Theresa May had already announced that fuel duty would be frozen for the ninth year in a row. As announced during the weekend, local councils in England will receive an extra Â£420m to tackle a growing number of potholes. Campaigners say this is not enough to solve the problem. As at the last Budget, the duty on beer, cider, and spirits has been frozen, although there will be an increase on some high-strength drinks, including some white ciders. Wine duty will rise in line with inflation. Tobacco duty will continue to rise by inflation plus 2%. In a move welcomed by many debt charities, the government is extending thebreathing spacefrom legal action given to those facing repayment difficulties, from six weeks to 60 days. A no-interest loan scheme for the financially stretched to overcome vital and unexpected household costs will also be investigated, similar tothe Good Shepherd project,externalseen in Australia. A study will take place next year, working out how a pilot scheme might work. So, it could be sometime before this became a mainstream option. The Treasury believes a third of people claiming self-employed status as a ""personal service company"" are actually working in the same way as employees and should pay more income tax and national insurance. Having changed the rules on this in the public sector, it will now do the same in the private sector from April 2020. However, this will only be used for those working for large and medium-sized businesses. Campaigners immediately described it as a ""fresh raid"" on the self-employed. First-time buyers in England who buy a shared ownership home will get the same stamp duty breaks for homes of up to Â£500,000 as other first-time buyers whoreceived the concession in the last Budget. This will also be backdated for anyone who has bought such a property in the last year. There are more than 200,000 shared ownership properties in the UK. A commemorative 50p coin will be issued to mark the UK's departure from the EU. The coin will feature the Queen's head and the date 29 March 2019 and on the reverse the phrase ""Friendship with all nations"". This is a bit of a turnaround from the last Budget, when the Treasury paved the way for the withdrawal of 1p and 2p coins, and possibly the Â£50 note. This idea has since been dropped. The gradual process allowing people to pass on property to their descendants free from some inheritance tax will enter its third year. It will reach its target by 2021 Many buy-to-let landlords are seeing the amount of tax relief that they can claim on mortgage interest payments cut over the course of four years. The process began in April 2017. Eventually, they will only be able to claim at the lower rate of tax, not the higher Some changes to the way higher redundancy payments, company cars, and employee loans are taxed will also take effect in April.

Hammond hails better borrowing figures,"Chancellor Philip Hammond has used the Budget to ease the government spending squeeze as he declared that austerity was ""finally coming to an end"". Against a backdrop of stronger tax receipts, Mr Hammond said borrowing this year would be Â£11.6bn lower than projected in March, at Â£25.5bn. Borrowing is expected to fall over the next five years. Mr Hammond said day-to-day spending budgets were now expected to grow by around 1.2% a year from 2019. This is up from an average contraction of 1.3% in the last Spending Review in 2015. Bumper tax receipts and a stronger jobs market helped Mr Hammond to land a Â£68bn borrowing windfall over the next five years. A healthier outlook for the public finances means the Treasury can fund a multi-billion pound boost for the NHS, as well as more money for defence, schools, welfare andabove-inflation rises in the income tax personal allowance. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the spending promises represented the biggest Budget giveaway since the independent fiscal watchdog was set up in 2010. Healthier public finances means the government could have used its borrowing windfall to eliminate the deficit in five years time. It chose not to. The OBR said its downward revision to underlying borrowing over the next five years was the biggest since 2013. On its own, this would have been enough to achieve a budget surplus of Â£3.5bn in 2023-24, meeting the government's goal of balancing the books by 2025. By choosing to spend most of the windfall instead, the OBR described this goal of balancing the books as ""challenging from a variety of perspectives"". It added that Mr Hammond faced a stark choice: keep borrowing or cut spending. The OBR calculated that if the deficit kept falling at the same pace beyond 2023-24 as in the coming four years, the government would be on course to balance the books in 2028-29. However, this would mean spending on government departments would need to starting falling again per head in real terms. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation think-tank, said the government's target for a budget surplus had effectively been ""abandoned"". He tweeted: ""Borrowing is basically being held at just over Â£20bn forever."" The government's independent fiscal watchdog left its forecasts for economic growth broadly unchanged. The OBR said the UK economy was expected to grow by 1.3% in 2018. While this is slightly lower than the 1.5% growth predicted in March, economic growth is expected to rise to 1.6% in 2019, up from a previous projection of 1.3%. Mr Hammond said wages were currently growing at their fastest pace in a decade. Britain's unemployment rate is now expected to fall to a fresh four-decade low of 3.7% next year, with a strong jobs market expected to boost economic growth and tax revenues. Healthier public finances are expected to keep Britain's debt share falling over the next five years, helping the government to meet two key fiscal rules. Budget 2018: At-a-glance summary What it means for you Tech giants face digital services tax Kamal Ahmed: Big spender Hammond Budget calculator Mr Hammond signalled that a good Brexit agreement would enable the Treasury to spend a ""double deal dividend"". He said the economy would receive a boost from the end to uncertainty over Britain's future relationship with the EU, and a good deal with the EU would also free up money set aside to protect the economy in the event of no deal. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said government policy was now expected to boost economic growth next year for the first time since 2014. But Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, suggested that it was too early to say austerity was over. He said the overall package of measures had a ""familiar Augustinian pattern of a near-term giveaway followed by a longer-term takeaway"", increasing borrowing by Â£5.3bn in 2019-20 but reducing it by Â£0.2bn by 2023-24. Mr Hammond wants to maintain the size of his Brexit war chest which he has set aside to protect the economy from any shock in the event of no deal. Mr Tombs said: ""The chancellor could have announced higher spending for 2020-21 and beyond, but he is keeping some ammunition in the locker in case the economy needs emergency support."" A four-year freeze on working-age benefits will also continue. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, added that while overall day-to-day spending is set to increase over the next five years, departments would have to wait until next year to find out if any departments still faced spending cuts. He said: ""We will have to wait until the Spending Review next year to make a final judgment as to whether austerity is really coming to an end.""

Sniffer dogs can identify malariaThe animals recognise tell-tale aromas using clothes from people infected with the disease.Health,"This video can not be played It's suspected that dogs are picking up on the same odours mosquitoes do Scientists in the UK and The Gambia say they have the first evidence that dogs can sniff out malaria. They have trained dogs to recognise tell-tale aromas using clothes from people infected with the disease. It is hoped the animals can be used to stop malaria spreading and eventually help with eradication. Although the research is still at an early stage, experts say the findings may even lead to new ways of testing for the disease. Studies have already shown that being infected with the malaria parasite changes our aroma to make us more attractive to the mosquitoes that spread the disease. Now dogs are on the scent, too. Socks worn overnight by children in the Upper River Region of The Gambia, in West Africa, were packaged and shipped to the UK. Of the 175 pairs sent, 30 had been worn by children infected with the parasite. The smelly footwear arrived at the Medical Detection Dogs charity in Milton Keynes. The supremely talented noses there are already being trained to sniff out cancer and even the early stages of Parkinson's disease. When it came to spotting malaria, the results, presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, showed dogs could pick out seven in 10 samples from infected children. But they also incorrectly thought one in 10 healthy children had malaria. Researcher Prof Steve Lindsay, from Durham University, said he was ""really excited"" by the findings so far, but that dogs were not yet ready to be used more routinely. The researchers still need to improve the dog's accuracy and test them on people rather than socks, as well as investigate whether the animals can sniff out different species of malaria. The aim is to one day use specially trained dogs at airports to curb the spread of the disease and to find symptomless carriers to help eradication efforts. Dogs could test a whole community in a short space of time. Chelci Squires, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: ""Dogs are actually nature's super-smellers so it is a great gift to have them. ""They are much faster than existing rapid diagnostic tests which can take up to 20 minutes and require a fully trained professional to do."" New tools to detect, treat and prevent malaria are needed as progress is stalling. According to thelast global report on the disease,external, cases had increased by five million to a new total of 216 million cases a year. The research was a collaboration between The National Malaria Control Programme in The Gambia; the Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia; Medical Detection Dogs; Durham University; the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the University of Dundee.

Hammond: 'Austerity coming to an end',"This video can not be played Budget headlines in two minutes Philip Hammond has said the ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end"", in his last Budget before Brexit. He spent a windfall from better public finances on more money for universal credit and bringing forward planned income tax cuts by a year. The personal allowance will rise to Â£12,500 and the higher rate threshold to Â£50,000 in April 2019, worth Â£130 a year for a typical base rate taxpayer. Jeremy Corbyn said whatever Mr Hammond had claimed, ""austerity is not over"". At-a-glance: The Budget key points Budget calculator 2018 - what it means for you How the budget affects you if you're young In a speech lasting more than 70 minutes, Mr Hammond said ""we have reached a defining moment on this long, hard journey"" after repairing the damage to the public finances. He described it as a Budget for ""the strivers, the grafters and the carers,"" promising them a ""brighter future"" after years of constraint. He announced a slight increase in growth forecasts, from 1.3% to 1.6% for 2019, and better-than-expected borrowing figures.

Tech giants face digital services tax The chancellor announced an extra Â£2bn for mental health services in England, as part of the Â£20bn boost to the NHS announced by the government in June. He also unveiled an additional Â£400m to allow schools to ""buy the little extras they need"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This is a broken promise Budget"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""What we've heard today are half measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on. ""And far from people's hard work and sacrifices having paid off, as the chancellor claims, this government has frittered it away in ideological tax cuts to the richest in our society."" Corbyn - Budget is full of broken promises Labour said the extra money for mental health would ""do little to relieve the severe pressures"" on services caused by the government's ""relentless underfunding of the NHS,"" and the extra Â£20bn for the health service in England was not enough. Labour MPs also reacted angrily to Mr Hammond's promise of a ""little extra"" for schools. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner tweeted: Allow Twitter content?

The chancellor had been under pressure from Labour and some Tory MPs to put more money into universal credit, amid warnings it could push people into destitution. He announced an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments, which will replace six in-work benefits, and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year. He claimed the changes - reversing cuts made in previous Budgets - would make 2.4 million working people and people with disabilities Â£630 a year better off. Labour said the entire Budget should be voted down unless the government agreed to halt the roll-out of universal credit. The dust hasn't quite settled but we're a good few hours on from when the chancellor squeezed himself back down onto the government front bench, in between a pleased-looking prime minister and his ever-enthusiastic colleague Liz Truss, his number two at the Treasury. A few hours when certainly not everything has become clear, no doubt a few nasties will crawl out from under the rocks through the course of tomorrow according to Budget tradition, but the broad shape of the Budget and its impact are becoming clear. Read Laura's blog Mr Hammond warned at the weekend that an emergency Budget would be needed if Britain leaves the EU in March without a deal. However, Downing Street has said all spending plans in this Budget will go ahead ""irrespective"" of Brexit. The big long-term spending decisions will be made next year, after Britain's scheduled departure from the EU. Mr Hammond said overall spending would go up by 1.2% over the next five years. But Treasury officials said this was not a guide to next year's spending review because more money could be available if the UK gets a deal with the EU. And, they added, there was Â£4.2bn in reserve for a no-deal scenario so it was likely spending would go up whatever happened, although the 1.2% figure included the extra money for the NHS. Mr Hammond has said his Budget was based on the assumption of an ""average-type free trade deal"" being agreed between the UK and the EU. He said he was holding back some ""fiscal"" headroom in case he needed to alter his economic plan if Britain leaves the EU without a deal - but that a Brexit agreement with Brussels would result in a ""deal dividend"" for the economy.

He added that ""most of the planned welfare cuts are still on the books"". The Office for Budget Responsibility said the chancellor had decided to spend a ""windfall"" from better employment and tax receipts on a ""near-term tax and spending giveaway"", in addition to the extra Â£20bn promised for the NHS by Theresa May. ""This leaves the medium-term outlook for government borrowing little changed since March"", with the government still committed to balancing the nation's books by 2025.

MoD gets extra Â£1bnSchools to get Â£400m 'extra kit' boost,"The money will also go on Dreadnought - the UK's nuclear deterrent submarine programme The chancellor has pledged an extra Â£1bn, between now and the end of next year, to boost the UK's defences. In his Budget speech, Philip Hammond said the plan was to modernise key areas such as anti-submarine warfare and expertise in cyber offensives. The extra Â£1bn for defence comes on top of an Â£800m increase in the summer. But it is a ""drop in the ocean"" that will not resolve the ""hollowing out"" of armed forces, according to a former head of the Royal Navy. It also falls short of a suggested Â£20bn increasethat was proposed in Juneby the Commons defence select committee. The committee said the Ministry of Defence's budget should rise from 2% of GDP (Â£40bn) to 3% (Â£60bn). Speaking after Mr Hammond's Budget speech, Labour peer Admiral Lord West of Spithead said the cash, although welcome, is not enough. Lord West, who headed the Navy from 2002 to 2006, added that if more money was not forthcoming, it would be a ""real, real problem for UK defence"". Allow Twitter content?

However, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the extra funds represented a ""substantial financial boost"". ""Not only will this funding ensure we continue to have world-leading armed forces but will also allow defence to modernise our critical assets, such as our offensive cyber capabilities, anti-submarine warfare and our nuclear deterrent,"" he said. Among the defence programmes that will benefit from the extra cash is the UK's continuous at-sea deterrent Dreadnought. Its submarines will carry the Trident nuclear missiles when the current Vanguard class is scrapped. Mr Hammond said in his speech the extra defence funding was prompted by ""stark reminders in the past year of the scale, scope and complexity of the threats we face"". He also promised a further Â£160m to fund counter-terrorism policing.

Schools to get Â£400m 'extra kit' boost,"Schools in England are to receive a one-off Â£400m to buy ""that extra bit of kit"", the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has announced in his Budget. The money is worth, on average, Â£10,000 per primary school and Â£50,000 per secondary school, he said. Unions said Mr Hammond's gesture would ""infuriate"" head teachers. His announcement comes as England's school leaders have been campaigning for better funding for schools, saying their budgets have been squeezed. Responding to the chancellor's Â£400m one-off cash injection, Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""While we welcome any increased investment in schools, the Â£400m 'bonus' announced today hardly scratches the surface of what is needed. Head teachers' polite protest over funding Hammond: 'Austerity coming to an end' At-a-glance summary: Budget key points ""The chancellor's comment that this money will help schools to 'buy the little extras they need' shows a complete misunderstanding of the prevailing funding pressures. ""Many schools don't have enough money to provide a full curriculum or individual support to pupils, let alone provide 'little extras'. What they desperately need is improved core funding. ""It is a sign of the government's priorities that it is spending more on fixing potholes than on fixing the school funding crisis."" School leaders' union NAHT said: ""This is a Budget that will infuriate school leaders. Schools and young people are most definitely much too far down the government's list of priorities. ""There's more money for potholes than for pupils. For schools and young people, austerity is most certainly not over."" Jules White, head of Tanbridge House School in Horsham and leader of theWorth Less campaign,external, told the BBC: ""Never mind Mr Hammond's 'extras' - schools can't afford the essentials. Jules White says head teachers' concerns have ""fallen on deaf ears"" ""Every head teacher has made clear to the chancellor and the government that our schools have been bled dry in recent years. ""We've appealed for help with our budgets and especially for support children with special needs and for the most disadvantaged pupils. It's all fallen on deaf ears. ""Parents, governors and professional associations have all politely requested help for school budgets. They've been completely ignored, too. Are we all wrong?"" Schools say their budgets have been squeezed  by unfunded pay rises, national insurance payments, other cost pressures and rising pupil numbers. Mr Hammond also announced that he would give Â£1.7m for educational programmes in schools to mark the 75th anniversary of the Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camps. He said the fund was to ensure ""the next generation hears the stories of those who survived the holocaust, and of the British soldiers who liberated... because the terrible events in Pittsburgh this weekend remind that the battle against anti-Semitism did not end with the defeat of Nazi Germany"". Phil Lyons, chief executive of the National Holocaust Centre, said: ""We are very pleased that the Treasury has committed additional funds to Holocaust education. ""We are privileged to work with survivors of the Holocaust who, in sharing their experiences, enable young people to be challenged by the consequences of hate and the enormity of genocide.

Brexit 'won't affect spending plans',"This video can not be played Budget headlines in two minutes Philip Hammond has said the ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end"", in his last Budget before Brexit. He spent a windfall from better public finances on more money for universal credit and bringing forward planned income tax cuts by a year. The personal allowance will rise to Â£12,500 and the higher rate threshold to Â£50,000 in April 2019, worth Â£130 a year for a typical base rate taxpayer. Jeremy Corbyn said whatever Mr Hammond had claimed, ""austerity is not over"". At-a-glance: The Budget key points Budget calculator 2018 - what it means for you How the budget affects you if you're young In a speech lasting more than 70 minutes, Mr Hammond said ""we have reached a defining moment on this long, hard journey"" after repairing the damage to the public finances. He described it as a Budget for ""the strivers, the grafters and the carers,"" promising them a ""brighter future"" after years of constraint. He announced a slight increase in growth forecasts, from 1.3% to 1.6% for 2019, and better-than-expected borrowing figures. A freeze on beer, cider and spirits duty, saving 2p on a pint of beer, 1p on a pint of cider, and 30p on a bottle of Scotch or gin A packet of 20 cigarettes goes up by 33p Wine duty will not be frozen and a bottle will go up by 8p from 1 February next year Another freeze in fuel duty An end to the the use of Private Finance Initiative schemes for future infrastructure projects A Â£30bn package for England's roads,including repairs to motorways and potholes Â£900m inbusiness rates relief for small businessesand Â£650m to rejuvenate high streets Stamp Duty abolished for all first-time buyers of shared ownership properties valued up to Â£500,000, applied retrospectively to the date of the last Budget An extra Â£500m for no-deal Brexit preparations A tax on plastic packaging which does not contain enough recycled materials - but no disposable plastic cup tax An extra Â£1bn for the Ministry of Defence to boost cyber capabilities and anti-submarine warfare capacity A further Â£650m of grant funding for English local authorities struggling to cope with rising care bills, for 2019/20 New mandatory business rates relief for all public lavatories made available for public use, whether publicly or privately owned Mr Hammond also announced a planned new tax - subject to consultation - on the profits generated in the UK by global online ""giants"", such as Facebook, which he said would come into effect in April 2020 and raise Â£400m a year. Tech giants face digital services tax The chancellor announced an extra Â£2bn for mental health services in England, as part of the Â£20bn boost to the NHS announced by the government in June. He also unveiled an additional Â£400m to allow schools to ""buy the little extras they need"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This is a broken promise Budget"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""What we've heard today are half measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on. ""And far from people's hard work and sacrifices having paid off, as the chancellor claims, this government has frittered it away in ideological tax cuts to the richest in our society."" Corbyn - Budget is full of broken promises Labour said the extra money for mental health would ""do little to relieve the severe pressures"" on services caused by the government's ""relentless underfunding of the NHS,"" and the extra Â£20bn for the health service in England was not enough. Labour MPs also reacted angrily to Mr Hammond's promise of a ""little extra"" for schools. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner tweeted: Allow Twitter content?

The chancellor had been under pressure from Labour and some Tory MPs to put more money into universal credit, amid warnings it could push people into destitution. He announced an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments, which will replace six in-work benefits, and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year. He claimed the changes - reversing cuts made in previous Budgets - would make 2.4 million working people and people with disabilities Â£630 a year better off. Labour said the entire Budget should be voted down unless the government agreed to halt the roll-out of universal credit. The dust hasn't quite settled but we're a good few hours on from when the chancellor squeezed himself back down onto the government front bench, in between a pleased-looking prime minister and his ever-enthusiastic colleague Liz Truss, his number two at the Treasury. A few hours when certainly not everything has become clear, no doubt a few nasties will crawl out from under the rocks through the course of tomorrow according to Budget tradition, but the broad shape of the Budget and its impact are becoming clear. Read Laura's blog Mr Hammond warned at the weekend that an emergency Budget would be needed if Britain leaves the EU in March without a deal. However, Downing Street has said all spending plans in this Budget will go ahead ""irrespective"" of Brexit. The big long-term spending decisions will be made next year, after Britain's scheduled departure from the EU. Mr Hammond said overall spending would go up by 1.2% over the next five years. But Treasury officials said this was not a guide to next year's spending review because more money could be available if the UK gets a deal with the EU. And, they added, there was Â£4.2bn in reserve for a no-deal scenario so it was likely spending would go up whatever happened, although the 1.2% figure included the extra money for the NHS. Mr Hammond has said his Budget was based on the assumption of an ""average-type free trade deal"" being agreed between the UK and the EU. He said he was holding back some ""fiscal"" headroom in case he needed to alter his economic plan if Britain leaves the EU without a deal - but that a Brexit agreement with Brussels would result in a ""deal dividend"" for the economy.

He added that ""most of the planned welfare cuts are still on the books"". The Office for Budget Responsibility said the chancellor had decided to spend a ""windfall"" from better employment and tax receipts on a ""near-term tax and spending giveaway"", in addition to the extra Â£20bn promised for the NHS by Theresa May. ""This leaves the medium-term outlook for government borrowing little changed since March"", with the government still committed to balancing the nation's books by 2025.

Five things to watch for,"Today is Budget day and certainly a tricky one for the Chancellor. He has a number of competing challenges. Some of them are economic - can he really ""end austerity"" by spending more and at the same time keep his promise to control the government's Â£1.8tn debts? Some of them are political - don't forget the government does not have a majority and pushing any big tax rises, for example, through Parliament would be very difficult. Mr Hammond is also being lent on to be ""more positive"" on the economy by his next door neighbour at Number 10, Theresa May. With those caveats, here are the five key issues to look out for. Ever since the Prime Minister announced billions of pounds of extra spending a year on the NHS in England, both Mrs May and the Chancellor have suggested that taxes will have to rise to pay for the pledge. Keep an eye on what Mr Hammond says about thresholds - that is the amount people are able to earn before they start paying tax. If they are frozen that is effectively a tax increase as annual wage inflation means more of our income will be subject to income tax. Mr Hammond knows that freezing thresholds could draw criticism as it was a Conservative manifesto pledge last year to increase thresholds. And with no Parliamentary majority, anything too radical in this area is likely to be voted down, just as plans to increase national insurance contributions for the self employed were voted down last year. More likely is a tightening of the rules on self-employment status which will mean more self employed people paying tax.I have written about that issue here. There are also likely to be more taxes on gambling firms. The Treasury signalled earlier in the year the betting industry would take a tax hit after the bets people could make on Fixed Odd Betting Terminals were reduced, limiting the amount of tax paid to the government. But overall, expect nothing too radical on tax. For example, I don't believe the Treasury is yet ready to announce a new tax on global technology companies. It is a complicated issue and America has expressed its displeasure at countries which it believes are targeting its success stories such as Google and Facebook. Far more likely are a number of small and relatively technical changes which will increase the overall tax burden on individuals and businesses. Check the forecasts for tax changes in the future - they may signal larger rises ahead in order to pay for higher public spending. Budget 2018: Everything you need to know Extra Â£420m to tackle potholes in England Chancellor plans High Street rates relief Remember Pastygate? Budgets that backfired A lot better than Mr Hammond believed they would be this time last year. Tax revenues have been stronger than expected and local council spending lower. That means the amount the government has borrowed could be as much as Â£13bn less this year than the official watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, predicted. That gives the Chancellor some headroom to support increased spending without raising taxes substantially or risking the Conservative pledge that the government plans to ""balance the books"" (match tax revenues with spending) by the middle of the 2020s. Those close to Mr Hammond point out that annual public finance numbers are volatile and that if there is a ""no deal"" Brexit he will need some fiscal fire power to support the economy. The Chancellor won't want to use up all his wriggle room - just in case - but expect a loosening of the purse strings to support the controversial transition to the new benefits system, universal credit. More positive signals, again in what he plans to spend in the future rather than immediately, are also likely for social care and local authorities. It is not a good look when a Conservative government is experiencing its own local councils putting in place emergency measures to save money. Mrs May announced that ""austerity is over"" in her conference speech last month. For Treasury officials such an announcement might be considered ""heroic"". As the IFS has saidending a long period of public sector cuts is likely to cost at least Â£19bn a year by 2022. And with Mr Hammond also pressed to find that Â£20.5bn for the NHS in England by the same year, it is difficult to see how he can ""end austerity"" and boost spending so significantly all at the same time. Day-to-day spending for departments such as the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice is set to fall by Â£4bn next year. Benefit cuts totalling Â£7bn are also scheduled to be implemented before 2022. It is unlikely this Budget will do much to reverse those. What to look for is the spending ""envelope"" Mr Hammond sets for the next five years. Will it be more generous than the one set this time last year? If it is, then the government might be able to make the argument that austerity will end in the future. Even if the Prime Minister did make her pledge in the present tense. Chancellors always like to have something of a surprise up their sleeve for Budget day and many people I have spoken to believe that this year it will be on housing. Mr Hammond is keen to show that the government is doing something for ""generation rent"" - often younger people who cannot afford to clamber on the housing ladder. I expect that Sir Oliver Letwin's final report on the substantial disconnect between the amount of land granted planning permission and the number of actual houses built to be published alongside the Budget. The former Tory government minister is likely to recommend speeding up the ""build out permissions"" process which could help the government hit the target of constructing 300,000 new houses a year. The Treasury is also considering splitting the huge revenue gains landowners receive when a piece of land is granted planning permission with local authorities. Councils could then use that money to build social housing, alongside the extra funds for house building Mrs May has already said councils will be allowed to borrow. Another move giving more rights to tenants to buy homes they have been renting long term is also on the cards. This set of measures could well be brought together in an effort to show the government ""gets"" (and is doing something about) the housing crisis. Alongside the Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility publishes its forecasts for growth over the next five years. It substantially downgraded its forecasts a year ago. Will it be more positive this time? Maybe a little. But more importantly, will it admit that it has been too negative on government borrowing, showing that the government is on course to hit its target of eliminating the deficit by early in the next decade? That is likely. And a fact that Mr Hammond will trumpet, with the usual cautious warnings that a man known as ""spreadsheet Phil"" is renowned for. One of those warnings will be about Brexit. If there is a deal on Brexit, expect some kind of economic ""dividend"" - a boost to the economy as business demand, for example, held back by the uncertainty of the negotiations is released. If there isn't a deal, expect Mr Hammond to warn that the economy could suffer and that all his plans to ""end austerity"" and boost spending are likely to end up on the floor in a tattered pile.

And for those who can't get enough of this Budget, you can findall the official documents here,external. Goodnight. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says only if you consider ""a very tight definition"" of what austerity means. ""Arguably he's just about got to the absolute minimal definition of ending austerity but it's certainly nothing like a bonanza for the rest of the public services,"" he told the BBC. He adds that ""most of the planned welfare cuts are still on the books"". Philip Hammond was, perhaps uncharacteristically, in a very jovial mood. Not known for humour - in public, at least - the chancellor managed to raise a few laughs during his Budget speech. Here's his best gags, courtesy of the Press Association. The last Budget to be held on a Monday was in 1962 and Mr Hammond said: ""I
was six years old, tensions between Russia and the United States were rising and
a former foreign secretary turned chancellor delivered a Budget amid Cabinet
revolt...  I could swear I remember my parents turning to me and saying:
'Philip, one day, that can be you'."" By holding the statement on Monday rather than the usual Wednesday, the chancellor said he avoided a Halloween Budget which could have produced ""Hammo
House of Horrors"" headlines. But ""I have not avoided the blood-curdling
threats, the anguished wailing, and the strange banging of furniture that's
usually associated with Wednesday - I have kindly been invited to a special
meeting of the 1922 Committee this evening"". In a display of toilet humour, the chancellor promised that councils can
""relieve themselves"" with a tax break on public lavatories, although he did
not want to get ""bogged down"" on the subject. It was, he noted, one of the few
announcements that had not ""leaked"". In a nod to Mr McDonnell's recent accident, suffered tripping over fly-tipped
waste, the chancellor promised cash to deal with the issue ""although I cannot
guarantee that Â£10m is going to be enough to stop him falling flat on his
face in the future"". After announcing plans for a Â£400m digital services tax, Mr Hammond
also managed a quick jibe at Sir Nick Clegg, who has taken a senior role with
Facebook, joking that ""I am already looking forward to my call from the former
leader of the Liberal Democrats"". Hidden in theBudget Red Book,external(on page 80!) is news of a new prize-linked saving scheme for credit unions. The Budget document said: ""Credit unions play an important role in
facilitating savings and offering affordable borrowing to their members. ""To help people increase
their financial resilience while boosting awareness and membership of these community
organisations, the Budget commits to launching a pilot of a new prize-linked saving scheme for
credit unions."" More details will follow - such as timings and amounts - but the Treasury presumably hopes it could be a boost  for the sector. Matt Bland of the Association of British Credit Unions told the BBC: ""We're excited by the announcement. Credit unions are all about encouraging people to save and prize-linked savings is an interesting way to encourage savers."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scotch Whisky Association said the Chancellor's decision to continue the freeze on spirits duty was a ""welcome show of support"" for the industry. The measure means the price of a typical bottle is 30p lower than if it had risen by inflation, according to the Treasury. The duty rate on spirits remains Â£28.74 per litre of pure alcohol. Of the Â£14.15 average price of a bottle of Scotch whisky, Â£10.41 is collected in tax through excise duty and VAT, the SWA said. Hundreds of thousands of private-sector contractors face higher tax and National Insurance (NI) bills from April 2020, after today's Budget. The crackdown is the biggest revenue-raising measure in this year's budget. Ian Hyde, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, says it's a ""huge cost burden"" and a ""significant shift of risk"" for businesses which rely on contractors. âMany contractors have highly specialised skills and
it is crucial that these skills can be easily circulated amongst businesses.
However, these new rules may result in businesses scaling back their use of
contractors, slowing this transfer of skills from one business to another. âThe ultimate winner from these new rules is HMRC
which will now have thousands of businesses doing their policing for them, but
at what cost?,"" he asks. Read more here Simon JackBBC Business Editor 2018
has been an annus horribilis for the high street. Many
high street retailers have cried foul in the face of new
competition from online firms that employ fewer staff and pay far lower
business rates. There
are two ways you can level the playing field. Cut
charges for the traditional retailers or increase them for online traders. Mr
Hammond has done a bit of both. He has spent Â£900m knocking a third off the business rates billof 500,000 small retailers. Very welcome to those who have
premises with a rateable value below Â£51k. Second
â he unveileda new Â£400m digital services taxto be levied on the tech
giants on the money they
make on digital services like advertising and streaming entertainment (but not
online sales). So will these two measures save the high
street? Probably not â at least not on their own. Read more here Mark Stokes at Deloitte has more exclusive analysis of today's Budget for the BBC: The Government will extend the stamp duty relief for first-time buyers to purchases of shared ownership properties worth up to Â£500,000. That means qualifying
purchasers will pay no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 paid on the purchase of their
home and 5% on the remainder up to the cap of Â£500,000. In welcome news for taxpayers who have bought homes that would have qualified
since the last Budget in November 2017, the rules will be backdated with
taxpayers able to claim a refund. A consultation will be published in January 2019 on the potential
introduction of a further 1% stamp duty charge on purchases of residential property
by non-UK residents. This follows significant changes to the taxation of
non-residents investing in UK residential real estate over recent years to
align their tax position with UK residents. The Budget offered nothing for those ""massacred"" by the Universal Credit welfare reforms, according to Frank Field, chair of the Commons' Work and Pensions Committee. He told the Commons cuts for families would get ""worse next year and worse the year after and worse the year after that"". He added: ""The Chancellor did make some very important additions to the Universal Credit Budget and I'm grateful, as all of us must be who've seen our constituents massacred by this benefit. ""But there are four big changes he has yet to announce if we are to be satisfied that the rollout of Universal Credit can roll out safely to every one of our constituents."" BBC World News Stephanie Flanders, former BBC economics correspondent and now a senior editor at Bloomberg, says the Prime Minister wanted ""a really big Budget"". But she points out that with the UK preparing to leave the EU on 29 March, that simply wasn't possible. ""It can't really be a watershed Budget, because we are months before this big question,"" she says. Philip Hammond didn't mention any negatives from Brexit, even going to far as to talk about a Brexit dividend, Ms Flanders adds.

Rory Cellan-JonesBBC technology correspondent Faced
with public anger over the low tax paid in the UK by the likes of Google,
Amazon and Facebook, the government has talked time and again of imposing some
kind of levy on the tech giants. The
problem has been designing it so that it doesn't stifle innovation from new
firms and coordinating action with other countries so that businesses aren't
put off investing in the UK. The
Chancellorâs solution is to target a Digital Services Tax at a narrow set of what
are described as digital business platform services - specifically search
engines, online marketplaces and social media firms. Which sounds like Google,
Amazon and Facebook. He
also makes it clear he hopes that by 2020 when the tax is due to be
introduced, a global agreement on a tax on digital turnover will have been
agreed. That
may be optimistic according to the trade body techUK, which warns that going it
alone would be costly. But
there is in any case still plenty to be sorted out about how the
new tax will work - and whether it can be as precisely targeted as the Treasury
seems to think. The Chancellor will be hoping that an international agreement rides to his rescue before the UK tax has to be imposed. BBC Radio 5 live Frank Jay owns a chilli shop in Leeds city centre. He tells BBC Radio 5 Live he is interested in the business rate relief announced by the chancellor for small retailers in England: ""I was pleasantly surprised. When I started the chilli shop, when we hit business rates, wow that was a big chunk of our income. And we were not getting anything from it - it was the difference between making the rent and not making the rent sometimes. ""So this has come as a big relief.  I'd prefer them to go further for small businesses to protect our high street, and go all the way and have [no business rates] for a couple of years, but yeah I'm much happier."" Anne Redston, professor of tax law at Kingâs College London, details two important changes in today's Budget relating to insolvent businesses: The Budget announced two important changes when businesses
are insolvent. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is an unsecured
creditor of an insolvent business, so is in the same position as anyone else
who is owed money by that business. But from April 2020, HMRC will be first in the queue, with a
priority right to recover any PAYE, employee national insurance contributions
(NICs), VAT and deductions made under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS). The governmentâs reasoning is that VAT, PAYE, employee NICs
and CIS are all money deducted from customers and employees, and held in trust
by the business. This new preferential creditor rule therefore does not apply
to corporation tax or employer NICs. The new rules will mean money is more likely to be
recovered from insolvent businesses than has been the
case - but it also means that other creditors will receive less. So if a
business goes bust which owes you money, you are likely to get back a lower
amount, or even nothing at all. And if it is your business that has gone bust, and you have
been involved in tax avoidance or evasion, or if you simply set up a new
business to replace the old (known as ""phoenixism"") HMRC will have the power to
collect the missing tax, NICs or VAT from you personally. It includes announcements on wages, mental health and universal credit. Here's what it means to you. It includes announcements on wages, mental health and universal credit. Here's what it means to you. What were the chancellor's most-used words in today's speech? The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has produced a rather handy word cloud to tell us. Unsurprisingly, deputy speaker, people and British all feature prominently. But rather oddly austerity doesn't seem to have made the cut. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Public spending will rise by Â£30bn by 2023-24 - a significant stimulus to be spent on the NHS and on raising the amount people can earn before they start paying tax. That is in sharp contrast to the five-year ""austerity"" plan announced in 2010, which saw cuts of 3% a year, and 2015, which included cuts of 1.3% a year. To pay for that, Mr Hammond will allow borrowing to to be sustained at about Â£20bn a year. Little talk today of ""balancing the books"" or the risk of a bad Brexit deal.

"'Woman blows herself up' in TunisNine people are injured in the blast, which police suspect was a terrorist attack.Africa","At least nine people were injured when a 30-year-old woman blew herself up in the centre of Tunisia's capital, Tunis, the interior ministry says. Describing the blast as a ""terrorist explosion"", the ministry said the woman had had no previous known militant background. Eight of those hurt in the explosion on Avenue Habib Bourguiba, which runs through the middle of the city, were police officers. No deaths have been reported. No group has said it is behind the attack. The attack comes at a time when the country's vital tourism industry is starting to show signs of recovery, more than three years after two deadly terror attacks decimated visitor numbers.

He arrived at the scene 15 minutes after the blast and says a cloud of black smoke was visible from far away.

Kuenssberg: The Budget's politics,"Chancellors and prime ministers are always bound together. They always are, until either the occupant of Number 10 moves out or has enough of their neighbour and sacks them, or their joint project collapses and they fall together. Theresa May and Philip Hammond's past and present are woven together too. Under David Cameron they sat around the same Cabinet table, both pushing George Osborne for money for their departments. They were both backers of Remain, a fact Brexiteers refer to all too often. And both their futures are intimately tied up with the government's chances of brokering a deal with the EU, and then getting it through Parliament. Budget 2018: What we know already Hammond prepares last Budget before Brexit Five things to watch out for Neither of them are flashy politicians. One senior figure describes how they are sometimes privately joked about in Whitehall as a well-to-do middle-aged couple. In this metaphor, Mr Hammond is at the leather wheel of a Jag, and they are gently bickering over the directions, with a tin of travel sweets close to hand. The car journey is more likely to descend into frosty silences and raised eyebrows, rather than having a blazing shouting match. They are grimly determined that they will arrive at their destination by persevering, never indulging in too much drama. This video can not be played What to expect in the Budget But only one of them can be in charge. And for this Budget the prime minister, the boss of course, seems to have drawn a difficult route for the chancellor. His motivation for holding the Budget in October was to get it out of the way, before the last moments of the Brexit process create a Parliamentary rollercoaster. It was - in a period of political peril for the government - meant to be non-controversial, ""slimline"", almost a ""holding Budget"", according to senior government figures. The chancellor admitted at the weekend that if there is no deal and the UK ends up leaving in chaos, the economic drama might mean he'd have to tear up the whole thing and start again. With question marks hanging over the Brexit process, question marks of course hang over the economy. While Treasury insiders say, for now, the economy is ""puttering along"" not too badly, it is not the time for bold moves, not the moment for a sudden splash of spending. They need to keep cash back in case the Brexit process goes pop. So far, so non-controversial. Except at the Tory conference the prime minister decided to charge the politics around the Budget by suggesting that the era of the squeeze on public spending was at an end. The prime minister proclaimed ""people need to know that austerity is over"". It was a headline-grabbing claim that was vigorously disputed, not just by the opposition parties, but also by Conservative councillors around the country. And that promise has created huge expectation for this Budget. There are calls for extra cash to cushion the huge benefit changes under Universal Credit, demands for a top-up to the defence budget, calls for more money to soften the squeeze on school funding, and the list goes on and on and on. This video can not be played What do young people want from this year's Budget? This happens in the run-up to every big financial event like this, but the prime minister's claim that austerity is at an end has given bags of extra ammunition to those making the case for their particular cause. But while there are clear signals that both defence and Universal Credit will see a bit of an easing up, this week won't be seen as a groundbreaking Budget. Don't look for a dramatic change of course, whatever the prime minister said last month. How so, when her claim was so clear? First off, remember last November the chancellor eased up the squeeze to the tune of Â£25bn with extra cash for housing and the NHS. Certainly there are still tight constraints on public spending and that is being felt for real, and painfully in many places. But George Osborne's original plans for austerity faded long ago. Secondly, I understand Philip Hammond was the only member of the Cabinet who had read the whole of Theresa May's conference speech before she arrived on stage accompanied by Abba. No doubt he will have noted carefully the build-up to her claim on austerity in that speech too. Remember Pastygate? Budgets that backfired 'Everything is just stretched to its limit' Before she made that vow Theresa May said: ""When we have secured a good Brexit deal for Britain, at the spending review next year we will set out our approach for the future. ""Debt as a share of the economy will continue to go down, support for public services will go up. ""A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over."" Whatever you hear in the next 24 hours, the prime minister said AFTER the Brexit deal is done, and AFTER the much bigger set of spending decisions at the huge review next year - that's when the public can expect something that could prove radically different. Budgets can, of course, always surprise. And Theresa May's political promise earlier this month means she and her co-driver have to come up with something that's more than a ""do no harm"" day out. It needs to have enough in it that can justify her claim that austerity is over. Failing to deliver anything that gives substance to it would be a gift to her political opponents. But it would be a genuine surprise if the statement is a real change of direction. A genuine surprise would be if Number 11 misses the opportunity to warn what's at stake if a compromise with Brussels - and with Parliament - can't be reached. Let's see. Remember Pastygate?

Brexit 'won't affect Budget spending plans',"This video can not be played Budget headlines in two minutes Philip Hammond has said the ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end"", in his last Budget before Brexit. He spent a windfall from better public finances on more money for universal credit and bringing forward planned income tax cuts by a year. The personal allowance will rise to Â£12,500 and the higher rate threshold to Â£50,000 in April 2019, worth Â£130 a year for a typical base rate taxpayer. Jeremy Corbyn said whatever Mr Hammond had claimed, ""austerity is not over"". At-a-glance: The Budget key points Budget calculator 2018 - what it means for you How the budget affects you if you're young In a speech lasting more than 70 minutes, Mr Hammond said ""we have reached a defining moment on this long, hard journey"" after repairing the damage to the public finances. He described it as a Budget for ""the strivers, the grafters and the carers,"" promising them a ""brighter future"" after years of constraint. He announced a slight increase in growth forecasts, from 1.3% to 1.6% for 2019, and better-than-expected borrowing figures.

Tech giants face digital services tax The chancellor announced an extra Â£2bn for mental health services in England, as part of the Â£20bn boost to the NHS announced by the government in June. He also unveiled an additional Â£400m to allow schools to ""buy the little extras they need"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This is a broken promise Budget"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""What we've heard today are half measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on. ""And far from people's hard work and sacrifices having paid off, as the chancellor claims, this government has frittered it away in ideological tax cuts to the richest in our society."" Corbyn - Budget is full of broken promises Labour said the extra money for mental health would ""do little to relieve the severe pressures"" on services caused by the government's ""relentless underfunding of the NHS,"" and the extra Â£20bn for the health service in England was not enough. Labour MPs also reacted angrily to Mr Hammond's promise of a ""little extra"" for schools. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner tweeted: Allow Twitter content?

The chancellor had been under pressure from Labour and some Tory MPs to put more money into universal credit, amid warnings it could push people into destitution. He announced an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments, which will replace six in-work benefits, and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year. He claimed the changes - reversing cuts made in previous Budgets - would make 2.4 million working people and people with disabilities Â£630 a year better off. Labour said the entire Budget should be voted down unless the government agreed to halt the roll-out of universal credit. The dust hasn't quite settled but we're a good few hours on from when the chancellor squeezed himself back down onto the government front bench, in between a pleased-looking prime minister and his ever-enthusiastic colleague Liz Truss, his number two at the Treasury. A few hours when certainly not everything has become clear, no doubt a few nasties will crawl out from under the rocks through the course of tomorrow according to Budget tradition, but the broad shape of the Budget and its impact are becoming clear. Read Laura's blog Mr Hammond warned at the weekend that an emergency Budget would be needed if Britain leaves the EU in March without a deal. However, Downing Street has said all spending plans in this Budget will go ahead ""irrespective"" of Brexit. The big long-term spending decisions will be made next year, after Britain's scheduled departure from the EU. Mr Hammond said overall spending would go up by 1.2% over the next five years. But Treasury officials said this was not a guide to next year's spending review because more money could be available if the UK gets a deal with the EU. And, they added, there was Â£4.2bn in reserve for a no-deal scenario so it was likely spending would go up whatever happened, although the 1.2% figure included the extra money for the NHS. Mr Hammond has said his Budget was based on the assumption of an ""average-type free trade deal"" being agreed between the UK and the EU. He said he was holding back some ""fiscal"" headroom in case he needed to alter his economic plan if Britain leaves the EU without a deal - but that a Brexit agreement with Brussels would result in a ""deal dividend"" for the economy.

He added that ""most of the planned welfare cuts are still on the books"". The Office for Budget Responsibility said the chancellor had decided to spend a ""windfall"" from better employment and tax receipts on a ""near-term tax and spending giveaway"", in addition to the extra Â£20bn promised for the NHS by Theresa May. ""This leaves the medium-term outlook for government borrowing little changed since March"", with the government still committed to balancing the nation's books by 2025.

And for those who can't get enough of this Budget, you can findall the official documents here,external. Goodnight. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says only if you consider ""a very tight definition"" of what austerity means. ""Arguably he's just about got to the absolute minimal definition of ending austerity but it's certainly nothing like a bonanza for the rest of the public services,"" he told the BBC. He adds that ""most of the planned welfare cuts are still on the books"". Philip Hammond was, perhaps uncharacteristically, in a very jovial mood. Not known for humour - in public, at least - the chancellor managed to raise a few laughs during his Budget speech. Here's his best gags, courtesy of the Press Association. The last Budget to be held on a Monday was in 1962 and Mr Hammond said: ""I
was six years old, tensions between Russia and the United States were rising and
a former foreign secretary turned chancellor delivered a Budget amid Cabinet
revolt...  I could swear I remember my parents turning to me and saying:
'Philip, one day, that can be you'."" By holding the statement on Monday rather than the usual Wednesday, the chancellor said he avoided a Halloween Budget which could have produced ""Hammo
House of Horrors"" headlines. But ""I have not avoided the blood-curdling
threats, the anguished wailing, and the strange banging of furniture that's
usually associated with Wednesday - I have kindly been invited to a special
meeting of the 1922 Committee this evening"". In a display of toilet humour, the chancellor promised that councils can
""relieve themselves"" with a tax break on public lavatories, although he did
not want to get ""bogged down"" on the subject. It was, he noted, one of the few
announcements that had not ""leaked"". In a nod to Mr McDonnell's recent accident, suffered tripping over fly-tipped
waste, the chancellor promised cash to deal with the issue ""although I cannot
guarantee that Â£10m is going to be enough to stop him falling flat on his
face in the future"". After announcing plans for a Â£400m digital services tax, Mr Hammond
also managed a quick jibe at Sir Nick Clegg, who has taken a senior role with
Facebook, joking that ""I am already looking forward to my call from the former
leader of the Liberal Democrats"". Hidden in theBudget Red Book,external(on page 80!) is news of a new prize-linked saving scheme for credit unions. The Budget document said: ""Credit unions play an important role in
facilitating savings and offering affordable borrowing to their members. ""To help people increase
their financial resilience while boosting awareness and membership of these community
organisations, the Budget commits to launching a pilot of a new prize-linked saving scheme for
credit unions."" More details will follow - such as timings and amounts - but the Treasury presumably hopes it could be a boost  for the sector. Matt Bland of the Association of British Credit Unions told the BBC: ""We're excited by the announcement. Credit unions are all about encouraging people to save and prize-linked savings is an interesting way to encourage savers."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scotch Whisky Association said the Chancellor's decision to continue the freeze on spirits duty was a ""welcome show of support"" for the industry. The measure means the price of a typical bottle is 30p lower than if it had risen by inflation, according to the Treasury. The duty rate on spirits remains Â£28.74 per litre of pure alcohol. Of the Â£14.15 average price of a bottle of Scotch whisky, Â£10.41 is collected in tax through excise duty and VAT, the SWA said. Hundreds of thousands of private-sector contractors face higher tax and National Insurance (NI) bills from April 2020, after today's Budget. The crackdown is the biggest revenue-raising measure in this year's budget. Ian Hyde, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, says it's a ""huge cost burden"" and a ""significant shift of risk"" for businesses which rely on contractors. âMany contractors have highly specialised skills and
it is crucial that these skills can be easily circulated amongst businesses.
However, these new rules may result in businesses scaling back their use of
contractors, slowing this transfer of skills from one business to another. âThe ultimate winner from these new rules is HMRC
which will now have thousands of businesses doing their policing for them, but
at what cost?,"" he asks. Read more here Simon JackBBC Business Editor 2018
has been an annus horribilis for the high street. Many
high street retailers have cried foul in the face of new
competition from online firms that employ fewer staff and pay far lower
business rates. There
are two ways you can level the playing field. Cut
charges for the traditional retailers or increase them for online traders. Mr
Hammond has done a bit of both. He has spent Â£900m knocking a third off the business rates billof 500,000 small retailers. Very welcome to those who have
premises with a rateable value below Â£51k. Second
â he unveileda new Â£400m digital services taxto be levied on the tech
giants on the money they
make on digital services like advertising and streaming entertainment (but not
online sales). So will these two measures save the high
street? Probably not â at least not on their own. Read more here Mark Stokes at Deloitte has more exclusive analysis of today's Budget for the BBC: The Government will extend the stamp duty relief for first-time buyers to purchases of shared ownership properties worth up to Â£500,000. That means qualifying
purchasers will pay no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 paid on the purchase of their
home and 5% on the remainder up to the cap of Â£500,000. In welcome news for taxpayers who have bought homes that would have qualified
since the last Budget in November 2017, the rules will be backdated with
taxpayers able to claim a refund. A consultation will be published in January 2019 on the potential
introduction of a further 1% stamp duty charge on purchases of residential property
by non-UK residents. This follows significant changes to the taxation of
non-residents investing in UK residential real estate over recent years to
align their tax position with UK residents. The Budget offered nothing for those ""massacred"" by the Universal Credit welfare reforms, according to Frank Field, chair of the Commons' Work and Pensions Committee. He told the Commons cuts for families would get ""worse next year and worse the year after and worse the year after that"". He added: ""The Chancellor did make some very important additions to the Universal Credit Budget and I'm grateful, as all of us must be who've seen our constituents massacred by this benefit. ""But there are four big changes he has yet to announce if we are to be satisfied that the rollout of Universal Credit can roll out safely to every one of our constituents."" BBC World News Stephanie Flanders, former BBC economics correspondent and now a senior editor at Bloomberg, says the Prime Minister wanted ""a really big Budget"". But she points out that with the UK preparing to leave the EU on 29 March, that simply wasn't possible. ""It can't really be a watershed Budget, because we are months before this big question,"" she says. Philip Hammond didn't mention any negatives from Brexit, even going to far as to talk about a Brexit dividend, Ms Flanders adds.

Rory Cellan-JonesBBC technology correspondent Faced
with public anger over the low tax paid in the UK by the likes of Google,
Amazon and Facebook, the government has talked time and again of imposing some
kind of levy on the tech giants. The
problem has been designing it so that it doesn't stifle innovation from new
firms and coordinating action with other countries so that businesses aren't
put off investing in the UK. The
Chancellorâs solution is to target a Digital Services Tax at a narrow set of what
are described as digital business platform services - specifically search
engines, online marketplaces and social media firms. Which sounds like Google,
Amazon and Facebook. He
also makes it clear he hopes that by 2020 when the tax is due to be
introduced, a global agreement on a tax on digital turnover will have been
agreed. That
may be optimistic according to the trade body techUK, which warns that going it
alone would be costly. But
there is in any case still plenty to be sorted out about how the
new tax will work - and whether it can be as precisely targeted as the Treasury
seems to think. The Chancellor will be hoping that an international agreement rides to his rescue before the UK tax has to be imposed. BBC Radio 5 live Frank Jay owns a chilli shop in Leeds city centre. He tells BBC Radio 5 Live he is interested in the business rate relief announced by the chancellor for small retailers in England: ""I was pleasantly surprised. When I started the chilli shop, when we hit business rates, wow that was a big chunk of our income. And we were not getting anything from it - it was the difference between making the rent and not making the rent sometimes. ""So this has come as a big relief.  I'd prefer them to go further for small businesses to protect our high street, and go all the way and have [no business rates] for a couple of years, but yeah I'm much happier."" Anne Redston, professor of tax law at Kingâs College London, details two important changes in today's Budget relating to insolvent businesses: The Budget announced two important changes when businesses
are insolvent. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is an unsecured
creditor of an insolvent business, so is in the same position as anyone else
who is owed money by that business. But from April 2020, HMRC will be first in the queue, with a
priority right to recover any PAYE, employee national insurance contributions
(NICs), VAT and deductions made under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS). The governmentâs reasoning is that VAT, PAYE, employee NICs
and CIS are all money deducted from customers and employees, and held in trust
by the business. This new preferential creditor rule therefore does not apply
to corporation tax or employer NICs. The new rules will mean money is more likely to be
recovered from insolvent businesses than has been the
case - but it also means that other creditors will receive less. So if a
business goes bust which owes you money, you are likely to get back a lower
amount, or even nothing at all. And if it is your business that has gone bust, and you have
been involved in tax avoidance or evasion, or if you simply set up a new
business to replace the old (known as ""phoenixism"") HMRC will have the power to
collect the missing tax, NICs or VAT from you personally. It includes announcements on wages, mental health and universal credit. Here's what it means to you.

Public spending will rise by Â£30bn by 2023-24 - a significant stimulus to be spent on the NHS and on raising the amount people can earn before they start paying tax. That is in sharp contrast to the five-year ""austerity"" plan announced in 2010, which saw cuts of 3% a year, and 2015, which included cuts of 1.3% a year. To pay for that, Mr Hammond will allow borrowing to to be sustained at about Â£20bn a year. Little talk today of ""balancing the books"" or the risk of a bad Brexit deal.

"Angela Merkel to step down in 2021The decision by Germany's veteran chancellor comes after a series of regional election setbacks.EuropeBrexit 'won't affect Budget spending plans'All spending plans in the Budget are ""funded"" whether the UK leaves the EU with a deal or not, No 10 says.UK Politics","Mrs Merkel gave a news conference on Monday Germany's Angela Merkel has said she will step down as chancellor in 2021, following recent election setbacks. ""I will not be seeking any political post after my term ends,"" she told a news conference in Berlin. She also said she would not seek re-election as leader of the centre-right CDU party in December. She has held the post since 2000. The CDU was severely weakened in Sunday's poll in the state of Hesse, the latest in a series of setbacks. Both the CDU and its national coalition partners, the Social Democrats, were 10 percentage points down on the previous poll there. The election comes just weeks afterMrs Merkel's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, suffered huge losses in a state parliament vote. A career in pictures Chancellor Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Merkel's three challenges Angela Merkel's leadership woes Parties like the left-leaning Greens and the far-right, anti-immigration AfD have grown in national support following the 2017 general election, as backing for the major centre parties has waned. By Jenny Hill, BBC's Berlin correspondent Angela Merkel did her best to maintain her famous poker face but at times she looked rather sad as she announced what amounted to an official - albeit drawn-out - farewell to German politics. She has always insisted that if she is to lead Germany, she must also lead her party. The announcement is intended to silence critics in her party and win back the voters who have deserted the CDU in favour of parties like AfD and the Greens, but it also reflects her dwindling grip on power. Much depends on her successor as party leader. If it is a loyalist - like Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer - Germany might see a smooth transition to a new chancellor, possibly allowing Mrs Merkel to see out her term. But the vultures are circling. Already an old rival, Friedrich Merz, has announced his candidacy. If one of Mrs Merkel's adversaries prevails as party leader, her chancellorship becomes uncomfortable and possibly untenable. Mrs Merkel said she took ""full responsibility"" for poor performance. ""As chancellor and leader of the CDU I'm politically responsible for everything, for successes and for failures,"" she said. ""When people are telling us what they think of how the government was formed and what they think of our work during the first seven months of this parliament... then it is a clear signal that things can't carry on as they are. ""The time has come to open a new chapter."" Mrs Merkel is a veteran political figure, pictured here with former Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1997 She also made it clear she would not handpick her successor as party leader and would ""accept any democratic decision taken by my party"". Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer would be the obvious choice for Merkel loyalists to replace her. She is currently the party secretary. However, Health Minister Jens Spahn, a leading critic of the chancellor's open-door migration policies, has also announced his candidacy. And Friedrich Merz, a former leader of the CDU-CSU parliamentary group and an old rival to Mrs Merkel, has thrown his hat into the ring. Mrs Merkel's CDU plunged 11 percentage points to 27% in Sunday's elections in the central state of Hesse, according to preliminary results. This was the party's worst showing in the state since 1966. The SPD, which is in coalition with the CDU nationally, fell by a similar amount to 19.8%. The Greens saw their share of the vote rise substantially to 19.5% in Hesse The main beneficiaries were the Greens, who paradoxically share power with the CDU in the state and have now drawn level with the SPD, and the far-right AfD, who rose to 13%. The Hesse vote follows a pattern of losses for the two main parties, with the AfD doing particularly well in eastern states. Also on 14 October, the CDU's Bavarian ally, the CSU, lost its absolute majority in the state's parliament which it has dominated since 1957. Like in Hesse, the SPD also lost badly and the Greens and AfD surged. While the Greens appear to have benefited from the SPD's slump in support, it seems clear that the centre-right has lost voters to the AfD. Part of the reason could be anger at Mrs Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders to large numbers of migrants, a move which the AfD has vehemently opposed.

"Brexit 'won't affect Budget spending plans'All spending plans in the Budget are ""funded"" whether the UK leaves the EU with a deal or not, No 10 says.UK Politics","This video can not be played Budget headlines in two minutes Philip Hammond has said the ""era of austerity is finally coming to an end"", in his last Budget before Brexit. He spent a windfall from better public finances on more money for universal credit and bringing forward planned income tax cuts by a year. The personal allowance will rise to Â£12,500 and the higher rate threshold to Â£50,000 in April 2019, worth Â£130 a year for a typical base rate taxpayer. Jeremy Corbyn said whatever Mr Hammond had claimed, ""austerity is not over"". At-a-glance: The Budget key points Budget calculator 2018 - what it means for you How the budget affects you if you're young In a speech lasting more than 70 minutes, Mr Hammond said ""we have reached a defining moment on this long, hard journey"" after repairing the damage to the public finances. He described it as a Budget for ""the strivers, the grafters and the carers,"" promising them a ""brighter future"" after years of constraint. He announced a slight increase in growth forecasts, from 1.3% to 1.6% for 2019, and better-than-expected borrowing figures.

Tech giants face digital services tax The chancellor announced an extra Â£2bn for mental health services in England, as part of the Â£20bn boost to the NHS announced by the government in June. He also unveiled an additional Â£400m to allow schools to ""buy the little extras they need"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This is a broken promise Budget"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""What we've heard today are half measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on. ""And far from people's hard work and sacrifices having paid off, as the chancellor claims, this government has frittered it away in ideological tax cuts to the richest in our society."" Corbyn - Budget is full of broken promises Labour said the extra money for mental health would ""do little to relieve the severe pressures"" on services caused by the government's ""relentless underfunding of the NHS,"" and the extra Â£20bn for the health service in England was not enough. Labour MPs also reacted angrily to Mr Hammond's promise of a ""little extra"" for schools. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner tweeted: Allow Twitter content?

The chancellor had been under pressure from Labour and some Tory MPs to put more money into universal credit, amid warnings it could push people into destitution. He announced an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments, which will replace six in-work benefits, and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year. He claimed the changes - reversing cuts made in previous Budgets - would make 2.4 million working people and people with disabilities Â£630 a year better off. Labour said the entire Budget should be voted down unless the government agreed to halt the roll-out of universal credit. The dust hasn't quite settled but we're a good few hours on from when the chancellor squeezed himself back down onto the government front bench, in between a pleased-looking prime minister and his ever-enthusiastic colleague Liz Truss, his number two at the Treasury. A few hours when certainly not everything has become clear, no doubt a few nasties will crawl out from under the rocks through the course of tomorrow according to Budget tradition, but the broad shape of the Budget and its impact are becoming clear. Read Laura's blog Mr Hammond warned at the weekend that an emergency Budget would be needed if Britain leaves the EU in March without a deal. However, Downing Street has said all spending plans in this Budget will go ahead ""irrespective"" of Brexit. The big long-term spending decisions will be made next year, after Britain's scheduled departure from the EU. Mr Hammond said overall spending would go up by 1.2% over the next five years. But Treasury officials said this was not a guide to next year's spending review because more money could be available if the UK gets a deal with the EU. And, they added, there was Â£4.2bn in reserve for a no-deal scenario so it was likely spending would go up whatever happened, although the 1.2% figure included the extra money for the NHS. Mr Hammond has said his Budget was based on the assumption of an ""average-type free trade deal"" being agreed between the UK and the EU. He said he was holding back some ""fiscal"" headroom in case he needed to alter his economic plan if Britain leaves the EU without a deal - but that a Brexit agreement with Brussels would result in a ""deal dividend"" for the economy.

He added that ""most of the planned welfare cuts are still on the books"". The Office for Budget Responsibility said the chancellor had decided to spend a ""windfall"" from better employment and tax receipts on a ""near-term tax and spending giveaway"", in addition to the extra Â£20bn promised for the NHS by Theresa May. ""This leaves the medium-term outlook for government borrowing little changed since March"", with the government still committed to balancing the nation's books by 2025.

KKK display treated as 'hate incident',"The picture was taken a few doors down from the Bangladesh Islamic Centre in Newtownards A report of a group of people dressed as Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members in Newtownards, County Down, is being treated by police as a hate crime. Pictures emerged of the group posing near an Islamic prayer house. The pictures were taken on Saturday night on Greenwell Street. The incident was reported to police at about 17:00 GMT on Sunday. Strangford MLAs have condemned the incident. PSNI Insp Richard Murray said: ""Hate crime, in all its forms, is totally unacceptable. The Chief Constable, George Hamilton, toldBBC NI's The Nolan Showthe incident was ""disgusting and distasteful"". ""There's no place for it anywhere in Northern Ireland. We will investigate it and report the evidence to the PPS,"" he added. This video can not be played A group of people dressed in KKK outfits in County Down BBC News NI has obtained footage of men dressed in KKK outfits in a JD Wetherspoon pub in the town. JD Wetherspoon spokesperson Eddie Gershon said the group was ""refused entry by door staff, but pushed past them into the pub"". He said: ""They were told by bar staff that they would not be served. They remained in the pub for five minutes, unserved, and then left."" Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said the picture of the people dressed as members of the white supremacist group was a ""clear demonstration of aggression"" and ""that is a hate crime."" The picture appears to have been taken a few doors down from the Bangladesh Islamic Centre in Newtownards. In August last year,a pig's head was left on the doorstep of the centre. DUP MLA Peter Weir tweeted that the pictures showed ""malevolent intent"". Ulster Unionist Mike Nesbitt tweeted he was ""disgusted"" and would pass the picture to the PSNI Chief Constable.

Belfast Islamic Centre executive treasurer Dr Raied Al-Wazzan said the small Muslim community in Newtownards had been left shaken by the incident. ""They could have gone to anywhere in Newtownards, anywhere in Northern Ireland dressing in any uniform, but to go in front of an Islamic prayer room, it's totally making people afraid,"" he told The Nolan Show. ""They are afraid to come out or even to go there."" Dr Al-Wazzan acknowledged that it could have been a Halloween prank, and called upon those involved to come forward and identify themselves. ""If they keep it quiet for the next 24 hours, that means it was a deliberate act,"" he said. ""If this is just a joke, these people should come forward and identify themselves. ""To go there specifically wearing that costume in front of the Islamic centre is not acceptable. It's similar to somebody wearing a Nazi uniform and going in front of a Jewish synagogue."" Belfast Islamic Centre executive treasurer Dr Raied Al-Wazzan said the small Muslim community in Newtownards had been left shaken One man, who did not want to be named, lives near a bar in Newtownards and told the BBC he saw the group go into it. ""We were disturbed by mens' voices. I looked out the blinds and saw men in KKK costumes. One was giving a fascist salute. They looked like proper KKK outfits - they had the flap that covers the face,"" he said. ""They were shouting and posing outside the pub. ""At about 02:00 GMT they came out of the bar so they had been allowed into it in their costumes. ""It's insensitive - it's not a laugh and it's not just about Halloween. ""Last year, a pig's head was thrown through the door of the Islamic centre. ""This is ethnically diverse town. What if a black family had been walking home from a Halloween party and been confronted with that? ""I was disgusted and also was saddened by the reaction on social media."" Ms Armstrong, who has an office near where the photographs are said to have been taken, said the KKK represented a ""brand of hatred not wanted or welcome in the area"". She told BBC's Good Morning Ulster that people in the area were ""disgusted"". ""They were people who purchased KKK robes,"" she said. ""They were wearing hoods and carrying crosses and they happened to go outside the Islamic prayer house, they were in bars in the town, expressing religious intolerance - and that's a hate crime. ""Some are saying this is just a Halloween jape. No it's not. Everyone knows what the KKK stands for"" she added.

Seven guilty of Rotherham abuse charges,"Clockwise from top left: Iqlak Yousaf, Nabeel Kurshid, Mohammed Imran Ali Akhtar, Tanweer Ali, Salah Ahmed El-Hakam and Asif Ali were found guilty after a trial Seven men have been found guilty of grooming and exploiting young girls, including one who was sexually abused by ""at least 100 Asian men"" before the age of 16. Sheffield Crown Court heard how the men targeted and exploited the teenagers before subjecting them to acts of a ""degrading and violent nature"". They abused five young girls over a seven year period in Rotherham. The gang were convicted of offences including rape and indecent assault. One girl described being bitten and raped by two of the men in Sherwood Forest while ""high as a kite"" on drugs. Mohammed Imran Ali Akhtar, 37, Asif Ali, 33, Tanweer Ali, 37, Salah Ahmed El-Hakam, 39, Nabeel Kurshid, 35, Iqlak Yousaf, 34, and a seventh man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted after a trial. An eighth man, Ajmal Rafiq, 39, was found not guilty of one count of false imprisonment and one count of indecent assault. The men are due to be sentenced on 16 November. The convictions are the latest to come out of Operation Stovewood, the National Crime Agency's (NCA) investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, which has identified more than 1,500 victims. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire All the offences took place in and around Rotherham between 1998 and 2005 During a trial lasting more than eight weeks the jury heard the men, who are all of British Pakistani heritage, preyed on the girls' vulnerability before they were sexually assaulted and passed on to other men. Prosecutor Michelle Colborne QC said the girls had been ""lured by the excitement of friendship with older Asian youths"" but were then ""targeted, sexualised and in some instances subjected to acts of a degrading and violent nature"". She said: ""None of them had the maturity to understand that they were being groomed and exploited, often believing that sex of some kind was a necessary price for friendship."" Operation Stovewood is the largest law enforcement investigation into non-familial child sexual exploitation in the UK. It began in 2014 after a report found at least 1,400 children in Rotherham were the victims of abuse between 1997 and 2013. It is run by the NCA, which is working with 296 alleged victims, has identified 151 suspects and is running 22 ongoing investigations. More than 150 officers work on the operation and there are plans to recruit another 100. It is jointly funded by South Yorkshire Police and the Home Office and when up to full strength will cost Â£15m a year to run. It has led to 14 convictions so far, and 24 more people have been charged with offences. The court head the men used alcohol, drugs, threats and violence to control the girls. On girl said Ali Akhtar regularly threatened to dump her in remote locations if she did not have sex with him and his friends and on one occasion he abandoned her by the side of a motorway. The same girl said Ali Akhtar would take her to meet older Asian taxi drivers who would then abuse her. Another recounted how as Tanweer Ali raped her in the back of a car he told her: ""It's better you just get it over and done with and then you can go back home"". Victims were assaulted and abused in locations across Rotherham, including Clifton Park The court heard some of the girls had already been exploited by other men in Rotherham. The girls were abused in locations across Rotherham, the court heard, including at the tip in Rawmarsh, in a supermarket car park, and at Clifton Park and Ulley Country Park. One girl, who was 14 at the time, was given cannabis and driven to Sherwood Forest by Nabeel Kurshid, Iqlak Yousaf and a third man. The men then took turns raping her, warning her that if she did not do as she was told she would be left there. Ms Colborne said the girl became pregnant as a result of the attack and was forced to have a termination. 14 men have now been convicted as a result of Operation Stovewood The men denied the offences, claiming either the girls were lying or what had happened had been consensual. However, in July 2015 Ali Akhtar was recorded by one of the victims as he tried to find out if she had spoken to the police. In the recording he said: ""The thing is that was a wrong time when Shatan [the devil] whispers to you and says to you: 'Enjoy life, take drugs'. He wants you to do haram [acts forbidden by Allah]."" He went on to suggest that other girls had come forward in order ""to get some coin"". Mike Duffy of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: ""These men deliberately preyed on young, vulnerable teenagers, grooming and exploiting them.

Moors Murder victim's remains reburied,"Pauline Reade's remains were found in 1987 after her disappearance in 1963 The Moors Murderers' first victim, Pauline Reade, has been reburied in order to add remains kept by police for 30 years to her grave. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the private exhumation and reburial took place at her grave in Gorton Cemetery, Manchester. Ian Brady and Myra Hindley admitted the 1963 killing of the 16-year-old while in prison in the 1980s. Pauline's remains were kept without her family's knowledge. A GMP statement said: ""Pauline and the other Moors Murders victims are ever present in our minds and Greater Manchester Police will always do everything we can to support their relatives and honour their memory."" GMP apologised to the Reade familyin Novemberwhen an audit revealed some of her remains were kept on its behalf at the University of Leeds. The Moors murders were a series of crimes that shocked Britain in the 1960s Ian Brady and his girlfriend Myra Hindley tortured, sexually assaulted and murdered five children during 1963 and 1964 and buried their bodies on Saddleworth Moor, near Manchester Their killing spree was discovered in 1965, when Hindley's brother-in-law told police he witnessed Brady murdering Edward Evans, 17, at the couple's home in Hattersley The pair were jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans while Brady was also convicted of killing 12-year-old John Kilbride In 1987, Brady and Hindley admitted killing Keith Bennett, 12, and 16-year-old Pauline Reade. Pauline's body was found still wearing her pink and gold party dress in a shallow grave on Saddleworth Moor after Brady and Hindley returned with police to the scene of their crimes. Keith's body was never found Hindley died in 2002 while Brady died in 2017 Police searched Saddleworth Moor in the 1980s when Brady and Hindley admitted killing Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett Pauline vanished on 12 July 1963 while on her way to a disco near her home in Gorton, Manchester. Hindley, who was an acquaintance of Pauline's, lured her to Saddleworth Moor with a fabricated tale about needing help to find some lost gloves. It was there the teenager was beaten about the head and her throat cut with such force that her spinal cord was severed. Her stored remains, which her family said included a jaw bone and hair, were discovered as part of a GMP audit of body parts stored before 2006 whenthe 2004 Human Tissue Act,externalcame into force. Peter Hall, who has represented Pauline's niece Jackie Reade, said the way GMP had handled the remains added to his client's distress. He said there was a nine-month gap between the family receiving the samples of her remains and the return of Pauline's shoes and jewellery. ""Why those items were not returned earlier with the body samples we do not know,"" he added.

Far-right Bolsonaro is Brazil's new leader,"This video can not be played Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro has won Brazil's presidential election. But who is he? Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro has won a sweeping victory in Brazil's presidential election. The former army captain won 55.2% of the vote against 44.8% for Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party. Mr Bolsonaro's pledge to fight crime and corruption following a string of scandals have won him mass support. However critics are worried by his praise of Brazil's former dictatorship, and by his comments on race, women and homosexuality. In one infamous incident in 2015 he told a fellow lawmaker she was too ugly to rape. Mr Bolsonaro's controversial comments, his pro-gun stance and his populist approach to politics have led to some media dubbing him ""Trump of the Tropics"". Jair Bolsonaro: The Trump of the Tropics? Brazil's swing to the right brings hope and fear What are Bolsonaro's policies? President Trump himself took to Twitter on Monday to praise the Brazilian president-elect. Allow Twitter content?

For his supporters, Mr Bolsonaro is a politician who they say will bring much needed change to the country - a swing to the right after four elections won by the left. For the past four years, Brazil has been consumed by a criminal investigation - known as Operation Car Wash - that has uncovered massive corruption. Dozens of business and political leaders have been jailed. Among them wasformer President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, who was barred from standing in the election. Tears and celebration on Brazil's streets Who supports Bolsonaro? Brazil election guide in five charts The 63-year-old leads the Social Liberal Party (PSL), an anti-establishment group that combines social conservatism and pro-market policies. Mr Bolsonaro is a deeply polarising figure who has had a divisive effect on Brazilians with both supporters and opponents taking to the streets to make their voices heard. This video can not be played Rival supporters argue after Brazil poll result He has in the past defended the killing of opponents to the country's former military regime and said he is ""in favour of dictatorship"". But after the results came in, he told supporters he would be a ""defender of democracy"" and uphold the constitution. One of his flagship policies is to restore security by relaxing gun laws and suggested that ""every honest citizens"" should be able to own a gun. He has promised to reduce state intervention in the economy and indicated that Brazil could pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. He takes over on 1 January 2019. Election drives wedge between friends Analysis by BBC's Katy Watson in Sao Paulo Is there a chance Mr Bolsonaro could soften his stance, now he's won power? Few experts believe it. You only need to look to another firebrand in the continent for guidance. ""The things that Donald Trump outlined and the signals that he gave during the campaign he carried through with,"" says Kyle Pope of the Columbia Journalism Review, who has studied parallels between Brazil's new president and the leader of the US. Many say a comparison with Mr Trump is inaccurate. Instead, they say Mr Bolsonaro is more akin to Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Whatever the comparison, what is clear is that country's sharp swing to the right will resonate beyond Brazil as another populist takes power. And the opposition will redouble efforts not to take away the gains that country's made since it returned to democracy 30 years ago. The future looks messy for Brazil. Yes and no. On the one hand, his PSL party achieved a remarkable breakthrough in this month's legislative election, increasing its representation from one to 52 seats in the lower house. However Mr Haddad's PT remains the largest party, with 56 seats. But most ominously for Mr Bolsonaro, there will be a record 30 parties represented in the next Congress. This suggest that finding backing for legislation could be difficult for the new president. A number of Latin American leaders congratulated Mr Bolsonaro: Argentine President Mauricio Macri described the poll results as Mr Bolsonaro's ""triumph"" Chilean President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era congratulated Brazilians for a ""clean and democratic election"" Colombia's Ivan Duque welcomed the result and called for the two countries' ""brotherly relations"" to be strengthened further Mexican outgoing President President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto hailed Brazil's ""democratic strength"" Peru's Martin Vizcarra wished Mr Bolsonaro ""full success"" Venezuela's NicolÃ¡s Maduro extended his ""congratulations to the people of Brazil"" Amnesty International said that taking into account his campaign pledges, Mr Bolsonaro's victory could pose a ""huge risk"" to Brazil's indigenous peoples, LGBT communities, black youth, women, activists and civil society organisations.

Women over 34 refused IVF treatment,"Charlotte, 38, is considering moving home as she is too old to qualify for IVF in her current area Women over 34 are being automatically refused IVF treatment on the NHS in 12 areas of England, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has found. IVF should be offered to women until age 42, guidelines say, but new figures show around 80% of areas are failing to do this. Campaign group Fertility Fairness said it ""penalises women who take longer to find a partner"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""blanket bans"" were ""not acceptable"". Couples in Wales and Scotland are offered IVF until they are 42, as long as certain criteria are met. 'The food supplement that ruined my liver' The murder that changed America SinÃ©ad O'Connor converts to Islam One 38-year-old woman, Charlotte - whose surname we are not using - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she was considering moving house to a different area, having been told she was too old to qualify for the procedure in Southampton. Southampton City Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) has a cut-off age for women of 34. ""It's just unfair, because I am not over the hill,"" she said. ""To say that 35 and over is the end of having children is ridiculous."" Charlotte was first tested aged 34, and said the ""most upsetting"" aspect was not being told about the age limit sooner. ""I would have liked to have known when I was younger,"" she said. ""It would have enabled us to make a decision earlier about selling the house, and given us another year on what is already a timed situation."" Southampton City CCG said it had ""taken into account the relative cost-effectiveness [of IVF] compared to other treatments that could be funded with the resources we have available"". Guidelines from health watchdog NICE recommend that women under 40 should be offered three full cycles of IVF, and those between 40 and 42 one full cycle. But data from all 195 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England - obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Fertility Fairness and analysed by the Victoria Derbyshire programme - shows that seven have stopped offering IVF on the NHS entirely. Of the others, 12 deny treatment to women over 34 - offering only one full cycle to those under that age. 85 CCGs, some 43% of the total, have cut IVF for women over 39. England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Victoria Derbyshire such restrictions were ""not acceptable"". ""Decisions on the treatments that are made available to people should be made on their clinical need,"" he said. ""There is a reason we have guidelines in the first place - and that's to provide the standard the country should expect."" The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists blamed ""inadequate government funding"". It said it was ""very concerned that women and their partners are turning to costly private clinics for treatment"". This video can not be played Happy Birthday IVF: Five things you might not know Sarah Norcross, co-chair of campaign group Fertility Fairness, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that it ""penalises the women who take longer to find a partner or wish to put themselves on a secure financial footing before trying to conceive"". The group's 2018 report into IVF rationing found that 30 CCGs have ""slashed NHS fertility services"" in the last two years. It said many CCGs were setting their own access criteria - with 27% now using a man's body mass index (BMI) to determine whether a couple can be referred for IVF on the NHS, and 8% stipulating men must be aged below 55. NHS England said in a statement: ""Ultimately these are decisions for local GPs, who rightly decide how best to balance the various competing demands on the NHS.""

BBC app aims to woo younger listeners,"The new app includes music mixes as well as podcasts and live radio BBC Sounds, a new app that brings together the corporation's radio, music and podcasts, is hoping to entice more younger people to listen to the BBC. The app replaces BBC iPlayer Radio, and James Purnell, director of radio and education, said it would allow the BBC to ""lean in to the podcast revolution"". The old app was only used by 3% of people under the age of 35 each week. ""We do serve younger people less well than older people and we have to do more for them,"" Mr Purnell said. Last week, regulator Ofcom said the corporation""needs to take significant steps"",externalto reach young people. BBC Sounds will offer ""all of BBC audio at your fingertips"", Mr Purnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The app, which will offer 80,000 hours of BBC audio, had a soft launch in June but is being promoted fully from this week. Mr Purnell said it ""will be personalised, we'll recommend content, edit collections... make it much easier for you to find your favourites"". BBC podcasts including You, ME and the Big C are available on the app It will also include a new Today programme spin-off, Beyond Today. Mr Purnell added: ""We're here to bring the best to everyone, that's the BBC's role and if we're not serving young people as well as in the past then that will create a problem for our society."" He warned: ""If we keep it exactly as it has been, in 10 or 20 years time we won't have the brilliant BBC radio that we have today."" The experience of listening to live radio gives the new app an edge over its rivals, he added. ""It's one of the key things that we have that none of our competitors - the big streamers - have. So we think radio is absolutely central to it. ""But we can complement it with podcasts, with amazing music mixes from our best talent - we can do both.""

A tragic end to city's fairytale,"Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was a ""chairman of the community"", according to Leicester City ambassador Alan Birchenall When a reclusive Thai billionaire took control of an ailing East Midlands football club in 2010, few could have predicted the fairytale that would follow. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha'sdeath in a helicopter crashoutside the King Power Stadium capped a tragic end to a remarkable eight years. On the football side, it included Leicester City's promotion from the Championship and peaked with the 5,000-1 outsiders' astonishingPremier League title winin 2016. But Mr Vichai's contribution to the city went beyond what happened on the pitch. During his stewardship of the club he donated Â£2m to the Leicester Children's Hospital charity, Â£1m to the Foxes Foundation for community causes and Â£1m to Leicester University's medical department. Those generous gestures - as well as the club's success - led to the tycoon being hailed as part of the city's fabric. Leicester's mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said Mr Vichai ""didn't just buy a football club and run it from a distance - he became a part of the city and became much loved here"". Sir Peter praised his ""philanthropic donations"" but also smaller gestures such as providing free scarves, clappers, flags anddoughnutsat the King Power Stadium. Hundreds of bouquets of flowers and tributes have been left at the King Power Stadium Dr Sanjiv Nichani, a consultant paediatrician at University Hospital Leicester Children's Hospital, told BBC Radio 5 live Mr Vichai had become ""part of the fabric of Leicester, a giant of Leicester history"" due to his charitable efforts. In Thailand, where Mr Vichai made his fortune, his profile was ""rather different"" to the image of a benevolent billionaire he had cultivated in the UK. BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head described his company King Power's monopoly of Thai duty-free sales as ""very controversial"". The company had faced allegations of corruption over Â£323mreportedly owed to the Thai government, but the case was dismissed in September. However, in Leicester, Mr Vichai was loved almost unconditionally, as the outpouring of emotion since his death in the crash on Saturday night shows. Leicester players pay tribute to owner What we know so far Leicester helicopter crash victims named Worth an estimated Â£2.9bn ($3.8bn), he was chairman of duty-free company King Power International Group which bought then-Championship side Leicester in 2010 for Â£39m. After some early struggles the Foxes were promoted to the Premier League in 2014. They flirted with relegation in their first season back in the top-flight, eventually finishing 14th. That saw the club begin the 2015-16 campaign with odds of 5,000-1 to win the league. But led by Italian manager Claudio Ranieri, the Foxes claimed an unlikely first top division title in their history, inone of the greatest sporting stories of all time. This video can not be played Leicester lift the Premier League trophy The following season, the club reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League and is now established as a mainstay of the Premier League. Mr Vichai's death in the crash, alongside his staff members Nusara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare, and pilots and partners Eric Swaffer and Izabela Roza Lechowicz, has left a city in shock. The billionaire's Â£2m donation helped fund a new children's hospital in the city and has seen Mr Vichai hailed by Karamjit Singh, chairman of Leicester's Hospitals. Who was Leicester's billionaire owner? The greatest sporting story of all time? Mr Singh said: ""Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was a very special individual, not only with his involvement with the football club, but he made a real effort to engage with the fans and the community of Leicester. ""This is evident with the outpouring of emotion across the city and beyond. ""We remain extremely grateful for the very generous donation he made towards our new children's hospital; he knew how to make the impossible possible and has left behind a legacy which we are committed to keeping alive."" University of Leicester graduate Muhamid Pathan said Mr Vichai ""gave so much to the city - unforgettable memories and enormous charitable donations"". Allow Twitter content?

To mark his 60th birthday earlier this year, Mr Vichai gave away 60 free season tickets, highlighting why Leicester City ambassador Alan Birchenall called Mr Vichai ""a chairman of the community"". ""My thoughts are just like everyone in Leicestershire, whether you are a football fan or not, it's so sad and all the others in the helicopter... our thoughts go out to them,"" he told 5 live. Leicestershire Live'sLeicester City editor Rob Tanner said,externalthe wider impact of Mr Vichai's community donations had been felt across the county. He wrote: ""They may not come from Leicester, but they became part of the community through the Foxes Foundation, raising thousands and even contributing millions of their own money to worthwhile causes across the county, services that everyone could use and benefit from, not just football fans.""

""We need to find the main wreckage,"" said Bambang Suryo, operational director of the search and rescue agency. ""I predict there are no survivors, based on body parts found so far."" Belongings - including a handbag - and debris are being recovered from the suspected crash site Families are being told to go to a hospital to identify the dead. Flight JT 610 took off from Jakarta at 06:20 on Monday (23:30 GMT on Sunday). It was due to arrive at Depati Amir airport in Pangkal Pinang an hour later but 13 minutes into the flight, authorities lost contact. The pilot had asked to return to Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta airport, officials say. How could a brand new plane crash?

How likely are you to survive a plane crash? Air disasters timeline by Rebecca Henschke, BBC Indonesia correspondent, Jakarta Relatives of those on board are waiting anxiously for any news at a crisis centre at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma airport, their faces stained with tears. At a desk under a white tent, Lion Air staff are taking down their details. At the top of the forms, they are asked to specify their relationship to the missing - husband, mother, child. Murtado Kurniawan's wife was on the plane. They are newly married and she was making the journey for work. ""I can't live without her, I love her,"" he says through tears. ""The last thing I said to her, was 'be careful'. I always worry about her when she goes away. When I saw on TV that the plane had crashed, my whole body went weak."" Murtado Kurniawan's wife was on board Dede dropped her niece Fiona Ayu and her family off at the airport on Monday morning, to make the short journey home. Fiona is trying to get pregnant via IVF and her family thought it would be good for her to get some rest. ""The airline kept telling us to wait and wait for news, but the images on social media and television are very bad,"" Dede says. ""But I am still holding out hope that she will come back, I am praying and praying for that."" Lion Air said in a statement that the pilot and co-pilot had more than 11,000 flight hours between them. Three of the crew on board were trainee flight attendants and one was a technician. Twenty employees from Indonesia's finance ministry were also on board, the BBC has learned. A ministry spokesperson said they worked at the finance ministry offices in Pangkal Pinang but had been in Jakarta for the weekend. The 737 Max series are the fastest-selling planes in Boeing history, and there are four models - the Max 7, Max 8, Max 9 and Max 10. The Boeing 737 Max 8 has been in commercial use since 2016. The aircraft involved in the crash was made in 2018. It is a single aisle plane used for short-haul travel. In a statement, Boeing expressed sympathy for the victims and families,externaland said it ""stands ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation"". Australia told government workers and contractors to stop using the airline until the findings of the investigation were out. Indonesia, a vast archipelago, is heavily reliant on air travel, but many of its airlines have a poor safety record. This Lion Air plane landed in the sea off Bali in 2013, but all passengers and crew survived Established in 1999, Lion Air operates domestic flights as well as international routes to South East Asia, Australia and the Middle East. It has had issues of safety and poor management in the past and was banned from flying into European airspace until 2016. In 2013, Lion Air flight 904 crashed into the sea on landing at Bali's International Airport.All 108 people on board survived. In 2004, flight 538 from Jakarta crashed and broke up on landing at Solo City, killing 25 people. In 2011 and 2012 a number of pilots were found in possession of methamphetamines, in one incident hours before a flight.

Far-right Bolsonaro is Brazil's new leaderThe controversial candidate wins a big victory over his left-wing rival in the presidential election.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro has won Brazil's presidential election. But who is he? Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro has won a sweeping victory in Brazil's presidential election. The former army captain won 55.2% of the vote against 44.8% for Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party. Mr Bolsonaro's pledge to fight crime and corruption following a string of scandals have won him mass support. However critics are worried by his praise of Brazil's former dictatorship, and by his comments on race, women and homosexuality. In one infamous incident in 2015 he told a fellow lawmaker she was too ugly to rape. Mr Bolsonaro's controversial comments, his pro-gun stance and his populist approach to politics have led to some media dubbing him ""Trump of the Tropics"". Jair Bolsonaro: The Trump of the Tropics? Brazil's swing to the right brings hope and fear What are Bolsonaro's policies? President Trump himself took to Twitter on Monday to praise the Brazilian president-elect. Allow Twitter content?

For his supporters, Mr Bolsonaro is a politician who they say will bring much needed change to the country - a swing to the right after four elections won by the left. For the past four years, Brazil has been consumed by a criminal investigation - known as Operation Car Wash - that has uncovered massive corruption. Dozens of business and political leaders have been jailed. Among them wasformer President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, who was barred from standing in the election. Tears and celebration on Brazil's streets Who supports Bolsonaro? Brazil election guide in five charts The 63-year-old leads the Social Liberal Party (PSL), an anti-establishment group that combines social conservatism and pro-market policies. Mr Bolsonaro is a deeply polarising figure who has had a divisive effect on Brazilians with both supporters and opponents taking to the streets to make their voices heard. This video can not be played Rival supporters argue after Brazil poll result He has in the past defended the killing of opponents to the country's former military regime and said he is ""in favour of dictatorship"". But after the results came in, he told supporters he would be a ""defender of democracy"" and uphold the constitution. One of his flagship policies is to restore security by relaxing gun laws and suggested that ""every honest citizens"" should be able to own a gun. He has promised to reduce state intervention in the economy and indicated that Brazil could pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. He takes over on 1 January 2019. Election drives wedge between friends Analysis by BBC's Katy Watson in Sao Paulo Is there a chance Mr Bolsonaro could soften his stance, now he's won power? Few experts believe it. You only need to look to another firebrand in the continent for guidance. ""The things that Donald Trump outlined and the signals that he gave during the campaign he carried through with,"" says Kyle Pope of the Columbia Journalism Review, who has studied parallels between Brazil's new president and the leader of the US. Many say a comparison with Mr Trump is inaccurate. Instead, they say Mr Bolsonaro is more akin to Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Whatever the comparison, what is clear is that country's sharp swing to the right will resonate beyond Brazil as another populist takes power. And the opposition will redouble efforts not to take away the gains that country's made since it returned to democracy 30 years ago. The future looks messy for Brazil. Yes and no. On the one hand, his PSL party achieved a remarkable breakthrough in this month's legislative election, increasing its representation from one to 52 seats in the lower house. However Mr Haddad's PT remains the largest party, with 56 seats. But most ominously for Mr Bolsonaro, there will be a record 30 parties represented in the next Congress. This suggest that finding backing for legislation could be difficult for the new president. A number of Latin American leaders congratulated Mr Bolsonaro: Argentine President Mauricio Macri described the poll results as Mr Bolsonaro's ""triumph"" Chilean President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era congratulated Brazilians for a ""clean and democratic election"" Colombia's Ivan Duque welcomed the result and called for the two countries' ""brotherly relations"" to be strengthened further Mexican outgoing President President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto hailed Brazil's ""democratic strength"" Peru's Martin Vizcarra wished Mr Bolsonaro ""full success"" Venezuela's NicolÃ¡s Maduro extended his ""congratulations to the people of Brazil"" Amnesty International said that taking into account his campaign pledges, Mr Bolsonaro's victory could pose a ""huge risk"" to Brazil's indigenous peoples, LGBT communities, black youth, women, activists and civil society organisations.

"Breaking|Breaking newsAngela Merkel to step down in 2021Germany's Angela Merkel says she will step down as chancellor in 2021, following election setbacks.Europe","Mrs Merkel gave a news conference on Monday Germany's Angela Merkel has said she will step down as chancellor in 2021, following recent election setbacks. ""I will not be seeking any political post after my term ends,"" she told a news conference in Berlin. She also said she would not seek re-election as leader of the centre-right CDU party in December. She has held the post since 2000. The CDU was severely weakened in Sunday's poll in the state of Hesse, the latest in a series of setbacks. Both the CDU and its national coalition partners, the Social Democrats, were 10 percentage points down on the previous poll there. The election comes just weeks afterMrs Merkel's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, suffered huge losses in a state parliament vote. A career in pictures Chancellor Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Merkel's three challenges Angela Merkel's leadership woes Parties like the left-leaning Greens and the far-right, anti-immigration AfD have grown in national support following the 2017 general election, as backing for the major centre parties has waned. By Jenny Hill, BBC's Berlin correspondent Angela Merkel did her best to maintain her famous poker face but at times she looked rather sad as she announced what amounted to an official - albeit drawn-out - farewell to German politics. She has always insisted that if she is to lead Germany, she must also lead her party. The announcement is intended to silence critics in her party and win back the voters who have deserted the CDU in favour of parties like AfD and the Greens, but it also reflects her dwindling grip on power. Much depends on her successor as party leader. If it is a loyalist - like Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer - Germany might see a smooth transition to a new chancellor, possibly allowing Mrs Merkel to see out her term. But the vultures are circling. Already an old rival, Friedrich Merz, has announced his candidacy. If one of Mrs Merkel's adversaries prevails as party leader, her chancellorship becomes uncomfortable and possibly untenable. Mrs Merkel said she took ""full responsibility"" for poor performance. ""As chancellor and leader of the CDU I'm politically responsible for everything, for successes and for failures,"" she said. ""When people are telling us what they think of how the government was formed and what they think of our work during the first seven months of this parliament... then it is a clear signal that things can't carry on as they are. ""The time has come to open a new chapter."" Mrs Merkel is a veteran political figure, pictured here with former Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1997 She also made it clear she would not handpick her successor as party leader and would ""accept any democratic decision taken by my party"". Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer would be the obvious choice for Merkel loyalists to replace her. She is currently the party secretary. However, Health Minister Jens Spahn, a leading critic of the chancellor's open-door migration policies, has also announced his candidacy. And Friedrich Merz, a former leader of the CDU-CSU parliamentary group and an old rival to Mrs Merkel, has thrown his hat into the ring. Mrs Merkel's CDU plunged 11 percentage points to 27% in Sunday's elections in the central state of Hesse, according to preliminary results. This was the party's worst showing in the state since 1966. The SPD, which is in coalition with the CDU nationally, fell by a similar amount to 19.8%. The Greens saw their share of the vote rise substantially to 19.5% in Hesse The main beneficiaries were the Greens, who paradoxically share power with the CDU in the state and have now drawn level with the SPD, and the far-right AfD, who rose to 13%. The Hesse vote follows a pattern of losses for the two main parties, with the AfD doing particularly well in eastern states. Also on 14 October, the CDU's Bavarian ally, the CSU, lost its absolute majority in the state's parliament which it has dominated since 1957. Like in Hesse, the SPD also lost badly and the Greens and AfD surged. While the Greens appear to have benefited from the SPD's slump in support, it seems clear that the centre-right has lost voters to the AfD. Part of the reason could be anger at Mrs Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders to large numbers of migrants, a move which the AfD has vehemently opposed.

And for those who can't get enough of this Budget, you can findall the official documents here,external. Goodnight. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says only if you consider ""a very tight definition"" of what austerity means. ""Arguably he's just about got to the absolute minimal definition of ending austerity but it's certainly nothing like a bonanza for the rest of the public services,"" he told the BBC. He adds that ""most of the planned welfare cuts are still on the books"". Philip Hammond was, perhaps uncharacteristically, in a very jovial mood. Not known for humour - in public, at least - the chancellor managed to raise a few laughs during his Budget speech. Here's his best gags, courtesy of the Press Association. The last Budget to be held on a Monday was in 1962 and Mr Hammond said: ""I
was six years old, tensions between Russia and the United States were rising and
a former foreign secretary turned chancellor delivered a Budget amid Cabinet
revolt...  I could swear I remember my parents turning to me and saying:
'Philip, one day, that can be you'."" By holding the statement on Monday rather than the usual Wednesday, the chancellor said he avoided a Halloween Budget which could have produced ""Hammo
House of Horrors"" headlines. But ""I have not avoided the blood-curdling
threats, the anguished wailing, and the strange banging of furniture that's
usually associated with Wednesday - I have kindly been invited to a special
meeting of the 1922 Committee this evening"". In a display of toilet humour, the chancellor promised that councils can
""relieve themselves"" with a tax break on public lavatories, although he did
not want to get ""bogged down"" on the subject. It was, he noted, one of the few
announcements that had not ""leaked"". In a nod to Mr McDonnell's recent accident, suffered tripping over fly-tipped
waste, the chancellor promised cash to deal with the issue ""although I cannot
guarantee that Â£10m is going to be enough to stop him falling flat on his
face in the future"". After announcing plans for a Â£400m digital services tax, Mr Hammond
also managed a quick jibe at Sir Nick Clegg, who has taken a senior role with
Facebook, joking that ""I am already looking forward to my call from the former
leader of the Liberal Democrats"". Hidden in theBudget Red Book,external(on page 80!) is news of a new prize-linked saving scheme for credit unions. The Budget document said: ""Credit unions play an important role in
facilitating savings and offering affordable borrowing to their members. ""To help people increase
their financial resilience while boosting awareness and membership of these community
organisations, the Budget commits to launching a pilot of a new prize-linked saving scheme for
credit unions."" More details will follow - such as timings and amounts - but the Treasury presumably hopes it could be a boost  for the sector. Matt Bland of the Association of British Credit Unions told the BBC: ""We're excited by the announcement. Credit unions are all about encouraging people to save and prize-linked savings is an interesting way to encourage savers."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scotch Whisky Association said the Chancellor's decision to continue the freeze on spirits duty was a ""welcome show of support"" for the industry. The measure means the price of a typical bottle is 30p lower than if it had risen by inflation, according to the Treasury. The duty rate on spirits remains Â£28.74 per litre of pure alcohol. Of the Â£14.15 average price of a bottle of Scotch whisky, Â£10.41 is collected in tax through excise duty and VAT, the SWA said. Hundreds of thousands of private-sector contractors face higher tax and National Insurance (NI) bills from April 2020, after today's Budget. The crackdown is the biggest revenue-raising measure in this year's budget. Ian Hyde, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, says it's a ""huge cost burden"" and a ""significant shift of risk"" for businesses which rely on contractors. âMany contractors have highly specialised skills and
it is crucial that these skills can be easily circulated amongst businesses.
However, these new rules may result in businesses scaling back their use of
contractors, slowing this transfer of skills from one business to another. âThe ultimate winner from these new rules is HMRC
which will now have thousands of businesses doing their policing for them, but
at what cost?,"" he asks. Read more here Simon JackBBC Business Editor 2018
has been an annus horribilis for the high street. Many
high street retailers have cried foul in the face of new
competition from online firms that employ fewer staff and pay far lower
business rates. There
are two ways you can level the playing field. Cut
charges for the traditional retailers or increase them for online traders. Mr
Hammond has done a bit of both. He has spent Â£900m knocking a third off the business rates billof 500,000 small retailers. Very welcome to those who have
premises with a rateable value below Â£51k. Second
â he unveileda new Â£400m digital services taxto be levied on the tech
giants on the money they
make on digital services like advertising and streaming entertainment (but not
online sales). So will these two measures save the high
street? Probably not â at least not on their own. Read more here Mark Stokes at Deloitte has more exclusive analysis of today's Budget for the BBC: The Government will extend the stamp duty relief for first-time buyers to purchases of shared ownership properties worth up to Â£500,000. That means qualifying
purchasers will pay no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 paid on the purchase of their
home and 5% on the remainder up to the cap of Â£500,000. In welcome news for taxpayers who have bought homes that would have qualified
since the last Budget in November 2017, the rules will be backdated with
taxpayers able to claim a refund. A consultation will be published in January 2019 on the potential
introduction of a further 1% stamp duty charge on purchases of residential property
by non-UK residents. This follows significant changes to the taxation of
non-residents investing in UK residential real estate over recent years to
align their tax position with UK residents. The Budget offered nothing for those ""massacred"" by the Universal Credit welfare reforms, according to Frank Field, chair of the Commons' Work and Pensions Committee. He told the Commons cuts for families would get ""worse next year and worse the year after and worse the year after that"". He added: ""The Chancellor did make some very important additions to the Universal Credit Budget and I'm grateful, as all of us must be who've seen our constituents massacred by this benefit. ""But there are four big changes he has yet to announce if we are to be satisfied that the rollout of Universal Credit can roll out safely to every one of our constituents."" BBC World News Stephanie Flanders, former BBC economics correspondent and now a senior editor at Bloomberg, says the Prime Minister wanted ""a really big Budget"". But she points out that with the UK preparing to leave the EU on 29 March, that simply wasn't possible. ""It can't really be a watershed Budget, because we are months before this big question,"" she says. Philip Hammond didn't mention any negatives from Brexit, even going to far as to talk about a Brexit dividend, Ms Flanders adds.

Rory Cellan-JonesBBC technology correspondent Faced
with public anger over the low tax paid in the UK by the likes of Google,
Amazon and Facebook, the government has talked time and again of imposing some
kind of levy on the tech giants. The
problem has been designing it so that it doesn't stifle innovation from new
firms and coordinating action with other countries so that businesses aren't
put off investing in the UK. The
Chancellorâs solution is to target a Digital Services Tax at a narrow set of what
are described as digital business platform services - specifically search
engines, online marketplaces and social media firms. Which sounds like Google,
Amazon and Facebook. He
also makes it clear he hopes that by 2020 when the tax is due to be
introduced, a global agreement on a tax on digital turnover will have been
agreed. That
may be optimistic according to the trade body techUK, which warns that going it
alone would be costly. But
there is in any case still plenty to be sorted out about how the
new tax will work - and whether it can be as precisely targeted as the Treasury
seems to think. The Chancellor will be hoping that an international agreement rides to his rescue before the UK tax has to be imposed. BBC Radio 5 live Frank Jay owns a chilli shop in Leeds city centre. He tells BBC Radio 5 Live he is interested in the business rate relief announced by the chancellor for small retailers in England: ""I was pleasantly surprised. When I started the chilli shop, when we hit business rates, wow that was a big chunk of our income. And we were not getting anything from it - it was the difference between making the rent and not making the rent sometimes. ""So this has come as a big relief.  I'd prefer them to go further for small businesses to protect our high street, and go all the way and have [no business rates] for a couple of years, but yeah I'm much happier."" Anne Redston, professor of tax law at Kingâs College London, details two important changes in today's Budget relating to insolvent businesses: The Budget announced two important changes when businesses
are insolvent. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is an unsecured
creditor of an insolvent business, so is in the same position as anyone else
who is owed money by that business. But from April 2020, HMRC will be first in the queue, with a
priority right to recover any PAYE, employee national insurance contributions
(NICs), VAT and deductions made under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS). The governmentâs reasoning is that VAT, PAYE, employee NICs
and CIS are all money deducted from customers and employees, and held in trust
by the business. This new preferential creditor rule therefore does not apply
to corporation tax or employer NICs. The new rules will mean money is more likely to be
recovered from insolvent businesses than has been the
case - but it also means that other creditors will receive less. So if a
business goes bust which owes you money, you are likely to get back a lower
amount, or even nothing at all. And if it is your business that has gone bust, and you have
been involved in tax avoidance or evasion, or if you simply set up a new
business to replace the old (known as ""phoenixism"") HMRC will have the power to
collect the missing tax, NICs or VAT from you personally. It includes announcements on wages, mental health and universal credit. Here's what it means to you. It includes announcements on wages, mental health and universal credit. Here's what it means to you. What were the chancellor's most-used words in today's speech? The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has produced a rather handy word cloud to tell us. Unsurprisingly, deputy speaker, people and British all feature prominently. But rather oddly austerity doesn't seem to have made the cut. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Public spending will rise by Â£30bn by 2023-24 - a significant stimulus to be spent on the NHS and on raising the amount people can earn before they start paying tax. That is in sharp contrast to the five-year ""austerity"" plan announced in 2010, which saw cuts of 3% a year, and 2015, which included cuts of 1.3% a year. To pay for that, Mr Hammond will allow borrowing to to be sustained at about Â£20bn a year. Little talk today of ""balancing the books"" or the risk of a bad Brexit deal.

KKK display treated as 'hate incident'A report of a group dressed as Ku Klux Klan members in Newtownards is widely condemned.,"The picture was taken a few doors down from the Bangladesh Islamic Centre in Newtownards A report of a group of people dressed as Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members in Newtownards, County Down, is being treated by police as a hate crime. Pictures emerged of the group posing near an Islamic prayer house. The pictures were taken on Saturday night on Greenwell Street. The incident was reported to police at about 17:00 GMT on Sunday. Strangford MLAs have condemned the incident. PSNI Insp Richard Murray said: ""Hate crime, in all its forms, is totally unacceptable. The Chief Constable, George Hamilton, toldBBC NI's The Nolan Showthe incident was ""disgusting and distasteful"". ""There's no place for it anywhere in Northern Ireland. We will investigate it and report the evidence to the PPS,"" he added. This video can not be played A group of people dressed in KKK outfits in County Down BBC News NI has obtained footage of men dressed in KKK outfits in a JD Wetherspoon pub in the town. JD Wetherspoon spokesperson Eddie Gershon said the group was ""refused entry by door staff, but pushed past them into the pub"". He said: ""They were told by bar staff that they would not be served. They remained in the pub for five minutes, unserved, and then left."" Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said the picture of the people dressed as members of the white supremacist group was a ""clear demonstration of aggression"" and ""that is a hate crime."" The picture appears to have been taken a few doors down from the Bangladesh Islamic Centre in Newtownards. In August last year,a pig's head was left on the doorstep of the centre. DUP MLA Peter Weir tweeted that the pictures showed ""malevolent intent"". Ulster Unionist Mike Nesbitt tweeted he was ""disgusted"" and would pass the picture to the PSNI Chief Constable.

Belfast Islamic Centre executive treasurer Dr Raied Al-Wazzan said the small Muslim community in Newtownards had been left shaken by the incident. ""They could have gone to anywhere in Newtownards, anywhere in Northern Ireland dressing in any uniform, but to go in front of an Islamic prayer room, it's totally making people afraid,"" he told The Nolan Show. ""They are afraid to come out or even to go there."" Dr Al-Wazzan acknowledged that it could have been a Halloween prank, and called upon those involved to come forward and identify themselves. ""If they keep it quiet for the next 24 hours, that means it was a deliberate act,"" he said. ""If this is just a joke, these people should come forward and identify themselves. ""To go there specifically wearing that costume in front of the Islamic centre is not acceptable. It's similar to somebody wearing a Nazi uniform and going in front of a Jewish synagogue."" Belfast Islamic Centre executive treasurer Dr Raied Al-Wazzan said the small Muslim community in Newtownards had been left shaken One man, who did not want to be named, lives near a bar in Newtownards and told the BBC he saw the group go into it. ""We were disturbed by mens' voices. I looked out the blinds and saw men in KKK costumes. One was giving a fascist salute. They looked like proper KKK outfits - they had the flap that covers the face,"" he said. ""They were shouting and posing outside the pub. ""At about 02:00 GMT they came out of the bar so they had been allowed into it in their costumes. ""It's insensitive - it's not a laugh and it's not just about Halloween. ""Last year, a pig's head was thrown through the door of the Islamic centre. ""This is ethnically diverse town. What if a black family had been walking home from a Halloween party and been confronted with that? ""I was disgusted and also was saddened by the reaction on social media."" Ms Armstrong, who has an office near where the photographs are said to have been taken, said the KKK represented a ""brand of hatred not wanted or welcome in the area"". She told BBC's Good Morning Ulster that people in the area were ""disgusted"". ""They were people who purchased KKK robes,"" she said. ""They were wearing hoods and carrying crosses and they happened to go outside the Islamic prayer house, they were in bars in the town, expressing religious intolerance - and that's a hate crime. ""Some are saying this is just a Halloween jape. No it's not. Everyone knows what the KKK stands for"" she added.

Not known for humour - in public, at least - the chancellor managed to raise a few laughs during his Budget speech. Here's his best gags, courtesy of the Press Association. The last Budget to be held on a Monday was in 1962 and Mr Hammond said: ""I
was six years old, tensions between Russia and the United States were rising and
a former foreign secretary turned chancellor delivered a Budget amid Cabinet
revolt...  I could swear I remember my parents turning to me and saying:
'Philip, one day, that can be you'."" By holding the statement on Monday rather than the usual Wednesday, the chancellor said he avoided a Halloween Budget which could have produced ""Hammo
House of Horrors"" headlines. But ""I have not avoided the blood-curdling
threats, the anguished wailing, and the strange banging of furniture that's
usually associated with Wednesday - I have kindly been invited to a special
meeting of the 1922 Committee this evening"". In a display of toilet humour, the chancellor promised that councils can
""relieve themselves"" with a tax break on public lavatories, although he did
not want to get ""bogged down"" on the subject. It was, he noted, one of the few
announcements that had not ""leaked"". In a nod to Mr McDonnell's recent accident, suffered tripping over fly-tipped
waste, the chancellor promised cash to deal with the issue ""although I cannot
guarantee that Â£10m is going to be enough to stop him falling flat on his
face in the future"". After announcing plans for a Â£400m digital services tax, Mr Hammond
also managed a quick jibe at Sir Nick Clegg, who has taken a senior role with
Facebook, joking that ""I am already looking forward to my call from the former
leader of the Liberal Democrats"". Hidden in theBudget Red Book,external(on page 80!) is news of a new prize-linked saving scheme for credit unions. The Budget document said: ""Credit unions play an important role in
facilitating savings and offering affordable borrowing to their members. ""To help people increase
their financial resilience while boosting awareness and membership of these community
organisations, the Budget commits to launching a pilot of a new prize-linked saving scheme for
credit unions."" More details will follow - such as timings and amounts - but the Treasury presumably hopes it could be a boost  for the sector. Matt Bland of the Association of British Credit Unions told the BBC: ""We're excited by the announcement. Credit unions are all about encouraging people to save and prize-linked savings is an interesting way to encourage savers."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scotch Whisky Association said the Chancellor's decision to continue the freeze on spirits duty was a ""welcome show of support"" for the industry. The measure means the price of a typical bottle is 30p lower than if it had risen by inflation, according to the Treasury. The duty rate on spirits remains Â£28.74 per litre of pure alcohol. Of the Â£14.15 average price of a bottle of Scotch whisky, Â£10.41 is collected in tax through excise duty and VAT, the SWA said. Hundreds of thousands of private-sector contractors face higher tax and National Insurance (NI) bills from April 2020, after today's Budget. The crackdown is the biggest revenue-raising measure in this year's budget. Ian Hyde, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, says it's a ""huge cost burden"" and a ""significant shift of risk"" for businesses which rely on contractors. âMany contractors have highly specialised skills and
it is crucial that these skills can be easily circulated amongst businesses.
However, these new rules may result in businesses scaling back their use of
contractors, slowing this transfer of skills from one business to another. âThe ultimate winner from these new rules is HMRC
which will now have thousands of businesses doing their policing for them, but
at what cost?,"" he asks. Read more here Simon JackBBC Business Editor 2018
has been an annus horribilis for the high street. Many
high street retailers have cried foul in the face of new
competition from online firms that employ fewer staff and pay far lower
business rates. There
are two ways you can level the playing field. Cut
charges for the traditional retailers or increase them for online traders. Mr
Hammond has done a bit of both. He has spent Â£900m knocking a third off the business rates billof 500,000 small retailers. Very welcome to those who have
premises with a rateable value below Â£51k. Second
â he unveileda new Â£400m digital services taxto be levied on the tech
giants on the money they
make on digital services like advertising and streaming entertainment (but not
online sales). So will these two measures save the high
street? Probably not â at least not on their own. Read more here Mark Stokes at Deloitte has more exclusive analysis of today's Budget for the BBC: The Government will extend the stamp duty relief for first-time buyers to purchases of shared ownership properties worth up to Â£500,000. That means qualifying
purchasers will pay no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 paid on the purchase of their
home and 5% on the remainder up to the cap of Â£500,000. In welcome news for taxpayers who have bought homes that would have qualified
since the last Budget in November 2017, the rules will be backdated with
taxpayers able to claim a refund. A consultation will be published in January 2019 on the potential
introduction of a further 1% stamp duty charge on purchases of residential property
by non-UK residents. This follows significant changes to the taxation of
non-residents investing in UK residential real estate over recent years to
align their tax position with UK residents. The Budget offered nothing for those ""massacred"" by the Universal Credit welfare reforms, according to Frank Field, chair of the Commons' Work and Pensions Committee. He told the Commons cuts for families would get ""worse next year and worse the year after and worse the year after that"". He added: ""The Chancellor did make some very important additions to the Universal Credit Budget and I'm grateful, as all of us must be who've seen our constituents massacred by this benefit. ""But there are four big changes he has yet to announce if we are to be satisfied that the rollout of Universal Credit can roll out safely to every one of our constituents."" BBC World News Stephanie Flanders, former BBC economics correspondent and now a senior editor at Bloomberg, says the Prime Minister wanted ""a really big Budget"". But she points out that with the UK preparing to leave the EU on 29 March, that simply wasn't possible. ""It can't really be a watershed Budget, because we are months before this big question,"" she says. Philip Hammond didn't mention any negatives from Brexit, even going to far as to talk about a Brexit dividend, Ms Flanders adds.

Rory Cellan-JonesBBC technology correspondent Faced
with public anger over the low tax paid in the UK by the likes of Google,
Amazon and Facebook, the government has talked time and again of imposing some
kind of levy on the tech giants. The
problem has been designing it so that it doesn't stifle innovation from new
firms and coordinating action with other countries so that businesses aren't
put off investing in the UK. The
Chancellorâs solution is to target a Digital Services Tax at a narrow set of what
are described as digital business platform services - specifically search
engines, online marketplaces and social media firms. Which sounds like Google,
Amazon and Facebook. He
also makes it clear he hopes that by 2020 when the tax is due to be
introduced, a global agreement on a tax on digital turnover will have been
agreed. That
may be optimistic according to the trade body techUK, which warns that going it
alone would be costly. But
there is in any case still plenty to be sorted out about how the
new tax will work - and whether it can be as precisely targeted as the Treasury
seems to think. The Chancellor will be hoping that an international agreement rides to his rescue before the UK tax has to be imposed. BBC Radio 5 live Frank Jay owns a chilli shop in Leeds city centre. He tells BBC Radio 5 Live he is interested in the business rate relief announced by the chancellor for small retailers in England: ""I was pleasantly surprised. When I started the chilli shop, when we hit business rates, wow that was a big chunk of our income. And we were not getting anything from it - it was the difference between making the rent and not making the rent sometimes. ""So this has come as a big relief.  I'd prefer them to go further for small businesses to protect our high street, and go all the way and have [no business rates] for a couple of years, but yeah I'm much happier."" Anne Redston, professor of tax law at Kingâs College London, details two important changes in today's Budget relating to insolvent businesses: The Budget announced two important changes when businesses
are insolvent. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is an unsecured
creditor of an insolvent business, so is in the same position as anyone else
who is owed money by that business. But from April 2020, HMRC will be first in the queue, with a
priority right to recover any PAYE, employee national insurance contributions
(NICs), VAT and deductions made under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS). The governmentâs reasoning is that VAT, PAYE, employee NICs
and CIS are all money deducted from customers and employees, and held in trust
by the business. This new preferential creditor rule therefore does not apply
to corporation tax or employer NICs. The new rules will mean money is more likely to be
recovered from insolvent businesses than has been the
case - but it also means that other creditors will receive less. So if a
business goes bust which owes you money, you are likely to get back a lower
amount, or even nothing at all. And if it is your business that has gone bust, and you have
been involved in tax avoidance or evasion, or if you simply set up a new
business to replace the old (known as ""phoenixism"") HMRC will have the power to
collect the missing tax, NICs or VAT from you personally. It includes announcements on wages, mental health and universal credit. Here's what it means to you. It includes announcements on wages, mental health and universal credit. Here's what it means to you. What were the chancellor's most-used words in today's speech? The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has produced a rather handy word cloud to tell us. Unsurprisingly, deputy speaker, people and British all feature prominently.

Public spending will rise by Â£30bn by 2023-24 - a significant stimulus to be spent on the NHS and on raising the amount people can earn before they start paying tax. That is in sharp contrast to the five-year ""austerity"" plan announced in 2010, which saw cuts of 3% a year, and 2015, which included cuts of 1.3% a year. To pay for that, Mr Hammond will allow borrowing to to be sustained at about Â£20bn a year. Little talk today of ""balancing the books"" or the risk of a bad Brexit deal.

More students seek help for mental health,"The number of students seeking mental health support while studying at university has increased by more than 50% in five years, analysis suggests. The BBC asked universities across the UK for the numbers of students seeking some form of support. The National Union of Students said young people were under increasing pressure to perform. The Department for Education said universities needed to provide pastoral care for students. In August, a pre-inquest hearing into the death of a vulnerable student at Bristol University heard she did not receive well-being support. Natasha Abrahart, 20, is one of 11 students at the university to die since October 2016. The university later issued a statement, saying it had made offers of support towards Ms Abrahart. Students tell of mental health experiences Huge rise in students in Scotland seeking mental health support Mental illness: Why help ends at a milestone birthday This video can not be played Mental health at university: Stress made me anxious Christian Frank, from the University of Birmingham, said: ""Universities are just accepted by students to be a hotbed for stress and anxiety. The drinking culture at university allowed me to hide away, numbing my pain and normalising being exhausted in the day and hyperactive at night. ""I'd been ill throughout the course and talked to the extenuating circumstances officer about how many lectures I'd missed but my anxiety was too high to admit that I had a problem. ""By admitting to someone at the university, I'm telling them that I feel like I'm not good enough to finish a course I signed up for. This means there's a lot of shame attached to asking for help."" Will said he started positively but found it tough being away Will had gone to university feeling ""quite positive"" but found his mental health deteriorated during the first term. He admitted things had been tough, being away from his family, and because he had not immediately ""found his feet"" by joining societies and making friends. Will said the idea of seeking help with mental health issues was not easy. ""On the university mental health counselling website there is a form you fill out that ranks your answers from not at all to very likely - there are a lot of very triggering questions. ""[But it] felt like almost immediately you opened it there's less of a chance you are going to get in because there will be people filling it in as 'likely' for every single thing."" Two months after completing the form he was emailed to say he had not been accepted for one-on-one counselling. ""I'm feeling better now but was definitely in a worse place after the experience of not getting help,"" he said. ""It's something the uni needs to focus on... and make more personal."" Kayleigh, from the University of Bristol, said: ""A friend of mine was suicidal at uni. We got him referred to the university counselling service but he was on a long waiting list. They suggested he talk to a tutor and maybe if he'd done that he would have got counselling sooner but he was so stressed about the course that he didn't want to. It was really hard to get anyone to take any notice. ""One night he was threatening suicide, I took him to A&E and they sent him home. I didn't know what to do so my mum sent the vice chancellor a very angry email, basically saying, if he dies, it's on your hands. The next day, uni mental health services got in touch and referred him to an emergency external counselling service. ""He ended up dropping out and is much healthier and happier but the uni really should have dealt with it better. Especially since Bristol is in the news about high suicide rates - he could very easily have been another."" Of 83 universities that provided five years of full data from 2012 to 2017, the number of students seeking help rose from 50,900 to 78,100.  The number of students going to university dropped slightly over the same period. At the same time, budgets towards mental health services increased by more than 40%. Eva Crossan Jory, the NUS Vice President, said: ""There is a growth in demand [for mental health services] over the last decade, in part, because the reality of studying in the UK has changed so much. ""Many are balancing work, study and caring responsibilities. With fees so high, and the job market so competitive, students feel they have to continually push themselves, perhaps more so than before."" Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: ""University is supposed to be an assault on the senses. It should be demanding and disorientating, and with that should come adequate pastoral care for studentsâ. ""This does not mean mollycoddling or cushioning students from the experiences that are part and parcel of university life, it means making sure support services are available if they need them."" A University of Bristol spokesperson said it had adopted a university-wide approach to identify vulnerable students as early as possible and get them the right support.

Breaking|Breaking newsMerkel 'to abandon key party role'Germany's Angela Merkel has told her CDU party's leaders she will not run for re-election as chairwoman - sources.Europe,"Mrs Merkel has led the CDU party for 18 years German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed she will not run for re-election as its chairwoman in December. Her decision comes after her party suffered heavy losses in regional elections that threatened the stability of the governing coalition. Mrs Merkel has been chair of the CDU since 2000, becoming one of its longest-serving chairpersons. She has led Germany as chancellor since 2005 - and wants to stay in that post. However, news of Mrs Merkel decision could spark a race within the CDU to find her successor as chancellor. The position is usually determined in Germany's federal elections, the next of which are provisionally scheduled for 2021. Mrs Merkel has reportedly told leaders of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party that she will step aside from the leadership election bid afterthe centre-right party and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) both took a hit in ballots in Hesse stateat the weekend. However, she said that she would like to remain in the post of Germany's chancellor until 2021, local media report. This would be in contrast to Mrs Merkel's previous position, in which she has linked the party leadership role to the chancellorship - meaning that she would only remain chancellor if she was party leader. One attendee at Mrs Merkel's announcement told AFP she said this would be ""her last term"". The source said Mrs Merkel ""was genuinely sad and not at all bitter"" - and that she received a standing ovation. Angela Merkel's leadership woes Germany's marriage of convenience Jenny Hill, BBC Berlin correspondent Predicting the political demise of Angela Merkel has become almost a national sport. Today Germany's battle-scarred leader has herself formally marked what might be termed the beginning of the end. Mrs Merkel has always said that she could only be chancellor if she also held the role of party leader. Her willingness now to give up the latter is intended to silence critics in her party but it also reflects her dwindling grip on power. Much depends on her successor as party leader. If it's a loyalist, Germany might witness a smooth transition to a new chancellor, possibly allowing Mrs Merkel to see out her term. But the vultures are circling. Already an old rival, Friedrich Merz has announced his candidacy. If one of her political adversaries prevails as party leader, Mrs Merkel's chancellorship becomes uncomfortable and possibly untenable. Mrs Merkel, the country's first female chancellor, rose to power on the image of a prudent and pragmatic leader. It was, however, her open-door refugee policy that sparked public concern and helped fuel parties like the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Angela Merkel's quiet power The Greens have also grown in national support. This video can not be played How Angela Merkel rose to power to lead Germany Mrs Merkel's migration policy has exposed the fragility of her divided coalition government - and even within her own political group. Sexual assaults by migrants in Cologne and Islamist attacks in Germany all dented the chancellor's popularity. Mrs Merkel has stopped short of admitting making a mistake, but has said ""if I could, I would turn back the clock many years"" to prepare Germany better for the influx of arrivals. Among the potential candidates are ambitious Health Minister Jens Spahn; the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet; and the woman seen as Mrs Merkel's anointed heir, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. Following news of Mrs Merkel's decision on Monday, former CDU parliamentary group leader Friedrich Merz indicated that he wanted to join the race for party leadership, Reuters news agency reports.

Blow for Merkel in German electionThe main parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition lose votes in a regional election in Hesse.Europe,"The Greens saw their share of the vote rise substantially to 19.5% Both the parties in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition have suffered heavy losses in a regional election, early results show. Her centre-right CDU party and the centre-left SPD were each 10% down on the previous election in Hesse state. SPD leader Andrea Nahles said the federal government's poor performance had ""significantly"" contributed to the disappointing result. She told reporters the state of the government was ""unacceptable"". The federal government must find a ""reasonable way of working"", after what looks to be the SPD's worst result in the western state since 1946. The CDU must agree to a ""clear, binding roadmap"" ahead of a scheduled coalition review next year. ""Then we'll be able to check whether this government is still the right place for us,"" she said. Germany's marriage of convenience Angela Merkel's leadership woes Both the CDU and the SPD have seen their support slip nationally in recent months, and the coalition has already come close to collapse. ""The message to the parties ruling in Berlin is people want fewer disputes and more focus on the important issues,"" state premier and CDU member Volker Bouffier told supporters. Meanwhile the left-leaning Greens surged into third place in the Hesse regional government, with about 19.5%. And the far-right AfD will enter the regional assembly for the first time, having secured about 12% of the vote. The CDU still came first, but with a heavily reduced vote share Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - 27.9% (down from 38.3%) Social Democratic Party (SPD) - 19.9% (down from 30.7%) Green Party - 19.5% (up from 11.1%) Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) - 12% Free Democrats (FDP) - 7.5% (up from 5%) Hesse's election comes just weeks afterMrs Merkel's Bavarian sister party suffered huge losses in a state parliament vote. Parties like the AfD and the Greens have grown in national support following Germany's 2017 general election, as support for the major centre parties has waned. And with the CDU's party conference scheduled for December, Mrs Merkel could lose her leadership re-election bid. She has said previously she could not continue as chancellor - a position she has held for 13 years - were she to lose that role. By Jenny Hill, BBC's Berlin correspondent It's been a bruising evening for Angela Merkel. Her party has lost significant support in the wealthy state of Hesse, home to the financial centre of Frankfurt. The result is widely interpreted not as a rejection of local politicians but rather a protest against Mrs Merkel's unhappy coalition government in Berlin. The losses are undoubtedly ammunition for critics in her party who want rid of Mrs Merkel. But she may face a more immediate problem. Her Social Democrat coalition partners are in electoral freefall, haemorrhaging support at federal level. The SPD's poor performance tonight in Hesse follows a drubbing in Bavaria two weeks ago. Many in the party blame the controversial coalition with Mrs Merkel's conservatives. The SPD's leaders may decide to pull out of the alliance and bring down her fragile government. Germans are calling this a 'schicksalswahl', or vote of destiny. It may yet seal the fate of this country's government - and perhaps even its leader.

also managed a quick jibe at Sir Nick Clegg, who has taken a senior role with
Facebook, joking that ""I am already looking forward to my call from the former
leader of the Liberal Democrats"". Hidden in theBudget Red Book,external(on page 80!) is news of a new prize-linked saving scheme for credit unions. The Budget document said: ""Credit unions play an important role in
facilitating savings and offering affordable borrowing to their members. ""To help people increase
their financial resilience while boosting awareness and membership of these community
organisations, the Budget commits to launching a pilot of a new prize-linked saving scheme for
credit unions."" More details will follow - such as timings and amounts - but the Treasury presumably hopes it could be a boost  for the sector. Matt Bland of the Association of British Credit Unions told the BBC: ""We're excited by the announcement. Credit unions are all about encouraging people to save and prize-linked savings is an interesting way to encourage savers."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scotch Whisky Association said the Chancellor's decision to continue the freeze on spirits duty was a ""welcome show of support"" for the industry. The measure means the price of a typical bottle is 30p lower than if it had risen by inflation, according to the Treasury. The duty rate on spirits remains Â£28.74 per litre of pure alcohol. Of the Â£14.15 average price of a bottle of Scotch whisky, Â£10.41 is collected in tax through excise duty and VAT, the SWA said. Hundreds of thousands of private-sector contractors face higher tax and National Insurance (NI) bills from April 2020, after today's Budget. The crackdown is the biggest revenue-raising measure in this year's budget. Ian Hyde, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, says it's a ""huge cost burden"" and a ""significant shift of risk"" for businesses which rely on contractors. âMany contractors have highly specialised skills and
it is crucial that these skills can be easily circulated amongst businesses.
However, these new rules may result in businesses scaling back their use of
contractors, slowing this transfer of skills from one business to another. âThe ultimate winner from these new rules is HMRC
which will now have thousands of businesses doing their policing for them, but
at what cost?,"" he asks. Read more here Simon JackBBC Business Editor 2018
has been an annus horribilis for the high street. Many
high street retailers have cried foul in the face of new
competition from online firms that employ fewer staff and pay far lower
business rates. There
are two ways you can level the playing field. Cut
charges for the traditional retailers or increase them for online traders. Mr
Hammond has done a bit of both. He has spent Â£900m knocking a third off the business rates billof 500,000 small retailers. Very welcome to those who have
premises with a rateable value below Â£51k. Second
â he unveileda new Â£400m digital services taxto be levied on the tech
giants on the money they
make on digital services like advertising and streaming entertainment (but not
online sales). So will these two measures save the high
street? Probably not â at least not on their own. Read more here Mark Stokes at Deloitte has more exclusive analysis of today's Budget for the BBC: The Government will extend the stamp duty relief for first-time buyers to purchases of shared ownership properties worth up to Â£500,000. That means qualifying
purchasers will pay no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 paid on the purchase of their
home and 5% on the remainder up to the cap of Â£500,000. In welcome news for taxpayers who have bought homes that would have qualified
since the last Budget in November 2017, the rules will be backdated with
taxpayers able to claim a refund. A consultation will be published in January 2019 on the potential
introduction of a further 1% stamp duty charge on purchases of residential property
by non-UK residents. This follows significant changes to the taxation of
non-residents investing in UK residential real estate over recent years to
align their tax position with UK residents. The Budget offered nothing for those ""massacred"" by the Universal Credit welfare reforms, according to Frank Field, chair of the Commons' Work and Pensions Committee. He told the Commons cuts for families would get ""worse next year and worse the year after and worse the year after that"". He added: ""The Chancellor did make some very important additions to the Universal Credit Budget and I'm grateful, as all of us must be who've seen our constituents massacred by this benefit. ""But there are four big changes he has yet to announce if we are to be satisfied that the rollout of Universal Credit can roll out safely to every one of our constituents."" BBC World News Stephanie Flanders, former BBC economics correspondent and now a senior editor at Bloomberg, says the Prime Minister wanted ""a really big Budget"". But she points out that with the UK preparing to leave the EU on 29 March, that simply wasn't possible. ""It can't really be a watershed Budget, because we are months before this big question,"" she says. Philip Hammond didn't mention any negatives from Brexit, even going to far as to talk about a Brexit dividend, Ms Flanders adds.

Rory Cellan-JonesBBC technology correspondent Faced
with public anger over the low tax paid in the UK by the likes of Google,
Amazon and Facebook, the government has talked time and again of imposing some
kind of levy on the tech giants. The
problem has been designing it so that it doesn't stifle innovation from new
firms and coordinating action with other countries so that businesses aren't
put off investing in the UK. The
Chancellorâs solution is to target a Digital Services Tax at a narrow set of what
are described as digital business platform services - specifically search
engines, online marketplaces and social media firms. Which sounds like Google,
Amazon and Facebook. He
also makes it clear he hopes that by 2020 when the tax is due to be
introduced, a global agreement on a tax on digital turnover will have been
agreed. That
may be optimistic according to the trade body techUK, which warns that going it
alone would be costly. But
there is in any case still plenty to be sorted out about how the
new tax will work - and whether it can be as precisely targeted as the Treasury
seems to think. The Chancellor will be hoping that an international agreement rides to his rescue before the UK tax has to be imposed. BBC Radio 5 live Frank Jay owns a chilli shop in Leeds city centre. He tells BBC Radio 5 Live he is interested in the business rate relief announced by the chancellor for small retailers in England: ""I was pleasantly surprised. When I started the chilli shop, when we hit business rates, wow that was a big chunk of our income. And we were not getting anything from it - it was the difference between making the rent and not making the rent sometimes. ""So this has come as a big relief.  I'd prefer them to go further for small businesses to protect our high street, and go all the way and have [no business rates] for a couple of years, but yeah I'm much happier."" Anne Redston, professor of tax law at Kingâs College London, details two important changes in today's Budget relating to insolvent businesses: The Budget announced two important changes when businesses
are insolvent. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is an unsecured
creditor of an insolvent business, so is in the same position as anyone else
who is owed money by that business. But from April 2020, HMRC will be first in the queue, with a
priority right to recover any PAYE, employee national insurance contributions
(NICs), VAT and deductions made under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS). The governmentâs reasoning is that VAT, PAYE, employee NICs
and CIS are all money deducted from customers and employees, and held in trust
by the business. This new preferential creditor rule therefore does not apply
to corporation tax or employer NICs. The new rules will mean money is more likely to be
recovered from insolvent businesses than has been the
case - but it also means that other creditors will receive less. So if a
business goes bust which owes you money, you are likely to get back a lower
amount, or even nothing at all. And if it is your business that has gone bust, and you have
been involved in tax avoidance or evasion, or if you simply set up a new
business to replace the old (known as ""phoenixism"") HMRC will have the power to
collect the missing tax, NICs or VAT from you personally. It includes announcements on wages, mental health and universal credit. Here's what it means to you. It includes announcements on wages, mental health and universal credit. Here's what it means to you. What were the chancellor's most-used words in today's speech? The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has produced a rather handy word cloud to tell us. Unsurprisingly, deputy speaker, people and British all feature prominently.

Public spending will rise by Â£30bn by 2023-24 - a significant stimulus to be spent on the NHS and on raising the amount people can earn before they start paying tax. That is in sharp contrast to the five-year ""austerity"" plan announced in 2010, which saw cuts of 3% a year, and 2015, which included cuts of 1.3% a year. To pay for that, Mr Hammond will allow borrowing to to be sustained at about Â£20bn a year. Little talk today of ""balancing the books"" or the risk of a bad Brexit deal.

The chancellor had been under pressure from Labour and some Tory MPs to put more money into universal credit, amid warnings it could push people into destitution. He announced an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments, which will replace six in-work benefits, and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year. He claimed the changes - reversing cuts made in previous Budgets - would make 2.4 million working people and people with disabilities Â£630 a year better off. Labour said the entire Budget should be voted down unless the government agreed to halt the roll-out of universal credit.

However, Downing Street has said all spending plans in this Budget will go ahead ""irrespective"" of Brexit. The big long-term spending decisions will be made next year, after Britain's scheduled departure from the EU. Mr Hammond said overall spending would go up by 1.2% over the next five years. But Treasury officials said this was not a guide to next year's spending review because more money could be available if the UK gets a deal with the EU. And, they added, there was Â£4.2bn in reserve for a no-deal scenario so it was likely spending would go up whatever happened, although the 1.2% figure included the extra money for the NHS. Mr Hammond has said his Budget was based on the assumption of an ""average-type free trade deal"" being agreed between the UK and the EU. He said he was holding back some ""fiscal"" headroom in case he needed to alter his economic plan if Britain leaves the EU without a deal - but that a Brexit agreement with Brussels would result in a ""deal dividend"" for the economy.

Blow for Merkel in German election,"The Greens saw their share of the vote rise substantially to 19.5% Both the parties in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition have suffered heavy losses in a regional election, early results show. Her centre-right CDU party and the centre-left SPD were each 10% down on the previous election in Hesse state. SPD leader Andrea Nahles said the federal government's poor performance had ""significantly"" contributed to the disappointing result. She told reporters the state of the government was ""unacceptable"". The federal government must find a ""reasonable way of working"", after what looks to be the SPD's worst result in the western state since 1946. The CDU must agree to a ""clear, binding roadmap"" ahead of a scheduled coalition review next year. ""Then we'll be able to check whether this government is still the right place for us,"" she said. Germany's marriage of convenience Angela Merkel's leadership woes Both the CDU and the SPD have seen their support slip nationally in recent months, and the coalition has already come close to collapse. ""The message to the parties ruling in Berlin is people want fewer disputes and more focus on the important issues,"" state premier and CDU member Volker Bouffier told supporters. Meanwhile the left-leaning Greens surged into third place in the Hesse regional government, with about 19.5%. And the far-right AfD will enter the regional assembly for the first time, having secured about 12% of the vote. The CDU still came first, but with a heavily reduced vote share Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - 27.9% (down from 38.3%) Social Democratic Party (SPD) - 19.9% (down from 30.7%) Green Party - 19.5% (up from 11.1%) Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) - 12% Free Democrats (FDP) - 7.5% (up from 5%) Hesse's election comes just weeks afterMrs Merkel's Bavarian sister party suffered huge losses in a state parliament vote. Parties like the AfD and the Greens have grown in national support following Germany's 2017 general election, as support for the major centre parties has waned. And with the CDU's party conference scheduled for December, Mrs Merkel could lose her leadership re-election bid. She has said previously she could not continue as chancellor - a position she has held for 13 years - were she to lose that role. By Jenny Hill, BBC's Berlin correspondent It's been a bruising evening for Angela Merkel. Her party has lost significant support in the wealthy state of Hesse, home to the financial centre of Frankfurt. The result is widely interpreted not as a rejection of local politicians but rather a protest against Mrs Merkel's unhappy coalition government in Berlin. The losses are undoubtedly ammunition for critics in her party who want rid of Mrs Merkel. But she may face a more immediate problem. Her Social Democrat coalition partners are in electoral freefall, haemorrhaging support at federal level. The SPD's poor performance tonight in Hesse follows a drubbing in Bavaria two weeks ago. Many in the party blame the controversial coalition with Mrs Merkel's conservatives. The SPD's leaders may decide to pull out of the alliance and bring down her fragile government. Germans are calling this a 'schicksalswahl', or vote of destiny. It may yet seal the fate of this country's government - and perhaps even its leader.

Lil Wayne necklace pays student's uni feesDisqualified race winner 'can run again'PC told public how to save his lifeSpectacular sunsets light up UK skies,"An art student who made a solid gold necklace for Lil Wayne has said the sale helped pay for her course fees. Joy Bonfield-Colombara, 29, from south-east London, said she was struggling to pay her Â£9,500-a-year course fees at the prestigious Royal College of Art. But just as she was considering dropping out, she received an email from a friend of the US rapper who wanted to buy him a birthday present. The 18-carat gold pendant is in the shape of Lil Wayne's face. It features two diamonds for the Lollipop singer's famous teardrop tattoos, which represent the deaths of people in his family. Lil Wayne's latest album Tha Carter V, which features collaborations with Snoop Dogg, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott and Kendrick Lamar, reached number five in the UK charts this month. Artist Joy BC said Lil Wayne's friend told her: ""He absolutely loves it"" Ms Bonfield-Colombara, who goes by the name Joy BC, said she was ""freaking out"" when she was told who the commission - which she said was for ""thousands"" of pounds - was for. ""I was about to say 'no, I'm really sort of trying to figure out stuff with school'. They then said it's for my friend's birthday and told me who the friend was,"" she said. ""I listened to hip hop from a young age. I used to listen to him in the club!"" She said she had two to three weeks to complete the order in time for Lil Wayne's 36th birthday. Lil Wayne, wearing the necklace in New Orleans earlier this month, also wears it in his new music video Uproar ""I phoned my boyfriend and said I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out,"" she said. ""I hand carve everything, it takes me a really long time. One piece I made for someone took nine months. ""My boyfriend was like you can't do a Ronaldo on him,"" she said, referring toa bronze bust of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo that was mocked on social media. ""He said 'it's got to look like him, you can't make an awful portrait'."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Ms Bonfield-Colombara, who previously studied at Glasgow School of Art, said she had been applying for help with her course fees. ""My mum took out a bank loan and I got a government loan for living expenses which I had to use on my fees. ""I was thinking I can't afford this. The whole time I was questioning whether I should do it. But I'm really enjoying the course. ""I needed to find close to Â£10,000. I did a GoFundMe page and managed to raise Â£1,500 through that. Then I got this email. I couldn't believe it."" Although the commission - which she said cost ""thousands"" - does not cover all of her fees, she said it pays for a ""chunk"".

Disqualified race winner 'can run again'PC told public how to save his lifeSpectacular sunsets light up UK skies,"Jack Gray said he knew of others who had swapped places, but thinks he was singled out because he won A half marathon winner, who was then disqualified, has been invited back for next year's event - as long as he does not run under his boss's name again. Jack Gray, 25, took the place of his injured boss Andrew Rawlings at March's Cambridge Half Marathon and finished first,but fell foul of the rules. Race director Adam Moffat said they would ""welcome"" Mr Gray back. But Mr Gray said he was ""undecided"" and may prioritise other races as he seeks international selection. The transport planner beat more than 7,000 runners to win in his first half marathon, and came within a minute of the course record with a time of 66 minutes and 52 seconds. Jack Gray (circled in red), won the race but was disqualified, and Will Mycroft (in green) was declared the winner When he finished he heard the name ""Andrew Rawlings"" ringing out over the public address system, and told organisers who he really was. Sheffield student William Mycroft, who came second, was then declared the winner. Mr Gray said there were two different races he was considering next year - one on the same weekend as the Cambridge race and one the week after - that were ""important for international selection"". He said his aim was to run the marathon at the Commonwealth Games in his home city of Birmingham in 2022. ""It's a long shot but it's too tempting not to have a crack,"" he said.

PC told public how to save his lifeSpectacular sunsets light up UK skies,"This video can not be played Tom Dorman received many messages of support from colleagues, and kept his sense of humour A police officer has described how he asked members of the public to put a tourniquet on his leg to prevent him from bleeding to death. PC Tom Dorman had his leg amputated after a car crash in Maidenhead, Berkshire, in September. He said members of the public ""ran out of their homes"" to stop ""catastrophic"" bleeding in his leg, which meant he could have ""died within two minutes"". Two men have been arrested in connection with the collision. PC Dorman, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, was in a stationary vehicle which wasstruck by a silver Ford Focus at 05:30 BST on 2 September. He said the ""loud bang"" of the crash caused people to wake up and come out of their homes to his aid. ""I managed to explain, somehow, to someone, how to improvise a tourniquet, that they could tie round and keep pulling to slow the bleeding in the wound and close up the artery,"" he said. Tom Dorman was working the night shift when he was involved in a crash which led to the amputation of his leg Not being able to remember who applied the tourniquet, he said ""a jumper was used to at least stem the flow"", although he had ""no idea where it came from"". ""To everyone else who helped, I owe you my life, and I'm very thankful to them,"" PC Dorman said. ""I'm effectively the luckiest person in the world."" After nearly ten hours of surgery, he woke up to be told he had lost the lower half of his left leg. ""If blankness could be an emotion, that would describe how I would feel. I've never had such life changing news like that,"" he said. PC Dorman has started to learn to walk again, and hopes to be back at work within a year PC Dorman was discharged from hospital on 4 October, having had four operations, but adapting to life with one leg has been a ""new learning curve"".
