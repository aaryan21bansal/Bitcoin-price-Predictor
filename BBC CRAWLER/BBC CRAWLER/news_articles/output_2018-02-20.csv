Sick toddlerâs life support âcan endâ,"Alfie Evans suffers from an undiagnosed neurological degenerative condition Doctors can stop providing life support to toddler Alfie Evans against his parents' wishes, the High Court has ruled. Alder Hey Children's Hospital argued that continuing to treat the 21-month-old, who has a mystery illness, was ""unkind, unfair and inhumane"". His parents Tom Evans and Kate James had hoped to prolong Alfie's life with treatment at a hospital in Rome. Mr Justice Hayden said Alfie requires ""peace, quiet and privacy"". This video can not be played Alfie Evans' father Tom Evans: ""I'm not giving up"" The hospital is set to withdraw ventilation on Friday. His mother left the court hearing before the ruling while his father broke down as the decision was announced. About 30 supporters of the family's campaign had gathered outside Alder Hey as the decision about his treatment was delivered. The conclusion was made after a hearing at Liverpool Civil and Family Court earlier this month was told Alfie was in a ""semi-vegetative state"". He has a degenerative neurological condition doctors had not definitively diagnosed, the court heard. Supporters had gathered outside Alder Hey Children's Hospital Mr Justice Hayden said he accepted medical evidence which showed further treatment was futile, adding: ""Alfie's need now is for good quality palliative care."" Delivering the ruling in the High Court in London, he said he had reached his conclusion with great sadness. He paid tribute to Alfie's parents and the staff at Alder Hey. After the decision, Mr Evans said: ""I need time to reflect on the judgement"" while supporters of Alfie's campaign stood in silence wiping away tears and hugging each other. Tom Evans and Kate James believe Alfie responds to them The family is considering whether to appeal. In a statement, Alder Hey Children's Hospital said it will continue to work with Alfie's family to agree the ""most appropriate"" palliative care plan for him during a ""very difficult time"". It said it always aims to reach an agreement with parents about care plans. ""Unfortunately there are sometimes rare situations such as this where agreement cannot be reached and the treating team believe that continued active treatment is not in a child's best interests."" The hospital had referred the case to the High Court to determine what treatment would be in Alfie's best interests.

Trump pushes for ban on modified guns,"This video can not be played Trump signs an order on gun 'bump stocks' US President Donald Trump has signed an order to ban bump-stock devices, which were used by a gunman who killed 58 Las Vegas concert-goers last year. Such devices enable a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute. Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump said he had directed the justice department to propose a law to make the accessories illegal. The gun control debate took on a new urgency after17 people were killed at a school in Florida last week. Six radical ways to stop US school shootings West Point admits murdered Florida hero Mourners attended the funeral of Florida victim Peter Wang, 15, on Tuesday Students and parents affected by the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are planning a demonstration in the state capital of Tallahassee on Wednesday. Some of them arrived on Tuesday in time to see the state legislature reject a proposed ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines. However it will consider a package of more limited gun restrictions. By Paul Blake, BBC News, South Florida These Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students boarded a bus in Coral Springs In all around 100 students, spread across three buses, made the journey of more than seven hours to the state capital. For many of these students, it is their first time to the capitol building in Tallahassee - much less to lobby their lawmakers over a national issue. There is an excitement among the students, who sense that they may be on the cusp of starting a national movement. ""We're travelling to our state capital to make sure that none of these people that we grew up with - that we've known our whole lives - die in vain,"" Julia Salomone, 18, said confidently. So how do the students expect the politicians to receive them? ""Honestly, I feel like they're gonna be overwhelmed by us because they're going to see in our faces our determination, our commitment to this, because this is all we're fighting for right now,"" 16-year-old Rain Valladares said. ""They're gonna look us in the face and see that we're not gonna back down."" Clooneys make pledge to gun reform march 'Counting every school shooting so it never seems normal' At an event on Tuesday recognising the bravery of law enforcement, Mr Trump said he had directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to finalise new guidelines to declare bump stocks illegal ""very soon"". ""The key in all of these efforts, as I said in my remarks the day after the shooting, is that we cannot merely take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference, we must actually make a difference,"" he said. ""We must move past clichÃ©s and tired debates, and focus on evidence-based solutions and security measures that actually work and that make it easier for men and women of law enforcement to protect our children and protect our safety."" This video can not be played A guide to the weapons available in the US and the rate at which they fire The accessories can make semi-automatic rifles fire as rapidly as machine guns. They can be bought for as little as $100 (Â£70) without the need for a criminal background check. The device was used by Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old gambler, who rained bullets on the crowd at an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in October. More than 500 people were also injured in that attack, considered America's worst ever mass-shooting by a lone gunman. Audio analysis found Paddock had been able to fire 90 bullets within 10 seconds from his room in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Should US gun raffles be cancelled? America's gun culture in 10 charts Both Democrats and Republicans agreed in the nationwide wave of horror following the Las Vegas attack that the sale of bump stocks should be outlawed. This video can not be played What gunfire tells us about weapons used However, a bill introduced to ban bump stocks, trigger cranks and other devices that can speed up a semi-automatic rifle's rate of fire has since stalled. In December, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives began considering a regulation for bump stocks, opening a process that drew more than 35,000 public comments. Proposals to ban bump stocks have been put forward with mixed results at state level, including in South Carolina, Illinois, Washington and Colorado. Previous efforts to introduce gun control measures in the wake of mass shootings in recent years have gone nowhere in the US Congress. This video can not be played As a gunman opened fire in a Florida high school, students inside reached for their phones. On Tuesday, the White House signalled it was open to an age limit for people buying AR-15-type assault rifles, like the one used in the Florida shooting. ""I think that's certainly something that's on the table for us to discuss and that we expect to come up over the next couple of weeks,"" said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, when asked about a possible age requirement. The age limit in most US states for buying an AR-15 is 18. This video can not be played What has Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Over the weekend, Mr Trump said he wassupportive of a bipartisan bill that seeks to improve the checks in place before someone can buy a gun. Allow Twitter content?

That legislation intends to patch holes in the FBI's background check System, which processed more than 25 million gun ownership applications last year. Failures in that database were exposed by the Florida shooting, allegedly committed by a 19-year-old gunman with a history of mental health issues. Bump stocks were not used in that attack. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBCNews,Washington Whether the bureaucratic review process just initiated by the president will amount to a comprehensive ban on bump stocks depends very much on how the yet-to-be-written regulation is crafted. Still, it is the closest the Trump administration has come to new firearm regulation after multiple mass shootings - and, perhaps, a reflection of the new pressure the president is feeling on the gun issue. Congress, of course, could have stepped in at any point in the five months since the Las Vegas massacre and banned bump stocks without this contorted bureaucratic process. The National Rifle Association, however, is not keen on seeing a bipartisan coalition forming to enact any kind of new federal gun control laws. The question now is whether Mr Trump's move relieves the pressure to ""do something"" after Florida. If the past is any guide, attention will fade and the drive to enact new legislation will slow.

Disputed Stormont 'deal' pages leaked,"There has been a 13-month political stalemate in Northern Ireland A leaked copy of the draft agreement being worked on by Northern Ireland's two main parties, before power sharing talks broke down, has been published. The Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn FÃ©in disagree on whether or not a deal was on the table beforethe latest round of talks collapsed last week. Sinn FÃ©in said it included an Irish language act,an Ulster Scots act, and respecting language and diversity act. The DUP said the published papers did not ""undermine anything"" it had said. Broadcaster Eamonn Mallie has published 13 pages of adraft document on his website,external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He says: ""On page 5 under the heading: Respecting Languages and Culture, there is specific reference to the Irish (Respecting Language and Diversity) Bill and the Ulster Scots (Respecting Language and Diversity) Bill and a Respecting Language and Diversity Bill. ""It has to be stated that square brackets obtain in this eight-line paragraph - meaning it had not yet been signed off and agreed."" Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide NI Assembly divided by Irish language What is direct rule? Journalist Brian Rowan, who worked alongside Mr Mallie on the leaked document, told BBC NI's Spotlight programme that at no stage during the negotiations was there a ""done deal"". However, he said he had seen correspondence between senior members of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in under the heading ""draft agreement text"". There were ""presentational"" issues over the language bills, he suggested, with Sinn FÃ©in viewing them as stand-alone acts but the DUP seeing them as a package. Mr Rowan said these presentational issues were contained within square brackets within the draft document, as they were ""matters still to be resolved... particularly around how they would be presented by the two parties"". ""We were at the 59th minute of the 11th hour and someone panicked,"" he said. ""Someone took cold feet and this thing got unpicked."" The papers show that DUP leader Arlene Foster would have been first minister in the event of an agreement. They also suggest that a longer time to resolve differences had been allocated in the eventuality that the executive would collapse again. This would see an initial period of six weeks, and an additional period of 18 weeks for parties, in which parties could attempt to resolve future issues. Therefore, avoiding the immediate dissolution of the assembly that happened whenMartin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in January 2017. Mr Rowan said the documents showed no signs of resolution over the issue of same-sex marriage. Eamonn Mallie says the 13-page document he has obtained was sent by DUP negotiators to their Sinn FÃ©in counterparts late on the night of Friday 9 February. That's five days before the Stormont talks collapsed. The paper says the two main priorities of any new executive would have been implementing health reforms and dealing with the impact of Brexit. A section on language confirms plans for three separate bills, dealing with Irish, Ulster Scots and the importance of respect and tolerance. Square brackets indicate some details may still have been under discussion, but there are clear plans for the creation of Irish and Ulster Scots commissioners, simultaneous translation for people speaking at the Assembly and a translation unit within the finance department. The document says English would remain the language used in courts, but Irish and other languages could be facilitated when deemed necessary. On same-sex marriage, the Mallie document says only that the parties hold different policy positions on the issue. The DUP's Edwin Poots said the party would not be publishing any of the papers as ""it would be an act of bad faith"". ""If others wish to publish elements of the talks that's a matter for them,"" he said. ""Such a publication will not undermine anything that the DUP has said in public or private."" Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP had been in negotiations to end the13-month stalemate at Stormont. The devolved government collapsed in a row over abotched green energy scheme. After the latest talks collapsed on Wednesday, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said a deal had been in place the week before. She said the DUP was warned to ""close the deal before those opposed to it could unpick"" it. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said there will be no free-standing Irish language act The DUP leader has said no draft agreement was in place. Mrs Foster said the talks failed due to disagreements with Sinn FÃ©in about legislation for the Irish language. Mrs Foster has called on Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley to set a budget and take key decisions about the region's schools, hospitals and infrastructure. But in an update to MPs on Tuesday, Mrs Bradley declined to immediatelyre-impose direct rule from Westminster. She also raised the prospect of another Assembly election.

Mink fur farm raid sanctioned by police,"Up to 6,000 mink were released in the raid in 1998 Police allowed animal rights activists to attack a fur farm causing thousands of mink to be released into the countryside, it has emerged. The raid in Crow Hill Farm near Ringwood in 1998 was carried out by a group which had been infiltrated by the Metropolitan Police, the force said. It said its actions had ""impacted"" on the Hampshire police investigation. No charges were ever brought over the attack in which up to 6,000 mink were set free. Many of the predators were killed to protect pets and livestock. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said the raid was sanctioned by the force An undercover officer, using the name Christine Green, took part in the raid which was carried out by members of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), police said. Her cover name has been revealed by the public inquiry into undercover policing, which was launched by the government in 2015. The true identity of the officer, who has since resigned from Scotland Yard's Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), cannot be revealed for legal reasons. An undercover Scotland Yard officer took part in the fur farm raid The Metropolitan Police said the scale of the mink release had been ""unforeseen"" by senior officers. Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: ""It appears that the SDS allowed this incident to go ahead, as they saw it, in the interests of preventing more serious crime in the longer term. ""I would like to be clear that the decision-making surrounding this incident would simply not happen in today's Metropolitan Police Service."" Ms Ball said Hampshire Constabulary was not told until 2014 about the undercover officer's involvement. She said: ""The Metropolitan Police Service has apologised to Hampshire Constabulary for the impact these decisions had on their ability to bring those responsible to justice."" The Hampshire force said it had reopened the case in 2014 but could not bring charges due to a ""lack of tangible evidence and no suspects being identified"".

KFC shortages to continue all week,"Delivery problems will mean some KFC outlets will remain closed for the rest of the week, while others will have a reduced menu or shortened hours. About half the fast food chain's 900 outlets in its UK-based division were still closed on Tuesday night. That was fewer than the 575 closed as of Monday evening. Last week the fried chicken chain switched its delivery contract to DHL, which has blamed ""operational issues"" for the supply disruption. Earlier, a KFC spokesperson expected the number of closures to fall in the coming coming days as teams ""work flat-out all hours to clear the backlog"". ""Each day more deliveries are being made. However, we expect the disruption to some restaurants to continue over the remainder of the week, meaning some will be closed and others operating with a reduced menu or shortened hours."" DHL's managing director of retail, John Boulter, said the delivery firm regretted the ""interruption of supply"" and apologised for the ""inconvenience and disappointment caused to KFC and their customers"". ""The reasons for this unforeseen interruption of this complex service are being worked on with a goal to return to normal service levels as soon as possible,"" he added. ""We are committed to step-by-step improvements to allow KFC to reopen its stores over the coming days."" KFC has set up a web page,externalwhere customers can find their nearest outlet that is open. Until 13 February, KFC's chicken was delivered by specialist food distribution group Bidvest. But after the contract switched to DHL, many of the food giant's outlets began running out of chicken products. The GMB union said it had warned KFC that switching from Bidvest to DHL was a mistake. The change led to 255 job losses and the closure of a Bidvest depot, said Mick Rix, GMB national officer. ""Bidvest are specialists - a food distribution firm with years of experience. DHL are scratching around for any work they can get, and undercut them,"" he said. ""KFC are left with hundreds of restaurants closed while DHL try and run the whole operation out of one distribution centre. Three weeks ago, KFC knew they had made a terrible mistake, but by then it was too late."" The distribution network uses software developed by the firm Quick Service Logistics (QSL). DHL said: ""Due to operational issues, a number of deliveries in recent days have been incomplete or delayed. We are working with our partners, KFC and QSL, to rectify the situation as a priority and apologise for any inconvenience."" A KFC spokesperson said the decision to change supplier had not been taken lightly. ""DHL have estimated that winning the KFC contract and opening the new distribution centre has created 300 new jobs,"" he added. KFC's spokesman said he did not have a figure, but any calculation is likely to be complicated by the fact that 95% of KFC's outlets in the UK are run by franchisees. Some media reports say the crisis could be costing the chain Â£1m a day, but any such figure is likely to be guesswork. This video can not be played ""Angry, sad, disappointed and hungry"": We talk to KFC customers Workers are being encouraged to take holiday, but would not be forced to do so, the company has said. It said that in the restaurants owned by the chain, staff on short-term contracts would be paid the average hours worked per day over the past 12 weeks, while those on salaries would be paid as normal. ""Franchisees will be seeking their own independent advice, but we're encouraging them to adopt this policy too,"" said the chain. A KFC worker in London who contacted the BBC said he had not received any shifts for the past week. ""This problem isn't our fault, but we are the ones who can't work. ""I have got bills that come out of my account on Friday and I feel terrible about the whole situation. I am looking for a new job,"" he said. 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water UK reacts to 'underwhelming' earthquake QUIZ: Which Black Panther character are you?

MPs set out Brexit 'suggestions' to May,"More than 60 Brexit-supporting Tory MPs have written to Theresa May to insist the UK make a clean break with the EU. The MPs say the UK must not be stopped from negotiating trade deals with other countries, once it leaves the EU, and must gain full ""regulatory autonomy"". The letter was sent by the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg. Opposition critics accused the PM of being ""too weak"" to confront the ""hard Brexiteers"" in her own party. What is the European Research Group? Post-Brexit UK won't be like Mad Max, says David Davis The letter, signed by 62 MPs including several ex-ministers and former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, includes a number of ""suggestions"" for securing a successful Brexit. It backs the PM's vision for Brexit, as set out in herLancaster House speech,externalin January 2017, including leaving the customs union and single market. But it says she ""must"" ensure the UK can change its laws without authorisation from the EU from the moment it leaves in March 2019. The MPs also insist the UK must be ""free to start its own trade negotiations"" during the planned two-year transition period that would kick in after Brexit day. And it urges the UK government to resist EU efforts to set the timetable for Brexit negotiations. ""The UK should negotiate as an equal partner. Ministers may not want or be able to accept the EU's timing and mandates as fixed, and should be able to set out alternative terms including, for example, building an agreement based on our World Trade Organisation membership instead,"" says the letter. It comes ahead of a crunch cabinet meeting on Thursday to thrash out an agreement on how to proceed in negotiations with the EU. The government is also set to publish its its response to the EU's proposals for how the two-year transition period after Brexit should work later on Wednesday. The UK wants a mechanism to object to new European legislation introduced during the implementation phase. The prime minister had suggested that EU nationals who arrive during the transition period should not have the right to settle permanently in the UK. Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg With no majority, she knows that she needs to keep the dozens and dozens of Brexit-backing Tory MPs broadly with her for her own government's survival. They have accepted some shifts from the government that they used to find intolerable - a Brexit departure lounge of a couple of years rather than a sharp exit, and a bill of tens of billions. But they are not, as this letter makes clear, up for swallowing many more compromises when it comes to getting trade deals done immediately after Brexit. Read Laura's full blog Labour claimed the MPs' letter ""exposes the deep divisions that run through the heart of this Tory government"". Shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield  said: ""It is clearer than ever that Theresa May cannot deliver the Brexit deal Britain needs. ""She is too weak to face down the fanatics in her own party and to deliver a final deal that protects jobs and the economy."" The SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""It is clear from this list of demands that the Tories don't want either a transition deal or a âfuture relationship with the EU."" Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said it appeared the prime minister had ""one arm tied behind her back by the Tory militants who are now nakedly acting like a party within a party"". In other Brexit news, a group of pro-Leave economists claim to have ""comprehensively debunked"" leaked government forecasts predicting a hit to the UK economy outside the EU. The Whitehall forecasts - which predicted lower growth across the UK as a result of Brexit - sparked a row when they emerged last month. Now Economists for Free Trade have published their ""alternative"" calculations, saying the civil servants' version ignored what they said were the ""clear objectives"" set out by Mrs May of free trade with Europe and the rest of the world. Using government models, this would suggest a 2% rise in GDP over 15 years, the group claimed. Mr Duncan Smith said the report ""deserves to be taken very seriously"". Mrs May is meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte for talks in Downing Street and is expected to update him on Brexit progress.

Corbyn attacks press over spy 'smears',"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says Daily Mail and Sun stories 'nonsense' Jeremy Corbyn has warned press barons ""change is coming"" as he accused them of printing ""lies and smears"" over his contacts with a Czech spy in the 1980s. The Labour leader said newspapers had gone a ""little bit James Bond"" in their coverage of his meetings with diplomat and agent Jan Sarkocy. He suggested the reporting showed how ""worried"" media bosses were by the prospect of a Labour government. The Sun said it would continue to ask ""inconvenient"" questions. Details of a file held on Mr Corbyn by the StB, the Communist-era Czechoslovakian intelligence agency, were first reported by The Sun almost a week ago. It reported contacts Mr Corbyn is alleged to have had with Mr Sarkocy, who was working in the Czechoslovakian embassy in London, towards the end of the Cold War in 1986 and 1987. Czech officials have since told the BBC Mr Corbyn was a ""person of interest"" to their intelligence agencies but not an informant, contradicting claims reportedly made by Mr Sarkocy. This video can not be played Former Sun executive Trevor Kavanagh defends paper's coverage The story has been widely reported by British newspapers, prompting calls by Theresa May for Mr Corbyn to be open about his past actions and one cabinet minister to accuse him of ""betraying"" Britain. Mr Corbyn has previously declined to comments on the claims, but earlier on Tuesday at an event in London he was asked directly whether he was a Czech spy, replying ""no"". The Labour leader has now upped the ante, releasing a video message to supporters accusing newspapers of reporting ""increasingly wild and entirely false"" claims made by Mr Sarkocy. ""In the last few days, The Sun, The Mail, The Telegraph and The Express have all gone a little bit James Bond. ""It's easy to laugh, but something more serious is happening,"" he said. ""Publishing these ridiculous smears that have been refuted by Czech officials shows just how worried the media bosses are by the prospect of a Labour government. ""They're right to be. Labour will stand up to the powerful and corrupt - and take the side of the many, not the few."" Mr Corbyn said the right-wing press had become less powerful in the era of social media and ""their bad habits were becoming less and less relevant"". Lords vote for second stage Leveson probe ""A free press is essential for democracy and we don't want to close it down, we want to open it up. At the moment, much of our press isn't very free at all. ""In fact it's controlled by billionaire tax exiles, who are determined to dodge paying their fair share for our vital public services. ""Instead of learning these lessons they're continuing to resort to lies and smears. Their readers - you, all of us - deserve so much better. Well, we've got news for them: change is coming."" The BBC understands the phrase ""change is coming"" refers to Labour's plans to go ahead with a second stage of the Leveson inquiry into press ethics as well a review of media ownership and plurality. The Sun issued a statement hitting back at the Labour leader and defending its coverage. ""Over the past few days, we have revealed substantial, documented evidence from the Czech security archive that a Czech spy met with Jeremy Corbyn at the height of the Cold War,"" it said, adding that it was in the public interest to know details of the meeting. ""Those questions are yet to be answered and we will keep asking them, no matter how inconvenient they might be, nor how many times we are threatened with 'change' - whatever that may mean. ""They are questions that we would put to anybody who aspires to the highest office in the land.""

Oxfam scandal: Thousands cancel donations,"This video can not be played Mark Goldring: 'We are sorry for the damage done to Haiti and the wider aid efforts' About 7,000 people have stopped making regular donations to Oxfam since it emerged some of its staff used prostitutes in Haiti, MPs have heard. Oxfam boss Mark Goldring apologised to the International Development Committee for the damage done to people in Haiti and the wider efforts of aid workers. He said 26 claims of sexual misconduct had been made since the scandal broke. Save the Children's Kevin Watkins also gave evidence, saying his charity had investigated 53 allegations in 2016. Mr Goldring and two other senior Oxfam executives faced an uncomfortable morning of questions from MPs about the sexual misconduct of the charity's workers in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010. Oxfam chief: 'Attacks out of proportion' UN aid agencies fear Oxfam backlash The urgent session, called by the committee in response to allegations appearing earlier this month in the Times newspaper, was marked by repeated apologies. Oxfam, which has almost 10,000 staff working in more than 90 countries, has denied a cover-up but its handling of the scandalis being investigated by the Charity Commission. Since the story broke, Mr Goldring, who became chief executive in 2013, said 26 reports of recent and historical incidents had been made by Oxfam workers - 16 of them outside the UK. Of the scandal, he said: ""I am sorry, we are sorry, for the damage Oxfam has done both to the people of Haiti but also to wider efforts for aid and development by possibly undermining public support."" He denied there had been a cover-up, saying Oxfam had been trying to deliver a huge programme with 500 staff, and his predecessors would have believed they were making the right decision at the time. ""I don't defend that decision,"" he said. This video can not be played Winnie Byanyima: 'It hurts me that Oxfam is facing these questions' Mr Goldring also said he was ""deeply sorry"" for hisremarks in a Guardian interviewin defence of Oxfam when he said the attacks on the charity were as if it had ""murdered babies in their cots"". He told MPs that at the time of the original investigation, Oxfam issued a press release revealing its findings of ""serious misconduct"" involving bullying, intimidation and breaches of the charity's code of conduct - but did not mention sexual exploitation. ""At the time, people thought that was being transparent. We know now that that was not enough,"" said Mr Goldring. ""I suspect there was a balance of saying 'Oxfam is delivering life-saving assistance to a million people in Haiti. We have got to keep that work going'."" He added: ""Not every organisation chooses to tell the public about something they got wrong."" He said there was now a safeguarding team and helpline at Oxfam and the charity was seeking more independent support. Caroline Thomson, the chair of trustees since 2017, and Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International, both told the committee they were ""ashamed"" of what happened in Haiti. Ms Byanyima said the situation was ""painful"" as she has spent her life protecting women. The number of lost donations referred to by Mr Goldring relates to direct debits. Oxfam confirmed later it had lost 7,094 direct debits - representing about 3.5% of the total number of donations received through that method. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Committee chairman Stephen Twigg said MPs would conduct a full inquiry into sexual misconduct in the aid sector. Save the Children UK's chief executive Mr Watkins told the committee said his charity had produced two reports warning that ""predatory men"" were seeking to use aid work as an opportunity for abuse. ""What has come to light over the past few weeks cautions all of us against complacency,"" he said. This video can not be played Kevin Watkins: ""If I sat here and told you I felt we were doing enough, that would be complacency"" He said Save the Children has been pushing for an ""international humanitarian passport"", which could be revoked if aid workers breach rules. Mr Watkins said of the 53 ""safeguarding cases"" it had investigated in 2016, 20 files had been passed to police and 11 staff members had been dismissed. He added across Save The Children UK and International there were 35 cases of staff harassment reported and 19 staff dismissed. A redacted version of an internal Oxfam report from 2011,external, released on Monday, revealed that three of the men accused of sexual misconduct in Haiti physically threatened witnesses during an investigation. It also showed an employee was dismissed and three resigned for using prostitutes on Oxfam premises and the use of underage prostitutes was not ruled out. During the committee hearing, it emerged that one of them was re-employed for Oxfam on a short-term contract in another country. Mr Van Hauwermeiren worked in Chad from 2006-09 before going to Haiti in 2010 In the report, the charity said director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, ""admitted using prostitutes"" at his Oxfam residence. Last week, he denied paying prostitutes for sex. He was granted a ""phased and dignified exit"" and was allowed to resign, the report added, so long as he fully co-operated with the rest of the 2011 investigation. It is not known if he was one of the suspects accused of threatening witnesses.

Syrian pro-government forces enter Afrin,"This video can not be played Pro-government forces waved Syrian flags as they entered Afrin, in footage posted by the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah Syrian pro-government forces have entered the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, provoking an immediate response from Turkish forces besieging the area. The government was asked for military help by a Kurdish militia that has been trying to repel an offensive by Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels. Fighters were seen passing through a checkpoint in armoured vehicles. Turkish troops then shelled the area and Turkey said it had forced the pro-government fighters to retreat. Turkey had threatened to confront government forces if they intervened, raising the prospect of direct conflict between two of the main players in Syria's civil war. The development comes as: Syrian government warplanes continued to bombard the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghoutaregion outside Damascus, reportedly killing dozens of civilians a day after strikes left more than 120 dead The government's allyRussia acknowledged that dozens of its citizens were killed or wounded in a recent armed clash in Syria- an apparent reference to a confrontation this month with US-backed forces in Deir al-Zour Turkish leaders say they want to clear the Kurdish enclave of members of the People's Protection Units (YPG) militia, which they consider a terrorist group. They say it is an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in south-eastern Turkey for three decades. The Syrian Kurds deny any direct organisational links to the PKK - an assertion backed by the US, which has provided the militia and allied Arab fighters with weapons and air support to help them battle the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). The Turkish air and ground assault on Afrin, dubbed ""Operation Olive Branch"", began on 20 January. Since then, Turkish troops and Syrian rebels have taken about 45 villages, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The UK-based monitoring group says the fighting has left at least 205 Syrian rebels and 219 Kurdish militiamen dead, along with 112 civilians. Turkey says 32 of its soldiers have been killed and denied reports of any civilian casualties in Afrin. The abridged back story How historical Afrin became a prize worth a war The government has denounced the Turkish offensive as a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty. Soon after it began, the Kurdish authorities in Afrin called on the government to ""carry out its sovereign obligations"" and send troops to help defend the border from Turkish attacks. The government, which has so far avoided conflict with Kurdish forces since the start of the civil war in 2011, did not immediately respond to the appeal for help. Turkey launched a cross-border operation against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria last month But on Tuesday state media reported that members of the ""Popular Forces"" had arrived in Afrin to ""support the locals against the aggression waged by the Turkish regime"" and to confront IS, which has no known presence in the area. A military media unit run by Lebanon's Hezbollah movement - an ally of the Syrian government - posted photos and video of men brandishing Syrian flags passing through a checkpoint on a number of pick-up trucks and lorries mounted with heavy weapons. A reporter for the official Sana news agency said Turkish artillery had targeted the convoy after it crossed into the Kurdish enclave, as well as media personnel accompanying it. Turkey and its allies wants to drive Kurdish YPG militia fighters from Afrin Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency later reported that Turkish troops had fired ""warning shots"" at ""pro-regime terrorist groups trying to advance"" towards Afrin, forcing them to retreat about 10km (6 miles). Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the convoy was made up of Shia militiamen acting independently, adding that he had earlier persuaded the Syrian government's main allies, Russia and Iran, to stop any troops being deployed. ""Unfortunately, these kinds of terror organisations take wrong steps with the decisions they take. It is not possible for us to allow this. They will pay a heavy price,"" the Reuters news agency quoted him as telling an news conference. By Selin Girit, BBC News, Istanbul For Turks this was not surprising, but it is alarming. Turkey had said that if Syrian forces came in to Afrin to support the Kurdish YPG forces, there would be serious consequences. The confrontation risks an escalation in Turkey's one-month old offensive that is aimed at driving the YPG out of Afrin. This video can not be played Why do the two biggest military powers in Nato risk fighting each other in Syria? There has not yet been an official statement regarding the latest events. But presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin had tweeted to say that reports suggesting that Syrian government had struck a deal with the YPG were not based on facts, adding that ""dirty and secret negotiations were being held"". Ankara says it is determined to carry on its operation whatever happens. But many argue Turkey would need Russia's backing in order to avoid confronting Syrian troops along with the YPG. Afrin is just one of many active fronts in the country's civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. Government forces, supported by Russian air strikes and Iran-backed militias, are also carrying out offensives on two major rebel strongholds - the north-western province of Idlib and the besieged Eastern Ghouta region. The UN says more than 300,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in Idlib since December, while almost 200 civilians are reported to have been killed in government air and artillery strikes on the Eastern Ghouta since Monday. Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry acknowledged that dozens of its citizens and people from other former Soviet states were killed or wounded in a recent battle. It gave no details, butit is believed to be a reference to an incident in the eastern province of Deir al-Zour on 7 February, when the US military said it had killed an estimated 100 pro-Syrian government fighters in response to an attack on an allied, Kurdish-led militia force battling Islamic State militants in the area.

Syrian bombardment 'kills 250' in two days,"This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" The death toll from two days of bombing by Syria's government of a rebel-held area has risen to 250, reports say. It is the worst violence in the Eastern Ghouta area near Damascus since 2013, according to activists. More than 50 children are among the dead, they say. The UN has warned that the situation is ""spiralling out of control"". Meanwhilethe Damascus government has sent forces to confront Turkish troopswho have crossed the border to push back the Kurds in northern Syria. Turkey fired shells near the advancing columns, which, it claims, forced the pro-government fighters into retreat. The Syrian military has not commented on the reports from the Eastern Ghouta but says it carried out ""precision strikes"" on areas from which the shells were launched. A UN spokesperson said at least six hospitals had been hit in the area on Monday and Tuesday. Pro-government forces - backed by Russia - intensified their efforts to retake the last major rebel stronghold on Sunday night. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said at least 250 people had been killed in air strikes and artillery fire since then. A makeshift hospital was set up in Douma - one of the several towns under bombardment It said it was the highest 48-hour death toll sincea 2013 chemical attack on the besieged enclave. About 1,200 people were injured. Activists say at least 10 towns and villages across the Eastern Ghouta came under renewed bombardment on Tuesday. The UN called for a ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered and the wounded to be evacuated. Syria country profile By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor After seven years, Syria's war is not ending but it is changing. President Assad now looks like he is trying to roll up this final major enclave around Damascus - the Eastern Ghouta. This would secure his victory around the capital, and would be a very big moment. But Syria remains linked into a web of war and power politics, which guarantees more conflict. Up in the north, there are a whole host of big powers completing for influence: Russia, Iran, Turkey and the United States. British Special Forces are there, too. Iran is seen as a particularly big threat by the Americans, the Israelis, who are also getting involved increasingly, and the Saudis, who have been big players in the war as well. While the cast of characters is changing, the bloodshed continues and it is certainly not over. A local doctor told the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations, which supports medical facilities in the Eastern Ghouta, that it was ""catastrophic"". ""People have nowhere to turn,"" he said. ""They are trying to survive but their hunger from the siege has weakened them significantly."" The UN's co-ordinator in Syria, Panos Moumtzis, said he was ""appalled"" by reports that hospitals had been deliberately targeted,warning that such attacks might amount to war crimes,external. Five hospitals in Marj, Saqba and Douma were left inoperable or partially functioning after reported government strikes on Monday, while on Tuesday a hospital in Zamalka was hit, according to Mr Moumtzis. The Syrian American Medical Society said a hospital in Arbin was also put out of service on Tuesday. The Syrian Observatory said the facility had been targeted by Russian warplanes. The government has allowed one humanitarian convoy into the Eastern Ghouta since late November, and there are severe shortages of food. A bundle of bread now costs close to 22 times the national average and 12% of children under five years old are said to be acutely malnourished. This video can not be played Father describes a 'miserable day for Eastern Ghouta' The Eastern Ghouta is dominated by the Islamist faction Jaysh al-Islam. But Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, also operates there. The region has been designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by Russia and Iran, the government's main allies, along with Turkey, which backs the rebels, but hostilities intensified in mid-November. On Tuesday, Syrian pro-government forces entered the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, just south of the Turkish border. Turkey is trying to oust the Kurdish militia, which have semi-autonomous rule of the area and which have called on the Syrian military for help. Syria has denounced the Turkish offensive as a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty, while Turkey has insisted it will not back down.

Ex-Save the Children boss 'faced three complaints',"A former chief executive of Save the Children faced three complaints of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff before leaving the charity, the BBC has learned. Justin Forsyth was accused of sending inappropriate texts and commenting on what young female staff were wearing. Mr Forsyth said he had ""apologised unreservedly"" to the three workers. It comes as Oxfam and Save the Children haveseparately been quizzed by MPs about sexual misconduct by workers. Although not accused of sexual misconduct, Mr Forsyth, who is now deputy executive director at Unicef., said he had had ""unsuitable and thoughtless conversations"" with staff. He said the concerns were handled through a process of mediation and no formal complaints were made. He added he thought the issue had been closed ""many years ago"". Save the Children said it had commissioned ""a root and branch review of the organisational culture"" at the charity ""addressing any behavioural challenges among senior leadership"". The charity said concerns were raised about ""inappropriate behaviour and comments"" by Mr Forsyth in 2015. It said two trustees carried out separate investigations into a total of three complaints made by female employees. ""Both reviews resulted in unreserved apologies from the CEO. All the parties agreed to this and the former CEO apologised to the women in question. At that time the matters were closed."" A Unicef spokesman said: ""We welcome Mr Forsyth's decision to come forward and acknowledge past mistakes. ""We are discussing this matter with Mr Forsyth and his former employer so we can take appropriate action."" An investigation by BBC Radio 4's PM programme, found the complaints against Mr Forsyth included women receiving a series of inappropriate texts, and comments on how they looked, what they were wearing and how he felt about them. If they did not respond, Mr Forsyth would follow up his messages with an email, asking if they had seen the text. If they still did not respond, he would ask someone to send them to him for a ""quick word"". A woman who complained at the time said the longer she was at the charity the more she was exposed to ""some of the bravado"". ""That is both at head office and in the field,"" she said. ""Other women tell you to watch out for certain senior people. You start to hear rumours about some of the directors but of course until it happens to you - which it did - you don't really appreciate how hard it is to deal with."" She said it did not seem the complaints were being treated with the ""appropriate degree of seriousness"" and it was ""troubling"" that the then chairman of the charity's board of trustees, Sir Alan Parker, became involved. Sir Alan is the founder of the PR firm Brunswick. Justin Forsyth with Samantha Cameron in Lebanon Another former employee of Save the Children told the BBC: ""The centre of this crisis was not in Haiti or Chad. It was in London. ""Young professional women at Save the Children felt unsafe. They felt that their careers could depend on ensuring they responded to unwanted attention and to bullying."" In his statement, Mr Forsyth said he had made ""some personal mistakes during my time at Save the Children"". ""I recognise that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I now know caused offence and hurt. ""When this was brought to my attention on two separate occasions, I apologised unreservedly to the three colleagues involved. ""My apologies were accepted and I had thought the issue closed many years ago."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The allegations come after Brendan Cox - the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox - quit two charities he set up in memory of his wifeamid allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The Charity Commission said it had ""extensive regulatory engagement"" with Save the Children after allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour were made against Mr Cox and Mr Forsyth between 2015-16. A spokeswoman added that the body received an independent review ""commissioned by trustees"", and ""received direct confirmation and assurance from trustees"" that recommendations made to the charity ""were being urgently acted upon"".

UN aid agencies fear backlash,"Oxfam staff are accused of paying vulnerable people for sex in Haiti in 2011 The news that Oxfam staff used prostitutes in Haiti has led to renewed focus on how the aid sector works, and what measures are in place to prevent abuse by aid workers. Headlines like ""Oxfam faces new sex scandal in South Sudan"" are certainly not flattering, and they come at a time when many countries are debating cutting foreign aid. How does this square with the more standard view of an aid worker: the selfless humanitarian who works in the most difficult conditions in order to improve the lives of the most vulnerable? Of course, there are no perfect saints, and probably no perfect sinners either, in any organisation. But the UN, which regularly uses organisations like Oxfam as implementing partners, is now struggling with a problem many suggest it should have addressed more publically decades ago. How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? Oxfam did not disclose 'full Haiti details' This week in Geneva, UN aid agencies took care to express their zero tolerance approach to sexual abuse. ""Every single report or allegation of sexual exploitation, harassment, or abuse is thoroughly assessed,"" said Andrej Mahecic of the UN Refugee Agency. ""If substantiated it leads to sanctions and summary dismissal."" ""We are in the process of introducing mandatory training for all staff, using existing UN courses on the prevention of sexual harassment and exploitation,"" added Tarik Jasarevic of the World Health Organisation. But is this enough? Andrew MacLeod, a former UN worker who has been highly critical of the UN system, believes they should have been more active long ago. ""No one working in aid will be surprised by this,"" he said. ""This is not just an issue about Oxfam, it's an issue in all aid agencies all over the world."" Since the Oxfam scandal broke, Mr MacLeod has given numerous interviews, and provided an assessment to the tabloid newspaper The Sun which ran the headline ""UN aid workers raped 60,000 people"". Asked by the BBC to substantiate the figures, Mr MacLeod said: ""I'm not claiming that to be a number of science."" So where did he get it? By looking at UN figures for 2016, he explained, which suggest there were 311 cases of sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers during that year. A further suggestion by the UN that the numbers would be higher led him to double that annual figure, and then multiply it by ten because generally only about 10% of rape cases are reported. That brought to him an approximate figure of 6000, which he then multiplied by ten again to cover a ten year period. ""Sensationalist and bombastic, zero creds,"" was the reaction of one female aid worker with years of experience in the field. ""Not the experience of any aid agency I have ever worked with."" Nevertheless, the UN knows it must now be much more transparent about what it is actually doing to combat cases of abuse. An Oxfam sign is seen in Corail, a camp for people displaced by the 2010 Haiti earthquake Scandals in the past, such as the sexual exploitation of trafficked women in Bosnia by UN peacekeepers, a ""sex for food"" scandal which implicated the World Food Programme in Liberia, and the abuse of children in the Central African Republic by French peacekeepers have all raised questions about the UN's ability to prevent abuse, and to prosecute it when it does occur. In fact, Judith Greenwood, Executive Director of the CHS (Core Humanitarian Standards) Alliance, says aid agencies and the UN do have ""the tools"" to tackle sexual abuse in the aid sector, although abuse committed by UN peacekeepers remains (at member states' insistence) the responsibility of the countries the peacekeepers come from. Pointing out that the Oxfam Haiti scandal dates back to 2011, Ms Greenwood said a lot of good policy and practice had been adopted since then. ""There is an interagency task team that specifically looks at accountability to the affected population. All of our member organisations (all the major aid agencies, including Oxfam) have to have clear procedures in place to tackle exploitation and abuse."" This video can not be played Oxfam employee Widza Bryant discusses the Haiti allegations with the BBC Meanwhile Unicef says any allegations of abuse of children in its care are referred to its executive director within 48 hours. They added: ""We are training our staff continuously in this, and we are improving our assistance to victims."" The UN this week also responded sharply to Andrew MacLeod's suggestion that UN aid workers committing abuse could get away with it because they enjoyed diplomatic immunity. ""Let's be clear about this. The answer is no,"" tweeted the secretary general's spokesperson. ""Sexual abuse is a crime. The UN does not and will not claim immunity in such cases."" But tweets and restatements of existing policy may not be enough to calm this debate, especially if there are more revelations of historic scandals. Allow Twitter content?

UN aid agencies are currently trying to deal with an unprecedented number of humanitarian crises, from Syria, to Yemen, to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Privately senior UN officials are concerned that the headlines may lead to a substantial loss of public support, and a consequent major cut in funding.

Call for military funeral for Florida hero,"Peter Wang was one of 17 killed in February's mass school shooting A junior cadet who died helping other students escape a Florida school shooting has been posthumously accepted into a prestigious US military school. Peter Wang, 15, one of 17 killed in the 14 February attack, was admitted to the class of 2025 at his dream school, West Point Academy. He was a member of the US Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC), a school programme for potential US military officers. His funeral took place on Tuesday. Clooneys make pledge to gun reform march Florida shooting: Who are the victims? The school will confer a letter of admission and honorarium tokens to his family, local West Point alumnus Chad Maxey told the Sun Sentinel newspaper. Florida Governor Rick Scott also reportedly directed the state's National Guard to honour Peter and two other members of the JROTC at their funerals. Peter Wang was reportedly wearing his JROTC uniform when he died The US Army bestowed the Medal of Heroism on three students who were killed, including Peter, according to US media. The Cadet Command also approved Junior ROTC Heroism Medals for 14-year-old cadets Alaina Petty and Martin Duque, an army spokesman told US media. Peter was in uniform when he was fatally shot while holding the door for others fleeing a gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, witnesses say. This video can not be played Students staged an anti-gun 'lie-in' The recognition comes after an online petition called for him to be laid to rest with military honours, saying he ""deserves"" to be buried as a hero, because ""his selfless and heroic actions have led to the survival of dozens in the area"". Peter, who had spent part of his childhood in his parents' native China, had dreamed of attending the West Point military academy, friends say. In Florida aftermath, US students say 'Never Again' Should US gun raffles be cancelled? Jesse Pan, a neighbour and longstanding friend of Peter's family, told the BBC Chinese Service he had tried to support the teenager's parents as they struggled to cope with the loss. ""I was there with his parents, helping translating and finding a funeral home,"" he said. ""His parents fainted as soon as they saw his body. He had got multiple shots in frontâ¦ So horrible.""

Meanwhile, about 100 students from Stoneman Douglas have travelled by bus to the Florida state capitol, where they plan to hold a rally against gun violence on Wednesday. Some of them arrived on Tuesday in time to see the Republican-controlled state legislature reject a proposed ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines. State lawmakers voted down the measure after opening their session with a prayer for the victims of the Parkland high school shooting.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday called for a ban on rapid-fire ""bump stock"" devices, which were used last October's Las Vegas massacre, but not in the Florida high school attack. The Parkland school was the scene of a deadly rampage last week, when an ex-student allegedly opened fire with an AR-15 assault rifle. A school shooting comes to 'paradise' American gun culture in 10 charts Nikolas Cruz: A depressed loner 'crazy about guns' The suspect, Nikolas Cruz, had moved in with a friend, who also attended the school, after his adoptive mother died in 2017. The parents who hosted Mr Cruz, James and Kimberly Snead, told CBS News the teenager was depressed but they did not realise how troubled he was. This video can not be played Emma Gonzalez told a rally that the massacre was not only a mental health issue ""The Nik we knew was not the Nik that everybody else seemed to know,"" James Snead told CBS. ""He pulled one over on us. As well as a lot of people,"" Mrs Snead said. Mr Snead, a US army veteran, said he knew Mr Cruz had guns but believed he had the only key to the safe where they were located. He added that it was Mr Cruz's right to have guns. James and Kimberly Snead told ABC about how they took in the troubled teenager after his adopted mum died Law enforcement officials say that Mr Cruz legally purchased seven rifles in the last year, despite several mental health warnings. The couple also told ABC News that Mr Cruz had texted their son only three minutes before the attack began in Parkland, Florida, to say he was ""going to the movies"". When they first saw him at the police station after he was arrested, he ""mumbled"" an apology to the parents. Documents obtained by CBS show that Mr Cruz and his late adoptive mother, Lynda Cruz, were visited by Florida's Department of Children and Families (DCF) after allegations of medical neglect in September 2016. The investigator reportedly determined that Mr Cruz suffered from depression, ADHD and autism, hadcut his arms in a post on social media,externaland once plastered a racist message on his school backpack. Officials closed the investigation after deciding he was not being mistreated, according to CBS News. 'Shame on you' - Florida students chant.

Ambulance abuse note woman pleads guilty,"The note was left on an ambulance in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent A 26-year-old woman who verbally abused paramedics and left a foul-mouthed note on their ambulance in Stoke-on-Trent has admitted a public order offence. Kirsty Sharman, of Parsonage Street, also accepted writing the handwritten message, which said she did not care ""if the whole street collasped [sic]"" . Paramedics were dealing with a 999 call in her street in Tunstall on Sunday. At North Staffordshire Justice Centre, chairman of the magistrates said it was an ""absolutely despicable incident"". The ambulance had been responding to a next door neighbour's emergency call to help his wife, who was ""experiencing breathing difficulties"", prosecutor Liz Ryder told magistrates. She said there had been ""ongoing difficulties"" between Sharman and her neighbours, leading to a restraining order being issued against her in January. Midlands Live: Armed police called to triple stabbing; Man dies in Wolverhampton 'hit-and-run' Miss Ryder said: ""A neighbour saw that note being deposited by the defendant and they took it from the rear windscreen and posted it back through the defendant's address, having torn it apart."" During the incident, Sharman also went into the street and swore at a paramedic, telling him to move the ambulance. Sentencing, the chairman of the magistrates Christopher Rushton told her: ""This was an absolutely despicable incident. ""The fact it was directed at an ambulance crew providing a public service to a sick person. That crew should not be subject to actions such as these."" Sharman was fined Â£120 and was ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£30 and Â£135 costs. Chicken chaos as KFC closes outlets Amazon removes magnetic putty from sale New 50p Beatrix Potter coins released Through her solicitor, Hayley Keegan, Sharman offered her ""most sincere apologies to the ambulance staff"". She was arrested after a social media plea by West Midlands Ambulance Service staff who reported colleagues had the note put on the back windscreen of a vehicle. The ambulance service welcomed the outcome ""of this unpleasant case"". A spokesman said: ""We hope that this case will serve as a warning to others that abusing our staff is not acceptable. ""Our staff will only block roads or park in front of drives if absolutely necessary in the interests of patient care.  In this case, they were parked at the side of the road and were not blocking a driveway."" Ch Insp John Owen, from Staffordshire Police, said: ""This type of behaviour cannot be tolerated, and I know my view is supported by 99% of our community.""

Anger at supermodel's new year message,"Liu was the first Chinese model to walk the catwalk at the Victoria's Secret fashion show Chinese model Liu Wen has sparked a backlash after sending a new year's message to fans on Instagram. Liu used the phrase ""Happy Lunar New Year"", rather than ""Chinese New Year"", prompting some Chinese social media users to accuse her of neglecting her heritage. The supermodel has since changed her message to ""Happy Chinese New Year"". Lunar New Year, which began this year on 16 February, is celebrated by hundreds of millions around the world. The phrase ""Lunar New Year"" is often used instead of ""Chinese New Year"" because the festival, which is determined by the lunar calendar, is celebrated in China but also in Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, and other parts of Southeast Asia. In Pictures: Lunar New Year Malaysia apologises for barking rooster How beauty queens got political in 2017 Liu, who features in Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid models, had posted a photo of herself celebrating the new year with businesswoman Wendi Deng in front of a festive Kumquat tree.

However, her account was bombarded with thousands of messages from nationalistic social media users who accused her of pandering to other Asian countries. ""If even Chinese people don't respect their own culture, how can you expect others to respect you?"" Instagram user baijingting999 wrote. Another user accused Vietnam of appropriating Chinese New Year, and said ""you called it Chinese New Year last year, but Lunar New Year this year - disgusting!"" A third wrote: ""If you want to become Vietnamese so badly, get out and don't come back to China."" Others though came to her defence, and argued that both phrases were valid. One told Liu: ""Happy new year! The people who have a problem with the word 'Lunar' need to go back to school to study English."" User szml wrote: ""Both greetings are ok. You shouldn't change it just because of some online bullying. This would enhance those who try to push their way by online bullying."" 'Baby factory' dad wins paternity rights Pyeongchang's 'best and worst' Olympian Drinking cobra blood to survive the jungle Instagram is blocked in China, but many users have found ways of bypassing this, and Liu's post was also reposted on Chinese social media.

Call to make 'upskirting' an offence,"This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting ""Upskirting"" should be made a specific sexual offence, after police data showed a 10-year-old girl was among those targeted, campaigners say. Secretly photographing underneath a skirt is not a specific offence in England and Wales. The Ministry of Justice says that upskirting is currently covered by alternative avenues of prosecution. There have been just 11 charges related to the practice since 2015, a Freedom of Information request found. The FoI request, made by the Press Association, found only 15 out of 44 police forces contacted held records - a situation campaigners describe as ""wholly inadequate"". Upskirting has been an offence in Scotland since 2010,externalwhen it was listed under the broadened definition of voyeurism. A day after the department said the law on upskirting was ""under constant review"", an MoJ spokesman said that, as powers to enable prosecutions ""already exist"", a change in law was not needed. In a statement, the MoJ said it was ""up to prosecutors to decide if there is sufficient evidence for them to move forward, the issue is not with the laws in place."" 'Upskirting': It happened to me Labour urges 'upskirt' photography ban I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back MP Maria Miller, who chairs the Commons' women and equalities select committee, said more must be done to stop a ""horrific crime"" and that a stronger legal framework ""can help"" begin to tackle it. She said: ""Attempting to take a photograph underneath a skirt is a gross violation of privacy and potentially an act of indecency"". As there is no law specifically naming and banning upskirting, victims and police are presently only able to pursue offences of voyeurism or indecency. The FoI request found the police pursued 78 offences related to upskirting since 2015, but only 11 led to alleged offenders being charged. There was insufficient evidence to proceed in several cases, including in regard to an alleged sexual offence on a 10-year-old girl in 2015, Avon and Somerset Police said. Upskirting took place in a wide variety of public spaces, including nightclubs, shops and restaurants - with mobile phones frequently used and young women disproportionately targeted. Devon and Cornwall - alleged offences included taking an indecent photograph of a child, voyeurism and conspiring to outrage public decency. One victim said she turned around to see an offender bent over on the floor with his camera up her skirt. Five people were charged. The known victims aged from 25 to 47. Lincolnshire - one alleged offence involved a man seen on CCTV taking pictures up women's skirts without their knowledge. Another man was spotted by security staff at a McDonald's restaurant at Cornhill, Lincoln, lying under the stairs and looking up ""young girls' skirts"". Nottingham - of the six reported incidents, two resulted in criminal charges. In one case, a man was seen following a woman around a shop, and taking a picture up her skirt when she approached the checkout. Clare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University and an expert on sexual violence, said the FoI data showed there ""are few public places where women are free from this abuse"". She said: ""The government's continuing failure to provide an effective criminal law against upskirting breaches women's human rights."" She added women were entitled to protection, privacy and ""a law that is fit for purpose"", by treating the act as sexual abuse. ""Only then will victims feel more willing to come forward and report to the police and support prosecutions,"" she said. Voyeurism only applies to filming actions taking place in private Outraging public decency usually requires someone to have witnessed the action but upskirting is often unobserved It may be only discovered later because footage ends up on the internet It also has to take place in public - some spaces like schools might not count as public Unlike other sexual offences, people don't have automatic right to anonymity Campaigners say the current situationresembles that of revenge porn: the practice of posting online explicit material without the subject's consent, which was only made illegal in April 2015, after a national campaign. They argue the ambiguity surrounding upskirting is similar, and that a specific offence needs to be created so the police can pursue more cases. Sarah Green, for the End Violence Against Women coalition, described the police figures as ""very concerning, even though only a minority of police forces were able to respond because the behaviour is not classified as an offence"". She said: ""The police responses show that the police are clearly struggling to recognise upskirting distinctly, even though the disclosures reveal that it is commonly connected to existing sexual offences including voyeurism and sexual assault. ""It is notable that girls and young women are disproportionately targeted where that information has been recorded. The law should be urgently examined in this area.""

Brexit UK 'won't be Mad Max-style world',"This video can not be played Will ministers be locked in a room 'all night'? Britain will not be ""plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction"" after it leaves the EU, the Brexit secretary has said. David Davis said the UK wanted to lead a ""global race to the top"" in rights and standards not, as some feared, a ""competitive race to the bottom"". British business could ""never be cheaper than China"" and must focus instead on product and service quality. He also suggested a Brexit deal by the end of 2018 was ""well on the cards"". The Brexit secretary's address to Austrian business leaders in Vienna is the latest in a series of speeches the UK government is calling ""the road to Brexit"" as it faces demands to spell out details of the future partnership it wants with the EU. The UK says it wants to avoid obstacles to smooth trade with the EU although it is leaving the single market and the customs union when Brexit happens in March 2019. Newsbeat: Social media's take on Mad Max Green dismisses Brexit 'conspiracy theories' Johnson: Let's unite around Brexit vision Mr Davis said this can be achieved if both sides recognise each other's standards and regulations, promising the UK will ""continue our track record of meeting high standards"" once outside the EU. The government has previously spoken of adopting a ""new economic model"" to stay competitive if it is locked out of the EU single market after Brexit, and Labour has claimed the UK could be turned into a ""low-wage, offshore tax haven"". Mr Davis hit back at the government's critics in his speech, invoking the Mad Max series of action films which portray societal collapse in a lawless future world. The first three Mad Max films in the 1980s were followed by Mad Max: Fury Road in 2015 ""They fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom,"" Mr Davis said. ""With Britain plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction. These fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing, not our history, not our intentions, not our national interest. ""But while I profoundly disagree with those who spread these fears â it does remind us all that we must provide reassurance."" Allow Twitter content?

The UK, he said, would never prosper in a new era of intensified globalisation by cutting standards since it ""would never be cheaper than China or have more resources than Brazil"". He said UK's post-Brexit economic relationship with the EU should be based on the principles of ""open trade and fair competition"". As part of this, once the UK has left, it would not allow firms heavily subsidised by EU governments ""unfettered access"" to its markets nor permit mergers between UK and EU firms which reduced consumer choice. Where we are with Brexit - in 300 words Brexit: All you need to know ""A crucial part of any such agreement is the ability for both sides to trust each other's regulations and the institutions that enforce them,"" he added. ""Such mutual recognition will naturally require close, even-handed co-operation between these authorities and a common set of principles to guide them."" Last year EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""simply impossible"" for the UK to adopt its own standards and regulations while also having them recognised automatically in the EU. Labour said past comments by some senior ministers showed they wanted to use Brexit as a vehicle to ""drive down"" environmental standards and employment rights when, instead, they should be extended. ""David Davis's promise... isn't worth the paper it's written on,"" said shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. The general secretary of the GMB union, Tim Roache, said: """"If the best this Government can do is promise Britain will not turn into a 'Mad Max' nightmare - it's no wonder people are worried about their post-Brexit lives."" The Institute of Directors' Allie Renison said they were ""pleased that Davis acknowledges the importance of keeping a level playing field on state aid and competition policy. Minimising trade barriers can and should go hand in hand with a future deal with the EU"". Trust levels in the UK were fairly high as EU finance ministers arrived for a regular meeting in Brussels today. After all, they have seen their British colleagues largely play by the rules for the last four decades. But what happens next? Luxembourg's finance minister sees it as a balance: stick to European standards and goods will flow freely between the two, go your own way and trade won't be as smooth. And the EU doesn't just want a pledge, they want rules, a process, a mechanism that binds the UK into what Brussels calls the Level Playing Field, or the LPF. Magdalena Andersson of Sweden summed up why, saying: ""Of course I trust David Davis but we don't know who will come after him some day in the future."" Allow Twitter content?

How the scandal unfolded,"The scandal has rocked the charity, which has apologised and promised to 'atone for the past' Oxfam, one of the UK's biggest charities, has dominated the headlines in recent weeks following allegations its staff hired prostitutes while working overseas. Since then, the story has continued to develop, with the Charity Commission launching a statutory inquiry - the most serious action it can take. Oxfam - which has nearly 10,000 staff working in more than 90 countries - denies any cover-up. Here is a summary of the events so far: The Times newspaper publishes a front page article under the headline: ""Top Oxfam staff paid Haiti survivors for sex"". The article alleges thatOxfam covered up claims that senior staff working in Haitiin the wake of the 2010 earthquake used prostitutes, some of whom may have been underage. The Times broke the story on its front page Among the male staff accused of sexual misconduct is Oxfam's then-director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren. He is alleged to have used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by the charity. In a statement,Oxfam denies claims of a cover-up,external. It says the behaviour of its staff was ""totally unacceptable"". The charity says it uncovered the accusations in 2011 and immediately launched an internal investigation. According to Oxfam's own 2011 report, four members of staff were dismissed and three, including Mr Van Hauwermeiren, were allowed to resign before the end of the investigation. It says claims of underage girls being involved were unproven. Roland Van Hauwermeiren, who denies paying for sex Oxfam adds thatit had publicly announced the investigation at the time. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock orders Oxfam to hand over all the evidence to the Charity Commission. The Charity Commissionsays it was not given full details,externalabout the use of prostitutes by aid workers. It says it would have acted differently if it had known all the facts. In a fresh story, the Times says Oxfam did not warn other aid agencies about problem staff caught using prostitutes. It emerges that Mr Van Hauwermeiren went on to work elsewhere in the aid sector. Oxfam's chief executive, Mark Goldring, says the charity did ""anything but"" cover up the incident. But he admits the 2011 report released by the charity did not give details of the revelations, and only referred to them as ""serious misconduct"". Oxfam GB's chief executive Mark Goldring and chair of trustees Caroline Thomson leave the Department for International Development Oxfamis hit with further allegations that staff on its mission to Chad,,externalalso led by Mr Van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes in 2006. The Sunday Timesalso reports new claims,externalalleging more than 120 workers from UK charities were accused of sexual abuse in the past year. Meanwhile, Oxfamannounces new measures,externalfor the prevention and handling of sexual abuse cases. Oxfam's chair of trustees, Caroline Thomson, says staff members had been coming forward with ""concerns about how staff were recruited and vetted"" following the recent media reports. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt warns that ministers could cut off funding for Oxfam if it cannot account for the way it handled claims. Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrenceresigns over the handling of the sex scandal. She says she is ""ashamed"" and takes full responsibility. Penny Lawrence, who resigned as deputy chief executive of the charity, said concerns were raised about staff behaviour in Chad and Haiti The Charity Commission, which regulates the industry,opens a statutory inquiry into Oxfam,external- the most serious action it can take. The watchdog says it has concerns that Oxfam ""may not have fully and frankly disclosed"" everything it knew about the claims. The European Commission, which gave â¬1.7m to Oxfam's Haiti programme in 2011, threatens it is ready to ""cease funding any partner not living up to high ethical standards"". Thepresident of Haiti, Jovenel MoÃ¯se, condemns Oxfam,externaland says the actions were an ""extremely serious violation of human dignity"". A senior government source in Haiticonfirms an investigation will be launchedinto foreign aid agencies operating there. President Jovenel Moise condemned ""sexual predator"" staff exploiting ""needy people in their moment of greatest vulnerability"" Actress Minnie Driverbecomes the first famous face to cut ties with Oxfam. In a statement Ms Driver, who stepped down from her role as a celebrity ambassador for the charity, said she was ""nothing short of horrified"" by the allegations. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, a former colleague of Roland Van Hauwermeirentells the IRIN news website,externalthat he was investigated by British health charity Merlin after allegations of using prostitutes in Liberia in 2004, before he was employed by Oxfam. The Charity Commissionsays it is looking into these reports. Oxfam confirms that more than 1,200 peoplecancelled their direct debit payments to the charityon the Saturday, Sunday and Monday after the first reports of the scandal emerged. The former Oxfam director at the centre of the accusations, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, 68,denies paying for sex but admits some ""mistakes"". Inan open letter to Belgian media in Dutch,external, he denies that a reception he hosted was, as alleged by the Times, a sex party. Archbishop Desmond Tutu steps down from his role as ambassador for Oxfam. Oxfamannounces it is setting up an independent commission,externalof leading women's rights experts to carry out a review of working culture and practices. It will also create a global database of referees to stop dishonest or unreliable references and triple its safeguarding budget. The charity's international executive director Winnie Byanyimapromises the charity would ""do justice"" and ""atone for the past"".She is the most senior Oxfam executive to speak on the issue. Oxfamagrees to stop bidding for UK government fundinguntil it can show it meets the ""high standards"" required, ministers say. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt says the charity has ""a long way to go"" before regaining public trust. Meanwhile, chief executive for Oxfam GB, Mark Goldring,tells the Guardian he believes attacks on the charityare ""out of proportion to the level of culpability"". Oxfam apologises in a full page advertisement in the Guardian. The ad was paid for by supporters rather than the charity Meanwhile, another charity - MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) -comes under scrutiny as the president of Haiticalls for an investigation into the activities of aid agencies working in his country. Jovenel MoÃ¯se, asks why MSF had repatriated 17 of its staff members. MSF said it takes seriously any reports of misconduct. In a separate story relating to alleged sexual misconduct in the charity sector, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox,Brendan Cox, quits two charities set up in her memory. Mr Cox denies assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 but admits ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. Oxfam publishes a redacted version of its 2011 internal report into alleged abuse by staff.,externalIt will present the original report to the government in Haiti. Thereport reveals that three of the men accused of sexual misconductphysically threatened witnesses during the charity's 2011 investigation. Oxfam boss Mark Goldring and two other senior executivesare hauled in front of MPs. The International Development Committee hears that around 7,000 people have cancelled donations to the charity. Mr Goldring apologises for the damage done and says 26 claims of sexual misconduct have been made since the scandal broke. This video can not be played Mark Goldring: 'We are sorry for the damage done to Haiti and the wider aid efforts' Save the Children chief executive Kevin Watkins also gives evidence and says his charity investigated 53 allegations in 2016. He says the Oxfam scandal has been a ""wake up call"" for the sector. Meanwhile, a former chief executive of Save the Children, Justin Forsyth,makes headlines over three claims of inappropriate behaviourhe received before leaving the charity. He says he has ""apologised unreservedly"" to the three workers. Oxfam suspects 'threatened' witnesses How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Reality Check: How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam?

UN aid agencies fear Oxfam backlash,"Oxfam staff are accused of paying vulnerable people for sex in Haiti in 2011 The news that Oxfam staff used prostitutes in Haiti has led to renewed focus on how the aid sector works, and what measures are in place to prevent abuse by aid workers. Headlines like ""Oxfam faces new sex scandal in South Sudan"" are certainly not flattering, and they come at a time when many countries are debating cutting foreign aid. How does this square with the more standard view of an aid worker: the selfless humanitarian who works in the most difficult conditions in order to improve the lives of the most vulnerable? Of course, there are no perfect saints, and probably no perfect sinners either, in any organisation. But the UN, which regularly uses organisations like Oxfam as implementing partners, is now struggling with a problem many suggest it should have addressed more publically decades ago. How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? Oxfam did not disclose 'full Haiti details' This week in Geneva, UN aid agencies took care to express their zero tolerance approach to sexual abuse. ""Every single report or allegation of sexual exploitation, harassment, or abuse is thoroughly assessed,"" said Andrej Mahecic of the UN Refugee Agency. ""If substantiated it leads to sanctions and summary dismissal."" ""We are in the process of introducing mandatory training for all staff, using existing UN courses on the prevention of sexual harassment and exploitation,"" added Tarik Jasarevic of the World Health Organisation. But is this enough? Andrew MacLeod, a former UN worker who has been highly critical of the UN system, believes they should have been more active long ago. ""No one working in aid will be surprised by this,"" he said. ""This is not just an issue about Oxfam, it's an issue in all aid agencies all over the world."" Since the Oxfam scandal broke, Mr MacLeod has given numerous interviews, and provided an assessment to the tabloid newspaper The Sun which ran the headline ""UN aid workers raped 60,000 people"". Asked by the BBC to substantiate the figures, Mr MacLeod said: ""I'm not claiming that to be a number of science."" So where did he get it? By looking at UN figures for 2016, he explained, which suggest there were 311 cases of sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers during that year. A further suggestion by the UN that the numbers would be higher led him to double that annual figure, and then multiply it by ten because generally only about 10% of rape cases are reported. That brought to him an approximate figure of 6000, which he then multiplied by ten again to cover a ten year period. ""Sensationalist and bombastic, zero creds,"" was the reaction of one female aid worker with years of experience in the field. ""Not the experience of any aid agency I have ever worked with."" Nevertheless, the UN knows it must now be much more transparent about what it is actually doing to combat cases of abuse. An Oxfam sign is seen in Corail, a camp for people displaced by the 2010 Haiti earthquake Scandals in the past, such as the sexual exploitation of trafficked women in Bosnia by UN peacekeepers, a ""sex for food"" scandal which implicated the World Food Programme in Liberia, and the abuse of children in the Central African Republic by French peacekeepers have all raised questions about the UN's ability to prevent abuse, and to prosecute it when it does occur. In fact, Judith Greenwood, Executive Director of the CHS (Core Humanitarian Standards) Alliance, says aid agencies and the UN do have ""the tools"" to tackle sexual abuse in the aid sector, although abuse committed by UN peacekeepers remains (at member states' insistence) the responsibility of the countries the peacekeepers come from. Pointing out that the Oxfam Haiti scandal dates back to 2011, Ms Greenwood said a lot of good policy and practice had been adopted since then. ""There is an interagency task team that specifically looks at accountability to the affected population. All of our member organisations (all the major aid agencies, including Oxfam) have to have clear procedures in place to tackle exploitation and abuse."" This video can not be played Oxfam employee Widza Bryant discusses the Haiti allegations with the BBC Meanwhile Unicef says any allegations of abuse of children in its care are referred to its executive director within 48 hours. They added: ""We are training our staff continuously in this, and we are improving our assistance to victims."" The UN this week also responded sharply to Andrew MacLeod's suggestion that UN aid workers committing abuse could get away with it because they enjoyed diplomatic immunity. ""Let's be clear about this. The answer is no,"" tweeted the secretary general's spokesperson. ""Sexual abuse is a crime. The UN does not and will not claim immunity in such cases."" But tweets and restatements of existing policy may not be enough to calm this debate, especially if there are more revelations of historic scandals. Allow Twitter content?

UN aid agencies are currently trying to deal with an unprecedented number of humanitarian crises, from Syria, to Yemen, to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Privately senior UN officials are concerned that the headlines may lead to a substantial loss of public support, and a consequent major cut in funding. That's an outcome that won't help anyone, they argue. And here, even UN critic Andrew MacLeod agrees. ""This is not an excuse to cut aid. This is an excuse to fix aid.""

Treatment for girl who cries blood,"This video can not be played Nikki is one of the first patients to try the treatment Researchers have found the genetic cause of a blood-vessel disorder that can cause deadly bleeds and stroke. Scientists at University College LondonInstitute of Child Health,externaland Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) who led the study, called it an ""enormous step"" towards understanding and treatingarteriovenous malformation (AVM),external. And they now believe targeted cancer drugs may be able to treat it. AVM, which usually worsens over time, can cause swelling and disfigurement. An AVM is an abnormal collection of blood vessels where high-pressure arterial blood feeds directly into low-pressure veins. Teams in London, Edinburgh and Cambridge, collaborated on the research, published in theJournal of Clinical Investigation,external. The researchers took biopsies from 160 children with blood vessel disorders including AVMs and sequenced the DNA in the affected tissue. They found four faulty genes that could trigger the condition, all involved in the signalling pathway between cell surface receptors and the nucleus. The same gene mutations are also involved in the growth of many cancers. There are several licensed cancer drugs that target the faulty RAS-MAPK pathway. The discovery means doctors now have the potential to treat AVMs with cancer drugs. Dr Veronica Kinsler,  consultant paediatric dermatologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and Wellcome Trust fellow at UCL, led the research. She told me: ""This is an enormous step for us.  Discovering the genetic causes of AVMs in individual patients means we are now able to suggest treatments which could potentially slow, stop or perhaps even reverse the growth of this condition in the longer term."" One of the patients involved in the research is Nikki Christou, 13. She has an AVM on the right side of her face and skull and can have a severe bleed at any time. Nikki told me: ""It can be very scary as the blood not only comes out of my nose but can flow down my throat and mouth and if it is really bad comes out of my tear ducts as well so I cry blood instead of water. ""I can become light-headed, and when the severe bleeds happen I need an ambulance."" Nikki has had 30 operations and hundreds of outpatient appointments. Her family set up theButterfly AVM Charity,externaland, along with the Wellcome Trust, were key funders for the research project. As a result of the findings, Nikki is now one of two patients taking a cancer treatment that targets the gene mutation in her AVM. Nikki has been taking the once-daily tablet for more than six months. A recent MRI scan suggested that her AVM had not worsened, but it will be more than a year before doctors know whether the treatment is effective. A clinical trial of the targeted cancer drugs is planned. Nikki has her own YouTube channel -Nikki Lilly,external, with 300,000 subscribers, and won CBBC's Junior Bake Off in 2016. She has also interviewed the prime minister. She says her key message is ""don't judge a book by its cover, it's what's on the inside that counts - people's personality and heart not the way they look"".

'Secret' report into RBS published,"After months of wrangling, MPs have released a report by the financial regulator which said a unit of RBS mistreated thousands of small firms.

However, she said there was an ""overwhelming"" public interest in its publication. ""The findings in the report are disgraceful. The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property,"" she said.

Brexit UK 'won't be Mad Max-style world'The Brexit secretary promises the UK will maintain high standards and regulations outside the EU.4h4 hours agoUK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played Will ministers be locked in a room 'all night'? Britain will not be ""plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction"" after it leaves the EU, the Brexit secretary has said. David Davis said the UK wanted to lead a ""global race to the top"" in rights and standards not, as some feared, a ""competitive race to the bottom"". British business could ""never be cheaper than China"" and must focus instead on product and service quality. He also suggested a Brexit deal by the end of 2018 was ""well on the cards"". The Brexit secretary's address to Austrian business leaders in Vienna is the latest in a series of speeches the UK government is calling ""the road to Brexit"" as it faces demands to spell out details of the future partnership it wants with the EU. The UK says it wants to avoid obstacles to smooth trade with the EU although it is leaving the single market and the customs union when Brexit happens in March 2019. Newsbeat: Social media's take on Mad Max Green dismisses Brexit 'conspiracy theories' Johnson: Let's unite around Brexit vision Mr Davis said this can be achieved if both sides recognise each other's standards and regulations, promising the UK will ""continue our track record of meeting high standards"" once outside the EU. The government has previously spoken of adopting a ""new economic model"" to stay competitive if it is locked out of the EU single market after Brexit, and Labour has claimed the UK could be turned into a ""low-wage, offshore tax haven"". Mr Davis hit back at the government's critics in his speech, invoking the Mad Max series of action films which portray societal collapse in a lawless future world. The first three Mad Max films in the 1980s were followed by Mad Max: Fury Road in 2015 ""They fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom,"" Mr Davis said. ""With Britain plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction. These fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing, not our history, not our intentions, not our national interest. ""But while I profoundly disagree with those who spread these fears â it does remind us all that we must provide reassurance."" Allow Twitter content?

The UK, he said, would never prosper in a new era of intensified globalisation by cutting standards since it ""would never be cheaper than China or have more resources than Brazil"". He said UK's post-Brexit economic relationship with the EU should be based on the principles of ""open trade and fair competition"". As part of this, once the UK has left, it would not allow firms heavily subsidised by EU governments ""unfettered access"" to its markets nor permit mergers between UK and EU firms which reduced consumer choice. Where we are with Brexit - in 300 words Brexit: All you need to know ""A crucial part of any such agreement is the ability for both sides to trust each other's regulations and the institutions that enforce them,"" he added. ""Such mutual recognition will naturally require close, even-handed co-operation between these authorities and a common set of principles to guide them."" Last year EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""simply impossible"" for the UK to adopt its own standards and regulations while also having them recognised automatically in the EU. Labour said past comments by some senior ministers showed they wanted to use Brexit as a vehicle to ""drive down"" environmental standards and employment rights when, instead, they should be extended. ""David Davis's promise... isn't worth the paper it's written on,"" said shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. The general secretary of the GMB union, Tim Roache, said: """"If the best this Government can do is promise Britain will not turn into a 'Mad Max' nightmare - it's no wonder people are worried about their post-Brexit lives."" The Institute of Directors' Allie Renison said they were ""pleased that Davis acknowledges the importance of keeping a level playing field on state aid and competition policy. Minimising trade barriers can and should go hand in hand with a future deal with the EU"". Trust levels in the UK were fairly high as EU finance ministers arrived for a regular meeting in Brussels today. After all, they have seen their British colleagues largely play by the rules for the last four decades. But what happens next? Luxembourg's finance minister sees it as a balance: stick to European standards and goods will flow freely between the two, go your own way and trade won't be as smooth. And the EU doesn't just want a pledge, they want rules, a process, a mechanism that binds the UK into what Brussels calls the Level Playing Field, or the LPF. Magdalena Andersson of Sweden summed up why, saying: ""Of course I trust David Davis but we don't know who will come after him some day in the future."" Allow Twitter content?

Mum admits murdering seven-week-old son,"Hannah Turtle initially denied murdering her son and administering a poison to him A woman has admitted murdering her baby son after changing her plea halfway through her trial. Hannah Turtle, 22, from Shotton in Flintshire, suffocated seven-week-old James Hughes in 2016. She stopped his breathing on two other occasions before she killed him - both times he was revived in hospital. Turtle also admitted five other child cruelty charges and administering James with an adult antidepressant at Mold Crown Court on Tuesday. Turtle - who claimed she had heard voices telling her she was a bad mother - sat in the dock crying as the jury was discharged by Mr Justice Lewis. Baby murder accused 'could not stop' Baby murder accused 'had depression' Mother 'smiled after killing baby' Prior to her guilty plea, prosecutor David Elias QC said Turtle accepted she stopped James breathing on three occasions within a 10-day period. ""We may never know why exactly she did this,"" Mr Elias had said. James Hughes died from brain damage caused by oxygen deprivation James was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital and kept in for observations, but the prosecution said he stopped breathing while Turtle was alone with him. He was admitted to hospital on two other occasions in the days before his death after Turtle pinched his nose to restrict his breathing. On 9 June 2016, she suffocated her son again but this time he did not recover and died in hospital on 13 June from brain damage due to oxygen deprivation. Gordon Cole QC, defending Turtle, said the jury had not heard psychiatric evidence but said post-natal depression was an issue in the case. The court heard while Turtle had no mental illness it had been agreed she suffered from a personality disorder. The judge said he had to impose a life-sentence for murder but he needed to fix the minimum term she should have to serve, and one of the key issues he must consider was her culpability. Turtle, who also admitted putting her own anti-depressant drug in his milk bottle, will be sentenced on Thursday.

Soaring rates of measles in Europe,"Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of contracting measles Europe has seen a big surge in measles cases in 2017, which the World Health Organization says is a tragedy after a record low of 5,273 cases in 2016. Cases increased four-fold, with more than 20,000 people affected and 35 deaths. Fifteen European region countries, including the UK, had large outbreaks. Measles cases were highest in Romania, Italy and Ukraine. People shunning vaccination is part of the problem, say experts. Although research published 20 years ago about a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism has been discredited, the scare it created damaged some people's trust of the vaccine. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be deadly. The MMR vaccine can prevent it. NZ city declares emergency as Gita hits 'Baby factory' dad wins paternity rights Tummy bloating can be ovarian cancer The WHO says there have been declines in overall routine immunisation coverage, as well as consistently low coverage among some marginalised groups and interruptions in vaccine supply or underperforming disease surveillance systems. Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, from the WHO, said: ""Every new person affected by measles in Europe reminds us that unvaccinated children and adults, regardless of where they live, remain at risk of catching the disease and spreading it to others who may not be able to get vaccinated. ""This short-term setback cannot deter us from our commitment to be the generation that frees our children from these diseases once and for all."" The UK saw 282 cases in 2017, linked to the continuing outbreak in Europe. The UK recently achieved WHO measleselimination status, meaning that for the past few years the number of cases has been low enough to stop the disease circulating around the country. The overall risk of measles to the UK population is low, but due to ongoing measles outbreaks in Europe, cases in unimmunised individuals and limited onward spread can occur. A few weeks ago, Public Health England warned about measles cases inseveral regions of England. At the end of January 2018, there were 51 confirmed cases in the West Midlands. The vaccine is given as two doses to very young children as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. Adults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they have not been fully immunised before. To prevent outbreaks, WHO says 95% of the population should be immunised. In the UK, coverage was 91.6% among young children in 2016-17. Measles symptoms include a runny nose, sneezing and cough, sore, red eyes, a high temperature and, after a few days, a red-brown blotchy rash. The main reason behind the sharp rise in measles cases is low immunisation coverage, the WHO says. They say a lack of coverage increases the risk of the virus spreading when it is brought in from abroad. But some European countries have seen an exceptionally high increase in rates. Romania is fighting its worst measles outbreak in decades. There were more than 5,500 cases last year, partly due to a shortage of the vaccine and poor healthcare facilities. It is also thought that the country's large Roma population, who often live in severe poverty, are at particular risk of contracting and spreading the virus. Italy had the second highest number of measles cases in Europe last year. In recent years, a loose group of campaigners against vaccinations, dubbed the anti-vax movement, has dissuaded Italians from opting in to immunisations by citing supposed risks. In response, the government ruled that children must be vaccinated against 12 common illnesses before they can enrol for state-run schools. This law is one of the key issues in the upcoming March 4 elections and some people are calling for it to be scrapped. Ukraine is also struggling with a measles outbreak, with almost 5,000 cases recorded in 2017. The WHO says countries that are experiencing conflict are at an increased risk of measles due to damaged health services and infrastructure. Romania - 5,562 cases Italy - 5,006 cases Ukraine - 4,767 cases Greece - 967 cases Germany - 927 cases Serbia - 702 cases Tajikistan - 649 cases France - 520 Russian Federation - 408 Belgium - 369 UK - 282 Bulgaria - 167 Spain - 152 Czech Republic - 146 Switzerland - 105 Measles outbreak in five English regions WHO Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Council sorry for 'Monroe Â£10 food' tweetThe original tweet said parents who could not meet this budget were ""indolent or dysfunctional"".1han hour agoBristol","A council leader has distanced himself from a tweet made by his party suggesting a family can be fed on Â£10 a week. The tweet, which has now been deleted, said parents who could not meet this budget were ""indolent or dysfunctional or more likely parents who simply don't know how to feed their children well"". It has enraged food writer Jack Monroe who was tagged in the original post. Tim Warren said Bath's Conservatives had now tweeted an apology. The original tweet, which appeared on Saturday, on the Bath Conservatives Association feed, said: ""The reality may be indolent or disfunctional (sic) parents or more likely parents who simply don't know how to feed their children well. ""If absolutely-not-a-Tory Jack Monroe @BootstrapCook could feed herself & her child for Â£10 a week - not easily, but adequately - most people can."" The campaigner and cookbook author is renowned for a blog about cooking for a family on a shoestring. Reacting on the blog, Monroe said: ""I took exception to the Conservatives holding me up as some kind of role model because, it was their policies that left me hungry, cold, almost homeless, moving house seventeen times with a child under my arm."" Monroe challenged the original tweeter to live on just Â£10 a week for three weeks running, but added: ""You won't even start to experience the daily grind of living in poverty. ""Poverty isn't just having no heating, or not quite enough food, or unplugging your fridge and turning your hot water off. ""Poverty is the sinking feeling when your small boy finishes his one weetabix and says 'more mummy, bread and jam please mummy' as you're wondering whether to take the TV or the guitar to the pawn shop first, and how to tell him that there is no bread and jam."" Mr Warren, leader of BANES council, said he did not agree with the contents of the original tweet and it was ""ill-judged"" and ""outrageous"". Allow Twitter content?

"State of emergency as Gita floods NZThe storm, which caused widespread damage in Tonga and Fiji last week, has now hit New Zealand.2h2 hours agoAsia","Debris carried by a river rests at a bridge in the northern region of Bainham New Zealand has begun cleaning up after being hit by the remnants of Cyclone Gita, which damaged buildings and left thousands without power. Four regions across the country remain in a state of emergency, though the status has been lifted for the city of Christchurch. Up to 1,000 people are still stranded in Golden Bay on the South Island due to flooding. Authorities say they may send ferries to pick them up. But Christchurch has largely escaped flooding, having received about half the amount of rain originally forecast. ""We were lucky this time,"" said Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel, who lifted the state of emergency at 11:00 local time on Wednesday (2200 GMT on Tuesday).

Fresh strikes on Syria enclave kill dozens,"This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" The death toll from two days of bombing by Syria's government of a rebel-held area has risen to 250, reports say. It is the worst violence in the Eastern Ghouta area near Damascus since 2013, according to activists. More than 50 children are among the dead, they say. The UN has warned that the situation is ""spiralling out of control"". Meanwhilethe Damascus government has sent forces to confront Turkish troopswho have crossed the border to push back the Kurds in northern Syria. Turkey fired shells near the advancing columns, which, it claims, forced the pro-government fighters into retreat. The Syrian military has not commented on the reports from the Eastern Ghouta but says it carried out ""precision strikes"" on areas from which the shells were launched. A UN spokesperson said at least six hospitals had been hit in the area on Monday and Tuesday. Pro-government forces - backed by Russia - intensified their efforts to retake the last major rebel stronghold on Sunday night. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said at least 250 people had been killed in air strikes and artillery fire since then. A makeshift hospital was set up in Douma - one of the several towns under bombardment It said it was the highest 48-hour death toll sincea 2013 chemical attack on the besieged enclave. About 1,200 people were injured. Activists say at least 10 towns and villages across the Eastern Ghouta came under renewed bombardment on Tuesday. The UN called for a ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered and the wounded to be evacuated. Syria country profile By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor After seven years, Syria's war is not ending but it is changing. President Assad now looks like he is trying to roll up this final major enclave around Damascus - the Eastern Ghouta. This would secure his victory around the capital, and would be a very big moment. But Syria remains linked into a web of war and power politics, which guarantees more conflict. Up in the north, there are a whole host of big powers completing for influence: Russia, Iran, Turkey and the United States. British Special Forces are there, too. Iran is seen as a particularly big threat by the Americans, the Israelis, who are also getting involved increasingly, and the Saudis, who have been big players in the war as well. While the cast of characters is changing, the bloodshed continues and it is certainly not over. A local doctor told the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations, which supports medical facilities in the Eastern Ghouta, that it was ""catastrophic"". ""People have nowhere to turn,"" he said. ""They are trying to survive but their hunger from the siege has weakened them significantly."" The UN's co-ordinator in Syria, Panos Moumtzis, said he was ""appalled"" by reports that hospitals had been deliberately targeted,warning that such attacks might amount to war crimes,external. Five hospitals in Marj, Saqba and Douma were left inoperable or partially functioning after reported government strikes on Monday, while on Tuesday a hospital in Zamalka was hit, according to Mr Moumtzis. The Syrian American Medical Society said a hospital in Arbin was also put out of service on Tuesday. The Syrian Observatory said the facility had been targeted by Russian warplanes. The government has allowed one humanitarian convoy into the Eastern Ghouta since late November, and there are severe shortages of food. A bundle of bread now costs close to 22 times the national average and 12% of children under five years old are said to be acutely malnourished. This video can not be played Father describes a 'miserable day for Eastern Ghouta' The Eastern Ghouta is dominated by the Islamist faction Jaysh al-Islam. But Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, also operates there. The region has been designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by Russia and Iran, the government's main allies, along with Turkey, which backs the rebels, but hostilities intensified in mid-November. On Tuesday, Syrian pro-government forces entered the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, just south of the Turkish border. Turkey is trying to oust the Kurdish militia, which have semi-autonomous rule of the area and which have called on the Syrian military for help. Syria has denounced the Turkish offensive as a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty, while Turkey has insisted it will not back down. This video can not be played Pro-government forces waved Syrian flags as they entered Afrin, in footage posted by the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah Syrian government forces, supported by Russian air strikes and Iran-backed militias, are also carrying out offensives on the north-western province of Idlib. The UN says more than 300,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in Idlib since December. Meanwhile,Russia's foreign ministry acknowledged that dozens of its citizens and people from other former Soviet states were killed or woundedin a recent battle. It gave no details, but it is believed to be a reference to an incident in the eastern province of Deir al-Zour on 7 February, when the US military said it had killed an estimated 100 pro-Syrian government fighters in response to an attack on an allied, Kurdish-led militia force battling Islamic State militants in the area.

Syrian forces pound rebel enclave,"This video can not be played Children were among those rescued after Monday's air strikes in Eastern Ghouta Bombardments by Syrian government forces have killed at least 100 people including 20 children in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area outside Damascus, rescue teams and monitors say. This would make Monday one of the deadliest days for the district since it came under siege in 2013. The Syria Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, said bombs were continuing to fall on Tuesday morning. Syrian forces stepped up an offensive to retake the areaearlier this month. The Eastern Ghouta is the last major opposition enclave near the capital and is completely surrounded by areas under government control. Local Co-ordination Committees, an opposition activist network, reports that civilians have been killed and wounded in fresh air strikes on Douma, Misraba and al-Nashabiya. The White Helmets, a rescue group, said three people were killed in Misraba and four were killed in al-Marj on Tuesday. The UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) and the White Helmets both said more than 100 people had died in bombing on Monday. Urging a halt to the bombardment, a UN official said the situation was spiralling out of control. Children have been hurt in the latest bombing Last week the Eastern Ghouta, home to almost 400,000 people, received its first aid delivery in almost three months. Meanwhile,Turkey warned the Syrian government not to help Kurds fighting against Turkish forces in northern Syria. Why is there a war in Syria? Syrian timeline Analysis by Lina Sinjab, BBC Middle East correspondent The attacks on the Eastern Ghouta area since Sunday have hit not only civilians but also their means of survival, targeting bakeries, warehouses and anything else that may hold food supplies. It is the worst single day of bombing that people there have seen in years. People are fearful of it becoming another Aleppo scenario. Aid workers say the attacks targeted major roads in the area, which will block any aid or rescue operation and hinder the movement of ambulances. The death toll is rising because medical facilities were also hit. Four makeshift hospitals, including a maternity facility, were struck on Monday. The rebels have been responding with mortar attacks on Damascus but the government's military might is far stronger. Videos from Hamouria, a town in the enclave where at least 20 people were reportedly killed in air strikes on Monday, showed people fleeing heavily damaged buildings covered in dust and debris. In December international aid organisations warned conditions in the rebel-held area had reached a ""critical point"" for civilians because of shortages of food, fuel and medicines. UN regional humanitarian co-ordinator Panos Moumtzis said it was ""imperative"" to end the ""senseless human suffering"" in the Eastern Ghouta. ""Many residents have little choice but to take shelter in basements and underground bunkers with their children,"" he noted. However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said conditions in the enclave were being exaggerated by international actors. ""In the UN, the topic of humanitarian problems in the Eastern Ghouta and Idlib is being actively hyped up,"" he said, according to Russian media reports. This video can not be played Father describes a 'miserable day for Eastern Ghouta' Next month marks seven years of civil conflict in Syria. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and an estimated five million have fled the country. It is an agricultural belt, about 15km (nine miles) east from Damascus city centre. The area is made up of 22 communities. It has been designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by Russia and Iran, the Syrian government's main allies, along with Turkey, which backs the opposition. Several rebel groups operate in the Eastern Ghouta, but it is dominated by the Islamist faction Jaish al-Islam. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, also has a presence there.

State of emergency as Gita floods NZ,"Debris carried by a river rests at a bridge in the northern region of Bainham New Zealand has begun cleaning up after being hit by the remnants of Cyclone Gita, which damaged buildings and left thousands without power. Four regions across the country remain in a state of emergency, though the status has been lifted for the city of Christchurch. Up to 1,000 people are still stranded in Golden Bay on the South Island due to flooding. Authorities say they may send ferries to pick them up. But Christchurch has largely escaped flooding, having received about half the amount of rain originally forecast. ""We were lucky this time,"" said Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel, who lifted the state of emergency at 11:00 local time on Wednesday (2200 GMT on Tuesday).

'Astonishing' Roman boxing gloves found,"The gloves were ""skilfully made"" about 2,000 years ago Roman boxing gloves unearthed during an excavation near Hadrian's Wall have gone on public display. Experts at Vindolanda, near Hexham, in Northumberland, believe they are ""probably the only known surviving examples from the Roman period"". Dr Andrew Birley, Vindolanda Trust director of excavations, described the leather bands as an ""astonishing"" find. The gloves were discovered last summer along with a hoard of writing tablets, swords, shoes and bath clogs. Made of leather, they were designed to fit snugly over the knuckles and have the appearance of a protective guard. Dr Birley said: ""I have seen representations of Roman boxing gloves depicted on bronze statues, paintings and sculptures, but to have the privilege of finding two real leather examples is exceptionally special. ""The hairs stand up on the back of your neck when you realise you have discovered something as astonishing as these boxing gloves."" The larger of the two is filled with natural material, which would have acted as a shock absorber. The smaller glove, found ""in near perfect condition"", is filled with a coil of hard, twisted leather. It is understood they would have been used for sparring sessions as they do not have metal inserts used in ancient boxing bouts.

How the Oxfam scandal unfolded,"The scandal has rocked the charity, which has apologised and promised to 'atone for the past' Oxfam, one of the UK's biggest charities, has dominated the headlines in recent weeks following allegations its staff hired prostitutes while working overseas. Since then, the story has continued to develop, with the Charity Commission launching a statutory inquiry - the most serious action it can take. Oxfam - which has nearly 10,000 staff working in more than 90 countries - denies any cover-up. Here is a summary of the events so far: The Times newspaper publishes a front page article under the headline: ""Top Oxfam staff paid Haiti survivors for sex"". The article alleges thatOxfam covered up claims that senior staff working in Haitiin the wake of the 2010 earthquake used prostitutes, some of whom may have been underage. The Times broke the story on its front page Among the male staff accused of sexual misconduct is Oxfam's then-director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren. He is alleged to have used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by the charity. In a statement,Oxfam denies claims of a cover-up,external. It says the behaviour of its staff was ""totally unacceptable"". The charity says it uncovered the accusations in 2011 and immediately launched an internal investigation. According to Oxfam's own 2011 report, four members of staff were dismissed and three, including Mr Van Hauwermeiren, were allowed to resign before the end of the investigation. It says claims of underage girls being involved were unproven. Roland Van Hauwermeiren, who denies paying for sex Oxfam adds thatit had publicly announced the investigation at the time. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock orders Oxfam to hand over all the evidence to the Charity Commission. The Charity Commissionsays it was not given full details,externalabout the use of prostitutes by aid workers. It says it would have acted differently if it had known all the facts. In a fresh story, the Times says Oxfam did not warn other aid agencies about problem staff caught using prostitutes. It emerges that Mr Van Hauwermeiren went on to work elsewhere in the aid sector. Oxfam's chief executive, Mark Goldring, says the charity did ""anything but"" cover up the incident. But he admits the 2011 report released by the charity did not give details of the revelations, and only referred to them as ""serious misconduct"". Oxfam GB's chief executive Mark Goldring and chair of trustees Caroline Thomson leave the Department for International Development Oxfamis hit with further allegations that staff on its mission to Chad,,externalalso led by Mr Van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes in 2006. The Sunday Timesalso reports new claims,externalalleging more than 120 workers from UK charities were accused of sexual abuse in the past year. Meanwhile, Oxfamannounces new measures,externalfor the prevention and handling of sexual abuse cases. Oxfam's chair of trustees, Caroline Thomson, says staff members had been coming forward with ""concerns about how staff were recruited and vetted"" following the recent media reports. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt warns that ministers could cut off funding for Oxfam if it cannot account for the way it handled claims. Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrenceresigns over the handling of the sex scandal. She says she is ""ashamed"" and takes full responsibility. Penny Lawrence, who resigned as deputy chief executive of the charity, said concerns were raised about staff behaviour in Chad and Haiti The Charity Commission, which regulates the industry,opens a statutory inquiry into Oxfam,external- the most serious action it can take. The watchdog says it has concerns that Oxfam ""may not have fully and frankly disclosed"" everything it knew about the claims. The European Commission, which gave â¬1.7m to Oxfam's Haiti programme in 2011, threatens it is ready to ""cease funding any partner not living up to high ethical standards"". Thepresident of Haiti, Jovenel MoÃ¯se, condemns Oxfam,externaland says the actions were an ""extremely serious violation of human dignity"". A senior government source in Haiticonfirms an investigation will be launchedinto foreign aid agencies operating there. President Jovenel Moise condemned ""sexual predator"" staff exploiting ""needy people in their moment of greatest vulnerability"" Actress Minnie Driverbecomes the first famous face to cut ties with Oxfam. In a statement Ms Driver, who stepped down from her role as a celebrity ambassador for the charity, said she was ""nothing short of horrified"" by the allegations. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, a former colleague of Roland Van Hauwermeirentells the IRIN news website,externalthat he was investigated by British health charity Merlin after allegations of using prostitutes in Liberia in 2004, before he was employed by Oxfam. The Charity Commissionsays it is looking into these reports. Oxfam confirms that more than 1,200 peoplecancelled their direct debit payments to the charityon the Saturday, Sunday and Monday after the first reports of the scandal emerged. The former Oxfam director at the centre of the accusations, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, 68,denies paying for sex but admits some ""mistakes"". Inan open letter to Belgian media in Dutch,external, he denies that a reception he hosted was, as alleged by the Times, a sex party. Archbishop Desmond Tutu steps down from his role as ambassador for Oxfam. Oxfamannounces it is setting up an independent commission,externalof leading women's rights experts to carry out a review of working culture and practices. It will also create a global database of referees to stop dishonest or unreliable references and triple its safeguarding budget. The charity's international executive director Winnie Byanyimapromises the charity would ""do justice"" and ""atone for the past"".She is the most senior Oxfam executive to speak on the issue. Oxfamagrees to stop bidding for UK government fundinguntil it can show it meets the ""high standards"" required, ministers say. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt says the charity has ""a long way to go"" before regaining public trust. Meanwhile, chief executive for Oxfam GB, Mark Goldring,tells the Guardian he believes attacks on the charityare ""out of proportion to the level of culpability"". Oxfam apologises in a full page advertisement in the Guardian. The ad was paid for by supporters rather than the charity Meanwhile, another charity - MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) -comes under scrutiny as the president of Haiticalls for an investigation into the activities of aid agencies working in his country. Jovenel MoÃ¯se, asks why MSF had repatriated 17 of its staff members. MSF said it takes seriously any reports of misconduct. In a separate story relating to alleged sexual misconduct in the charity sector, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox,Brendan Cox, quits two charities set up in her memory. Mr Cox denies assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 but admits ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. Oxfam publishes a redacted version of its 2011 internal report into alleged abuse by staff.,externalIt will present the original report to the government in Haiti. Thereport reveals that three of the men accused of sexual misconductphysically threatened witnesses during the charity's 2011 investigation. Oxfam boss Mark Goldring and two other senior executivesare hauled in front of MPs. The International Development Committee hears that around 7,000 people have cancelled donations to the charity. Mr Goldring apologises for the damage done and says 26 claims of sexual misconduct have been made since the scandal broke. This video can not be played Mark Goldring: 'We are sorry for the damage done to Haiti and the wider aid efforts' Save the Children chief executive Kevin Watkins also gives evidence and says his charity investigated 53 allegations in 2016. He says the Oxfam scandal has been a ""wake up call"" for the sector. Meanwhile, a former chief executive of Save the Children, Justin Forsyth,makes headlines over three claims of inappropriate behaviourhe received before leaving the charity. He says he has ""apologised unreservedly"" to the three workers. Oxfam suspects 'threatened' witnesses How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Reality Check: How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam?

William Hill fined for lax criminal controlsThe Gambling Commission says 10 customers were able to deposit money linked to criminal offences.,"This video can not be played Tim Miller of the Gambling Commission said the penalty could rise if more people come forward Betting firm William Hill has been hit with a Â£6.2m penalty package for breaching anti-money-laundering and social responsibility regulations. The Gambling Commission said the company did not do enough to ensure prevention measures were effective. As a result, 10 customers were able to deposit money linked to criminal offences and William Hill gained Â£1.2m. The company was found to have not done enough to determine the source of the money or if they were problem gamblers. The penalty is the second biggest imposed by the Commission, following last year's Â£7.8m action against betting firm 888. In a statement, the Gambling Commission said William Hill's senior management ""failed to mitigate risks and have sufficient numbers of staff to ensure their anti-money-laundering and social responsibility processes were effective"". William Hill said it had co-operated with the Commission during the investigation. It added it had  committed to an independent review and would work to implement any recommendations following this review. Gambling Commission executive director Tim Miller told the BBC that William Hill should have been ""checking the source of money and understanding their customers and ensuring that potentially vulnerable customers are properly protected"". The investigation by the Gambling Commission covered the period between November 2014 and August 2016. It gave some examples of where it said William Hill's controls were insufficient: One customer deposited about Â£541,000 over a 14-month period after William Hill assumed his potential income was Â£365,000 a year, ""based on a verbal conversation and without further probing"". In fact, the customer was earning about Â£30,000 a year and was funding his gambling habit by stealing from his employer. Another customer exceeded deposits of Â£147,000 over 18 months with an escalating spend and losses of Â£112,000. William Hill's systems identified the issue, ""but its only response over a 12-month period was to send two automated social responsibility emails. Our view is that this action alone was not sufficient, given the customer's gambling behaviour, coupled with the severity of the losses."" A customer was allowed to deposit Â£653,000 in an 18-month period which activated a financial alert at William Hill. The alert resulted in a grading of ""amber risk"", which meant the customer's profile should have been reviewed under the company's anti-money-laundering policy. The file was marked as passed to managers for review, but that did not happen because of a systems failure. The customer was able to continue gambling for a further six months, despite continuing to activate financial alerts. William Hill will pay more than Â£5m for breaching the regulations and ""divest themselves of the Â£1.2m they earned from transactions with the 10 customers"", the Commission said. The company now has to appoint external auditors to review the effectiveness and implementation of its anti-money laundering and social responsibility policies and procedures Neil McArthur, executive director at the Gambling Commission, said: ""This was a systemic failing at William Hill which went on for nearly two years and today's penalty package - which could exceed Â£6.2m - reflects the seriousness of the breaches."" For the wider industry, the timing of William Hill's fine could not be worse. The government is weeks away from a crucial decision on fixed-odds betting terminals, the gambling machines found in high-street bookmakers up and down the country. The maximum stake could be cut from Â£100 to as low as Â£2. If it is at the bottom end of the range, the consequences for industry profitability would be enormous. There would also be far-reaching ramifications for the High Street - some estimate as many as 3,000 shops would close - and for revenue for the horse-racing industry. In a statement, William Hill chief executive Philip Bowcock said: ""William Hill has fully co-operated with the Commission throughout this process, introducing new and improved policies and increased levels of resourcing. ""We have also committed to an independent process review and will work to implement any recommendations that emerge from that review. ""We are fully committed to operating a sustainable business that properly identifies risk and better protects customers. ""We will continue to assist the Commission and work with other operators to improve practices in the areas identified."" Mr Miller said the Gambling Commission was sending a message to the industry as a whole that ""you need to take your responsibility seriously, you need to get this right"". ""We are always taking regulatory action and I don't think this will be the last action we take,"" he added.

Jamie Oliver closes flagship restaurant,"Barbecoa specialises in grilled meats Jamie Oliver's two flagship London restaurants have gone into administration, although the celebrity chef immediately bought one back. His upmarket Barbecoa steak restaurant in London's Piccadilly will close a year after it was re-launched. The other outlet, near St Paul's Cathedral, has been saved after the chef bought it for an undisclosed sum via a newly-created subsidiary. The move comes as Mr Oliver makes cuts in other parts of his business. Barbecoa St Paul's was bought back under a so-called pre-pack arrangement, which allows the purchase of the best assets of a business before it actually goes into administration. The Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group was already cutting costs in other areas, despite the chef putting Â£3m of his own money into the business in December. What's eating the restaurant trade? Last month it announced that it was shutting down 12 of its 37 Jamie's Italian restaurants - the mainstay of the group - as part of a rescue plan with creditors that would enable it to continue trading. The closure of the 12 restaurants will affect at least 200 jobs. This video can not be played Jamie Oliver's two flagship London restaurants have gone into administration. Court documents revealed that Jamie's Italian had debts of Â£71.5m. These included: Â£30.2m of overdrafts and loans Â£41.3m owed to landlords, HM Revenue and Customs, suppliers and other creditors, including Â£2.2m in wages owed to staff However, Â£47m of the debts are covered by loans from HSBC Bank and Jamie Oliver's other companies. The chain also closed down six Jamie's Italian restaurants in January 2017. At the time,the company saidthat the closures were due to uncertainties caused by Brexit and a ""tough"" market. Other British restaurant chains have been struggling in recent months. In January, burger chain Byron announced that it too had entered into a company voluntary arrangement, which would mean thatup to 20 Byron burger restaurants would need to close. Mr Oliver has seen several setbacks to his business in recent years. In 2017, he closed the last of his Union Jacks restaurants and also shut his magazine Jamie, which had been running for almost 10 years. In 2015, he admitted that about 40% of his business ventures had gone wrong and cost him money, but said those mistakes had taught him ""powerful"" lessons. Other parts of his business empire have been trading strongly. Jamie Oliver Holdings, which controls his media businesses, including books, made profits of Â£5.4m in 2016 (the most recent year of accounts available). Meanwhile Jamie Oliver Licensing, which makes money from ranges of products carrying his name made Â£7.3m. Whatâs eating the restaurant trade?

Oxfam boss 'sorry' over Haiti scandal,"This video can not be played Mark Goldring: 'We are sorry for the damage done to Haiti and the wider aid efforts' About 7,000 people have stopped making regular donations to Oxfam since it emerged some of its staff used prostitutes in Haiti, MPs have heard. Oxfam boss Mark Goldring apologised to the International Development Committee for the damage done to people in Haiti and the wider efforts of aid workers. He said 26 claims of sexual misconduct had been made since the scandal broke. Save the Children's Kevin Watkins also gave evidence, saying his charity had investigated 53 allegations in 2016. Mr Goldring and two other senior Oxfam executives faced an uncomfortable morning of questions from MPs about the sexual misconduct of the charity's workers in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010. Oxfam chief: 'Attacks out of proportion' UN aid agencies fear Oxfam backlash The urgent session, called by the committee in response to allegations appearing earlier this month in the Times newspaper, was marked by repeated apologies. Oxfam, which has almost 10,000 staff working in more than 90 countries, has denied a cover-up but its handling of the scandalis being investigated by the Charity Commission. Since the story broke, Mr Goldring, who became chief executive in 2013, said 26 reports of recent and historical incidents had been made by Oxfam workers - 16 of them outside the UK. Of the scandal, he said: ""I am sorry, we are sorry, for the damage Oxfam has done both to the people of Haiti but also to wider efforts for aid and development by possibly undermining public support."" He denied there had been a cover-up, saying Oxfam had been trying to deliver a huge programme with 500 staff, and his predecessors would have believed they were making the right decision at the time. ""I don't defend that decision,"" he said. This video can not be played Winnie Byanyima: 'It hurts me that Oxfam is facing these questions' Mr Goldring also said he was ""deeply sorry"" for hisremarks in a Guardian interviewin defence of Oxfam when he said the attacks on the charity were as if it had ""murdered babies in their cots"". He told MPs that at the time of the original investigation, Oxfam issued a press release revealing its findings of ""serious misconduct"" involving bullying, intimidation and breaches of the charity's code of conduct - but did not mention sexual exploitation. ""At the time, people thought that was being transparent. We know now that that was not enough,"" said Mr Goldring. ""I suspect there was a balance of saying 'Oxfam is delivering life-saving assistance to a million people in Haiti. We have got to keep that work going'."" He added: ""Not every organisation chooses to tell the public about something they got wrong."" He said there was now a safeguarding team and helpline at Oxfam and the charity was seeking more independent support. Caroline Thomson, the chair of trustees since 2017, and Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International, both told the committee they were ""ashamed"" of what happened in Haiti. Ms Byanyima said the situation was ""painful"" as she has spent her life protecting women. The number of lost donations referred to by Mr Goldring relates to direct debits. Oxfam confirmed later it had lost 7,094 direct debits - representing about 3.5% of the total number of donations received through that method. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Committee chairman Stephen Twigg said MPs would conduct a full inquiry into sexual misconduct in the aid sector. Save the Children UK's chief executive Mr Watkins told the committee said his charity had produced two reports warning that ""predatory men"" were seeking to use aid work as an opportunity for abuse. ""What has come to light over the past few weeks cautions all of us against complacency,"" he said. This video can not be played Kevin Watkins: ""If I sat here and told you I felt we were doing enough, that would be complacency"" He said Save the Children has been pushing for an ""international humanitarian passport"", which could be revoked if aid workers breach rules. Mr Watkins said of the 53 ""safeguarding cases"" it had investigated in 2016, 20 files had been passed to police and 11 staff members had been dismissed. He added across Save The Children UK and International there were 35 cases of staff harassment reported and 19 staff dismissed. A redacted version of an internal Oxfam report from 2011,external, released on Monday, revealed that three of the men accused of sexual misconduct in Haiti physically threatened witnesses during an investigation. It also showed an employee was dismissed and three resigned for using prostitutes on Oxfam premises and the use of underage prostitutes was not ruled out. During the committee hearing, it emerged that one of them was re-employed for Oxfam on a short-term contract in another country. Mr Van Hauwermeiren worked in Chad from 2006-09 before going to Haiti in 2010 In the report, the charity said director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, ""admitted using prostitutes"" at his Oxfam residence. Last week, he denied paying prostitutes for sex. He was granted a ""phased and dignified exit"" and was allowed to resign, the report added, so long as he fully co-operated with the rest of the 2011 investigation.

Call to make 'upskirting' an offenceCampaigners say the law needs to change to make it easier for police to take action.,"This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting ""Upskirting"" should be made a specific sexual offence, after police data showed a 10-year-old girl was among those targeted, campaigners say. Secretly photographing underneath a skirt is not a specific offence in England and Wales. The Ministry of Justice says that upskirting is currently covered by alternative avenues of prosecution. There have been just 11 charges related to the practice since 2015, a Freedom of Information request found. The FoI request, made by the Press Association, found only 15 out of 44 police forces contacted held records - a situation campaigners describe as ""wholly inadequate"". Upskirting has been an offence in Scotland since 2010,externalwhen it was listed under the broadened definition of voyeurism. A day after the department said the law on upskirting was ""under constant review"", an MoJ spokesman said that, as powers to enable prosecutions ""already exist"", a change in law was not needed. In a statement, the MoJ said it was ""up to prosecutors to decide if there is sufficient evidence for them to move forward, the issue is not with the laws in place."" 'Upskirting': It happened to me Labour urges 'upskirt' photography ban I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back MP Maria Miller, who chairs the Commons' women and equalities select committee, said more must be done to stop a ""horrific crime"" and that a stronger legal framework ""can help"" begin to tackle it. She said: ""Attempting to take a photograph underneath a skirt is a gross violation of privacy and potentially an act of indecency"". As there is no law specifically naming and banning upskirting, victims and police are presently only able to pursue offences of voyeurism or indecency. The FoI request found the police pursued 78 offences related to upskirting since 2015, but only 11 led to alleged offenders being charged. There was insufficient evidence to proceed in several cases, including in regard to an alleged sexual offence on a 10-year-old girl in 2015, Avon and Somerset Police said. Upskirting took place in a wide variety of public spaces, including nightclubs, shops and restaurants - with mobile phones frequently used and young women disproportionately targeted. Devon and Cornwall - alleged offences included taking an indecent photograph of a child, voyeurism and conspiring to outrage public decency. One victim said she turned around to see an offender bent over on the floor with his camera up her skirt. Five people were charged. The known victims aged from 25 to 47. Lincolnshire - one alleged offence involved a man seen on CCTV taking pictures up women's skirts without their knowledge. Another man was spotted by security staff at a McDonald's restaurant at Cornhill, Lincoln, lying under the stairs and looking up ""young girls' skirts"". Nottingham - of the six reported incidents, two resulted in criminal charges. In one case, a man was seen following a woman around a shop, and taking a picture up her skirt when she approached the checkout. Clare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University and an expert on sexual violence, said the FoI data showed there ""are few public places where women are free from this abuse"". She said: ""The government's continuing failure to provide an effective criminal law against upskirting breaches women's human rights."" She added women were entitled to protection, privacy and ""a law that is fit for purpose"", by treating the act as sexual abuse. ""Only then will victims feel more willing to come forward and report to the police and support prosecutions,"" she said. Voyeurism only applies to filming actions taking place in private Outraging public decency usually requires someone to have witnessed the action but upskirting is often unobserved It may be only discovered later because footage ends up on the internet It also has to take place in public - some spaces like schools might not count as public Unlike other sexual offences, people don't have automatic right to anonymity Campaigners say the current situationresembles that of revenge porn: the practice of posting online explicit material without the subject's consent, which was only made illegal in April 2015, after a national campaign. They argue the ambiguity surrounding upskirting is similar, and that a specific offence needs to be created so the police can pursue more cases. Sarah Green, for the End Violence Against Women coalition, described the police figures as ""very concerning, even though only a minority of police forces were able to respond because the behaviour is not classified as an offence"". She said: ""The police responses show that the police are clearly struggling to recognise upskirting distinctly, even though the disclosures reveal that it is commonly connected to existing sexual offences including voyeurism and sexual assault. ""It is notable that girls and young women are disproportionately targeted where that information has been recorded. The law should be urgently examined in this area.""

"'Astonishing' Roman boxing gloves foundThe bands of leather are ""probably the only known surviving examples"" of their kind.2h2 hours agoTyne & Wear","The gloves were ""skilfully made"" about 2,000 years ago Roman boxing gloves unearthed during an excavation near Hadrian's Wall have gone on public display. Experts at Vindolanda, near Hexham, in Northumberland, believe they are ""probably the only known surviving examples from the Roman period"". Dr Andrew Birley, Vindolanda Trust director of excavations, described the leather bands as an ""astonishing"" find. The gloves were discovered last summer along with a hoard of writing tablets, swords, shoes and bath clogs. Made of leather, they were designed to fit snugly over the knuckles and have the appearance of a protective guard. Dr Birley said: ""I have seen representations of Roman boxing gloves depicted on bronze statues, paintings and sculptures, but to have the privilege of finding two real leather examples is exceptionally special. ""The hairs stand up on the back of your neck when you realise you have discovered something as astonishing as these boxing gloves."" The larger of the two is filled with natural material, which would have acted as a shock absorber. The smaller glove, found ""in near perfect condition"", is filled with a coil of hard, twisted leather. It is understood they would have been used for sparring sessions as they do not have metal inserts used in ancient boxing bouts.

'Baby factory' dad wins paternity rights,"Nine babies were found in a Bangkok flat in 2014 A Bangkok court has awarded paternity rights to a Japanese man over 13 babies he fathered through Thai surrogate mothers. The ruling allows Mitsutoki Shigeta, 28, to pursue custody of the children. The son of a wealthy entrepreneur, he caused controversy in 2014 when he was revealed to have fathered at least 16 babies via surrogates in Thailand. His so-called ""baby factory"" case and others led to Thailand banning commercial surrogacy for foreigners. Mr Shigeta, who was not present at the trial, was awarded ""sole parent"" rights after the Thai surrogates forfeited their rights, according to the court, which did not name him. ""For the happiness and opportunities which the 13 children will receive from their biological father, who does not have a history of bad behaviour, the court rules that all 13 born from surrogacy to be legal children of the plaintiff,"" Bangkok's Central Juvenile Court said in a statement. The corner of Europe where women rent out their wombs Thailand's crackdown on 'wombs for rent' Mr Shigeta was awarded custody of his three other children in 2015. In 2014, he was investigated by Interpol for human trafficking after it emerged he had fathered 16 surrogate children in Thailand. His Bangkok apartment was raided and police found nine surrogate babies, nannies and a pregnant surrogate mother there. He left Thailand soon after, but later sued the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security for custody of the children. You may also like: Pyeongchang's 'best and worst' Olympian Drinking cobra blood to survive the jungle Anger at supermodel's new year message By Jonathan Head, BBC News, South East Asia correspondent When a blurred airport security photo was published, more than three years ago, of Mitsutoki Shigeta, holding an infant as he left Thailand, there was fevered speculation over his motives for siring so many children with surrogate mothers. Some of the children had already been taken to Cambodia, and the Thai police began investigating him for possible human trafficking. But his lawyer insisted he simply wanted a very large family, and that as the son of a wealthy Japanese entrepreneur he was able to look after them properly. A court in Bangkok has now accepted that explanation: Thai officials told the court they had travelled to Cambodia and Japan, and found he had enough carers and facilities to bring up the 13 children who are still in state care in Thailand. Few details are known about the background of Mr Shigeta. According to Japanese media, he is the son of an IT billionaire and paid between $9,300 (Â£6,600) and $12,500 to each of the surrogate mothers. Thai media says Mr Shigeta is unmarried, owns several companies himself and has already made plans for the future of his children, including setting up trust funds for them. After leaving Thailand four years ago, he was thought to have moved to Hong Kong and currently lives in Japan again. Media reports also suggest he might have travelled to India and Ukraine to father children there. The 13 children will not immediately be transferred into Mr Shigeta's custody. His lawyer told AFP news agency that he would contact the Social Welfare Ministry about next steps, adding that the timelines still had to be agreed to avoid ""abrupt changes"" for the children. Mr Shigeta's case shed light on Thailand's booming surrogacy industry, as did the case of ""Baby Gammy"" which also emerged in 2014. Baby Gammy's Thai surrogate mother alleged that he was abandoned by his Australian parents after they found out he had Down's Syndrome. They took his twin sister home. An Australian court later cleared the family of abandonment.

William Hill fined Â£6.2m for lax controls,"This video can not be played Tim Miller of the Gambling Commission said the penalty could rise if more people come forward Betting firm William Hill has been hit with a Â£6.2m penalty package for breaching anti-money-laundering and social responsibility regulations. The Gambling Commission said the company did not do enough to ensure prevention measures were effective. As a result, 10 customers were able to deposit money linked to criminal offences and William Hill gained Â£1.2m. The company was found to have not done enough to determine the source of the money or if they were problem gamblers. The penalty is the second biggest imposed by the Commission, following last year's Â£7.8m action against betting firm 888. In a statement, the Gambling Commission said William Hill's senior management ""failed to mitigate risks and have sufficient numbers of staff to ensure their anti-money-laundering and social responsibility processes were effective"". William Hill said it had co-operated with the Commission during the investigation. It added it had  committed to an independent review and would work to implement any recommendations following this review. Gambling Commission executive director Tim Miller told the BBC that William Hill should have been ""checking the source of money and understanding their customers and ensuring that potentially vulnerable customers are properly protected"". The investigation by the Gambling Commission covered the period between November 2014 and August 2016. It gave some examples of where it said William Hill's controls were insufficient: One customer deposited about Â£541,000 over a 14-month period after William Hill assumed his potential income was Â£365,000 a year, ""based on a verbal conversation and without further probing"". In fact, the customer was earning about Â£30,000 a year and was funding his gambling habit by stealing from his employer. Another customer exceeded deposits of Â£147,000 over 18 months with an escalating spend and losses of Â£112,000. William Hill's systems identified the issue, ""but its only response over a 12-month period was to send two automated social responsibility emails. Our view is that this action alone was not sufficient, given the customer's gambling behaviour, coupled with the severity of the losses."" A customer was allowed to deposit Â£653,000 in an 18-month period which activated a financial alert at William Hill. The alert resulted in a grading of ""amber risk"", which meant the customer's profile should have been reviewed under the company's anti-money-laundering policy. The file was marked as passed to managers for review, but that did not happen because of a systems failure. The customer was able to continue gambling for a further six months, despite continuing to activate financial alerts. William Hill will pay more than Â£5m for breaching the regulations and ""divest themselves of the Â£1.2m they earned from transactions with the 10 customers"", the Commission said. The company now has to appoint external auditors to review the effectiveness and implementation of its anti-money laundering and social responsibility policies and procedures Neil McArthur, executive director at the Gambling Commission, said: ""This was a systemic failing at William Hill which went on for nearly two years and today's penalty package - which could exceed Â£6.2m - reflects the seriousness of the breaches."" For the wider industry, the timing of William Hill's fine could not be worse. The government is weeks away from a crucial decision on fixed-odds betting terminals, the gambling machines found in high-street bookmakers up and down the country. The maximum stake could be cut from Â£100 to as low as Â£2. If it is at the bottom end of the range, the consequences for industry profitability would be enormous. There would also be far-reaching ramifications for the High Street - some estimate as many as 3,000 shops would close - and for revenue for the horse-racing industry. In a statement, William Hill chief executive Philip Bowcock said: ""William Hill has fully co-operated with the Commission throughout this process, introducing new and improved policies and increased levels of resourcing. ""We have also committed to an independent process review and will work to implement any recommendations that emerge from that review. ""We are fully committed to operating a sustainable business that properly identifies risk and better protects customers. ""We will continue to assist the Commission and work with other operators to improve practices in the areas identified."" Mr Miller said the Gambling Commission was sending a message to the industry as a whole that ""you need to take your responsibility seriously, you need to get this right"". ""We are always taking regulatory action and I don't think this will be the last action we take,"" he added.

Corbyn vows to curb City of London's power,"Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to take on the City of London if he becomes prime minister, saying finance should be ""the servant of industry, not the masters of us all"". The Labour leader called for a ""fundamental rethink"" of the finance sector and how it is regulated. He also promised to give the government new powers to intervene to prevent ""hostile takeovers"". The Tories said Labour would ""end up harming Britain's businesses"". Mr Corbyn has often criticised bankers, and promised a ""fundamental shift"" in economic policy if he wins power. In a speech to the EEF manufacturers' organisation, he said his administration would be the first in 40 years - a period which includes 13 years of Labour government - to ""stand up for the real economy"". ""There can be no rebalancing of our distorted, sluggish and unequal economy without taking on the power of finance,"" he said. ""For 40 years, deregulated finance has progressively become more powerful. ""Its dominance over industry, obvious and destructive; its control of politics, pernicious and undemocratic."" A Labour government, he said, ""will take decisive action to make finance the servant of industry, not the masters of us all"". Mr Corbyn pointed to theongoing attemptby manufacturing turnaround firm Melrose to gain control of engineering giant GKN as a further example of ""short-term performance and narrow shareholder value (being) prioritised over long-run growth and broader economic benefit"". Labour would broaden the scope of the public interest test applied to such takeovers, he said. Mr Corbyn also discussed Brexit, saying businesses needed clarity on market access regulations. Taking questions afterwards about his party's position, he said ""we have to have a customs union"" with the EU after Brexit. And while the UK would no longer ""automatically"" be a member of the EU's single market after Brexit, Labour wanted a ""tariff-free trade relationship"". Responding to his remarks for the Conservatives, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Robert Jenrick said:  ""Labour don't know how to handle the economy and would end up harming Britain's businesses, and there would be fewer good jobs for people as a result. ""We are stepping in to make sure businesses play by the rules, after Labour's failure to properly regulate the banks."" At the same EEF event, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will hail the UK's manufacturing sector, saying the government is already ""laying the groundwork"" for new trading relationships across Africa and Asia after Brexit.

Debt woes 'worsening mental health crisis',"Debt forced Lee Brookes into a ""spiral of destructive thinking"" Thousands of people with mental health issues are trapped in a spiral of escalating debts, a charity says. The Money and Mental Health Policy Institute said that in 2017, some 23,000 people were being pursued while in hospital for mental health problems. Thousands more were in a similar position while receiving mental health crisis support in the community. A coalition of debt groups wants the government to allow ""breathing space"" for people with mental health troubles. The government is considering whether to allow individuals in problem debt up to six weeks' grace from interest, charges and enforcement action by debt collectors if they seek help and financial advice. Charities want the breathing space scheme extended to anyone accessing psychiatric in-patient care or the care of a Crisis Resolution Team. Personal finance expert and broadcaster Martin Lewis, who founded the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute (MMHPI), said chasing people for debts only worsened their problems. ""It's time to stop people in mental health crisis being hassled over debt, which risks making recovery harder and means they'll be even less likely to repay creditors in future,"" he said. ""I [have] long campaigned for breathing space for those in crisis debt - but for those having a short period of acute mental illness; suffering panic attacks, unable to open post, call the bank, or even think coherently - going to a debt counsellor in order to call a halt to things is just impossible."" The impact that debt has on people facing mental health troubles was underlined by Lee Brookes, from Manchester, who told the BBC of his struggle to face up to his financial problems. Lee has bipolar disorder. Over a series of manic episodes, he lost control of his spending and worked up Â£30,000 of debt. ""When I was manic, I would spend without thinking of consequence,"" he said.  ""Then with the inevitable fall came a spiral of destructive thinking. ""I'd think about losing my house, my job, my friends, my family.  Then it became harder to face up to the debt."" Despite entering NHS crisis care, the interest on Lee's debt kept accruing and the visits from bailiffs began. Commenting on why he didn't call his bank and utility companies to explain why his debts were spiralling out of control, he said: ""When you are that bad, you can't even pick up your toothbrush to clean your teeth. You can't even call your mum to say, 'I need your help.' ""So calling the bank and asking for extensions is impossible."" The idea of a ""breathing space"" is already being considered as part of the Financial Guidance and Claims Bill. It would apply to anyone who is in severe debt, but has shown a willingness to seek advice. Dr JS Bamrah is seeing far more mental health problems linked to debt Charities want the scheme extended to anyone whose clinician diagnoses them as being in crisis. The proposal has cross-party endorsement from Conservative Johnny Mercer, Labour's Luciana Berger and Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb. Mr Lewis said extending the breathing space scheme would give people time to recover, rather than worry about bailiffs at the door. ""And with the tragically common marriage of mental illness and debt, the simplest way to do it is assume all in serious mental health crisis are likely to be struggling with their cash,"" Mr Lewis said. His charity's research found examples of people losing their jobs and working up fees because they were too ill to pay their debts. Others were sectioned then returned home to find court summons.  On one occasion, a person attempted suicide after visits from bailiffs. Consultant psychiatrist Dr JS Bamrah has worked for the NHS in Manchester for more than 30 years. He says he is seeing far more mental health problems linked to debt. ""It's very common now, especially since austerity. Their rational thinking has gone out of the window. Patients start thinking, 'There is no point in living with this debt.  I can't burden my family with this.' ""Suicidal thoughts are very common,"" Dr Bamrah said. ""And yes, on occasion, it spirals and we've seen people who take their own lives because of their debt."" Energy UK, which represents energy suppliers, told the BBC: ""Suppliers take their responsibility to support customers facing difficulties extremely seriously. ""Last year, along with the Money Advice Trust charity, we published a guide to help energy suppliers better identify and support customers facing mental health issues."" UK Finance, which represents banks and lenders, said: ""Our members want to help customers struggling with their finances including those with mental health issues.  We agree to giving customers a 'breathing space' to get advice, while taking individual circumstances into account."" Mr Lewis said that lenders were often sympathetic, but he believed making breathing space statutory would give all parties clarity. ""Providers can often be very good if people contact them but that isn't an option for people who have an acute mental illness.  If you are in hospital and not functional, then calling up your lender is something that is absolutely impossible because you are not making standard logical decisions,"" he said. Lee is back on his feet financially, and is fastidiously saving for his wedding to his fiancÃ©e - something that would have been unthinkable five years ago. He says that might have happened sooner had he been offered breathing space when he was at his lowest. ""I came close - too close - to suicide through debt on two occasions. I really hope these changes happen so that doesn't happen to others."" Sudden rise in personal insolvencies Should everybody get Â£10,000?

Key gig economy case reaches Supreme Court,"A plumber's legal battle for working rights will be closely watched by ""gig economy"" workers when it reaches the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Gary Smith, who worked for Pimlico Plumbers for six years, began his fight when he wanted to reduce his hours following a heart attack. Lower courts have ruled that he is entitled to basic workers' rights, although technically self-employed. These rights include the national minimum wage and paid holiday. Mr Smith won his most recent victory in the Court of Appeal a year ago, but Pimlico Plumbers and its founder, Charlie Mullins, are appealing against that decision, in a hearing expected to last two days. The case hinges on the distinction between Mr Smith's status as either a self-employed contractor, or a worker for the company. He was VAT-registered and paying tax on a self-employed basis, but worked solely for Pimlico Plumbers. After he suffered a heart attack in 2010, Mr Smith, from Kent, wanted to work three days a week rather than five. Pimlico refused his request and took away his branded van, which he had hired. He claims he was dismissed. Gary Smith argues he is entitled to basic workers' rights An employment tribunal found that the plumbers were workers, but not employees. The Court of Appeal backed that decision. Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, said the rise of the ""gig economy"" made the issue of employment status more important than ever. ""Tribunals' and courts' interpretations of these issues have done quite well to keep up with the times - that's why nearly all high-profile 'gig economy' cases have declared the individual to be a worker, and consequently entitled to minimum wage rights and holiday pay,"" he said. ""I expect the Supreme Court will do the same with the Pimlico Plumbers case."" Mr Mullins, the founder of London-based Pimlico Plumbers, says that plumbers were hired on the basis that they were self-employed, provided their own materials and did not have workers' benefits, but were paid significantly more as a result. He argues that the case has nothing to do with the gig economy and that Mr Smith is not in the same as an Uber driver. ""There is no comparison between a skilled tradesperson, like a plumber earning Â£150,000 a year, and a bike courier or minicab driver, struggling to make minimum wage,"" Mr Mullins said. ""This is the distinction that we are hoping to make clear to the Supreme Court.""

"Corbyn vows to curb City of London's powerThe Labour leader also says the government needs stronger powers to prevent ""hostile takeovers"".5h5 hours agoUK Politics","Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to take on the City of London if he becomes prime minister, saying finance should be ""the servant of industry, not the masters of us all"". The Labour leader called for a ""fundamental rethink"" of the finance sector and how it is regulated. He also promised to give the government new powers to intervene to prevent ""hostile takeovers"". The Tories said Labour would ""end up harming Britain's businesses"". Mr Corbyn has often criticised bankers, and promised a ""fundamental shift"" in economic policy if he wins power. In a speech to the EEF manufacturers' organisation, he said his administration would be the first in 40 years - a period which includes 13 years of Labour government - to ""stand up for the real economy"". ""There can be no rebalancing of our distorted, sluggish and unequal economy without taking on the power of finance,"" he said. ""For 40 years, deregulated finance has progressively become more powerful. ""Its dominance over industry, obvious and destructive; its control of politics, pernicious and undemocratic."" A Labour government, he said, ""will take decisive action to make finance the servant of industry, not the masters of us all"". Mr Corbyn pointed to theongoing attemptby manufacturing turnaround firm Melrose to gain control of engineering giant GKN as a further example of ""short-term performance and narrow shareholder value (being) prioritised over long-run growth and broader economic benefit"". Labour would broaden the scope of the public interest test applied to such takeovers, he said. Mr Corbyn also discussed Brexit, saying businesses needed clarity on market access regulations. Taking questions afterwards about his party's position, he said ""we have to have a customs union"" with the EU after Brexit. And while the UK would no longer ""automatically"" be a member of the EU's single market after Brexit, Labour wanted a ""tariff-free trade relationship"". Responding to his remarks for the Conservatives, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Robert Jenrick said:  ""Labour don't know how to handle the economy and would end up harming Britain's businesses, and there would be fewer good jobs for people as a result. ""We are stepping in to make sure businesses play by the rules, after Labour's failure to properly regulate the banks."" At the same EEF event, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will hail the UK's manufacturing sector, saying the government is already ""laying the groundwork"" for new trading relationships across Africa and Asia after Brexit.

UK and US 'in talks over British IS duo',"Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces The US and UK are in talks about what to do with two men from west London who were detained in Syria last month on suspicion of terrorist activity, the home secretary has said. Amber Rudd said the captured men, Allexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, should go on trial. They are suspected of being members of an Islamic State cell that killed Western hostages. The BBC understands the pair have been stripped of their UK citizenship. Ms Rudd said: ""We're absolutely committed to making sure that they are tried. ""These people should face the full force of the law. I can't be drawn at the moment intoâ¦where that will take place. But I am certain, because we'll be working with the Americans to ensure this, that they will face justice."" Earlier this month a defence minister said the men should be tried in an international criminal court. Tobias Ellwood told two newspapers it was important that ""terrorists from any origin are transparently and fairly held account for their actions"". Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? The men are accused of being the last two of four UK IS members known as""the Beatles"", so called because of their British accents. It has been suggested they could be sent to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay. Alternatively, they could be put on criminal trial in the US or at the International Criminal Court, The Hague, which can prosecute people for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression. Mr Ellwood, who lost his brother in a terrorist attack in Bali in 2002 and who himselfwas caught up in the Westminster attacklast year, said Kotey and Elsheikh should be tried at The Hague. This video can not be played Bethany Haines, whose father David was killed by the cell, on the capture of the IS duo The families of some of the cell's victims have also said the two captured menshould face trial.

Jamie Oliver closes flagship restaurantThe celebrity chef's two steak restaurants go into administration - but he immediately buys one back.9h9 hours agoBusiness,"Barbecoa specialises in grilled meats Jamie Oliver's two flagship London restaurants have gone into administration, although the celebrity chef immediately bought one back. His upmarket Barbecoa steak restaurant in London's Piccadilly will close a year after it was re-launched. The other outlet, near St Paul's Cathedral, has been saved after the chef bought it for an undisclosed sum via a newly-created subsidiary. The move comes as Mr Oliver makes cuts in other parts of his business. Barbecoa St Paul's was bought back under a so-called pre-pack arrangement, which allows the purchase of the best assets of a business before it actually goes into administration. The Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group was already cutting costs in other areas, despite the chef putting Â£3m of his own money into the business in December. What's eating the restaurant trade? Last month it announced that it was shutting down 12 of its 37 Jamie's Italian restaurants - the mainstay of the group - as part of a rescue plan with creditors that would enable it to continue trading. The closure of the 12 restaurants will affect at least 200 jobs. This video can not be played Jamie Oliver's two flagship London restaurants have gone into administration. Court documents revealed that Jamie's Italian had debts of Â£71.5m. These included: Â£30.2m of overdrafts and loans Â£41.3m owed to landlords, HM Revenue and Customs, suppliers and other creditors, including Â£2.2m in wages owed to staff However, Â£47m of the debts are covered by loans from HSBC Bank and Jamie Oliver's other companies. The chain also closed down six Jamie's Italian restaurants in January 2017. At the time,the company saidthat the closures were due to uncertainties caused by Brexit and a ""tough"" market. Other British restaurant chains have been struggling in recent months. In January, burger chain Byron announced that it too had entered into a company voluntary arrangement, which would mean thatup to 20 Byron burger restaurants would need to close. Mr Oliver has seen several setbacks to his business in recent years. In 2017, he closed the last of his Union Jacks restaurants and also shut his magazine Jamie, which had been running for almost 10 years. In 2015, he admitted that about 40% of his business ventures had gone wrong and cost him money, but said those mistakes had taught him ""powerful"" lessons. Other parts of his business empire have been trading strongly. Jamie Oliver Holdings, which controls his media businesses, including books, made profits of Â£5.4m in 2016 (the most recent year of accounts available).

Lee has bipolar disorder. Over a series of manic episodes, he lost control of his spending and worked up Â£30,000 of debt. ""When I was manic, I would spend without thinking of consequence,"" he said.  ""Then with the inevitable fall came a spiral of destructive thinking. ""I'd think about losing my house, my job, my friends, my family.  Then it became harder to face up to the debt."" Despite entering NHS crisis care, the interest on Lee's debt kept accruing and the visits from bailiffs began. Commenting on why he didn't call his bank and utility companies to explain why his debts were spiralling out of control, he said: ""When you are that bad, you can't even pick up your toothbrush to clean your teeth. You can't even call your mum to say, 'I need your help.' ""So calling the bank and asking for extensions is impossible."" The idea of a ""breathing space"" is already being considered as part of the Financial Guidance and Claims Bill. It would apply to anyone who is in severe debt, but has shown a willingness to seek advice. Dr JS Bamrah is seeing far more mental health problems linked to debt Charities want the scheme extended to anyone whose clinician diagnoses them as being in crisis. The proposal has cross-party endorsement from Conservative Johnny Mercer, Labour's Luciana Berger and Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb. Mr Lewis said extending the breathing space scheme would give people time to recover, rather than worry about bailiffs at the door. ""And with the tragically common marriage of mental illness and debt, the simplest way to do it is assume all in serious mental health crisis are likely to be struggling with their cash,"" Mr Lewis said. His charity's research found examples of people losing their jobs and working up fees because they were too ill to pay their debts. Others were sectioned then returned home to find court summons.  On one occasion, a person attempted suicide after visits from bailiffs. Consultant psychiatrist Dr JS Bamrah has worked for the NHS in Manchester for more than 30 years. He says he is seeing far more mental health problems linked to debt. ""It's very common now, especially since austerity. Their rational thinking has gone out of the window. Patients start thinking, 'There is no point in living with this debt.  I can't burden my family with this.' ""Suicidal thoughts are very common,"" Dr Bamrah said. ""And yes, on occasion, it spirals and we've seen people who take their own lives because of their debt."" Energy UK, which represents energy suppliers, told the BBC: ""Suppliers take their responsibility to support customers facing difficulties extremely seriously. ""Last year, along with the Money Advice Trust charity, we published a guide to help energy suppliers better identify and support customers facing mental health issues."" UK Finance, which represents banks and lenders, said: ""Our members want to help customers struggling with their finances including those with mental health issues.  We agree to giving customers a 'breathing space' to get advice, while taking individual circumstances into account."" Mr Lewis said that lenders were often sympathetic, but he believed making breathing space statutory would give all parties clarity. ""Providers can often be very good if people contact them but that isn't an option for people who have an acute mental illness.  If you are in hospital and not functional, then calling up your lender is something that is absolutely impossible because you are not making standard logical decisions,"" he said. Lee is back on his feet financially, and is fastidiously saving for his wedding to his fiancÃ©e - something that would have been unthinkable five years ago. He says that might have happened sooner had he been offered breathing space when he was at his lowest. ""I came close - too close - to suicide through debt on two occasions. I really hope these changes happen so that doesn't happen to others."" Sudden rise in personal insolvencies Should everybody get Â£10,000?

HSBC profits jump to $17.2bn on Asia growth,"HSBC has posted a pre-tax profit of $17.2bn (Â£12.3bn) in 2017, saying its focus on Asia was driving growth. The results represent a 141% jump on the $7.1bn profit of the previous year. But that comparison is flattering, given 2016 saw the bank incur a string of one-off costs including the sale of its Brazil business. Though well known on the British High Street, HSBC makes most of its money outside the UK, with Asia accounting for the bulk of global profits. And the bank said the prospect of regional Asian trade deals and lending linked to China's Belt and Road projects ""provided cause for optimism"". ""A large increase in reported profit before tax reflected both a healthy business and the non-recurrence of significant items from 2016,"" said group chairman Mark Tucker. While an stark improvement on 2016's results, the profit is still lower than the $18.9bn reported in 2015. HSBC's origins are in Hong Kong, where the bank now has its regional headquarters HSBC, Europe's largest bank, has been focusing on a drive to streamline its business and slash costs. That has been spearheaded by chief executive Stuart Gulliver, who on Wednesdaywill hand over the reins to John Flintafter seven years at the helm. Mr Flint, HSBC's former head of retail banking and wealth management, has said he wants to speed up the pace of change at the firm. HSBC said its pivot to Asia in recent years was paying off, with wealth management, commercial and retail banking becoming key drivers of growth. The lender, which has its regional headquarters in Hong Kong, has also beefed up its presence in China's heavily populated Pearl River Delta area, lending to firms in the real estate and infrastructure sectors, and increasing its staffing. Across 2017, the bank said its pre-tax profits from Asia rose by 89.3% from a year earlier to $15.3bn - the bulk of its global profits for the year. That compares with a loss of $1.9bn recorded in Europe. Total revenues for the year rose 7% to $51.4bn, up from $48bn the year before. Despite the positive news on the bank's Asia-wide business, the firm's shares dropped as its overall results fell short of expectations. In Hong Kong, the bank's shares closed down 3.1% while in London, they were down more than 4% in morning trade. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the appeal of HSBC's focus on Asia was clear, ""with the Asian middle class set to balloon by a staggering two billion people by 2050"". ""However, this approach comes with risks attached. The strength of HSBC's share price over the last two years has a lot to do with better-than-expected economic performance from China,"" he said. ""That's all well and good, but this cuts both ways, and looking forward if China sneezes, HSBC is going to catch a nasty cold.""

Councils 'unprepared' for cyber-attacks,"More than 25% of UK councils have had their computer systems breached in the past five years, campaigners say. A report by privacy group Big Brother Watch based on freedom of information requests found 114 councils experienced at least one incident between 2013 and 2017. The group said it was ""shocked"" that staff often lacked cyber-training. The Local Government Association said councils took their privacy responsibilities ""extremely seriously"". Big Brother Watch said it had received responses from 395 local authorities and that, of the 114 that said their systems had been breached, 25 reported they had experienced a data loss or breach as a result. It said the majority of successful cyber-attacks began with so-called phishing emails designed to trick staff into revealing passwords and other data. Big Brother Watch said humans were the weakest link the cyber-security chain and the risk could only be reduced by introducing training for all council employees. Three-quarters of councils did not provide mandatory cyber-security training, and 16% did not provide any at all, according to the report. Amazon removes magnetic putty from sale New 50p Beatrix Potter coins released March deadline to return old Â£10 notes Jennifer Krueckeberg, lead researcher at Big Brother Watch, said: ""One would assume that they [councils] would be doing their utmost to protect citizens' sensitive information. ""Local authorities need to take urgent action and make sure they fulfil their responsibilities to protect citizens,"" she added. Based on the FoI data, the report estimates the number of cyber-attacks on local authorities, which hold the data of millions of residents, at 98 million between 2013 and 2017. This amounts to 37 attacks every minute. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external A Local Government Association spokesman said: ""Very few of these attacks actually manage to breach the firewalls or scanning systems in place."" He added that councils were working with the National Cyber Security Centre to ensure their systems ""are as robust and resilient as possible"". It comes as figures released earlier this month by the National Cyber Security Centre showed Britain is repelling millions of attacks a month. They showed that councils are among the organisations most commonly imitated in emails designed to gain trust.

New Scots income tax system to be agreed,"Derek Mackay said his plans would give Scots taxpayers the best deal in the UK MSPs have agreed changes to Scotland's income tax system which will set up new rates and bands. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has put forward plans for a new five-band system which will cut bills for lower earners but raise them for others. MSPs passed the proposals, which are part of the budget deal the SNP struck with the Greens, by 67 votes to 50. The vote means Mr Mackay's spending plans will go to the Holyrood chamber for final approval on Wednesday. The Conservatives and Labour opposed the changes, which will come into force from the start of the new financial year in April. Budget calculator - are you better or worse off? Scotland's budget: what does it mean for me? Look back at the debate with Holyrood Live Mr Mackay's plans will see two extra bands added to the income tax system, on either side of the basic rate - a 19p ""starter"" rate for lower earners and a 21p ""intermediate"" rate for those on middling incomes. This, coupled with an increase to the tax-free allowance included in the UK budget, will see 70% of Scots pay less tax in the coming year than they do now, while 30% will pay more. The changes will also add 1p to each of the higher and additional rates, making them 41p and 46p respectively, while limiting increases to the higher rate threshold to raise extra funds for local services and a public sector pay deal. The finance secretary said taxpayers in Scotland were going to get ""the best deal anywhere in the UK"". Mr Mackay said ministers were using Holyrood's powers in a ""fair, responsible and balanced way"" to set up a tax system which ""charts a new course for our country, around fairness and tackling inequality"". He said the budget would provide ""stability, stimulus and sustainability"" for the Scottish economy while backing frontline services. Mr Mackay also said the tax plans will create a ""settled structure in income tax policy"" to ""provide certainty for rest of this parliament"" - although other opposition parties, including the Greens, have already called for more action in future years. The Greens have now done a budget deal with the SNP two years in a row, and co-convener Patrick Harvie said the party's approach to taxation had ""shifted the debate"" in Scotland. He said he was ""delighted"" that Scotland had a ""radical opportunity to build a fairer tax system"" with ""progressive values"". The MSP said the SNP had ""completely rejected"" the idea of having more rates and bands when it was first suggested by the Greens prior to the 2016 election, welcoming ""the progress the SNP have made"" on the topic. It was a historic moment. Holyrood making substantial use of income tax powers for the first time. MSPs voting for the biggest change in taxation since the advent of devolution. As is so often the case with such moments, there was a certain lassitude about proceedings. A sense of role play. All passion spent, a sense of a token, faintly totemic debate. I do not remotely blame our MSPs for this. The budget and tax debate has been, understandably and rightly, prolonged. We had an outline of taxation principles, which invited a widespread debate. We then had the draft budget. After detailed and difficult negotiation, the deal between the SNP and the Greens. Then we had the stage one scrutiny, the stage one debate and vote, stage two amendments, today's tax resolution. And tomorrow, finally, the stage three vote on the budget. All of which makes for thorough and welcome scrutiny. A job done. It adds to the sense of serious politics. At the same time, inevitably, it may remove a little of the drama. Hence the faint sense of ennui around the chamber today. Read more from Brian here The Holyrood debate was something of a foregone conclusion, with the deal already assured of passing thanks to the SNP-Green deal. The budget bill also won support at stage one from two Lib Dem MSPs, Tavish Scott and Liam McArthur, due to funding for ferries in their Northern Isles constituencies. However, all other opposition MSPs voted against the budget bill, and also came out against the rates resolution. The Scottish Conservatives argued that the ""tax burden"" should not be increased, saying that more than a million Scots would pay more income tax than people earning the same amount in the rest of the UK. Labour's James Kelly and Tory Murdo Fraser both spoke against the plans - but for very different reasons Finance spokesman Murdo Fraser said the SNP had broken a manifesto pledge from the 2016 elections not to increase income tax, a promise he said had been repeated 53 times during the campaign. He contended that it was the UK government's moves to raise the tax-free allowance which had ""lifted millions of the lowest paid out of tax altogether"", which he said was being done ""without penalising those earning a bit more"". The MSP said his party would cut out waste and ""vanity projects"" and prioritise growing the economy. Labour has also stood against the changes, but for the opposite reason - they believe the plans do not go far enough. The party set outits own alternative tax proposalsshortly before the stage one vote on the budget, claiming they could raise an extra Â£1bn through a 50p top rate of tax and a package of other measures. Finance spokesman James Kelly said the budget just ""tinkered around the edges"", saying the tax proposals ""should be rejected because the SNP have failed to make the changes that would make a difference to people's lives"". He said Labour would ""ask the richest to pay their fare share"", adding: ""What we have heard from Mr Mackay is a litany of excuses as to why he can't increase tax."" The Scottish Lib Dems meanwhile argued that the budget was a ""missed opportunity"", with leader Willie Rennie saying it ""fails to invest the necessary funds to transform education and make a step change in mental health services"".

Davis rejects Brexit 'dystopia' claims,"This video can not be played Will ministers be locked in a room 'all night'? Britain will not be ""plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction"" after it leaves the EU, the Brexit secretary has said. David Davis said the UK wanted to lead a ""global race to the top"" in rights and standards not, as some feared, a ""competitive race to the bottom"". British business could ""never be cheaper than China"" and must focus instead on product and service quality. He also suggested a Brexit deal by the end of 2018 was ""well on the cards"". The Brexit secretary's address to Austrian business leaders in Vienna is the latest in a series of speeches the UK government is calling ""the road to Brexit"" as it faces demands to spell out details of the future partnership it wants with the EU. The UK says it wants to avoid obstacles to smooth trade with the EU although it is leaving the single market and the customs union when Brexit happens in March 2019. Newsbeat: Social media's take on Mad Max Green dismisses Brexit 'conspiracy theories' Johnson: Let's unite around Brexit vision Mr Davis said this can be achieved if both sides recognise each other's standards and regulations, promising the UK will ""continue our track record of meeting high standards"" once outside the EU. The government has previously spoken of adopting a ""new economic model"" to stay competitive if it is locked out of the EU single market after Brexit, and Labour has claimed the UK could be turned into a ""low-wage, offshore tax haven"". Mr Davis hit back at the government's critics in his speech, invoking the Mad Max series of action films which portray societal collapse in a lawless future world. The first three Mad Max films in the 1980s were followed by Mad Max: Fury Road in 2015 ""They fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom,"" Mr Davis said. ""With Britain plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction. These fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing, not our history, not our intentions, not our national interest. ""But while I profoundly disagree with those who spread these fears â it does remind us all that we must provide reassurance."" Allow Twitter content?

The UK, he said, would never prosper in a new era of intensified globalisation by cutting standards since it ""would never be cheaper than China or have more resources than Brazil"". He said UK's post-Brexit economic relationship with the EU should be based on the principles of ""open trade and fair competition"". As part of this, once the UK has left, it would not allow firms heavily subsidised by EU governments ""unfettered access"" to its markets nor permit mergers between UK and EU firms which reduced consumer choice. Where we are with Brexit - in 300 words Brexit: All you need to know ""A crucial part of any such agreement is the ability for both sides to trust each other's regulations and the institutions that enforce them,"" he added. ""Such mutual recognition will naturally require close, even-handed co-operation between these authorities and a common set of principles to guide them."" Last year EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""simply impossible"" for the UK to adopt its own standards and regulations while also having them recognised automatically in the EU. Labour said past comments by some senior ministers showed they wanted to use Brexit as a vehicle to ""drive down"" environmental standards and employment rights when, instead, they should be extended. ""David Davis's promise... isn't worth the paper it's written on,"" said shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. The general secretary of the GMB union, Tim Roache, said: """"If the best this Government can do is promise Britain will not turn into a 'Mad Max' nightmare - it's no wonder people are worried about their post-Brexit lives."" The Institute of Directors' Allie Renison said they were ""pleased that Davis acknowledges the importance of keeping a level playing field on state aid and competition policy. Minimising trade barriers can and should go hand in hand with a future deal with the EU"". Trust levels in the UK were fairly high as EU finance ministers arrived for a regular meeting in Brussels today. After all, they have seen their British colleagues largely play by the rules for the last four decades. But what happens next? Luxembourg's finance minister sees it as a balance: stick to European standards and goods will flow freely between the two, go your own way and trade won't be as smooth. And the EU doesn't just want a pledge, they want rules, a process, a mechanism that binds the UK into what Brussels calls the Level Playing Field, or the LPF. Magdalena Andersson of Sweden summed up why, saying: ""Of course I trust David Davis but we don't know who will come after him some day in the future."" Allow Twitter content?

Kuenssberg: What will May do?,"A library in a thriving college in Derby might have felt like the perfect location for the prime minister's official start of a review of education that has been promised several times before. She was here to show she wants to act, to sort out one of the problems the country faces. But at half term, the college was largely empty of students, the invited audience largely made up of education bigwigs rather than younger people whose lives might actually be affected by the decisions. In the unlikely event that Westminster's sketch writers would be short of metaphors the choice of venue and audience perhaps provided a convenient flavour for their spiky paragraphs on Tuesday. May rules out scrapping tuition fees Reality Check: Would cutting fees really help poorer students? 10 charts showing the impact of tuition fees There are plenty of good reasons why the prime minister chose to hold this review. Full time student numbers have gone up and up and up. But so have fees, and the level of debt students face after university in England has multiplied too. With the scrapping of student maintenance grants, students from less well-off backgrounds are finishing up with higher debts. The number of students doing part-time courses has dropped significantly, and while good quality apprenticeships and training are often feverishly oversubscribed, there is and has been (certainly in political circles) an assumption that university is the the premium choice for 18-year-olds. Theresa May wants to get rid of that assumption (although she is certainly not the first prime minister I have heard outline that demand in a speech) And politically, the Tories are looking for ways to show they are serious about addressing the tension between generations. It may be rather over-eager for any Conservative to imagine they can compete on a big scale with the Labour offer to get rid of fees altogether, but feeling parents' and grandparents' pain too is clearly an aim. And Theresa May wants to demonstrate there is more to her government than the bureaucratic and political tangle of Brexit. Full-time student numbers have gone up - but so have fees Reading that list of motivations - so far, so tempting. But you'd be forgiven for wondering if the review might in the end be, well, as half-empty as the college today. At times it was as if the prime minister had only just realised, or heard of the problems in higher education when, of course the Tories have been in charge for seven years while fees have gone up. Many would argue though that the fee increases are in fact the reason why universities have been able to grow so much, and the number-crunchers atthe IFS show,externalthat the best paid graduates pay more of the burden in the long term. More recently, there have already been very significant reforms to the education sector, in fact on Theresa May's watch. The Department for Education has already pushed for shorter courses and for more information about the quality of degrees to be made available, and new technical qualifications, T-levels, are already on the way. Since the election Number 10 has already made a few tweaks to the fees system. And while the prime minister emphasised again and again she wants this to be a wide review, its terms of reference (the small print) make clear there won't be a big shift on how education is paid for, nor any big extra promises of cash. For better or for worse, that means the review appears therefore to be looking at moving money around inside the sector. That doesn't meant there won't be any change. Cutting the cost of some degrees is on the cards, and there was a heavy hint from the PM that the maintenance grant might come back (one university boss lamented afterwards that the government could just do this straight away rather than spend another year concluding it was a relatively inexpensive no-brainer). But the review seems unlikely to be recommending massive upheavals, certainly not anything like the demands we heard from students at nearby Derby University today. It's abundantly crystal clear the Tories won't go near the kind of solution being put forward by the Labour Party that seemed to drive so much support their way in the general election. Yes, ministers are worried about the way the higher education system works, the levels of debt that some students face. But don't mistake today's announcement as a sudden Conservative conversion to something completely different. And while there is political opportunity in outlining promises, there are risks that in the end they look empty themselves.

The key Brexit dates in 2018,"Anyone who tells you they know how Brexit is going to play out in 2018 isn't to be trusted. After last year's rollercoaster, almost anything could happen. Another general election? A big shift in the public mood? Both are possibilities - perhaps unlikely, but not to be ruled out entirely. The only predictable thing is unpredictability. And among both arch-Brexiteers, and ardent Remainers, there is a sense that it is still all to play for. But the government insists that the UK will leave the EU on March 29 2019, and in the meantime Brexit negotiations will gather pace. Welcome to phase two. So what is supposed to happen next? First of all, the joint EU-UK report on ""sufficient progress"" needs to be turned into a legal text that will form the basis of a formal withdrawal agreement. And there are still plenty of details that remain unresolved. Expect the debate about what ""full alignment"" at the Irish border really means to re-emerge at regular intervals. At the end of January, formal negotiations are also due to begin on a transition period after Brexit. The EU's position is that the transition has to take place under all existing rules and regulations (including budget payments, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the free movement of people), and that it should come to an end on 31 December 2020. Donald Tusk calls Brexit talks a furious race against time Brexit: EU leaders agree to move talks to next stage Brexit: Guidelines for the next stage of talks Brexit talks: Where next for negotiations? No-one in the UK seems entirely happy about the transition proposals. Many businesses say it won't be long enough for them to be ready for a new world after the UK leaves. On the other hand, many supporters of Brexit say the transition will leave the UK as a ""vassal state"" - following rules without any say in making them. Either way, the idea of a transition suggests that you know where you are heading. But the debate on the ""end state"" of Brexit has barely begun. Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to give another big speech on Brexit - perhaps in early February - which may give us further clues about what the UK actually wants. But first she needs to reach some sort of consensus within her own cabinet. Does the UK stick as close as possible to the EU after Brexit, to try to preserve current economic links? Or does it forge a new path on its own? The best of both worlds may not be on offer. But formal negotiations on the outlines of a future relationship - on trade, security and so on - are not expected to start until April. It will be, says the European Council President Donald Tusk, a ""furious race against time"". The EU wants to have the withdrawal agreement (including transition arrangements), and a broad political declaration about the future relationship (NOT a full trade deal), finalised by October. That will give time for the withdrawal agreement to be ratified in full before the UK leaves in March 2019. It needs the approval of a qualified majority of the remaining 27 EU member states, as well as simple majorities in the UK and European parliaments. Until those votes are cast, no-one can say for sure that the withdrawal agreement will be successfully concluded. So Brexit will continue to take up an enormous amount of political time and energy throughout the year. Anyone hoping for certainty should probably look away now.

Will review make any difference?,"Will students be paying more or less after the fees review? Is anything going to happen as a result of the review of university costs in England? There had been claims that a year-long review would be a delaying tactic that would let ministers put off any tough decisions, allowing them to dodge difficult questions about tuition fees by saying they ""don't want to pre-empt the findings of the review"". But Theresa May has already made one of the biggest calls, effectively ruling out scrapping tuition fees, and drawing up the battle lines against one of Labour's most youth-friendly policies. The prime minister said it would not be fair on taxpayers who didn't go to university, it would leave higher education in a losing struggle for funding with schools and hospitals, and it would mean limiting university places and funding. And although the prime minister conceded the current system in England was more expensive than almost anywhere else in the world, there were no signs, from anything said by ministers publicly or briefed privately, to suggest the tuition fee level was expected to be radically reduced. It's an independent review so might take its own unexpected path, but the trajectory from the launch seemed to be towards changing the current system rather than inventing a new one. There were no signs of any slashing of fees. Theresa May met students ahead of her speech in Derby The idea of students paying back fees is the assumed starting point - and alternative approaches such as a graduate tax seem to be downplayed. That means focusing on the lower-hanging fruit in terms of cutting costs - such as cutting interest rates, which are currently up to 6.1%, and have been attacked as bafflingly high by a long line of former Conservative and Labour education ministers. The example of Wales could also be followed, with an emphasis on ensuring more maintenance support while students are studying. The most immediate effect will be that the freeze on tuition fees of Â£9,250 is almost certainly going to be extended - probably indefinitely. It's a big change from only a year ago, when the government decided to allow universities to increase fees every year, which would have seen them soon heading over Â£10,000. But with a review lasting a year, fees are not going up until at least the application cycle for 2020-21. In such uncertain political waters - and with Labour promising to completely scrap fees - it's hard to imagine that any outcome from the review will see fees being allowed to rise. The Education Secretary, Damian Hinds, has called for more ""variety"" in fees - concerned that almost every course at every university is charged at the maximum Â£9,250 per year. This has been interpreted as suggesting that some courses - such as arts and humanities - could be made cheaper than sciences, which are more expensive to deliver and where graduate earnings are likely to be higher. Damian Hinds says he wants to stop all universities charging the same amount But this is far from straightforward. If arts subjects had lower fees, it might act as a disincentive to apply for science subjects, particularly for those poorer students most sensitive to the cost. It would also tend to give even higher levels of tuition fee income to the most prestigious courses and institutions - described by Lord Willetts as a ""reverse pupil premium"". Such unintended consequences make such ""differential fees"" less likely to be recommended. The other big complication in trying to create a variable market in fees is that the level of fees is directly connected to the loan system that underpins it. This type of ""voucher system"", where the student has a guaranteed amount of public support, has an in-built tendency to see all providers pushing up their charges to the maximum of the subsidy. There will be other particular expectations from the review. There is a consensus that more support is needed for part-time students and those wanting to work and study. This will also be a broader post-18 review, with an expectation that vocational and technical training will receive more support. A much overlooked constituency in all this has been parents, who often have to fill the gaps in student living costs. Parents, who might be struggling themselves after years of wage stagnation, might be facing difficult bills for their student children's accommodation. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Unit, said the prime minister's review team had ""enormous expectations on their shoulders"". There is a long shopping list of demands for reducing fees and at the same time increasing levels of support. ""The government has encouraged this speculation but it will be hard to satisfy all the hopes, especially if the Treasury is not willing to allow additional public spending on post-compulsory education,"" said Mr Hillman.

Davis rejects Brexit 'dystopia' claimsThe Brexit secretary promises the UK will maintain high standards and regulations outside the EU.3m3 minutes agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Will ministers be locked in a room 'all night'? Britain will not be ""plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction"" after it leaves the EU, the Brexit secretary has said. David Davis said the UK wanted to lead a ""global race to the top"" in rights and standards not, as some feared, a ""competitive race to the bottom"". British business could ""never be cheaper than China"" and must focus instead on product and service quality. He also suggested a Brexit deal by the end of 2018 was ""well on the cards"". The Brexit secretary's address to Austrian business leaders in Vienna is the latest in a series of speeches the UK government is calling ""the road to Brexit"" as it faces demands to spell out details of the future partnership it wants with the EU. The UK says it wants to avoid obstacles to smooth trade with the EU although it is leaving the single market and the customs union when Brexit happens in March 2019. Newsbeat: Social media's take on Mad Max Green dismisses Brexit 'conspiracy theories' Johnson: Let's unite around Brexit vision Mr Davis said this can be achieved if both sides recognise each other's standards and regulations, promising the UK will ""continue our track record of meeting high standards"" once outside the EU. The government has previously spoken of adopting a ""new economic model"" to stay competitive if it is locked out of the EU single market after Brexit, and Labour has claimed the UK could be turned into a ""low-wage, offshore tax haven"". Mr Davis hit back at the government's critics in his speech, invoking the Mad Max series of action films which portray societal collapse in a lawless future world. The first three Mad Max films in the 1980s were followed by Mad Max: Fury Road in 2015 ""They fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom,"" Mr Davis said. ""With Britain plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction. These fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing, not our history, not our intentions, not our national interest. ""But while I profoundly disagree with those who spread these fears â it does remind us all that we must provide reassurance."" Allow Twitter content?

The UK, he said, would never prosper in a new era of intensified globalisation by cutting standards since it ""would never be cheaper than China or have more resources than Brazil"". He said UK's post-Brexit economic relationship with the EU should be based on the principles of ""open trade and fair competition"". As part of this, once the UK has left, it would not allow firms heavily subsidised by EU governments ""unfettered access"" to its markets nor permit mergers between UK and EU firms which reduced consumer choice. Where we are with Brexit - in 300 words Brexit: All you need to know ""A crucial part of any such agreement is the ability for both sides to trust each other's regulations and the institutions that enforce them,"" he added. ""Such mutual recognition will naturally require close, even-handed co-operation between these authorities and a common set of principles to guide them."" Last year EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""simply impossible"" for the UK to adopt its own standards and regulations while also having them recognised automatically in the EU. Labour said past comments by some senior ministers showed they wanted to use Brexit as a vehicle to ""drive down"" environmental standards and employment rights when, instead, they should be extended. ""David Davis's promise... isn't worth the paper it's written on,"" said shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. The general secretary of the GMB union, Tim Roache, said: """"If the best this Government can do is promise Britain will not turn into a 'Mad Max' nightmare - it's no wonder people are worried about their post-Brexit lives."" The Institute of Directors' Allie Renison said they were ""pleased that Davis acknowledges the importance of keeping a level playing field on state aid and competition policy. Minimising trade barriers can and should go hand in hand with a future deal with the EU"". Trust levels in the UK were fairly high as EU finance ministers arrived for a regular meeting in Brussels today. After all, they have seen their British colleagues largely play by the rules for the last four decades. But what happens next? Luxembourg's finance minister sees it as a balance: stick to European standards and goods will flow freely between the two, go your own way and trade won't be as smooth. And the EU doesn't just want a pledge, they want rules, a process, a mechanism that binds the UK into what Brussels calls the Level Playing Field, or the LPF. Magdalena Andersson of Sweden summed up why, saying: ""Of course I trust David Davis but we don't know who will come after him some day in the future."" Allow Twitter content?
