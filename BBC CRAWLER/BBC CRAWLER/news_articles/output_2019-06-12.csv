Warner's century leads Australia to victory over spirited Pakistan - highlights & report,"This video can not be played Cricket World Cup: Australia beat Pakistan - highlights ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, Taunton Australia 307 (49 overs):Warner 107, Finch 82, Amir 5-30 Pakistan 266 (45.4 overs):Imam 53, Hafeez 46, Cummins 3-33 Australia won by 41 runs Scorecard;Table;Schedule David Warner scored his first international century since serving a year-long ban for his part in the ball-tampering scandal in Australia's tense 41-run World Cup victory over Pakistan. Warner, transformed from the man who struggled in Sunday's defeat by India, busied his way to 107. With captain Aaron Finch also clubbing 82, Australia should have posted more than their 307 all out, only to lose their last six wickets for 30 runs thanks mainly to Mohammad Amir's 5-30. Facing a more reachable target than they would have once feared, Pakistan were well placed at 136-2 when their own collapse of 4-24 sucked the life from the chase. Hassan Ali hammered 32 from 15 balls and Wahab Riaz 45 from 39 balls to revive their vociferous fans, but after Wahab was given out caught behind on review off Mitchell Starc, Pakistan were bowled out for 266. Pakistan stay eighth in the 10-team table and move on to play arch-rivals India at Old Trafford on Sunday knowing that another defeat would go a long way to ending their involvement in the tournament. Australia join New Zealand at the top on six points, having played a game more than the Kiwis. TMS podcast: Warrior Warner, outstanding Amir and UN full member states This video can not be played Watch Warner's best shots in first century since return from ban Not only was it a relief for cricket to return after two days of abandonments, it returned with a magnificent contest that fluctuated throughout. Despite the grey and chilly conditions, this was a wonderful spectacle. The intimate setting is unique for a tournament mainly being played at large arenas and the vocal spectators filled the boutique venue with noise. The match itself - played on a juicy surface that offered encouragement for the pace bowlers - was rarely lacking in entertainment. The early Australia charge was helped by some poor bowling and fielding, with Pakistan's resurgence first led by Amir and followed up by a third-wicket stand of 80 between Imam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Hafeez. After Imam gloved Pat Cummins behind, the Pakistan implosion left the crowd silent, only for raucous hope to return through the hitting of Hassan and Wahab. Just as Australia were getting desperate, Starc asked for a review against a hopping Wahab. It detected the faintest edge and, eight balls later, the game was over.

On Saturday, he was left shaken when a stroke he played in practice struck net bowler Jaykishan Plaha on the head and, the next day, his ponderous 56 from 84 balls against India drew criticism. Before this game, he was backed by Finch and responded with a characteristic performance of punchy strokes, bustling running and the occasional display of power. Finch, dropped twice, hit four leg-side sixes in their opening stand of 146 before offering a leading edge to Amir. Warner took over. When he edged Shaheen Afridi between keeper and slip, it took him to three figures and sparked an emotional celebration of his trademark leap and prolonged gestures towards the Australia dressing room. He was dropped on 104 but holed out soon after, part of an overall slide of eight wickets for 84 runs, wickets falling regularly because of Australia's inability to kick on and Pakistan's improvement.

Amir's performance was all the more outstanding because of its contrast to that of his team-mates who, bar fellow left-armer Wahab, offered little support. Ignoring fielding littered with mistakes and other bowlers who dropped too short, Amir skillfully exploited the movement with a full length and changes of pace. When Pakistan finally began holding their catches, Amir got his rewards to move to 10 wickets in the tournament, more than any other bowler. Even with Australia checked and the Imam-Hafeez partnership proving difficult to dislodge, there remained the feeling Finch's men were only ever a wicket from taking charge. So it proved. After Imam was strangled, Hafeez swept a full-toss from part-time spinner Finch to deep square leg, while both Shoaib Malik and Asif Ali edged behind. Hassan's hitting seemed nothing more than a consolation, but a stand of 64 between Wahab and Sarfaraz Ahmed left Australia in serious peril and Pakistan's supporters louder than ever. As the game got tighter, Finch took some persuading to review the decision against Wahab. He was vindicated, leaving the lethal Starc to bowl Amir and Glenn Maxwell to end the match with a direct-hit run-out of Sarfaraz.

Watch the best of the action again as Australia edge past Pakistan Former England batsman Michael Vaughan on TMS:""We have seen some wonderful bowling in the tournament but that was an exhibition from Mohammad Amir. It was a masterclass of how to bowl on a pitch that was doing a bit. ""It was his skill that outdid the batsmen not the conditions: 5-30 in this era is astonishing."" Ex-Pakistan bowler Waqar Younis on the TMS podcast:""Because Amir wasn't picked initially for the World Cup, it was hurting him a lot and luckily for him some of the other fast bowlers didn't perform well against England in the World Cup so Pakistan had no choice but to pick him. ""He had a point to prove and he's been bowling extremely well. That five-for will take him a long way in terms of his confidence."" This video can not be played Hafeez makes breakthrough as Finch out for 82 Geoff Lemon, Australian broadcaster on TMS:""Australia have been lucky on a couple of occasions now. ""Mitchell Starc saved them against West Indies and he did it again here. They were short despite hitting 307. From where they were, they should have got closer to 400. ""Their batting is disjointed too. Usman Khawaja ended up coming in at number six - he's never batted at six in a List A game, let alone a World Cup match!"" Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed:""I'm very disappointed. We lost three wickets in 15 balls and that's why we lost. ""We conceded too many runs in the first 20 overs apart from Mohammad Amir. We came back and restricted them well but it was a 270-280 pitch. ""We made some runs and got starts but we've got to convert them and go long. If you want to win matches your top four must score runs.""

Comic Relief to curb celebrity appeals,"Stacey Dooley and Richard Curtis Comic Relief is to send fewer celebrities abroad after criticism that stars like Stacey Dooley were going to Africa as ""white saviours"". The charity's co-founder, screenwriter Richard Curtis, told MPs TV appeals ""will be heading in the direction of not using"" celebrities abroad. He said they would be ""very careful to give voices to people"" who live there. MP David Lammy, who had criticised the Dooley film, praised the plan to move away from ""tired, harmful stereotypes"". Earlier this year, Comic Relief and Dooley - a documentary-maker and Strictly Come Dancing winner - were criticised after she travelled to Uganda to make an appeal film about the charity's work in the country.

Curtis, who wrote hit films including Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill, said: ""We heard the criticism, we were doing stuff to address it, we're accelerating the way that we address it."" In 2017, Ed Sheeran's video from Liberia for Comic Relief was handed a ""Rusty Radiator"" award, given to the ""most offensive and stereotypical fundraising video of the year"". Curtis told the House of Commons International Development Committee,externalthat this year's Comic Relief had included two films featuring UK celebrities in Africa - Dooley and the group ofstars who climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. Dooley hits back at Comic Relief criticism Lammy responds to Comic Relief donations drop Did Ed Sheeran commit 'poverty tourism'? ""We are trying to do everything we can to raise the maximum amount of money for our projects internationally,"" he explained. ""But if it is felt that Comic Relief is so influential in terms of image that you start to send out the wrong image, and that people who live in this country with African backgrounds feel as though they're in some way demeaned or negatively affected by Comic Relief, then we really have to listen to that. ""What I'm searching for year by year is new ways of telling the stories. Traditionally, the sadder the film, the more money it makes, but I'm sure there must be a solution where you show such radiant joy and success that that would encourage you to give more money."" Richard Curtis with fellow Comic Relief co-founder Lenny Henry Asked by MPs how Comic Relief would operate in the future, he replied that the charity was ""at a very interesting moment"" in learning lessons from successful online fundraising campaigns. ""We're not strong on that yet,"" he said. ""I imagine as we go into this new future, that will not be based on celebrities going abroad. I suspect we will start that new initiative not going that way. ""And then on the TV, I think we have to do what we think is best, and I think it will be heading in the direction of not using [celebrities abroad], and particularly being very careful to give voices to people abroad."" This video can not be played The women behind #nowhitesaviours He said Comic Relief had not acted ""robustly"" to the criticism over the Dooley film because it was focused on raising money at the time. In response, Labour MPMr Lammy wrote on Twitter,external: ""Looks like Comic Relief are finally ready to listen to hundreds of thousands of my constituents and others who support aid but want to move on from the tired, harmful stereotypes and tropes that surround it and prevent genuine equity and partnership."" Kelsey Nielsen of pressure group No White Saviours, who works in Uganda, said Comic Relief had pledged to make such changes in the past, and now needs to put them into practice. It needs to stop ""continuing this narrative that Africa is in need of the great white saviour and the great white influencers to come in,"" she told BBC News. Charities shouldn't stop sending people to Africa, but should do it in a way that's not ""manipulative or coercive"", she added. ""It's not about not helping and not caring, it's about the way it should be done. ""It's almost that idea that Africans should just be thankful for whatever help they get. That has a lot to do with the root of how we view each other. We would never tolerate that in our own countries, but because it's Africa we have a lower standard.""

Hong Kong leader criticises 'organised riots',"This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam criticised protests against a proposed bill that would allow extradition to China, calling them ""organised riots"". She said the clashes between protesters and police were ""unacceptable for any civilised societies"". Seventy-two people aged between 15 and 66 were injured in violence, including two men who were in critical condition. The bill's critics cite the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions and forced confessions in mainland China. They also fear that the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state in Hong Kong. All you need to know on the Hong Kong protests Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained Hope and defiance on the streets of Hong Kong Ms Lam's government has backed the bill, which is also supported by China. The Hong Kong government has said there will be legally binding human rights safeguards. Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) has delayed a second reading but the bill is expected to pass on a final vote on 20 June. The rallies against the extradition bill have been the biggest since Hong Kong was handed back to China by the British in 1997. On Wednesday, activists tried to storm government buildings and police responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets at crowds of demonstrators. The protesters also blocked key roads around government buildings and threw bricks and projectiles at police. This video can not be played The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse was inside the LegCo building Rights groups including Amnesty accused police of using excessive force, but Hong Kong Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung said police had had ""no choice"". As night fell on Wednesday, protesters remained in some streets in the central Hong Kong, behind makeshift barricades, despite sustained efforts by police officers to disperse them. Officials said 21 officers had been hurt in the clashes. Police have been using tear gas Separately, police said they were investigating death threats made against Ms Lam. In a tearful interview on a local TV station, Ms Lam dismissed accusations that she had ""sold out"" Hong Kong. ""I have grown up here with all the Hong Kong people, my love for this place has led me to make many personal sacrifices,"" she said. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said reports that security forces might be sent to Hong Kong from the mainland were ""fake news"". Police and protesters faced off on key roads The bill allows for extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau for suspects accused of criminal wrongdoing such as murder and rape. The requests would be decided on a case-by-case basis. The move came after a 19-year-old Hong Kong man allegedly murdered his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend while they were holidaying in Taiwan together in February last year. The man fled to Hong Kong and could not be extradited to Taiwan because the two do not have an extradition treaty. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests Hong Kong officials have said courts in the territory will have the final say over whether to grant extradition requests, and suspects accused of political and religious crimes will not be extradited. The government has also promised to only hand over fugitives for offences carrying a maximum sentence of at least seven years. Hong Kong has entered into extradition agreements with 20 countries, including the UK and the US. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen tweeted that her nation supported the protesters' ""demands for freedom"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Many Western nations have also criticised the extradition bill. British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt urged the Hong Kong government to ""listen to the concerns of its people and its friends in the international community and to pause and reflect on these controversial measures"". US President Donald Trump said he was sure China and Hong Kong would be able to ""work things out"", Reuters reported. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said European countries shared Hong Kong citizens' concerns over the extradition reforms, and called for the protesters' right to assemble and express themselves freely and peacefully to be respected. The protesters fear human rights abuses in China's legal system More than 100 businesses in Hong Kong said they would shut to allow their staff to protest and nearly 4,000 teachers said they would strike. Powerful business lobbies say they fear the plans will damage Hong Kong's competitiveness as a base of operations. On Sunday, protest organisers said more than a million people had taken to the streets, though police estimated turnout was 240,000 at its peak. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841 until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong has kept its judicial independence, its own legislature, its economic system and the Hong Kong dollar. Ms Lam has refused to scrap the bill Its residents were also granted protection of certain human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech and assembly. Beijing retains control of foreign and defence affairs, and visas or permits are required for travel between Hong Kong and the mainland. In 2014, tens of thousands protested against restrictions imposed from Beijing on who they could vote for as chief executive. Despite being mostly peaceful, the protests failed to achieve any concessions. Some of theorganisers have since been jailed on public nuisance charges. Are you attending the protests?

British teens killed in Bolivia car crash,"Freddie McLennan (left) and Joe Atkins, both 19, were due to start at university next term Two British teenagers on a gap year have died in a car crash in Bolivia. Freddie McLennan and Joe Atkins, both 19, were driving across salt flats in the South American country when their vehicle crashed on Sunday. Families of the teenagers, both former pupils at Cranbrook School, Kent, paid tribute to the ""exceptional"" young men. The 22-year-old Bolivian driver - named locally as Alberto Barco - also died in the crash, while a third British man was taken to hospital. The car is understood to have flipped over while being driven on Bolivia's famous Salar de Uyuni - the world's largest salt flat. The family of Mr Atkins, who was due to return home from a ""trip of a lifetime"" this week, said he had been ""elated with the adventure"". Recalling a recent phone call, they said: ""He said just how much he was looking forward to being back to enjoy home comforts, and to move on to the next stage at the University of Bristol."" Mr McLennan's family said they were ""eternally grateful that Freddie came into our lives"". ""He was thoroughly enjoying his opportunity to travel and experience new parts of the world, before preparing for the next stage in his life at Leeds University."" In a statementpublished on its website,external, the Cranbrook School said: ""We share the grief of the families at their tragic loss and offer them our sincerest condolences.""

"No water for 100,000 properties after pipe burstSchools close and hospital appointments are cancelled due to a burst water pipe in Hampton.","Tanya O'Connell said the lack of water delayed her taking medication while she recovered at home from an operation Schools have been closed and hospital appointments cancelled due to a burst pipe that has left 100,000 properties in London with little or no water. Thames Water said the fault at its works in Hampton had caused problems in the west and south-west areas. It said repairs to the pipe would continue throughout the night but that a bypass and water from elsewhere has meant supplies are returning to normal. The TW, KT and W postcodes have been affected. People were spotted stocking up on large amounts of bottled water in Twickenham Thirty schools and two children's centres in Richmond and Hounslow have been closed, including Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham, which has been left without flushing toilets and washing facilities in the kitchen. Surrey County Council also confirmed six schools had closed in Sunbury-on-Thames because of the issue. Hounslow and Richmond Community Healthcare NHS Trust said all planned clinics and sessions at Teddington Memorial Hospital and Teddington Health and Social Care Centre were cancelled. The evening fixture at Kempton Park Racecourse in Surrey has also been abandoned and, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Chiswick Library and King Street in Hounslow are shut. Ealing, Hounslow, Shepherds Bush and Hammersmith and Fulham have all been affected. Thames Water has set up bottled water stations at a public car park near the Hampton Pub in The Avenue and opposite the Millennium Boat House in Lower Sunbury Road. The company said that it expected ""all [water] supplies to come back on over the course of the evening"" following the repair work carried out. Shelves have been emptied of bottled water in some supermarkets A statement added: ""We've delivered hundreds of bottles of water to customers on our priority services list, including those with medical and mobility issues. ""We're really sorry for the inconvenience we've caused today and the time taken to resolve the problem. ""We'll be carrying out a full investigation into what caused the burst so we can take steps to stop it happening again."" Chelsea Willis was unable to bathe her daughter, who has eczema Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said it was ""unacceptable"" that so many people had been left without water ""for several hours with little or no information on when supplies will be restored"". He said he expected Thames Water to compensate all those affected. Chelsea Willis, from Teddington in south-west London, said the lack of water had prevented her from feeding and bathing her six-month-old daughter RhivÃ©r. ""My daughter has eczema so I have to bath her once a day,"" the 29-year-old said. ""I called my housing association, who said they couldn't help for 12 hours, but somebody there said they couldn't let me go without and personally ordered three bottles of water and got it delivered to me."" London 'facing water crisis' Mum stabbed as son, 3, sleeps in pushchair London's brutalist estate celebrates 50 years Tanya O'Connell, who lives in Twickenham, said the problem delayed her taking medication while she recovered at home following an operation last week. The 37-year-old bank manager said her surgeon told her to take soluble pain relief, which she was meant to take at 08:00. She said Thames Water ""promised they would send someone with emergency stuff"" but she had to eventually send her mother to the shop to buy water.

New Ebola outbreak in DRC 'truly frightening',"Nearly 1,400 people have died in a recent outbreak in DR Congo The head of a major medical research charity has called the latest outbreak of Ebola in central Africa ""truly frightening"". Nearly 1,400 people have died in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, said the epidemic was the worst since that of 2013-16 and has showed ""no sign of stopping"". Two people have also died in neighbouring Uganda, the first cases of Ebola reported in the country. A five-year-old boy infected with the virus died on Tuesday and his 50-year-old grandmother died on Wednesday, the Ugandan health ministry said. The Ugandan government has reported at least six other suspected cases of the virus. In a statement, Dr Farrar said the spread was ""tragic but unfortunately not surprising"". He warned that more cases were expected, and a ""full"" national and international response would be needed to protect lives. ""The DRC should not have to face this alone,"" he said. This video can not be played Treating Ebola in the DR Congo warzone Since the first case of Ebola in DR Congo last August, nearly 1,400 people have died - around 70% of all those infected. The outbreak is the second-largest in the history of the disease, with a significant spike in new cases in recent weeks. Only once before has an outbreak continued to grow more than eight months after it began - that was theepidemic in West Africa between 2013-16, which killed 11,310 people. Ebola disbelief widespread in Congo hotspots Why Ebola keeps coming back Efforts to contain the spread have been hindered by militia group violence and by suspicion towards foreign medical assistance. Nearly 200 health facilities have been attacked in DR Congo this year, forcing health workers to suspend or delay vaccinations and treatments. In February, medical charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) put its activities on hold in Butembo and Katwa - two eastern cities in the outbreak's epicentre. In Uganda, a five-year-old boy died of the virus on Tuesday, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officials said his grandmother and younger brother also had the disease. The boy is said to have travelled across the border with his family from DR Congo on Sunday. He was then taken to a Ugandan hospital after exhibiting symptoms, including vomiting blood, officials said. Seven other cases have been confirmed in the country, and Uganda's government said 50 people were suspected to have come into contact with those infected. The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is already the second deadliest in history Analysis by James Gallagher, Health and Science Correspondent, BBC News Cases of Ebola appearing in another country are always a significant and worrying development. The key question now is how far has the virus spread in Uganda? Has it been contained to just the family that crossed the border from DR Congo or has it spread more widely? This is a moment that Uganda has long prepared for and, hopefully, measures such as pre-emptively vaccinating healthcare workers will lower the risk of Ebola spreading. This outbreak is already the second largest in human history and some have predicted it could take up to two more years to bring to an end. The WHO has twice ruled that this Ebola outbreak is not a yet global emergency. Its Emergency Committee will meet again on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

In Uganda, mass gatherings including market days and prayers have been cancelled. Market days in the town of Kasese attract an estimated 20,000 people at the border area. Uganda's health ministry and the WHO saida rapid response team had been dispatched to identify others at risk,external. The country has already vaccinated about 4,700 health workers against the disease, according to a joint statement by WHO and Ugandan health officials. On Wednesday, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that he would hold an IHR Emergency Committee meeting on 14 June. The group will decide if the outbreak should now be deemed a public health emergency. Ebola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat. It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding. People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola.

Green secures rescue for Topshop empire,"Sir Philip Green Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire has been saved by a rescue deal that will trigger the closure of 48 stores and a thousand jobs. The plan, covering stores including Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Wallis, was approved by Arcadia's creditors. After a week's delay and five hours of discussion Arcadia's landlords finally agreed to rent cuts, 23 store closures and 520 job losses. Once the plan is in place another 25 stores and 500 jobs will be axed. Ian Grabiner, CEO of Arcadia Group, said he was ""confident about the future of Arcadia"". ""From today, with the right structure in place to reduce our cost base and create a stable financial platform for the Group, we can execute our business turnaround plan to drive growth."" Arcadia's landlords were voting on the company's rescue plan, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). This is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. In the case of Arcadia it will involve store closures and reduced rents across 194 of its 566 UK and Irish stores over a three-year period. Last week, Arcadia secured the backing of pensions trustees, the Pension Protection Fund and most of its suppliers, for its plan. However, it came up against stiff resistance from one of its biggest creditors, the shopping centre operator Intu, which called the deal ""unfair"" and voted against it. Intu owns and manages some of the UK's biggest retail properties. Landlord threatens Green's Topshop rescue Topshop boss wins key vote for rescue plan A spokesperson for the group said: ""We firmly believe that the terms of the Arcadia CVA are unfair to our full rent paying tenants and not in the interests of any of our other stakeholders, including Intu shareholders and the 130,000 people whose jobs rely on the success of our prime shopping centres."" Lady Tina Green, Sir Philip Green's wife and Arcadia's majority shareholder, has also committed to pay Â£25m annually into the pension funds over three years, plus an additional Â£25m. Rt Hon Frank Field MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said:  ""Now that, thankfully, Arcadia's life has been extended, the Committee will try to ensure that the Pensions Regulator gets an effective programme in place to ensure that Arcadia staff receive in full the pensions that Sir Philip and Lady Green have promised them."" Tina Green, owner of Arcadia with her husband, Arcadia chairman Sir Philip Green If the CVA had not been passed Arcadia had said it would have been forced to go into administration. Troubles at the group came to a head when it announced that sales in its stores open for more than a year fell 9% in 2018-19. Profits this year are expected to be Â£30m, compared with Â£219m two years ago. Faced with fixed charges of Â£100m a year, the group said it was struggling to pay its way - so it decided on a CVA. A CVA is a renegotiation of terms with a company's creditors as part of an insolvency procedure. Arcadia had argued that it was ""over-rented"", paying too much for the space it occupied and the CVA initially called for cuts of 30% to 70%. However, after stiff resistance from the landlords it softened its demand to rent cuts of between 25% and 50%. Retail analysts say Arcadia's misfortunes are due less to rentals than to its failure to compete. They say it has been losing out to contemporary ""fast-fashion"" retailers, ranging from High Street chains, such as Zara and H&M, to pure online players such as Asos. Chloe Collins, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Most of its brands such as Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge have lost relevance in today's retail landscape due to their uninspiring fashion ranges and weak multichannel offer. ""Even Topshop, which used to be Arcadia's star player, has lost appeal."" While many believe Arcadia needed more investment the Green family stands accused of taking billions out of the group at the point when it need it most. In 2005 a Â£1.2bn dividend, the largest corporate payout in UK history, was paid by Arcadia's parent company, Taveta, to the Green family. Topshop is considered the jewel in Arcadia's crown Lady Green has agreed to invest Â£50m of equity into the group, in addition to the Â£50m of funding already provided in March. However some analysts believe it may be too little too late. The investment would be ""too thinly spread"", GlobalData's Chloe Collins said. ""The agreed closures still leave Arcadia with an estate of around 500 stores which have been neglected for far too long and are now unable to match competition which moves in favour of experience-led shopping,"" she added. Ed Cooke, chief executive of retail property organisation Revo, said: ""It is clear that a CVA alone will not be enough to save the jobs of 18,000 hardworking Arcadia employees, and we hope the restructuring plans for the brands will be enough to ensure they have a sustainable future."" The restructuring has to be done quickly. Catherine Shuttleworth chief executive and founder of Savvy Marketing warned ""the clock is ticking - if they don't act fast they will be back with another CVA"". She said: ""They have to invest heavily in online. Shoppers at Topshop and Topman are more and more dissatisfied - they have to create a more seamless online shopping experience. ""They may also have to speed up the store closure programme, to have fewer but better stores, and they may sell off brands. They have been saying they already have some buyers interested."" As for Sir Philip's involvement Ms Shuttleworth said: ""So long as he produces the money, that's all that matters. Otherwise he should just let his management get on with it and stay away.""

"British teens killed in Bolivia car crashStudents Freddie McLennan and Joe Atkins, both 19, died while travelling across South America.Sussex","Freddie McLennan (left) and Joe Atkins, both 19, were due to start at university next term Two British teenagers on a gap year have died in a car crash in Bolivia. Freddie McLennan and Joe Atkins, both 19, were driving across salt flats in the South American country when their vehicle crashed on Sunday. Families of the teenagers, both former pupils at Cranbrook School, Kent, paid tribute to the ""exceptional"" young men. The 22-year-old Bolivian driver - named locally as Alberto Barco - also died in the crash, while a third British man was taken to hospital.

Hong Kong leader criticises 'organised riots'Carrie Lam is backing a controversial bill which has provoked a wave of protest in Hong Kong.,"This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam criticised protests against a proposed bill that would allow extradition to China, calling them ""organised riots"". She said the clashes between protesters and police were ""unacceptable for any civilised societies"". Seventy-two people aged between 15 and 66 were injured in violence, including two men who were in critical condition. The bill's critics cite the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions and forced confessions in mainland China. They also fear that the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state in Hong Kong. All you need to know on the Hong Kong protests Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained Hope and defiance on the streets of Hong Kong Ms Lam's government has backed the bill, which is also supported by China. The Hong Kong government has said there will be legally binding human rights safeguards. Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) has delayed a second reading but the bill is expected to pass on a final vote on 20 June. The rallies against the extradition bill have been the biggest since Hong Kong was handed back to China by the British in 1997. On Wednesday, activists tried to storm government buildings and police responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets at crowds of demonstrators. The protesters also blocked key roads around government buildings and threw bricks and projectiles at police. This video can not be played The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse was inside the LegCo building Rights groups including Amnesty accused police of using excessive force, but Hong Kong Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung said police had had ""no choice"". As night fell on Wednesday, protesters remained in some streets in the central Hong Kong, behind makeshift barricades, despite sustained efforts by police officers to disperse them. Officials said 21 officers had been hurt in the clashes. Police have been using tear gas Separately, police said they were investigating death threats made against Ms Lam. In a tearful interview on a local TV station, Ms Lam dismissed accusations that she had ""sold out"" Hong Kong. ""I have grown up here with all the Hong Kong people, my love for this place has led me to make many personal sacrifices,"" she said. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said reports that security forces might be sent to Hong Kong from the mainland were ""fake news"". Police and protesters faced off on key roads The bill allows for extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau for suspects accused of criminal wrongdoing such as murder and rape. The requests would be decided on a case-by-case basis. The move came after a 19-year-old Hong Kong man allegedly murdered his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend while they were holidaying in Taiwan together in February last year. The man fled to Hong Kong and could not be extradited to Taiwan because the two do not have an extradition treaty. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests Hong Kong officials have said courts in the territory will have the final say over whether to grant extradition requests, and suspects accused of political and religious crimes will not be extradited. The government has also promised to only hand over fugitives for offences carrying a maximum sentence of at least seven years. Hong Kong has entered into extradition agreements with 20 countries, including the UK and the US. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen tweeted that her nation supported the protesters' ""demands for freedom"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Many Western nations have also criticised the extradition bill. British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt urged the Hong Kong government to ""listen to the concerns of its people and its friends in the international community and to pause and reflect on these controversial measures"". US President Donald Trump said he was sure China and Hong Kong would be able to ""work things out"", Reuters reported. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said European countries shared Hong Kong citizens' concerns over the extradition reforms, and called for the protesters' right to assemble and express themselves freely and peacefully to be respected. The protesters fear human rights abuses in China's legal system More than 100 businesses in Hong Kong said they would shut to allow their staff to protest and nearly 4,000 teachers said they would strike. Powerful business lobbies say they fear the plans will damage Hong Kong's competitiveness as a base of operations. On Sunday, protest organisers said more than a million people had taken to the streets, though police estimated turnout was 240,000 at its peak. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841 until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong has kept its judicial independence, its own legislature, its economic system and the Hong Kong dollar. Ms Lam has refused to scrap the bill Its residents were also granted protection of certain human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech and assembly. Beijing retains control of foreign and defence affairs, and visas or permits are required for travel between Hong Kong and the mainland. In 2014, tens of thousands protested against restrictions imposed from Beijing on who they could vote for as chief executive. Despite being mostly peaceful, the protests failed to achieve any concessions. Some of theorganisers have since been jailed on public nuisance charges. Are you attending the protests?

From meat-packer to World Cup coach,"Desiree Ellis was assistant manager to Vera Pauw at the Rio Olympics in 2016 before being named manager last year Fifa Women's World Cup 2019 Host nation:FranceDates:7 June - 7 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV and Red Button, Radio 5 Live & Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website & app. ""We want to make sure we are never forgotten."" South Africa are competing in their first women's World Cup and are the lowest-ranked team in the tournament. But that isn't a barrier for Desiree Ellis, their manager who captained her country during a nine-year international career. The 56-year-old was born in Cape Town, grew up during apartheid and faced stereotyping every day while trying to make it as a footballer. South Africa face China in their second game of the tournament in Paris on Thursday. Although South Africa lost 3-1 to Spain in their opener on Saturday, Ellis tells BBC Sport they have already achieved ""the ultimate dream"" simply by qualifying. Who are the stars at the World Cup? Fixtures, groups and BBC TV coverage Ellis began playing football with boys. It wasn't until after Nelson Mandela's release from prison that a unified national team were formed for the women of South Africa. Ellis was called up for the trials in 1993, at the age of 30, and was made vice-captain - later wearing the armband full-time. She scored a hat-trick on her debut in a 14-0 win over Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland). But on her way back from that match in Johannesburg, the team bus broke down. Ellis couldn't make it back in time for a late shift, working at a meat-packing market, and she was fired. ""For three years I was out of work, just doing odd jobs here and there,"" said Ellis. ""It was tough but I was living my dream. ""Eventually, I got a new job and I played in the national team until I was 39. I had worked at a meat market. I made spices and made sure there was enough stock. ""I also had that door sales job in South Africa that many people have. It's where you walk for miles and miles and try to sell door-to-door. At the end of the day you don't sell anything and just come back home."" Unemployment was a challenge but Ellis had already fought off bigger issues during her football career - gender stereotyping. ""I remember my first proper game. I was a substitute. My dad was the only supporter on the field,"" said Ellis. ""I came on and scored a goal and we won 1-0. ""Many people back then didn't think it was right for girls to play football. People would say I wanted to be a boy but I just loved football. I had the support of my parents and that for me was important. Many kids don't have that."" Ellis was just 15 at the time, but a week later she was forced to undress in front of her team-mates to ""prove"" she was a girl who simply had incredible talent. ""I was flat-chested and short-haired,"" said Ellis. ""They said a girl couldn't play football like that. My dad said 'pull down your pants'. I did and then I just carried on playing."" Nelson Mandela had a huge influence on sport in South Africa after his release in 1990 from prison, where he had served 27 years Apartheid affected every aspect of life in South Africa from 1948 to the early '90s. Black citizens struggled against a political system enforcing a racial hierarchy. Ellis' family were among those who struggled before benefiting from the movement led by Mandela. Her father, an ever-present during Ellis' football career, supported and encouraged her love of the game. ""My father had the belief that I could go, do and be whatever I wanted to be,"" said Ellis. ""So I went and played my football. At times, there were certain places we couldn't go to. But we knew the country was changing and we just carried on and played our sport for the love of it. ""When Mandela was released, we then had a unified team. I came for trials and the friends that I made back then in 1993 are some of my greatest friends now. We still talk every day. That is what football has done for me. ""In every individual's life you have setbacks and challenges but it is how you deal with them. I have never been a quitter. I'm not a perfectionist but I always want to do the best and be my best."" Even after Ellis had achieved her dream - representing her country - she faced years of adversity thanks to unemployment. Now, she says, the sport has ""evolved"" and her team are given different opportunities. ""When I played in the national team, 90% of the players were unemployed,"" said Ellis. ""Now, 90% of the players have degrees, are still studying, are pundits on national television or ambassadors for huge organisations. Football has really opened a lot of doors."" In 2018, South Africa, then ranked 50th in the world, came runners-up in the Africa Women Cup of Nations to 11-time champions Nigeria. Despite losing the final in a penalty shootout, South Africa secured their qualification for the World Cup and it was considered one of the greatest days in the history of their national team. Ellis said even in her ""wildest imagination"" she could not have foreseen South Africa competing at a World Cup and the thought of it still gives her ""goosebumps"". ""As a player, I never had those opportunities. For anybody the ultimate is the World Cup,"" said Ellis. ""Nobody gave us a chance when we played Nigeria in the Afcon. We are definitely underdogs. It is our first time at the World Cup and it's not an easy draw. ""I think the support that has come from our federation has been fantastic. Without them, this wouldn't be possible. We needed a proper federation to qualify for the World Cup and now... Yay! ""We want people to be able to say 'wow'. We want to make sure we are never forgotten. Can you imagine if we do well? What will happen next?"" The ""magnitude of what the team had done"" had not been realised until South Africa returned home to face the Netherlands in a friendly in January and were given an incredible reception by their supporters. And their achievements had not gone unnoticed outside of the sport. ""If you look at the messages of support on social media, it has been amazing,"" said Ellis. ""Even the president called us when we were in Ghana [in the Afcon] to wish us good luck for the final. ""In parliament, I got mentioned in the president's speech. It shows how football is changing but it has to be continued with results. Slowly but surely, things will change.""

MI5 probe hit by 'unprecedented' threat level,"Khuram Butt was being investigated by MI5 from 2015 An investigation into one of the London Bridge attackers was suspended because of an ""unprecedented"" threat level which put pressure on MI5 resources. A senior MI5 officer told an inquest that the inquiry into Khuram Butt was suspended between March and May 2017. Butt then killed eight people during the attack on 3 June 2017, which he carried out with two other men. The court also heard that MI5 got an anonymous tip-off that Butt was ""an extremist"" more than two years before. Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market, injuring 48 others. Police shot and killed the attackers less than 10 minutes after the violence began. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Giving evidence shielded from public view, the officer - identified as Witness L - said the decision to suspend a number of investigations in 2017 was made amid ""the unprecedented level of threat which we were facing and therefore the pressure on our resources"". In March 2017 five people were killed during an attack on Westminster Bridge, and two months later 22 people died during an attack at Manchester Arena. The head of policy, strategy and capability in MI5's international counter-terrorism branch went on: ""In my 28 years (in MI5), I cannot recall a time as alarming as this time."" The investigation into Butt had also been suspended for around a month in February 2016 after a series of attacks in mainland Europe. Witness L said: ""I think it reflects the level of resourcing available. This and other similarly concerning investigations had to be suspended because there were even more concerning investigations above these."" He added: ""Money is not the key determinant here. ""Even if we'd asked for more money in November 2015, its ability to transfer into actual experienced investigators by 2016 would simply not be plausible."" The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden The Old Bailey heard that the security service received an anonymous call about Butt, more than two years before he carried out the attack, from an informant who specifically asked not to be contacted again. Witness L said the call ""identified an individual called Khuram Butt who was in the right sort of age range and said that he was an extremist"". MI5 already had Butt on its radar - he was identified as a supporter of banned extremist group Al-Muhajiroun in 2014 - but did not realise the call related to the same person until after the attack. This information was handed over before MI5 launched an official investigation into Butt in mid-2015 because of unconnected intelligence. The inquest has previously heard that Butt's brother-in-law hadreported him to a police anti-terror hotline in September 2015- although this information was never passed on to the joint MI5 and police investigation of Butt. Witness L told the court that a post-attack review, carried out by a manager in MI5 with a panel of experts, found ""the investigation into Khuram Butt was well and effectively run"". It also said the decisions to temporarily suspend investigations into Butt were ""logical and proportionate in the circumstances"". Police were not consulted about the suspensions ""in any systematic way"" but may have been spoken to informally, he added. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed in the attack.

Large parts of London without waterSchools close and hospital appointments are cancelled due to a burst water pipe in Hampton.,"Tanya O'Connell said the lack of water delayed her taking medication while she recovered at home from an operation Schools have been closed and hospital appointments cancelled due to a burst pipe that has left 100,000 properties in London with little or no water. Thames Water said the fault at its works in Hampton had caused problems in the west and south-west areas. It said repairs to the pipe would continue throughout the night but that a bypass and water from elsewhere has meant supplies are returning to normal. The TW, KT and W postcodes have been affected. People were spotted stocking up on large amounts of bottled water in Twickenham Thirty schools and two children's centres in Richmond and Hounslow have been closed, including Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham, which has been left without flushing toilets and washing facilities in the kitchen. Surrey County Council also confirmed six schools had closed in Sunbury-on-Thames because of the issue. Hounslow and Richmond Community Healthcare NHS Trust said all planned clinics and sessions at Teddington Memorial Hospital and Teddington Health and Social Care Centre were cancelled. The evening fixture at Kempton Park Racecourse in Surrey has also been abandoned and, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Chiswick Library and King Street in Hounslow are shut. Ealing, Hounslow, Shepherds Bush and Hammersmith and Fulham have all been affected. Thames Water has set up bottled water stations at a public car park near the Hampton Pub in The Avenue and opposite the Millennium Boat House in Lower Sunbury Road. The company said that it expected ""all [water] supplies to come back on over the course of the evening"" following the repair work carried out. Shelves have been emptied of bottled water in some supermarkets A statement added: ""We've delivered hundreds of bottles of water to customers on our priority services list, including those with medical and mobility issues. ""We're really sorry for the inconvenience we've caused today and the time taken to resolve the problem. ""We'll be carrying out a full investigation into what caused the burst so we can take steps to stop it happening again."" Chelsea Willis was unable to bathe her daughter, who has eczema Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said it was ""unacceptable"" that so many people had been left without water ""for several hours with little or no information on when supplies will be restored"". He said he expected Thames Water to compensate all those affected. Chelsea Willis, from Teddington in south-west London, said the lack of water had prevented her from feeding and bathing her six-month-old daughter RhivÃ©r. ""My daughter has eczema so I have to bath her once a day,"" the 29-year-old said. ""I called my housing association, who said they couldn't help for 12 hours, but somebody there said they couldn't let me go without and personally ordered three bottles of water and got it delivered to me."" London 'facing water crisis' Mum stabbed as son, 3, sleeps in pushchair London's brutalist estate celebrates 50 years Tanya O'Connell, who lives in Twickenham, said the problem delayed her taking medication while she recovered at home following an operation last week. The 37-year-old bank manager said her surgeon told her to take soluble pain relief, which she was meant to take at 08:00. She said Thames Water ""promised they would send someone with emergency stuff"" but she had to eventually send her mother to the shop to buy water.

No-deal Brexit: What you need to know,"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship Even though ""major unresolved topics"" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit. It would mean significant differences in the way we live and work. Prices could go upfor the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade onWorld Trade Organization (WTO) terms- the basic rules for countries without trade deals. The EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. With the UK alsoimposing tariffs on some EU goods,external- they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut. Food standardsfor UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays. Long queues for lorriesare possible because there would bemore border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays. Less choice of foodis a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs. Northern Irelandhas been the subject of separate talks on howan agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. But across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas. Fishinghas beenparticularly importantduring the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs. Co-operation on security and data-sharingwould become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons. There arebig questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries. The supply of medicines could be vulnerableto disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in placeto ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK. Talks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including: Healthcare:The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement thatwould replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries. Education:It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate inErasmus, which helps students study in other countries. Driving:Talks are still going on about whether UK nationalswill need International Driving Permitsfor short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required. Pensions:There has not yet been an agreement for peopleclaiming their UK state pensions in an EU countrythat would mean their pensions increase every year. If the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one. It has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible. But there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. Whether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January. Fortrips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border. Duty free shoppingwill return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. The right to live and work in the EUwill no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020. A new immigration systemwill come into force in the UK, involvinga points-based systemfor people wanting to work. Trade with the EUfor UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licences and special labelling for some types of foods, plants and live animals. Correction 8 December: A previous version of this story said UK nationals would not need International Driving Permits in EU countries from 1 January next year. In fact, talks are still ongoing on this issue. Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit What could happen to food prices after Brexit?

Child dies from Ebola in Uganda,"Nearly 1,400 people have died in a recent outbreak in neighbouring DR Congo A five-year-old boy in Uganda has died from Ebola, health officials have said. The death is the first in Uganda, amid a deadly outbreak in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. Officials said his grandmother and younger brother also had the disease. The Ugandan government is now reporting seven suspected cases of Ebola. The boy is said to have travelled across the border with his family from DR Congo on Sunday. He was then taken to a Ugandan hospital after exhibiting symptoms, including vomiting blood, officials said. Ebola disbelief widespread in Congo hotspots Why Ebola keeps coming back The World Health Organization (WHO), citing Uganda's Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng, announced on Twitter that the boy had died on Tuesday. More than 2,000 cases have been recorded in DR Congo in the last 10 months - most of which have been fatal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fifty people in Uganda are suspected to have come into contact with the seven people known to have contracted the deadly disease, the Ugandan government said. The government has suspended mass gatherings including market days and prayers. Market days in the town of Kasese attract an estimated 20,000 people at the border area. Uganda's health ministry and the WHO saida rapid response team had been dispatched to identify others at risk,externaland to follow up on eight other possible cases. Uganda has already vaccinated about 4,700 health workers against the disease, according to a joint statement by WHO and Ugandan health officials. This video can not be played Treating Ebola in the DR Congo warzone The outbreak in DR Congo is the second biggest in history, with a significant spike in new cases noted in recent weeks. Nearly 1,400 people have died of the disease since August. Only once before has an outbreak continued to grow more than eight months after it began - that was theepidemic in West Africa between 2013 and 2016, which killed 11,310 people. Ebola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat. It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding. People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola. Patients tend to die from dehydration and multiple organ failure. Ebola outbreak 'not global emergency yet' Ebola disbelief widespread in Congo hotspots Ebola in the DR Congo warzone.

"Breaking|Breaking newsMPs reject Labour plan for no-deal voteMPs reject chance to take control of Parliament's timetable, blocking the latest attempt to stop no-deal BrexitUK Politics","This video can not be played Tellers read out the result with a win for the government by 309 votes to 298 MPs have rejected a Labour-led effort to take control of Parliament's timetable, blocking the latest attempt to stop a no-deal Brexit. The Commons opposed the move by 309 votes to 298. If passed, it would have given opponents of a no-deal Brexit the chance to table legislation to thwart the UK leaving without any agreement on the 31 October deadline. The result of the vote was greeted with cheers from the Tory benches. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn responded by shouting ""you won't be cheering in September"". Ten Tory MPs, mostly pro-Europeans, rebelled against the government by backing Labour's motion. Conversely, eight Labour MPs - mostly Eurosceptics or MPs in constituencies which voted Leave at the referendum - defied party instructions and voted against it. A key factor for the government was the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists, who have voted against Theresa May during previous Brexit votes. I'm not aiming for no deal, says Johnson No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Live: Reaction as no-deal bid fails No deal would mean the UK leaving the EU without any agreement about the ""divorce"" process. Overnight, the country would be out of the single market, customs union and institutions such as the European Court of Justice and Europol. There are fears about widespread disruption in such an event - to trade, travel and the functioning of the Irish border, in particular. The opposition said the Commons defeat was disappointing, but it still believed there was a majority in the Commons against a no deal and it remained ""determined to win this fight"". ""There will be other procedural mechanisms we can use,"" shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said. ""We are already looking at what those other opportunities will be."" No 10 said giving MPs a ""blank cheque"" to dictate Brexit policy would have set a troubling precedent. Can Parliament stop no deal? Where do leadership candidates stand on Brexit? The UK was originally supposed to leave the EU on 29 March. But the EU decided on a seven-month extension after MPs rejected the terms of withdrawal on three occasions. Opponents of a no-deal exit are concerned that Theresa May's successor as prime minister could seek to take the UK out of the EU without parliamentary approval for such an outcome. Tory leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson and several of his rivals have said the UK must leave the EU by the revised date, whether a deal is passed or not. Wednesday's motion - supported by the Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru, as well as some Conservatives, would not, by itself, have ruled out a no deal. However, its supporters hoped to start a process on 25 June which could culminate with Parliament blocking the UK leaving without an agreement - in effect, tying the next prime minister's hands. Backing the motion, Conservative ex-minister Sir Oliver Letwin said the case for ensuring Parliament had a ""decisive vote"" on the next PM's Brexit plan ahead of the 31 October deadline transcended party politics. Given that leaving without a deal remains the default legal position, he said it was ""perfectly possible"" for the next PM to usher in a no-deal exit by ""simply doing nothing"" at all. Tory Remain supporter and former Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the motion was the ""last sensible opportunity"" to stop no deal. He added that in the future, if necessary, he would support efforts to bring down a Conservative government in a vote of no confidence if it was the only way to block such an outcome. But veteran Eurosceptic Conservative Sir Bill Cash said it was a ""phantom motion"" which paved the way for ""government by Parliament"". ""It just simply opens the door for any bill of any kind to take precedence over government business,"" he told by MPs. ""It is inconceivable as a matter of constitutional convention."" After the defeat, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, accused the Conservatives of ""putting party loyalty ahead of national interest"". This is not the first time that MPs have attempted to seize control of the Commons order paper in order to shift government policy on Brexit. MPs voted in March to oblige Mrs May to seek a Brexit delay from the EU. But efforts by Sir Oliver and others to come up with an alternative Brexit plan failed in April after MPs rejected all the options in a series of indicative votes.

Boohoo credits floral prints for sales surgeDemand for floral prints and block colours helps the fashion chain outperform its rivals.Business,"Surging demand for floral prints and soft tailored dresses have helped Boohoo post a huge jump in revenue for three months to the end of May. The fast fashion retailer, which also owns PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, said strong block colours and ankle boots had also sold well. Group sales jumped 39% to Â£254.3m, although Boohoo's lofty profit margins dipped. It came as Zara-owner Inditex posted record sales of â¬5.9bn for the quarter. The growth contrasts with tough times seen at many other retailers - particularly those focused on the UK High Street. Union claim Boohoo 'found wanting' Web designer sues Boohoo boss for Â£118m Boohoo advertised real fur as fake Just this week shares in Ted Baker dived 24% after it posted a profit warning. Meanwhile, the future of Philip Green's Arcadia, which owns Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, is hanging in the balance as it tries to secure a rescue deal to avoid going into administration. Boohoo's soft tailored dresses also sold well ""Boohoo continues to defy the broader gloom on the High Street thanks to its appeal among younger shoppers with the tight marketing focus around celebs and social media paying off. ""There are doubts though about whether it can maintain margins as well as this rapid sales growth, but for now it's the one of the brightest stars in an otherwise pretty dark sky,"" said analyst Neil Wilson from Markets.com. Founded in Manchester in 2006, Boohoo has become a hit with millennial shoppers by selling cut price, own-brand clothing that mirrors the latest celebrity trends. It does all its trade online, avoiding the challenges faced by bricks-and-mortar retailers such as high shop rents and business rates. However, it has faced questions about its production processes and itsapproach to workers' rights. On Wednesday shares in the firm opened lower amid concerns about its profit margins, but later rebounded. The company's shares are up more than 40% this year. It also said it was on course to post revenue growth of 25-30% for the full year. It came as Spain's Inditex, which as well as Zara also owns such brands as Bershka and Pull & Bear, reported a 10% jump in profits for the first quarter as online sales surged. The firm, which operates in 90 countries, said sales in the first six weeks of the second quarter were also up, as shoppers snapped up items like jewel-toned blazers and long-printed dresses from Zara's spring collections.

The firm, which operates in 90 countries, said sales in the first six weeks of the second quarter were also up, as shoppers snapped up items like jewel-toned blazers and long-printed dresses from Zara's spring collections.

Comic Relief to curb celebrity appealsCo-founder Richard Curtis's pledge comes after the row over Stacey Dooley's visit to Uganda.Entertainment & Arts,"Stacey Dooley and Richard Curtis Comic Relief is to send fewer celebrities abroad after criticism that stars like Stacey Dooley were going to Africa as ""white saviours"". The charity's co-founder, screenwriter Richard Curtis, told MPs TV appeals ""will be heading in the direction of not using"" celebrities abroad. He said they would be ""very careful to give voices to people"" who live there. MP David Lammy, who had criticised the Dooley film, praised the plan to move away from ""tired, harmful stereotypes"". Earlier this year, Comic Relief and Dooley - a documentary-maker and Strictly Come Dancing winner - were criticised after she travelled to Uganda to make an appeal film about the charity's work in the country.

Curtis, who wrote hit films including Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill, said: ""We heard the criticism, we were doing stuff to address it, we're accelerating the way that we address it."" In 2017, Ed Sheeran's video from Liberia for Comic Relief was handed a ""Rusty Radiator"" award, given to the ""most offensive and stereotypical fundraising video of the year"". Curtis told the House of Commons International Development Committee,externalthat this year's Comic Relief had included two films featuring UK celebrities in Africa - Dooley and the group ofstars who climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. Dooley hits back at Comic Relief criticism Lammy responds to Comic Relief donations drop Did Ed Sheeran commit 'poverty tourism'? ""We are trying to do everything we can to raise the maximum amount of money for our projects internationally,"" he explained. ""But if it is felt that Comic Relief is so influential in terms of image that you start to send out the wrong image, and that people who live in this country with African backgrounds feel as though they're in some way demeaned or negatively affected by Comic Relief, then we really have to listen to that. ""What I'm searching for year by year is new ways of telling the stories. Traditionally, the sadder the film, the more money it makes, but I'm sure there must be a solution where you show such radiant joy and success that that would encourage you to give more money."" Richard Curtis with fellow Comic Relief co-founder Lenny Henry Asked by MPs how Comic Relief would operate in the future, he replied that the charity was ""at a very interesting moment"" in learning lessons from successful online fundraising campaigns. ""We're not strong on that yet,"" he said. ""I imagine as we go into this new future, that will not be based on celebrities going abroad. I suspect we will start that new initiative not going that way. ""And then on the TV, I think we have to do what we think is best, and I think it will be heading in the direction of not using [celebrities abroad], and particularly being very careful to give voices to people abroad."" This video can not be played The women behind #nowhitesaviours He said Comic Relief had not acted ""robustly"" to the criticism over the Dooley film because it was focused on raising money at the time. In response, Labour MPMr Lammy wrote on Twitter,external: ""Looks like Comic Relief are finally ready to listen to hundreds of thousands of my constituents and others who support aid but want to move on from the tired, harmful stereotypes and tropes that surround it and prevent genuine equity and partnership."" Kelsey Nielsen of pressure group No White Saviours, who works in Uganda, said Comic Relief had pledged to make such changes in the past, and now needs to put them into practice. It needs to stop ""continuing this narrative that Africa is in need of the great white saviour and the great white influencers to come in,"" she told BBC News. Charities shouldn't stop sending people to Africa, but should do it in a way that's not ""manipulative or coercive"", she added. ""It's not about not helping and not caring, it's about the way it should be done. ""It's almost that idea that Africans should just be thankful for whatever help they get. That has a lot to do with the root of how we view each other. We would never tolerate that in our own countries, but because it's Africa we have a lower standard.""

UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050,"Greenhouse gas emissions in the UK will be cut to almost zero by 2050, under the terms of a new government plan to tackle climate change. Prime Minister Theresa May said there was a ""moral duty to leave this world in a better condition than what we inherited"". Cutting emissions would benefit public health and cut NHS costs, she said. Britain is the first major nation to propose this target - and it has been widely praised by green groups. But some say the phase-out is too late to protect the climate, and others fear that the task is impossible. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts? Will the government pay you to go green? What is climate change? Is Greta Thunberg right about UK carbon emissions? This video can not be played Theresa May: ""You can lower emissions... and have economic growth at the same time"" The UK already has a 2050 target - to reduce emissions by 80%. That was agreed by MPs under the Climate Change Act in 2008, but will now be amended to the new, much tougher, goal. The actual terminology used by the government is ""net zero"" greenhouse gases by 2050. That means emissions from homes, transport, farming and industry will have to be avoided completely or - in the most difficult examples - offset by planting trees or sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere. The government's advisory Committee on Climate Changerecommended the ""net zero"" target in May. Its report said if other countries followed the UK, there was a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended 1.5C temperature rise by 2100. A 1.5C rise is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change. Young people have been very vocal in demanding change - now a group will take part in a government review Laurence Tubiana, an architect ofthe crucial Paris climate agreement,told the BBC: ""This is a historic commitment that will reverberate right around the world. ""All eyes will now turn on the rest of the EU to match this pledge."" Theresa May said the UK led the world to wealth through fossil fuels in the industrial revolution, so it was appropriate for Britain to lead in the opposite direction. ""We have made huge progress in growing our economy and the jobs market while slashing emissions,"" she said. ""Now is the time to go further and faster to safeguard the environment for our children. We must lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth."" Number 10 said it was ""imperative"" other countries followed suit, so there would be a review within five years to ensure other nations were taking similarly ambitious action and British industries were not facing unfair competition. Scotland has already committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions tonet-zero by 2045, five years ahead of the UK government's target. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommended Wales should aim to cut emissions by a lower target of 95% by 2050 due to the importance of the farming industry to rural communities. But theWelsh government has since said it wants to go further - and will commit to net-zero by 2050, like the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland is the only devolved administration which does not have its own climate change legislation and emissions targets. If ministers decided to clamp down on meat-eating or on flying, that would meet serious opposition. But the government will attempt to make the clean revolution as painless as possible. Technology improvements like LED light bulbs, for instance, save emissions without people noticing. Greenpeace fears offsetting emissions by planting trees outside the UK will not work The same is true if people get hydrogen central heating instead of gas, or if they are obliged to drive electric cars rather than petrol vehicles. But there will need to be a massive investment in clean energy generation - and that has to be funded by someone. The government hasn't yet spelled out if the cost will fall on bill-payers, or tax-payers, or the fossil fuel firms that have caused climate change. And then there's the international dimension. Prof Dieter Helm, from the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University, said: ""From the UK's end, doing this unilaterally, we have to be very careful that we don't simply say: 'we're going to reduce the emissions from our cars and our power stations here in Britain, but we're going to carry on importing those emissions from overseas.' ""We don't make very much in this country. Manufacturing is only 20% of the economy. Most of the stuff that you go and buy in the supermarket... it's all imported."" What's your diet's carbon footprint? What is a climate emergency? How can I help? Chancellor Philip Hammond haswarned of a potential cost of Â£1 trillion by 2050. The cash will have to come from somewhere, he said - maybe from schools, hospitals and the police. However, Chris Skidmore, the acting energy minister, said the costs would amount to between 1 and 2% of the UK's GDP - which was the same amount factored in to reach the previous 80% reduction target. Therefore it would not be the case that there would be less money to spend elsewhere, he said. He added that the green economy would generate jobs and the cost of green technologies was coming down all the time. The climate change contrarian Bjorn Lomborg, author of Skeptical Environmentalist, said: ""Mr Hammond is right to highlight the cost - and in fact, he is likely to be underestimating the real price tag."" Campaigners said Mr Hammond's sums did not take into account the benefits of cleaner air and a more stable climate. Following the Committee on Climate Change's recommendations last month, scientists, campaigners and health professionals have been urging Mrs May to bring in a net zero target before she stands down. The government will lay a ""statutory instrument"" in the Commons on Wednesday - a tactic that allows it to be fast-tracked through both houses of Parliament if other parties agree - which on this issue they generally do. Like any government decision it could be overturned by future governments. But the majority of Tory leadership candidates are backing it - and revoking the Act would need a majority Commons vote at a time when the public appear very concerned about the climate. This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally Mrs May has taken the unusual step of announcing that a group of young people will advise the government on priorities for environmental action. They will start their review in July. This is seen as a nod towards young voters, many of whom have recently taken to the streets protesting that their environment was being destroyed. The magnitude of the task is clear. The UK is already slipping away from its mid-term carbon targets of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. ""Achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions is necessary, feasible and cost-effective,"" said professor Phil Taylor, head of engineering at Newcastle University. ""But UK policy is still way off the mark and the foundations are not in place to be able to meet this target. ""Even with all the evidence before us we are still opening new coal mines, extending Heathrow airport and pushing forward with fracking. ""We have unambitious building regulations, and our drive to phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2040 is too late."" Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Royal Institution, warned that the public might not support carbon-cutting measures such as turning down thermostats in the home. And he questioned the ability of the government to insulate enough houses in time. ""The prize for improving the efficiency of buildings is significant,"" he said. ""However, there is a practical challenge in terms of the number of sufficient skilled workers to undertake the work, and then of course the barrier of getting homeowners to get the work done."" There will be major difficulties, too, in supplying low-carbon heating to homes and industries as natural gas is phased out. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, said it was a ""big moment"" for the climate but there were questions around plans to allow for international carbon credits which allow the UK to pay to offset its emissions elsewhere in the world. Such off-setting had a history of failure, was not cost-efficient and shifting the burden to developing nations undermined the commitment, he told the Guardian. Chris Skidmore, the acting energy minister, said the government did not ""intend"" to use international carbon credits but had kept it ""as an option"". ""We need to be able to decarbonise in the best possible way so we don't want to rule it out,"" he said. Mrs May's announcement indicates that she has taken notice of potential industrial pitfalls. To assuage Treasury fears about competitiveness, she has stipulated that the net zero policy should be reviewed in five years to see whether other nations were taking similar actions. That might prove problematic if US President Donald Trump -who denigrates climate change- is still in the White House. Meanwhile, the radical green group Extinction Rebellion is warning that the climate is changing so fast that 2050 is far too late to eliminate emissions in order to ensure that temperature rise stays well under 2C. 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

Joshua is finished in boxing - FuryTyson Fury says Anthony Joshua showed he did not want to be in the ring when he lost to Andy Ruiz Jr.,"This video can not be played Tyson Fury says Anthony Joshua is finished after his defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr Tyson Fury v Tom Schwarz Venue:Las VegasDate:15 JuneTime:About 04:00 BST, 16 June Coverage:Commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live; text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. Tyson Fury believes former world champion Anthony Joshua is ""finished"" after his shock defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr. Joshua, 29, gave up his IBF, WBA and WBO titles in a seventh-round stoppage loss to Ruiz in New York on 1 June. Speaking before Saturday's bout with Tom Schwarz - which will be broadcast by BBC Radio 5 Live - Fury said Joshua did not want to be in the ring. ""When a man doesn't want to be there once, he will always do it and it's hard to come back from,"" said Fury. ""It's been done many different times by many different fighters. He did it that night and I don't think he will come back from it. Finished. Ask any top trainer who has been around the sport a lifetime. When he got to the ring I saw he didn't want to be there."" Listen: 5 Live Boxing: Mad evening at Fury Manor Listen: 5 Live Boxing: Is Fury number one? Fury and Warrington bouts on BBC Radio 5 Live Fury's Las Vegas contest with Schwarz will air on 5 Live in the early hours of Sunday morning in the UK. The bout comes two weeks after Ruiz ripped up the heavyweight division's plot lines by inflicting a first career defeat on Joshua, who had previously made Fury an offer to fight. ""Everybody thought that man could beat me,"" Fury added. ""In what world could he ever beat me? What were people seeing? I don't know what people were looking at as I don't know in what world he could have beaten me."" Fury this week said he respects Joshua and regards him as ""a winner in life"" for how he has achieved sporting success after brushes with the law in his youth. But Joshua's loss has halted talk of any immediate fight with Fury or WBC champion Deontay Wilder as the 2012 Olympic champion is now intent on fulfilling a rematch with Ruiz. Fury, who battled mental health and drug issues before returning to the sport after a 31-month spell of inactivity in June of 2018, believes Joshua will lose the repeat fixture. In referencing Ruiz's much publicised fleshy physique and his own win over Wladimir Klitschko in 2015, Fury told 5 Live Boxing's Mike Costello and Steve Bunce that such results prove ""body types mean nothing in boxing."" ""Physically Joshua could out-train everyone,"" added Fury, 30. ""He would break every heart monitor, has probably worn out every treadmill in the gym, smashes the bag, it's all very unimportant. ""Boxing isn't rocket science and today people are trying to make it a scientist thing. If you can fight you can fight if you can't you can forget about it. You can eat every protein bar in the world, when you get banged on the chin and panic, it don't really help you much. ""People who don't understand boxing look at a fat man and think he can't fight. The best feeling I got from it was the two best conditioned fighters in the last 20 years have been Klitschko and Joshua and they both got done by two fat men."" This video can not be played Tyson Fury says Deontay Wilder 'isn't man enough' to face him or speak to him Undefeated Fury is a 1-25 favourite against Schwarz in his first fight since his epic draw with Wilder in December, where many ringside observers felt he should have been given a points victory despite being floored twice. Both his and Wilder's team have loosely agreed a rematch in 2020, though a venue has not been agreed and financial terms have not been negotiated. Fury, who lost around 10st in the 12 months leading up to the contest, says his relationship with Wilder is now strained. ""If I was a match fit fighter and some fat man comes off drugs and alcohol and done that to me I'd never look at the sport again,"" said Fury. ""Does Deontay Wilder have anything to bother me? Nothing at all. ""I've been hurt 1,000 times but Wilder didn't hurt me once. He hit me in the back of the head, scrambled my senses and the last knockdown was a touch of sleep but didn't hurt me. Those same punches that caught me then are not going to touch me when I'm match fit. ""They thought I'd be half the man. I had to con them to think I was only there for a pay day. I couldn't be at my best but still beat him at nowhere near my best. He isn't man enough to face me anymore or speak to me. He used to text me back and forth. I've text him five times and he hasn't replied once."" Schwarz, 25, is unbeaten in 24 fights and impressed 5 Live's Bunce with his movement when he and Fury performed open workouts at the MGM Grand Hotel on Tuesday. Saturday's contest will be Fury's first on his lucrative deal with ESPN and his team were keen to pick a bout which would lend itself to showcasing their fighter on his new broadcast platform. Germany's Schwarz has therefore been largely written off but Fury warned his opponent has been training while he has shouldered the majority of the media commitments both in the UK and US. ""Any man who is unbeaten and his full life changes with a win, I don't take that as an easy fight,"" added Fury. ""All it takes is one or two punches. That is all it takes. If you're 12 rounds ahead and get knocked out it's pointless. So I am not convinced it's easy.""

Inquiry to be held into fatal helicopter crash,"Four people died in the 2013 crash A fatal accident inquiry is to be held into a helicopter crash which killed four people near Shetland in 2013. A total of 18 people were on board when the Super Puma crashed on its approach to Sumburgh. Passengers Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin; Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness; Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland; and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, died. No date for the inquiry has been announced. There have been repeated calls for a fatal accident inquiry to be held into the crash, which took place on 23 August 2013. Almost two years ago,the mother of victim Sarah Darnley said an inquiry should be held soon. On Wednesday, the Crown Office said the investigation into the crash had reached ""a significant stage"". There is a memorial to the victims in Shetland It said: ""Crown Counsel have instructed that a fatal accident inquiry be held into the deaths of Duncan Munro, Sarah Darnley, Gary McCrossan and George Allison, who were passengers being transported from North Sea oil and gas platforms to the mainland."" The Crown Office said the investigation had been ""complex and challenging"", and that it would continue to keep the victims' relatives informed of developments. Responding to the development revealed by the BBC Scotland news website, Shetland MSP Tavish Scott said: ""It's taken too long but it's very important now that the families who lost loved ones do see some answers and receive closure on a terrible incident that happened all those years ago."" In 2016, a report said flight instruments were ""not monitored effectively"" by the pilots in the moments leading up to the crash. Pilots criticised over helicopter crash The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said a lack of monitoring meant a reduction in air speed was not noticed by the pilots. Attempts to recover were too late. The report also said the impact with the water had been ""survivable"". It said one of the four victims had been unable to escape, one was incapacitated by a head injury, one drowned before reaching the surface, and the other died in the life raft from a chronic heart condition.

US runner Grunewald dies aged 32,"Grunewald's husband Justin shared this image of him running alongside Gabriele in announcing she had died Gabriele Grunewald, the US distance runner hailed as an inspiration for her spirit in fighting cancer for 10 years, has died at the age of 32 . Grunewald - the US champion over 3,000m indoors in 2014 - is the 12th-fastest American woman in history over 1500m. World marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe praised her determination, while others left messages on the #bravelikegabe hashtag. Her husbandwrote on Instagram,externalthat she died ""peacefully with no suffering"". Read: 'Thank you for showing me what bravery looks likeâ ""At 7:52 I said 'I can't wait until I get to see you again' to my hero, my best friend, my inspiration, my wife,"" wrote Justin Grunewald. ""I always felt like the Robin to your Batman and I know I will never be able to fill this gaping hole in my heart or fill the shoes you have left behind. Your family loves you dearly as do your friends. ""To everyone else from all ends of the earth, Gabriele heard your messages and was so deeply moved. She wants you to stay brave and keep all the hope in the world. Thanks for helping keep her brave in her time of need."" The US Olympic Committee paid tribute, posting on Twitter: ""Thank you for teaching us what it means to be brave and courageous. Your story and memory will inspire the Team USA family for a lifetime."" World, European and Commonwealth medallist Jo Pavey tweeted: ""The running community has lost someone very special. A truly inspiring and courageous person. Thinking of Gabe's family and friends."" Grunewald has accompanied her husband on some of his training runs despite her cancer diagnosis Grunewald continued to train and race despite her cancer diagnosis that saw her have several treatments to rid her of the illness, including having half of her liver removed in 2016. After having radiotherapy during her second cancer treatment in 2011, she finished fourth in the US 1500m trials for the 2012 London Olympics, missing out on a place in the team by one position. Grunewald, who often trained with her husband on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, thought she was cancer free in 2016 - but within two years, scans showed she needed further treatment. On Monday, Justin used social media to state Grunewald had been admitted to end-of-life care. In addition to Radcliffe, 2006 London Marathon winner Deena Kastor, and American distance runner Kara Goucher thanked Grunewald for her inspirational attitude prior to her death.

The woman who makes cannabis oil 'to help people',"Marie, speaking to BBC journalist Samantha Poling, says she needs to remain anonymous because what she is doing is illegal Marie is a British mother-of-four who helps run an illegal cannabis oil laboratory in the mountains of Spain. What she is doing is against the law in both Spain and Britain, but Marie claims she is helping people with a range of conditions gain access to a medicinal drug they are currently unable to get on prescription. Marie (not her real name) agreed to show me her entire operation on condition I kept her identity a secret. I asked her why she had to be anonymous. ""Because it's illegal,"" she said. ""Because I don't want to be stopped from what I'm doing, because if I am then a lot of people are going to be left in the lurch."" The ""people"" she is referring to are generally sick - they are adults with fibromyalgia or diabetes, and children with epilepsy. I flew to Spain to meet Marie after a tip-off from a family I met in Scotland. The THC compound is extracted from the cannabis bud I was investigating medical cannabis and filming with families of children with drug-resistant epilepsy who were keen to try the medicine. One family I met had been dosing their child with a strain which contained THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive part of the plant. There is some evidence that cannabis medicines containing THC can help with epilepsy and reduce seizures. But there is also evidence it can cause seizures. Legally, doctors can now prescribe cannabis oil products in the UK but they are refusing to, saying it needs to be trialled properly to show that it is safe and that it works. Marie and the location of her cannabis oil operation need to remain anonymous In response, some people have been going to countries such as the Netherlands to get medical cannabis on prescription while others have turned to the black market. Experts warn this is a bad idea because their products are not pharmaceutical grade. They say there can be a ""very real danger"" because users do not know exactly what is in the dealer's products. The family I met in Scotland felt they had a black market dealer who actually wanted to help people - that was Marie. CCTV cameras are in operation to protect the site Marie told me she makes the oils because she had used cannabis herself for a medical condition and was sick of buying from street dealers. ""It was awful,"" she says. ""But it was out of necessity, not because I'm a hardened criminal. I kept getting ripped off by them and so I decided to grow it myself."" Her illicit activities soon brought the attention of the police in Britain. By then, she had met a man and fallen in love. It took her to Spain. She says: ""I made a pact there and then that I would help other people so that they wouldn't be ripped off as I had been. And that's how it all started."" The cannabis is grown in a small white-washed building up a narrow lane I met Marie in a bar west of Alicante, then she drove me into the mountains along dusty tracks lined with almond trees. The first stop is where they grow the plants. A small white-washed building up a narrow lane. There are bars on the windows and doors and CCTV cameras. Other criminals sometimes come and steal the product, she tells me. The door does not open far before we are hit with the sweet, pungent and unmistakeable aroma of cannabis. We go from room to room. The plants are in various stages of growth. Once the perfect size and age, the buds will be picked and dried and transported to the lab, which is where she takes me next. The laboratory where Marie makes the cannabis oils We head north, back through the fields of almonds and towards the hills. Then we lurch along the final stretch of a pot-holed dusty track and stop outside a small crop of outbuildings in the middle of nowhere. There is the obligatory metal fencing, the big barking guard dog and cameras - but once we are through the gates, everything changes. There, sitting incongruously in the arid Spanish plains, is a laboratory. Once inside, the air conditioning does much to dampen the heat, but the pungent aroma of cannabis remains. Marie tells me she is going to make up some oil, so I can see how easy the process is. I'm not going to detail it here, but she is right -  the process does look pretty simple. The larger syringes sell for hundreds of euros The larger syringes containing the oil can sell for several hundred euros but Marie tells me that if families really need it and do not have the money, she will give it to them for much less, sometimes for nothing. Marie says this is part of her idea of ""paying it forward"", but what she really wants is to teach people how to do it themselves. She says: ""I want people to be self-sufficient so that we don't have to break the law on their behalf. ""Or I want the government in the UK to pull their fingers out and actually implement a system quickly. There isn't time for people to be waiting with dying children. ""I want them (the government) to implement a system quickly whereby people have access to quality medication, that they know what's in it and dosing programmes."" Marie says there has been an increase in people asking for THC meds since the UK government changed the rules on prescriptions last year. She says people think that if the government is saying legal medical cannabis is OK, then it can't be as bad as they used to say it was. However, Marie also says that she wants to stop running her cannabis oil operation. ""I don't want the stress, I don't want the responsibility, I don't want people calling me at two o'clock in the morning because they've run out of oil,"" she said. ""It's just way too much responsibility. I won't have people crying at me because their child's had 40 seizures."" Marie says she has dozens of customers in the UK. Does she worry she is selling to desperate people, often with very sick children? She admits that she has ""no control"" over what happens to the product once she sends it to people. ""We do the best that we can to provide a quality product,"" she says. The oils are sent diluted, she says, with recommendations to be very careful with dosing protocols. ""But we try not to take too much part of what goes on from there because I don't want that responsibility,"" she says. ""My bit is to help them, but I would rather parents produce their own plants and made their own oil under guidance rather than me having to be part of that process.""

Government orders Whirlpool to recall dryers,"The government is to issue an ""unprecedented"" recall notice of up to 500,000 Whirlpool tumble dryers which pose a fire safety risk. It comes four years after Whirlpool issued a warning after it found its Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit dryers had a fault which needed fixing. The fault was blamed for at least 750 fires over an 11-year period, according to the government. Whirlpool said safety was its ""number one priority"". It urged anyone still owning an affected dryer to contact the company immediately on0800 151 0905. A spokeswoman added: ""In the meantime, anyone with an affected dryer that has not been modified should unplug it and not use it until the modification has been completed."" An estimated 5.3 million dryers were sold in the UK, but it is thought up to 500,000 could still be in use. Last year, the BBC's Watchdog Live consumer programme uncovered cases in which machines had caught fire even after being fixed. Whirlpool 'must step up fire-risk warnings' Safety flaws 'exposed by danger dryers' Fresh fears over danger tumble dryers And in April, the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) published a report, urging Whirlpool to improve its risk management, and""reach affected consumers in more creative ways""to minimise the risk of faulty machines still being in people's homes. Business minister Kelly Tolhurst told the Commons that the recall notice was ""unprecedented action"". She was responding to Conservative minister Andrew Griffiths, who told MPs that he was still concerned about whether people still had ""unsafe products"" in their homes. Mark Studley said the dryer caught fire in a room in which his children, then aged two and four, regularly used to play Mark Studley, 40, said his family came home one day in July last year to find their house ""full of smoke"" after their Whirlpool tumble dryer caught fire. He said the dryer - which was stored near his children's play room - ""could have killed"" them if it had caught ablaze overnight. Mr Studley, from Bridgwater in Somerset, told the BBC: ""The fire report states that it's an internal wiring fault in the machine, and all of this was caused - approximately Â£8,000 worth of damage - when the machine was turned off. ""If this had happened 12 hours earlier or later than it did, myself and my family risked death as it would've been in the early hours and we would've been asleep."" Rachel Reeves, Labour chairwoman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said the move was ""long overdue"". ""Finally, over a year since we called for a recall of defective machines and 18 months since the Beis Committee reported on Whirlpool's inadequate response to safety flaws, the government is at last showing some teeth,"" she said. This video can not be played Are tumble dryers still a fire risk? David Chaplin, a spokesman for consumer group Which? said there were still ""serious questions"" about the 500,000 unmodified machines that ""Whirlpool has already struggled to locate"". He said: ""People's lives have been put at risk for far too long, so it's a hugely significant step that these machines are set to be recalled. ""The government must urgently explain what it is going to do about the millions of modified machines still in people's homes, following serious concerns that have been raised by people who have experienced fires, smoke and burning despite the so-called fix."" A Whirlpool Corporation spokeswoman said: ""We remain committed to resolving any affected tumble dryers that have not yet been modified. ""To this end, we are in ongoing discussions with the Office for Product Safety and Standards to agree additional measures we have proposed to reach consumers who have not yet engaged with this safety programme. ""We have co-operated with OPSS throughout its recent review of the programme and welcome its findings that consumers whose tumble dryers have been modified can continue to use them safely.""

Schwarz, 25, is unbeaten in 24 fights and impressed 5 Live's Bunce with his movement when he and Fury performed open workouts at the MGM Grand Hotel on Tuesday. Saturday's contest will be Fury's first on his lucrative deal with ESPN and his team were keen to pick a bout which would lend itself to showcasing their fighter on his new broadcast platform. Germany's Schwarz has therefore been largely written off but Fury warned his opponent has been training while he has shouldered the majority of the media commitments both in the UK and US. ""Any man who is unbeaten and his full life changes with a win, I don't take that as an easy fight,"" added Fury. ""All it takes is one or two punches. That is all it takes. If you're 12 rounds ahead and get knocked out it's pointless. So I am not convinced it's easy.""

Free prom dress plea 'hit a chord',"This video can not be played Pupils felt uneasy about attending their school prom without a gown Three years ago Maesteg Comprehensive School held its first ""prom"" party for its year 11 students to celebrate finishing their GCSEs. Head teacher Helen Jones thought the new tradition imported from America was ""fantastic"" - but it also created a problem when they realised a pupil was not going to attend because of the cost of the outfit. ""It becomes an overwhelming experience for a lot of our children, particularly girls, with the pressure to look their very best,"" she said. ""It can run into hundreds [of pounds], if not thousands, and that's something that I never wanted to encourage."" So two of the school's PE teachers, Emily Scudamore and Annemarie Scarr, put out an appeal on social media for donations of prom gowns for pupils to use for free. They have now received about 200 gowns, plus shoes and accessories, from ex-pupils, local people and businesses, including 30 brand new dresses from a wedding shop in nearby Pyle. PE teachers Emily Scudamore and Annemarie Scarr have organised the collection ""It's hit a chord with a lot of people... the kindness of strangers and obviously through social media. I'm truly overwhelmed by the response we've had,"" said Mrs Scarr. The school is holding a ""pop-up"" shop this week, and promoting a ""vintage vibe"" in case there is any stigma around borrowing the dresses. Most of the gowns have only been worn once. ""It's not just about targeting those who couldn't afford the best dress. It's a real opportunity... to discourage them from this throwaway society that we live in, and also to instil a sense of community,"" said Mrs Scarr. The English town that really loves a school prom Young and in the red: Personal debt in five charts 'Selfie' body image warning issued Sixth-formers Katelin Jenkins and Megan Curling, both 18, previously went to their own prom and are enthusiastic about helping with the pop-up shop. ""Some of my friends were spending huge amounts of money... It's because it's prom and everybody thinks 'I have to go big, I have to have that big dress' when you don't,"" said Megan. Katelin agreed the prom event had come with ""massive pressure"". ""Don't worry about the pressure of 'Will I look right? How much has everyone else paid?' Just enjoy the night,"" she said. Head teacher Helen Jones recognises the financial pressure that comes with the American ""prom"" tradition The school is not stopping at dresses - it has also asked Bridgend College to help with hair and make-up and hopes to source suits for pupils in future. Nearly a quarter of its pupils, above the Welsh average, are entitled to free school meals and Ms Jones had questioned whether they should be running the prom at all. But overall the pupils wanted to have the event, so the school has decided to do what they can to keep it ""inclusive"". ""Austerity has affected everybody and tends to hit areas like Maesteg and lots of Valleys communities first. Certainly the recent news of the closing of the Ford factory [in Bridgend] has ricocheted around the community. It's bound to impact on our families,"" she said. ""We also provide buses to the venue because we don't want the nonsense that comes with limos, you name it. ""There are enough pressures and trials for our young people at the moment to survive, without the added pressure of this, which is supposed to be a celebration of what they've achieved at the end of their formal education.""

The woman who makes cannabis oil 'to help people'Marie runs an illegal cannabis oil laboratory in the mountains of Spain because she says she wants to help people.Scotland,"Marie, speaking to BBC journalist Samantha Poling, says she needs to remain anonymous because what she is doing is illegal Marie is a British mother-of-four who helps run an illegal cannabis oil laboratory in the mountains of Spain. What she is doing is against the law in both Spain and Britain, but Marie claims she is helping people with a range of conditions gain access to a medicinal drug they are currently unable to get on prescription. Marie (not her real name) agreed to show me her entire operation on condition I kept her identity a secret. I asked her why she had to be anonymous. ""Because it's illegal,"" she said. ""Because I don't want to be stopped from what I'm doing, because if I am then a lot of people are going to be left in the lurch."" The ""people"" she is referring to are generally sick - they are adults with fibromyalgia or diabetes, and children with epilepsy. I flew to Spain to meet Marie after a tip-off from a family I met in Scotland. The THC compound is extracted from the cannabis bud I was investigating medical cannabis and filming with families of children with drug-resistant epilepsy who were keen to try the medicine. One family I met had been dosing their child with a strain which contained THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive part of the plant. There is some evidence that cannabis medicines containing THC can help with epilepsy and reduce seizures. But there is also evidence it can cause seizures. Legally, doctors can now prescribe cannabis oil products in the UK but they are refusing to, saying it needs to be trialled properly to show that it is safe and that it works. Marie and the location of her cannabis oil operation need to remain anonymous In response, some people have been going to countries such as the Netherlands to get medical cannabis on prescription while others have turned to the black market. Experts warn this is a bad idea because their products are not pharmaceutical grade. They say there can be a ""very real danger"" because users do not know exactly what is in the dealer's products. The family I met in Scotland felt they had a black market dealer who actually wanted to help people - that was Marie. CCTV cameras are in operation to protect the site Marie told me she makes the oils because she had used cannabis herself for a medical condition and was sick of buying from street dealers. ""It was awful,"" she says. ""But it was out of necessity, not because I'm a hardened criminal. I kept getting ripped off by them and so I decided to grow it myself."" Her illicit activities soon brought the attention of the police in Britain. By then, she had met a man and fallen in love. It took her to Spain. She says: ""I made a pact there and then that I would help other people so that they wouldn't be ripped off as I had been. And that's how it all started."" The cannabis is grown in a small white-washed building up a narrow lane I met Marie in a bar west of Alicante, then she drove me into the mountains along dusty tracks lined with almond trees. The first stop is where they grow the plants. A small white-washed building up a narrow lane. There are bars on the windows and doors and CCTV cameras. Other criminals sometimes come and steal the product, she tells me. The door does not open far before we are hit with the sweet, pungent and unmistakeable aroma of cannabis. We go from room to room. The plants are in various stages of growth. Once the perfect size and age, the buds will be picked and dried and transported to the lab, which is where she takes me next. The laboratory where Marie makes the cannabis oils We head north, back through the fields of almonds and towards the hills. Then we lurch along the final stretch of a pot-holed dusty track and stop outside a small crop of outbuildings in the middle of nowhere. There is the obligatory metal fencing, the big barking guard dog and cameras - but once we are through the gates, everything changes. There, sitting incongruously in the arid Spanish plains, is a laboratory. Once inside, the air conditioning does much to dampen the heat, but the pungent aroma of cannabis remains. Marie tells me she is going to make up some oil, so I can see how easy the process is. I'm not going to detail it here, but she is right -  the process does look pretty simple. The larger syringes sell for hundreds of euros The larger syringes containing the oil can sell for several hundred euros but Marie tells me that if families really need it and do not have the money, she will give it to them for much less, sometimes for nothing. Marie says this is part of her idea of ""paying it forward"", but what she really wants is to teach people how to do it themselves. She says: ""I want people to be self-sufficient so that we don't have to break the law on their behalf. ""Or I want the government in the UK to pull their fingers out and actually implement a system quickly. There isn't time for people to be waiting with dying children. ""I want them (the government) to implement a system quickly whereby people have access to quality medication, that they know what's in it and dosing programmes."" Marie says there has been an increase in people asking for THC meds since the UK government changed the rules on prescriptions last year. She says people think that if the government is saying legal medical cannabis is OK, then it can't be as bad as they used to say it was. However, Marie also says that she wants to stop running her cannabis oil operation. ""I don't want the stress, I don't want the responsibility, I don't want people calling me at two o'clock in the morning because they've run out of oil,"" she said. ""It's just way too much responsibility. I won't have people crying at me because their child's had 40 seizures."" Marie says she has dozens of customers in the UK. Does she worry she is selling to desperate people, often with very sick children? She admits that she has ""no control"" over what happens to the product once she sends it to people. ""We do the best that we can to provide a quality product,"" she says. The oils are sent diluted, she says, with recommendations to be very careful with dosing protocols. ""But we try not to take too much part of what goes on from there because I don't want that responsibility,"" she says. ""My bit is to help them, but I would rather parents produce their own plants and made their own oil under guidance rather than me having to be part of that process.""

EuroMillions winner to claim ÃÂ£123m prize,"A single ticketholder in the UK has won a staggering Â£123m EuroMillions jackpot in Tuesday night's draw. Camelot has confirmed the winner will collect the third biggest EuroMillions jackpot in the UK since the draw launched in 2004. The main numbers picked were 25, 27, 39, 42 and 46, with 11 and 12 being picked for the Lucky star numbers. The ticketholder is yet to be named and it is unknown if it is a single person, a family or a syndicate. What do lottery winners spend their money on? If the winner is an individual, their new found fortune would also catapult them into the Sunday Times' Rich List of the 1,000 wealthiest people living in the UK or with British business links. With at least Â£123m now in the bank, their riches can now be compared to Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James (Â£127m), Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page (Â£125m) and Earl Spencer, brother of the late Diana, Princess of Wales (Â£125m). Colin and Chris Weir won Â£161m in 2011 but the latest ticketholder is yet to be named Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in North Ayrshire, Scotland, won Â£161m in 2011, making them the current record holders for the biggest ever lottery win in the UK. The couple, whoannounced they were divorcing in April, made a Â£1m donation to the Scottish National Party following their lottery win. In 2012, Adrian and Gillian Bayford, from Suffolk, took home more than Â£148m. Mr Bayford invested some of his winnings in buying and running a record shop. The couple separated a year later. Although EuroMillions is played in nine European countries, four of the biggest jackpots in 2019 have been claimed in the UK. Prior to this week's draw, the biggest prize in 2019 was in a special draw on New Year's Day. Patrick and Frances Connolly from Northern Ireland won the Â£114.9m prize.

Trump accidentally reveals Mexico migrant plan,"President Trump brandished a sheet of paper that had details of the deal written on it US President Donald Trump has inadvertently revealed some details of his immigration deal with Mexico.

What is a climate emergency?,"Thousands of students are expected to take part in climate change protests on Friday A national climate emergencyhas been declared by the UK Parliament. MPs are calling on the government to make changes that include setting a new target of reaching net zero emissions before 2050. The current target is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. In Scotland, a climate change emergency hadalready been declared- and targets are being set to reduce greenhouse gas emissionsto net-zero by 2045. Dozens of local areas around the UK have also said there is a climate emergency - but what does the term mean? There's no single definition, but many areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. The United Nations says we could havejust 11 years leftto limit a climate change catastrophe. Bristol councillor Carla Denyer first put forward the idea of a local area declaring a climate emergency and in Novemberthe city council passed the motion. ""We are acknowledging we are in an emergency situation,"" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat - speaking before the UK and Scottish governments made their pledges. Councillor Carla Denyer was the first person to put forward the idea of declaring ""a climate emergency"" She says it's not just about reducing carbon emissions on a local scale, but also raising awareness about climate change and trying to convince MPs so that changes can be made. ""The national government needs to declare an emergency and put resources in place to enable councils to help reduce carbon emissions. ""It's the first step to radical action.""

In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had already declared a climate emergency at the SNP conference in April. She said she was inspired after meeting young climate campaigners who had gone on strike from school Scotland to set 'faster' climate change target Dozens of local areas have copied Carla's motion and declared climate emergencies including Manchester, London, Edinburgh and Bath. Smaller parish and town councils have also asserted their own declarations to put pressure on government. The small market town of Machynlleth in west Walesdeclared a climate emergency in January. The town is looking at things like improving the energy efficiency of buildings and creating an electric car club to help it become carbon-zero by 2030. This video can not be played Bath council declares a climate emergency Thousands of students from across the UK and around the world have walked out of lessons to protest about climate change. One oftheir key demands, according to the UK Student Climate Network, is that they want the government to declare a climate emergency. They also want the national curriculum reformed to include ""the ecological crisis as an educational priority"". This video can not be played Environmental activist Greta Thunberg says climate change is ""an existential crisis"" And Extinction Rebellion -the group who held recent protests in UK citiesincluding London, Manchester and Newcastle - also wants a new legally binding target set for the UK to reduce its carbon emissions to net zero by 2025. Extinction Rebellion: What do they want and is it realistic? Is Greta Thunberg right about UK carbon emissions? Sam Appleton, 21, has put his degree on hold at Oxford University to become a climate change activist. He's told Newsbeat he thinks the most effective thing to make governments change their policies is activism. Activist Sam Appleton says climate change is the only thing MPs should be talking about ""I've come to the conclusion that this has to work this year if we are to avoid any future crises - we've only got 12 years. ""In my eyes, climate change should be treated like there's a war going on and it should be the only thing people and MPs are talking about, not Brexit."" He says although small lifestyle changes like swapping car journeys for cycling are important - changes in policy are more important. How to be more eco-friendly in everyday life What does the government say? In the Spring Statement,the Chancellor announced gas heating for new houses will be banned by 2025,as part of plans to address the concerns of those protesting about climate change. While that move was welcomed by environmental campaigners, many said the government hadn't gone far enough. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050The UK will set a new legally binding target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Science & EnvironmentComments,"Greenhouse gas emissions in the UK will be cut to almost zero by 2050, under the terms of a new government plan to tackle climate change. Prime Minister Theresa May said there was a ""moral duty to leave this world in a better condition than what we inherited"". Cutting emissions would benefit public health and cut NHS costs, she said. Britain is the first major nation to propose this target - and it has been widely praised by green groups. But some say the phase-out is too late to protect the climate, and others fear that the task is impossible. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts? Will the government pay you to go green? What is climate change? Is Greta Thunberg right about UK carbon emissions? This video can not be played Theresa May: ""You can lower emissions... and have economic growth at the same time"" The UK already has a 2050 target - to reduce emissions by 80%. That was agreed by MPs under the Climate Change Act in 2008, but will now be amended to the new, much tougher, goal. The actual terminology used by the government is ""net zero"" greenhouse gases by 2050. That means emissions from homes, transport, farming and industry will have to be avoided completely or - in the most difficult examples - offset by planting trees or sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere. The government's advisory Committee on Climate Changerecommended the ""net zero"" target in May. Its report said if other countries followed the UK, there was a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended 1.5C temperature rise by 2100. A 1.5C rise is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change. Young people have been very vocal in demanding change - now a group will take part in a government review Laurence Tubiana, an architect ofthe crucial Paris climate agreement,told the BBC: ""This is a historic commitment that will reverberate right around the world. ""All eyes will now turn on the rest of the EU to match this pledge."" Theresa May said the UK led the world to wealth through fossil fuels in the industrial revolution, so it was appropriate for Britain to lead in the opposite direction. ""We have made huge progress in growing our economy and the jobs market while slashing emissions,"" she said. ""Now is the time to go further and faster to safeguard the environment for our children. We must lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth."" Number 10 said it was ""imperative"" other countries followed suit, so there would be a review within five years to ensure other nations were taking similarly ambitious action and British industries were not facing unfair competition. Scotland has already committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions tonet-zero by 2045, five years ahead of the UK government's target. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommended Wales should aim to cut emissions by a lower target of 95% by 2050 due to the importance of the farming industry to rural communities. But theWelsh government has since said it wants to go further - and will commit to net-zero by 2050, like the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland is the only devolved administration which does not have its own climate change legislation and emissions targets. If ministers decided to clamp down on meat-eating or on flying, that would meet serious opposition. But the government will attempt to make the clean revolution as painless as possible. Technology improvements like LED light bulbs, for instance, save emissions without people noticing. Greenpeace fears offsetting emissions by planting trees outside the UK will not work The same is true if people get hydrogen central heating instead of gas, or if they are obliged to drive electric cars rather than petrol vehicles. But there will need to be a massive investment in clean energy generation - and that has to be funded by someone. The government hasn't yet spelled out if the cost will fall on bill-payers, or tax-payers, or the fossil fuel firms that have caused climate change. And then there's the international dimension. Prof Dieter Helm, from the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University, said: ""From the UK's end, doing this unilaterally, we have to be very careful that we don't simply say: 'we're going to reduce the emissions from our cars and our power stations here in Britain, but we're going to carry on importing those emissions from overseas.' ""We don't make very much in this country. Manufacturing is only 20% of the economy. Most of the stuff that you go and buy in the supermarket... it's all imported."" What's your diet's carbon footprint? What is a climate emergency? How can I help? Chancellor Philip Hammond haswarned of a potential cost of Â£1 trillion by 2050. The cash will have to come from somewhere, he said - maybe from schools, hospitals and the police. However, Chris Skidmore, the acting energy minister, said the costs would amount to between 1 and 2% of the UK's GDP - which was the same amount factored in to reach the previous 80% reduction target. Therefore it would not be the case that there would be less money to spend elsewhere, he said. He added that the green economy would generate jobs and the cost of green technologies was coming down all the time. The climate change contrarian Bjorn Lomborg, author of Skeptical Environmentalist, said: ""Mr Hammond is right to highlight the cost - and in fact, he is likely to be underestimating the real price tag."" Campaigners said Mr Hammond's sums did not take into account the benefits of cleaner air and a more stable climate. Following the Committee on Climate Change's recommendations last month, scientists, campaigners and health professionals have been urging Mrs May to bring in a net zero target before she stands down. The government will lay a ""statutory instrument"" in the Commons on Wednesday - a tactic that allows it to be fast-tracked through both houses of Parliament if other parties agree - which on this issue they generally do. Like any government decision it could be overturned by future governments. But the majority of Tory leadership candidates are backing it - and revoking the Act would need a majority Commons vote at a time when the public appear very concerned about the climate. This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally Mrs May has taken the unusual step of announcing that a group of young people will advise the government on priorities for environmental action. They will start their review in July. This is seen as a nod towards young voters, many of whom have recently taken to the streets protesting that their environment was being destroyed. The magnitude of the task is clear. The UK is already slipping away from its mid-term carbon targets of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. ""Achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions is necessary, feasible and cost-effective,"" said professor Phil Taylor, head of engineering at Newcastle University. ""But UK policy is still way off the mark and the foundations are not in place to be able to meet this target. ""Even with all the evidence before us we are still opening new coal mines, extending Heathrow airport and pushing forward with fracking. ""We have unambitious building regulations, and our drive to phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2040 is too late."" Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Royal Institution, warned that the public might not support carbon-cutting measures such as turning down thermostats in the home. And he questioned the ability of the government to insulate enough houses in time. ""The prize for improving the efficiency of buildings is significant,"" he said. ""However, there is a practical challenge in terms of the number of sufficient skilled workers to undertake the work, and then of course the barrier of getting homeowners to get the work done."" There will be major difficulties, too, in supplying low-carbon heating to homes and industries as natural gas is phased out. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, said it was a ""big moment"" for the climate but there were questions around plans to allow for international carbon credits which allow the UK to pay to offset its emissions elsewhere in the world. Such off-setting had a history of failure, was not cost-efficient and shifting the burden to developing nations undermined the commitment, he told the Guardian. Chris Skidmore, the acting energy minister, said the government did not ""intend"" to use international carbon credits but had kept it ""as an option"". ""We need to be able to decarbonise in the best possible way so we don't want to rule it out,"" he said. Mrs May's announcement indicates that she has taken notice of potential industrial pitfalls. To assuage Treasury fears about competitiveness, she has stipulated that the net zero policy should be reviewed in five years to see whether other nations were taking similar actions. That might prove problematic if US President Donald Trump -who denigrates climate change- is still in the White House. Meanwhile, the radical green group Extinction Rebellion is warning that the climate is changing so fast that 2050 is far too late to eliminate emissions in order to ensure that temperature rise stays well under 2C. 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

Topshop empire survival vote 'on a knife edge',"Landlords and other creditors will meet on Wednesday in London to vote on revised proposals to save Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire. Arcadia's brands include Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Wallis. Last week, a vote on Sir Philip's proposals was postponed after some landlords, including shopping centre owner Intu, refused to back it. It is understood thatIntu is planning to vote againstthe rescue plans. Sir Philip has warned that Arcadia could fall into administration if the new proposals are not approved. In May, Arcadia announced that it was in serious trouble, facing ""significant liquidity issues"". It is struggling to pay fixed charges of Â£100m a year, with earnings in 2019 expected to be only Â£30m, down from Â£219m two years ago. In order to save the business, Sir Philip has proposed implementing a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which is a renegotiation of terms with a company's creditors as part of an insolvency procedure. However, creditors must approve not one, but seven different CVAs, in order for the business to survive, as Arcadia's companies are interlinked. Sir Philip Green revised his rescue plans after landlords refused to back his initial deal The first proposals involved the closure of 48 stores, the loss of around 1,000 jobs and a rent reduction of between 30% to 70% on 194 stores. Sir Philip would invest Â£50m into the business. He also pledged to increase net pension contributions over three years, and to give landlords a 20% stake in Arcadia, but only if it is sold. On 5 June, the vote was postponed after some landlords refused to back the deal. On 7 June, Sir Philip announced revised plans in a last-ditch attempt to bring landlords of his stores back on board. He is now asking landlords to agree to rent cuts of between 25% and 50% instead, as well as improved terms on break clauses for leases. The shortfall in rent will be plugged by Â£9.5m provided by the Green family. However, that commitment could rise to up to Â£29m during the three-year period of the deal. Arcadia said it already had support from ""pensions trustees, trade creditors and a significant number of landlords"". The pensions regulator has also announced that it intends to back the deal, saying that it is the ""best outcome"" that can be achieved in ""challenging circumstances"". Shopping centre owner Intu, which also owns the Trafford Centre and Manchester Arndale, is Arcadia's biggest landlord with 35 of the retailer's outlets in its properties. Intu has refused to back the deal, and in order for the CVAs to be passed, at least 75% of all creditors must vote in favour of them. The shopping centre operator will have the biggest single voice at Wednesday's meeting, with an average 15% share of the vote across various different CVA proposals. It is understood the company believes if it were to agree to the lower rent cuts, it would still not be fair to its other tenants which pay the full rent. What do suppliers think?Oliver Buhus, operations director at Paragon Clothing, a supplier to Arcadia, said he had voted in favour of the CVAs and hoped that they would be approved.Â ""I can't imagine why a supplier would go against the CVA"" he told the Today programme. Landlord opinions may differ, he conceded. Arcadia is a ""significant part of our business"" which his company has worked with for more than a decade,"" he said. If it went into administration ""we would have to rethink our strategy as a business for sure,"" he said. Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, thinks it is difficult to tell if the deal will go through. ""It's quite strange that he's only talking about closing 20-odd stores as well. You would expect, if it's so close to going into administration, they'd want to close more than 23 stores,"" she says. Retail analyst Chris Field is more certain: ""I think they'll reject Philip Green's current rescue deal and there will be more discussions. ""But at some point, the landlords and shareholders are going to have to accept some kind of a deal."" The UK retail environment is still a difficult one, says Mr Field, and there will be some casualties as the High Street reinvents itself. Topshop has seen its profits dive over the last two years Ed Cooke, chief executive of retail property body Revo, says the vote is ""clearly on a knife edge"", and the outcome is by no means certain. However, he is not convinced that Arcadia will immediately go into administration should creditors vote against the rescue plans. Sir Philip said the business would go into administration if the vote earlier this month didn't go well. But it didn't, says Mr Cooke, and ""24 hours later there were other options, there were cash injections and a new rescue deal"". Mr Field agrees, and he thinks Sir Philip still has some tricks up his sleeve. ""Things never are as dire as the business owners like to say,"" he says. ""This is a man who won Retailer of the Year a few years ago. He's no fool, and ultimately money comes first.""

Conservative MPs have chosen the final two candidates in the race to become the next leader of their party - and, therefore, the next UK prime minister.

Dominic Raab says leadership candidates should be able to ""hold their nerve"" in a TV debate. The former Brexit secretary made it through the first round of the Tory leadership contest in fourth place with 27 votes and said he had a ""strong base to build on"". But he said the candidates needed to have a ""proper debate on the vision for the country"". He told the BBC: ""There are a lot of candidates with a lot to offer but we are
right at the beginning of this race. ""We havenât really tested the visions, the
ideas, the policies of all of the candidates, and I think the debates coming upâ¦
are a great opportunity to test the views. ""There is many a slip between a cup and the lip."" Mr Raab said the last leadership contest, that saw Theresa May take power, was a ""very quick coronation"", but ""once the adrenaline of the first froth and frenzy of this contest ebbs a little bit [you can] have a proper contest on the substance and the vision"". And what would he say to anyone considering not taking part in the TV debates? ""If you can't hold your nerve and take the heat of a
leadership contest, what chance [do you have] under the glare of the light in Brussels?"" Press Association photographer tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Theresa May and Jo Brand In other news, Prime Minister Theresa May has weighed into a row about Jo Brand. The comedian made a joke on BBC Radio 4 about the recent spate of milkshakes being thrown at politicians. ""Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?"" she asked, adding: ""I'm not going to do it. It's purely a fantasy."" Ms Brand was accused by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who hashad milkshakes thrown at himby protesters, of ""inciting violence"". Mrs May said the BBC should explain why the joke was deemed ""appropriate content"" for broadcast. Read more here. When it comes to Brexit, one key phrase that people keep using is ""kicking the can down the road"". But where does it come from? It started with a yard game played by children in the US called ""kicking the can"". A player was tagged ""it"" and had to guard an old can while seeking out others hiding. If the other players could kick the can before being caught, they freed everyone. The game seemed to disappear by the 1960s, but the 1980s ""kicking the can down the road"" became common parlance - signifying postponement - in the US Congress.

Michael Gove has posted a video on Twitter, celebrating getting through the first round of the Tory leadership contest. The environment secretary came third with 37 votes, behind Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. But now he is looking forward to a ""proper"" debate ""about ideas"", he said. âI believe I have policies that can transform this country for
the better,"" Mr Gove added. ""Iâve got the experience of delivery that can make sure that we have a brighter future, and
Iâve got the range of support to enable all of us in this country to come together. âIâm ready to unite, ready to deliver, ready to lead.â BBC Radio 5 Live Former Conservative Party
chairwoman Baroness Warsi tells BBC Radio 5 Live that the prime minister âshould
have insistedâ Home Secretary Sajid Javid be given a seat at the state banquet
held in honour of US President Donald Trump. She says the fact
Mr Javid was not at Buckingham Palace showed âa lack of leadershipâ in No 10. Leadership hopeful Mr Javid has called his
exclusion from the banquet ""odd"". A Downing Street
spokesman said neither Mr Javidâs ethnicity nor Mr Trump had anything to
do with the home secretary not being invited. Instead he cited the huge demand for seats, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that âpriority was given to trade and defence secretaries, given the themes of the state visitâ. But Baroness Warsi says: âI suspect there has been a lack of leadership
from No 10, where they have not been clear enough to say that, in Britain, our values are that we believe in equality and meritocracy and that we will not
make our decisions based upon your values. ""What we needed to do as a country was clearly show that our values were different and that weâre prepared to
assert those values, even if those values were being questioned and pushed by
the US.â BBC News Channel Ken Clarke, who backed seventh-placed Rory Stewart, says most of the candidates apart from Boris Johnson will feel disappointed, but he is ""very pleased"" with the result today. He says his candidate was ""very little known"" to the public before the contest but has ""fought the best campaign so far"". He says Mr Johnson is a ""Marmite politician"" and ""not a shoo-in"" to win, with ""quite a lot"" of Conservative MPs ""extremely fearful"" about the idea of him becoming PM. Â© 2025 BBC.

EuroMillions winner to claim ÃÂ£123m prizeThe ticketholder will become the third biggest EuroMillions jackpot winner in the UK.UK,"A single ticketholder in the UK has won a staggering Â£123m EuroMillions jackpot in Tuesday night's draw. Camelot has confirmed the winner will collect the third biggest EuroMillions jackpot in the UK since the draw launched in 2004. The main numbers picked were 25, 27, 39, 42 and 46, with 11 and 12 being picked for the Lucky star numbers. The ticketholder is yet to be named and it is unknown if it is a single person, a family or a syndicate. What do lottery winners spend their money on? If the winner is an individual, their new found fortune would also catapult them into the Sunday Times' Rich List of the 1,000 wealthiest people living in the UK or with British business links. With at least Â£123m now in the bank, their riches can now be compared to Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James (Â£127m), Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page (Â£125m) and Earl Spencer, brother of the late Diana, Princess of Wales (Â£125m). Colin and Chris Weir won Â£161m in 2011 but the latest ticketholder is yet to be named Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in North Ayrshire, Scotland, won Â£161m in 2011, making them the current record holders for the biggest ever lottery win in the UK. The couple, whoannounced they were divorcing in April, made a Â£1m donation to the Scottish National Party following their lottery win. In 2012, Adrian and Gillian Bayford, from Suffolk, took home more than Â£148m. Mr Bayford invested some of his winnings in buying and running a record shop. The couple separated a year later. Although EuroMillions is played in nine European countries, four of the biggest jackpots in 2019 have been claimed in the UK. Prior to this week's draw, the biggest prize in 2019 was in a special draw on New Year's Day. Patrick and Frances Connolly from Northern Ireland won the Â£114.9m prize. Ade Goodchild, from Hereford, banked Â£71m in March and an anonymous ticket-holder bagged Â£35.2m in April. What do lottery winners spend their money on?

Welsh NHS bill concerns over PE plan,"The curriculum will be rolled out from September 2022 for children currently in Year 3 and below The Welsh NHS bill will ""go through the roof"" without regular PE in schools, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson has said. Due to be introduced in 2022, thedraft curriculumdoes not specify a set amount of physical activity every week. The former Paralympic gold medallist, who sits in the House of Lords, said: ""If time is not carved out to do it, it will just disappear."" The Welsh Government said the curriculum ""takes into consideration the importance of physical activity"". The curriculum leaves it open for individual schools to decide on PE lessons. Baroness Grey-Thompson said she was concerned they would disappear off the curriculum in some schools, causing problems for the NHS in 15 to 20 years' time due to people being unfit. ""Because PE is difficult to teach, it's one of those things that I really worry will slip away because there are other things that are easier to do,"" she toldBBC Wales Live. ""If sport is not explicitly mentioned, it will just drop off. Whatever the meaning and the intention, it won't have the same priority. ""We won't see the problem right now, we'll see it 15 or 20 years down the line when the NHS bill goes through the roof because we have a generation of young adults who are just not fit enough to be healthy."" Draft school curriculum for Wales Q&A More school inspections from 2021 Plan to end kids being pulled from sex ed Baroness Grey-Thompson's concern is echoed by a group of AMs, who recommended schools be required by law to provide at least two hours of PE every week. The Health, Social Care and Sport Committee said the change was vital to tackle a public health crisis, with more than a quarter of four and five-year-olds starting school in Wales last year classed as obese or overweight. But supporters of the new curriculum said it would lead to children being more active and healthy as, for the first time, the wellbeing of pupils would be placed at the heart of school life. The wellbeing of pupils is placed at the heart of school life in the new curriculum In 2013, Baroness Grey-Thompson chaired a group which examined PE in Welsh schools. Its main recommendation - that PE be made a core subject with the same status as maths, English, Welsh and science - was not implemented. Education expert Prof Graham Donaldson was then commissioned by the Welsh Government to draw up a new curriculum. The first draft was published last month after consultations with schools and is made up of six areas of learning and experience - including wellbeing, which incorporates physical activity alongside topics like sexuality, relationships and healthy eating. Gethin Mon Thomas from GwE, the school improvement service for north Wales, said the new curriculum would deliver better outcomes than the plan proposed by Baroness Grey-Thompson. ""We have an area of learning and experience which occupies an increased amount of time on the school timetable,"" he said. Baroness Grey-Thompson has previously called for investment in leisure centres to improve health ""The curriculum oozes opportunities for sport to be used as a vehicle to support learning. ""We will actually put sport and physical activity in a position where it is truly valued in society, rather than just being something that small groups of individuals benefit from."" Sport Wales, the organisation responsible for promoting sport and physical activity in Wales, supports the new curriculum but its chief executive Sarah Powell said its success would stand or fall on the training teachers receive. ""The essential thing is to build up the confidence, motivation and skills of teachers to be able to deliver a high quality curriculum. But if we don't see that, then this is a curriculum that doesn't actually deliver the changes that we need to see."" The Welsh Government said the curriculum supported children's development, ensuring that they grow up to be healthy and confident individuals. There will be more on this story on Wales Live, BBC One Wales, at 22:30 BST on 12 June 'Milestone' as curriculum is published Draft school curriculum for Wales Q&A Warning 'education will be left to chance' School funding 'down Â£500 per pupil' Welsh Government Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

The woman who makes cannabis oil,"Marie, speaking to BBC journalist Samantha Poling, says she needs to remain anonymous because what she is doing is illegal Marie is a British mother-of-four who helps run an illegal cannabis oil laboratory in the mountains of Spain. What she is doing is against the law in both Spain and Britain, but Marie claims she is helping people with a range of conditions gain access to a medicinal drug they are currently unable to get on prescription. Marie (not her real name) agreed to show me her entire operation on condition I kept her identity a secret. I asked her why she had to be anonymous. ""Because it's illegal,"" she said. ""Because I don't want to be stopped from what I'm doing, because if I am then a lot of people are going to be left in the lurch."" The ""people"" she is referring to are generally sick - they are adults with fibromyalgia or diabetes, and children with epilepsy. I flew to Spain to meet Marie after a tip-off from a family I met in Scotland. The THC compound is extracted from the cannabis bud I was investigating medical cannabis and filming with families of children with drug-resistant epilepsy who were keen to try the medicine. One family I met had been dosing their child with a strain which contained THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive part of the plant. There is some evidence that cannabis medicines containing THC can help with epilepsy and reduce seizures. But there is also evidence it can cause seizures. Legally, doctors can now prescribe cannabis oil products in the UK but they are refusing to, saying it needs to be trialled properly to show that it is safe and that it works. Marie and the location of her cannabis oil operation need to remain anonymous In response, some people have been going to countries such as the Netherlands to get medical cannabis on prescription while others have turned to the black market. Experts warn this is a bad idea because their products are not pharmaceutical grade. They say there can be a ""very real danger"" because users do not know exactly what is in the dealer's products. The family I met in Scotland felt they had a black market dealer who actually wanted to help people - that was Marie. CCTV cameras are in operation to protect the site Marie told me she makes the oils because she had used cannabis herself for a medical condition and was sick of buying from street dealers. ""It was awful,"" she says. ""But it was out of necessity, not because I'm a hardened criminal. I kept getting ripped off by them and so I decided to grow it myself."" Her illicit activities soon brought the attention of the police in Britain. By then, she had met a man and fallen in love. It took her to Spain. She says: ""I made a pact there and then that I would help other people so that they wouldn't be ripped off as I had been. And that's how it all started."" The cannabis is grown in a small white-washed building up a narrow lane I met Marie in a bar west of Alicante, then she drove me into the mountains along dusty tracks lined with almond trees. The first stop is where they grow the plants. A small white-washed building up a narrow lane. There are bars on the windows and doors and CCTV cameras. Other criminals sometimes come and steal the product, she tells me. The door does not open far before we are hit with the sweet, pungent and unmistakeable aroma of cannabis. We go from room to room. The plants are in various stages of growth. Once the perfect size and age, the buds will be picked and dried and transported to the lab, which is where she takes me next. The laboratory where Marie makes the cannabis oils We head north, back through the fields of almonds and towards the hills. Then we lurch along the final stretch of a pot-holed dusty track and stop outside a small crop of outbuildings in the middle of nowhere. There is the obligatory metal fencing, the big barking guard dog and cameras - but once we are through the gates, everything changes. There, sitting incongruously in the arid Spanish plains, is a laboratory. Once inside, the air conditioning does much to dampen the heat, but the pungent aroma of cannabis remains. Marie tells me she is going to make up some oil, so I can see how easy the process is. I'm not going to detail it here, but she is right -  the process does look pretty simple. The larger syringes sell for hundreds of euros The larger syringes containing the oil can sell for several hundred euros but Marie tells me that if families really need it and do not have the money, she will give it to them for much less, sometimes for nothing. Marie says this is part of her idea of ""paying it forward"", but what she really wants is to teach people how to do it themselves. She says: ""I want people to be self-sufficient so that we don't have to break the law on their behalf. ""Or I want the government in the UK to pull their fingers out and actually implement a system quickly. There isn't time for people to be waiting with dying children. ""I want them (the government) to implement a system quickly whereby people have access to quality medication, that they know what's in it and dosing programmes."" Marie says there has been an increase in people asking for THC meds since the UK government changed the rules on prescriptions last year. She says people think that if the government is saying legal medical cannabis is OK, then it can't be as bad as they used to say it was. However, Marie also says that she wants to stop running her cannabis oil operation. ""I don't want the stress, I don't want the responsibility, I don't want people calling me at two o'clock in the morning because they've run out of oil,"" she said. ""It's just way too much responsibility. I won't have people crying at me because their child's had 40 seizures."" Marie says she has dozens of customers in the UK. Does she worry she is selling to desperate people, often with very sick children? She admits that she has ""no control"" over what happens to the product once she sends it to people. ""We do the best that we can to provide a quality product,"" she says. The oils are sent diluted, she says, with recommendations to be very careful with dosing protocols. ""But we try not to take too much part of what goes on from there because I don't want that responsibility,"" she says. ""My bit is to help them, but I would rather parents produce their own plants and made their own oil under guidance rather than me having to be part of that process.""

Government tells Whirlpool to recall dryersThe company will have to recall hundreds of thousands of appliances amid concerns over fire safety.,"The government is to issue an ""unprecedented"" recall notice of up to 500,000 Whirlpool tumble dryers which pose a fire safety risk. It comes four years after Whirlpool issued a warning after it found its Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit dryers had a fault which needed fixing. The fault was blamed for at least 750 fires over an 11-year period, according to the government. Whirlpool said safety was its ""number one priority"". It urged anyone still owning an affected dryer to contact the company immediately on0800 151 0905. A spokeswoman added: ""In the meantime, anyone with an affected dryer that has not been modified should unplug it and not use it until the modification has been completed."" An estimated 5.3 million dryers were sold in the UK, but it is thought up to 500,000 could still be in use. Last year, the BBC's Watchdog Live consumer programme uncovered cases in which machines had caught fire even after being fixed. Whirlpool 'must step up fire-risk warnings' Safety flaws 'exposed by danger dryers' Fresh fears over danger tumble dryers And in April, the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) published a report, urging Whirlpool to improve its risk management, and""reach affected consumers in more creative ways""to minimise the risk of faulty machines still being in people's homes. Business minister Kelly Tolhurst told the Commons that the recall notice was ""unprecedented action"". She was responding to Conservative minister Andrew Griffiths, who told MPs that he was still concerned about whether people still had ""unsafe products"" in their homes. Mark Studley said the dryer caught fire in a room in which his children, then aged two and four, regularly used to play Mark Studley, 40, said his family came home one day in July last year to find their house ""full of smoke"" after their Whirlpool tumble dryer caught fire. He said the dryer - which was stored near his children's play room - ""could have killed"" them if it had caught ablaze overnight. Mr Studley, from Bridgwater in Somerset, told the BBC: ""The fire report states that it's an internal wiring fault in the machine, and all of this was caused - approximately Â£8,000 worth of damage - when the machine was turned off. ""If this had happened 12 hours earlier or later than it did, myself and my family risked death as it would've been in the early hours and we would've been asleep."" Rachel Reeves, Labour chairwoman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said the move was ""long overdue"". ""Finally, over a year since we called for a recall of defective machines and 18 months since the Beis Committee reported on Whirlpool's inadequate response to safety flaws, the government is at last showing some teeth,"" she said. This video can not be played Are tumble dryers still a fire risk? David Chaplin, a spokesman for consumer group Which? said there were still ""serious questions"" about the 500,000 unmodified machines that ""Whirlpool has already struggled to locate"". He said: ""People's lives have been put at risk for far too long, so it's a hugely significant step that these machines are set to be recalled. ""The government must urgently explain what it is going to do about the millions of modified machines still in people's homes, following serious concerns that have been raised by people who have experienced fires, smoke and burning despite the so-called fix."" A Whirlpool Corporation spokeswoman said: ""We remain committed to resolving any affected tumble dryers that have not yet been modified. ""To this end, we are in ongoing discussions with the Office for Product Safety and Standards to agree additional measures we have proposed to reach consumers who have not yet engaged with this safety programme. ""We have co-operated with OPSS throughout its recent review of the programme and welcome its findings that consumers whose tumble dryers have been modified can continue to use them safely.""

UK to commit to 2050 climate target,"Greenhouse gas emissions in the UK will be cut to almost zero by 2050, under the terms of a new government plan to tackle climate change. Prime Minister Theresa May said there was a ""moral duty to leave this world in a better condition than what we inherited"". Cutting emissions would benefit public health and cut NHS costs, she said. Britain is the first major nation to propose this target - and it has been widely praised by green groups. But some say the phase-out is too late to protect the climate, and others fear that the task is impossible. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts? Will the government pay you to go green? What is climate change? Is Greta Thunberg right about UK carbon emissions? This video can not be played Theresa May: ""You can lower emissions... and have economic growth at the same time"" The UK already has a 2050 target - to reduce emissions by 80%. That was agreed by MPs under the Climate Change Act in 2008, but will now be amended to the new, much tougher, goal. The actual terminology used by the government is ""net zero"" greenhouse gases by 2050. That means emissions from homes, transport, farming and industry will have to be avoided completely or - in the most difficult examples - offset by planting trees or sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere. The government's advisory Committee on Climate Changerecommended the ""net zero"" target in May. Its report said if other countries followed the UK, there was a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended 1.5C temperature rise by 2100. A 1.5C rise is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change. Young people have been very vocal in demanding change - now a group will take part in a government review Laurence Tubiana, an architect ofthe crucial Paris climate agreement,told the BBC: ""This is a historic commitment that will reverberate right around the world. ""All eyes will now turn on the rest of the EU to match this pledge."" Theresa May said the UK led the world to wealth through fossil fuels in the industrial revolution, so it was appropriate for Britain to lead in the opposite direction. ""We have made huge progress in growing our economy and the jobs market while slashing emissions,"" she said. ""Now is the time to go further and faster to safeguard the environment for our children. We must lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth."" Number 10 said it was ""imperative"" other countries followed suit, so there would be a review within five years to ensure other nations were taking similarly ambitious action and British industries were not facing unfair competition. Scotland has already committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions tonet-zero by 2045, five years ahead of the UK government's target. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommended Wales should aim to cut emissions by a lower target of 95% by 2050 due to the importance of the farming industry to rural communities. But theWelsh government has since said it wants to go further - and will commit to net-zero by 2050, like the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland is the only devolved administration which does not have its own climate change legislation and emissions targets. If ministers decided to clamp down on meat-eating or on flying, that would meet serious opposition. But the government will attempt to make the clean revolution as painless as possible. Technology improvements like LED light bulbs, for instance, save emissions without people noticing. Greenpeace fears offsetting emissions by planting trees outside the UK will not work The same is true if people get hydrogen central heating instead of gas, or if they are obliged to drive electric cars rather than petrol vehicles. But there will need to be a massive investment in clean energy generation - and that has to be funded by someone. The government hasn't yet spelled out if the cost will fall on bill-payers, or tax-payers, or the fossil fuel firms that have caused climate change. And then there's the international dimension. Prof Dieter Helm, from the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University, said: ""From the UK's end, doing this unilaterally, we have to be very careful that we don't simply say: 'we're going to reduce the emissions from our cars and our power stations here in Britain, but we're going to carry on importing those emissions from overseas.' ""We don't make very much in this country. Manufacturing is only 20% of the economy. Most of the stuff that you go and buy in the supermarket... it's all imported."" What's your diet's carbon footprint? What is a climate emergency? How can I help? Chancellor Philip Hammond haswarned of a potential cost of Â£1 trillion by 2050. The cash will have to come from somewhere, he said - maybe from schools, hospitals and the police. However, Chris Skidmore, the acting energy minister, said the costs would amount to between 1 and 2% of the UK's GDP - which was the same amount factored in to reach the previous 80% reduction target. Therefore it would not be the case that there would be less money to spend elsewhere, he said. He added that the green economy would generate jobs and the cost of green technologies was coming down all the time. The climate change contrarian Bjorn Lomborg, author of Skeptical Environmentalist, said: ""Mr Hammond is right to highlight the cost - and in fact, he is likely to be underestimating the real price tag."" Campaigners said Mr Hammond's sums did not take into account the benefits of cleaner air and a more stable climate. Following the Committee on Climate Change's recommendations last month, scientists, campaigners and health professionals have been urging Mrs May to bring in a net zero target before she stands down. The government will lay a ""statutory instrument"" in the Commons on Wednesday - a tactic that allows it to be fast-tracked through both houses of Parliament if other parties agree - which on this issue they generally do. Like any government decision it could be overturned by future governments. But the majority of Tory leadership candidates are backing it - and revoking the Act would need a majority Commons vote at a time when the public appear very concerned about the climate. This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally Mrs May has taken the unusual step of announcing that a group of young people will advise the government on priorities for environmental action. They will start their review in July. This is seen as a nod towards young voters, many of whom have recently taken to the streets protesting that their environment was being destroyed. The magnitude of the task is clear. The UK is already slipping away from its mid-term carbon targets of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. ""Achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions is necessary, feasible and cost-effective,"" said professor Phil Taylor, head of engineering at Newcastle University. ""But UK policy is still way off the mark and the foundations are not in place to be able to meet this target. ""Even with all the evidence before us we are still opening new coal mines, extending Heathrow airport and pushing forward with fracking. ""We have unambitious building regulations, and our drive to phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2040 is too late."" Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Royal Institution, warned that the public might not support carbon-cutting measures such as turning down thermostats in the home. And he questioned the ability of the government to insulate enough houses in time. ""The prize for improving the efficiency of buildings is significant,"" he said. ""However, there is a practical challenge in terms of the number of sufficient skilled workers to undertake the work, and then of course the barrier of getting homeowners to get the work done."" There will be major difficulties, too, in supplying low-carbon heating to homes and industries as natural gas is phased out. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, said it was a ""big moment"" for the climate but there were questions around plans to allow for international carbon credits which allow the UK to pay to offset its emissions elsewhere in the world. Such off-setting had a history of failure, was not cost-efficient and shifting the burden to developing nations undermined the commitment, he told the Guardian. Chris Skidmore, the acting energy minister, said the government did not ""intend"" to use international carbon credits but had kept it ""as an option"". ""We need to be able to decarbonise in the best possible way so we don't want to rule it out,"" he said. Mrs May's announcement indicates that she has taken notice of potential industrial pitfalls. To assuage Treasury fears about competitiveness, she has stipulated that the net zero policy should be reviewed in five years to see whether other nations were taking similar actions. That might prove problematic if US President Donald Trump -who denigrates climate change- is still in the White House. Meanwhile, the radical green group Extinction Rebellion is warning that the climate is changing so fast that 2050 is far too late to eliminate emissions in order to ensure that temperature rise stays well under 2C. 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.
