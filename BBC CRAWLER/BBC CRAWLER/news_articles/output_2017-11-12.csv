EU 'preparing for possible talks collapse',"Michel Barnier says ""everyone needs to plan"" for the possible collapse of Brexit negotiations The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he is planning for the possible collapse of Brexit negotiations with the UK. Mr Barnier was talking to French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche,externaldays after giving the UK a two-week deadline to clarify key issues. Failing to reach an agreement was not his preferred option, he stressed. The UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis has said it is time for both sides ""to work to find solutions"". On Friday, Mr Davis insisted good progress was being made across the board, and that the negotiations had narrowed to a ""few outstanding, albeit important, issues"". How are the talks really progressing? All you need to know about Brexit Barnier: The EU's point man on Brexit negotiations Discussing the likelihood of the talks collapsing, Mr Barnier said: ""It's not my option, but it's a possibility. Everyone needs to plan for it, member states and businesses alike. We too are preparing for it technically. ""A failure of the negotiations would have consequences on multiple domains."" Mr Barnier has asked the UK to clarify its stance on its financial obligations to the EUif future trade talks are to go ahead in December. But Mr Davis has made conflicting remarks, suggesting the UK would not have to give a figure for a financial settlement before it could move on to talks about a future trading relationship. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, he said: ""In every negotiation, each side tries to control the timetable. The real deadline on this is, of course, December."" Mr Davis was referring to the next EU summit which will take place in Brussels in December.

He added: ""We've been very, very careful, and it's taking time and we will take our time to get to the right answer."" His comments followed a sixth round of talks between Mr Davis and Mr Barnier in Brussels.

Breaking|,"Irish musician and activist Bob Geldof said he is ""shamed"" to share the honour with Suu Kyi Bob Geldof has said he will return his Freedom of the City of Dublin in protest against the Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who also holds the award. Mr Geldof said ""her association with our city shames us all"". Ms Suu Kyi has faced heavy criticism over her failure to address allegations of ethnic cleansing against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims. More than half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh following recent violence. Mr Geldof, the musician and founder of Band Aid, said in a statement: ""Her association with our city shames us all and we should have no truck with it, even by default. We honoured her, now she appals and shames us."" He is handing back the award at City Hall in the Irish capital on Monday morning. What you need to know about the crisis What sparked latest violence in Rakhine? Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? Aung San Suu Kyi has faced widespread criticism over her response to reported atrocities Ms Suu Kyi has been condemned by international leaders and human rights groups over her reluctance to acknowledge the military violence, which the UN has called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". There have also been calls for her to be stripped of the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991. Reacting to Mr Geldof's announcement, Lord Mayor Micheal Mac Donnacha of Dublin City Council said on Monday: ""I find it ironic that he makes this gesture while proudly retaining his title as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, given the shameful record of British imperialism across the globe."" Fellow Irish musicians U2 also criticised Ms Suu Kyi, the civilian leader of Myanmar, also known as Burma, urging her on Saturday to take a stronger stance against the reported violence by security forces. In a statement on the band's website, they said her failure to address the crisis was ""starting to look a lot like assent"". ""So we say to you now what we would have said to her: the violence and terror being visited on the Rohingya people are appalling atrocities and must stop."" This video can not be played Thousands of Rohingya refugees flee to Bangladesh Last month,Oxford City Council decided to strip Ms Suu Kyi of the freedom of the city,which she was awarded in 1997, in an ""unprecedented step"" for the local authority. The City of London is also toconsider a similar step. Earlier this month, she was alsostripped of the freedom of the cities of SheffieldandGlasgowbecause of her response to the Rohingya crisis. St Hugh's College at Oxford University, where Ms Suu Kyi read politics, has removed a portrait of her from display. This video can not be played Rohingya Muslims had to decide what to bring and what to leave. The violence in Rakhine erupted on 25 August when Rohingya militants attacked security posts in Myanmar's Rakhine state, triggering a military crackdown. Scores of people have been killed in the crackdown and there are widespread allegations of villages being burned and Rohingya being driven out. Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians. About 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since 25 August.

PM 'will return to Lebanon in days',"Hariri's resignation has sent shockwaves through Lebanon and the region Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri says he will return home ""in days"" to formally submit his resignation. Mr Hariri spoke to Future TV from Riyadh, his first public remarks since he announced he was stepping down last week. His cabinet allies say he is being held captive, but Mr Hariri denied this. He has blamed the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement for his resignation, citing concerns over his and his family's safety. The US and UK have warned other countries not to use Lebanon for proxy conflicts. Mr Hariri, a Sunni leader and businessman, was nominated to form Lebanon's government in November 2016. Iran and Saudi Arabia: Who's siding with whom Lebanon caught in crosshairs of Saudi-Iran tension Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles ""I have resigned. I am going to Lebanon very soon and I will resign in the constitutional manner,"" he said in the TV interview. Under Lebanese law the prime minister has to submit his resignation to the president, who must accept it for it to take effect. However, Mr Hariri also held out the prospect that he might reconsider resigning if Hezbollah stopped intervening in neighbouring countries. ""If we want to go back on the resignation, we have to return to the policy of distancing ourselves"" from regional conflicts,""he said, according to the Associated Press,external. ""I am not against Hezbollah as a party, I have a problem with Hezbollah destroying the country,"" he said. The main problem for the region, he said, was ""Iran interfering in Arab states"". A sombre Mr Hariri recognised that he did not resign in the ""usual way"" but said he wanted to give his country a ""positive shock"". ""My resignation came as a wake-up call for Lebanon,"" he said. Posters of Mr Hariri have appeared across Beirut. This one says: ""We are all Saad"" Iran and Hezbollah have accused Saudi Arabia of holding Mr Hariri hostage. But Mr Hariri insisted that he was free to travel as he pleased in the country. ""I am free here. If I want to travel tomorrow, I will,"" he said. Observers noted the journalist who interviewed Mr Hariri made an effort to demonstrate that the event was live, rather than pre-recorded, thoughthere were several moments which raised suspicions about the conditions under which the interview was held,,externalthe Associated Press reported.

Omagh alert caused by pipe bomb device,"An Army robot at the scene of the alert on Sunday A security alert that postponed a wreath-laying ceremony in Omagh earlier was caused by a viable pipe bomb type device, police have said. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable George Hamilton said police were following a ""strong line of enquiry"" that dissident republicans were responsible. The alert began after the discovery of a suspicious object on Drumragh Avenue. The rest of the Remembrance Sunday service was able to go ahead. Cordons were in place at Drumragh Avenue, Mountjoy Road, Sedan Avenue, George Street and High Street. The alert has now ended. The PSNI Chief Constable said that the device was ""left to cause maximum disruption"" to the commemorations and described it as ""sickening and appalling"". An Army bomb expert examines the scene ""This is the action of a small and callous group of violent people who have nothing to offer our communities other than fear and intimidation,"" he said. ""Whilst our investigation into the incident is at a very early stage, one strong line of enquiry is that violent dissident republicans are responsible. ""Their actions today have demonstrated the disregard and disrespect they have for this community, which has already suffered so much pain and hurt at the hands of terrorists."" In 1998, a Real IRA bomb in Omagh killed 29 people. DUP MLA Tom Buchanan said he believed the planting of the pipe bomb was a ""re-run"" of the Enniskillen Poppy Day bomb 30 years ago that resulted in the deaths of 12 people. ""Innocent men, women and children's lives were taken and maimed with a similar type of device at that particular time,"" he said. ""And, again, I find it very difficult to get words strong enough to condemn those that are responsible for planning and pre-meditating such an attack."" Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Smyth said those responsible were cowards. ""It's always going to hurt an awful lot when people come to remember their dead and they come with wreaths, they come with a very clear idea of what they want to do,"" he said. ""Then, because of the actions of a few very sick and very cowardly individuals, they're stopped from doing that."" The Sinn FÃ©in MP for the area, Barry McElduff, said everyone had the ""unfettered right"" to remember their dead. ""Whoever decided to leave a package in this area, a suspicious package, obviously has shown complete disregard for everyone in the community,"" he said.

Trump's Russia stance 'puts US in peril',"Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump met recently at a summit Two former US intelligence chiefs say Donald Trump's stance on Russian meddling in last year's presidential election is putting the US at risk. The US president sparked uproar by suggesting he believed Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin when he said there had been no interference. The two leaders briefly discussed the allegations at an Asia-Pacific summit. US intelligence has long concluded Russia tried to sway the vote in Mr Trump's favour. Trump's Asia tour leaves observers perplexed ""Every time he [Putin] sees me he says I didn't do that, and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country."" Mr Trump also disparaged key figures in the US intelligence community who concluded in January that Russian meddling had taken place, including former national intelligence chief James Clapper, ex-CIA director John Brennan and sacked FBI chief James Comey, whom he called ""political hacks"". Mr Trump has since sought to mollify critics of his commentsfollowing uproar at his apparent defence of Mr Putin. Mr Clapper said he was alarmed by the president's comments. ""Putin is committed to undermining our system, our democracy and our whole process,""he told CNN,external. ""To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding and in fact poses a peril to this country."" This video can not be played Mr Putin stood up to greet Mr Trump Appearing alongside him, Mr Brennan, said he found it ""puzzling"" why Mr Trump was not more explicit in condemning the Russian president when it represented a ""national security problem"". Referring to Mr Trumps criticism of him, Mr Brennan said: ""Considering the source of the criticism, I consider that criticism a badge of honour."" Soon after, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin rejected suggestions from both men that Mr Trump was being ""played"", saying he was focused on tackling difficult issues like North Korea and Syria. Questions surrounding Russia's role in last year's US elections and allegations of collusion involving Donald Trump's campaign team have dogged his presidency. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to help Mr Trump win the presidency by hacking and releasing emails damaging to his opponent Hillary Clinton. While Russian hackers are widely suspected of involvement, there has been no conclusive link to the Kremlin. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Special counsel Robert Mueller is currently investigating whether there were any links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Both deny there was any collusion. Last month, former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to having lied to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and an associate were also placed under house arrest on charges of money laundering as a result of the Mueller inquiry, but the charges do not relate to the election.

Deadly quake hits Iraq and Iran,"Most of the deaths were reported in Iran's Kermanshah province A 7.3-magnitude earthquake has shaken the northern border region between Iran and Iraq, killing at least 396 people and injuring thousands more. More than 7,000 people are also said to have been injured in the quake, the world's deadliest this year. Most of those who died were in Iran's western Kermanshah province, where a search for survivors has started. Nine more people died in Iraq, where residents fled from their homes into the streets in the capital, Baghdad. ""I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,"" a Baghdad resident, Majida Ameer, told Reuters news agency. ""I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: 'Earthquake!'"" Latest images of aftermath The world's deadliest earthquakes In the latest updates from Iran: State news agency Irna quoted an emergency official as saying 6,603 people were injured in Iran alone Most of the victims were in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, about 15km (10 miles) from the border, emergency services chief Pir Hossein Koolivand said The town's main hospital was severely damaged, leaving it struggling to treat hundreds of wounded, state TV reported A woman and her baby were pulled alive from rubble in the town, Iranian media said One aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter after the quake. Many homes in the predominantly Kurdish mountainous area are made of mud bricks and are vulnerable in quakes as large as Sunday's. This video can not be played A Kurdish TV channel was live on air during the earthquake In Sarpol-e Zahab, a city of about 85,000 people, the sides of a number of tall buildings collapsed, forcing many people to spend the night outdoors in freezing conditions. Rescue teams were being hampered by landslides, emergency workers said. The quake hit at 21:18 local time (18:18 GMT) about 30km south-west of Halabja, near the north-eastern border with Iran,the US Geological Survey (USGS) said,external. About 1.8 million people live within 100km of the epicentre, the UN estimates. On the Iraqi side, the most extensive damage was in the town of Darbandikhan in the Kurdistan Region. ""The situation there is very critical,"" Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters news agency. Is it possible to predict a quake? Yaseen Abbas of the Iraqi Red Crescent Society told the BBC that 425 people had been wounded in the Iraqi Kurdistan region, where Turkey has already delivered aid. The BBC's Rami Ruhayem, in the regional capital Irbil, said shaking there had lasted for more than a minute. ""For a few seconds at first it was barely detectable, I wasn't sure whether it was a minor tremor or just my imagination,"" he said. ""But soon enough it was unmistakable as the building started swaying from side to side."" This huge rock fell from a mountain in Darbandikhan, Iraq The earthquake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 23.2 km, and tremors were felt in Turkey, Israel and Kuwait. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake destroyed the historic city of Bam in south-east Iran, killing 26,000 people. Sunday's quake is the deadliest to hit Iran since 2012. But it is only the sixth earthquake of magnitude-7.0 or more in 2017 -there were 16 last year and 19 the year before,external. Analysis by Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent Iran is one of those regions of the world that is all too familiar with quakes, and has experienced some very big tremors in the past. In general terms, the big driver here is the clash between the Arabia and Eurasia tectonic plates. The former is pushing north by a couple of centimetres a year. In the south-east of the country, the Arabia plate is actually pushing under the Eurasia plate, but in the north-west these great slabs rub directly against each other. The Zagros mountains are a result of all this compression. Early reports indicate the quake occurred on a thrust fault. This means the crust on one side of the break in the rocks is moved vertically up and over the other side - which fits exactly with this general picture. Geological agencies now produce immediate bulletins on the likely expected casualties. This modelling work is based on factors such as the size of the quake, population density and what is known about local construction methods. It's inexact work, but the first bulletins suggested this event could produce many hundreds of deaths and perhaps thousands of injured individuals. Are you in the area?

Lynx killing order defended by council,"Lilleth went missing some time in the last three weeks A council which ordered an escaped Eurasian lynx to be shot dead by a marksman has defended its decision. Ceredigion council said it sought expert advice before ordering Lilleth be'humanely destroyed' on Friday. Sheescaped from Borth Wild Animal Kingdom, near Aberystwyth, three weeks ago and on Saturday the zoo's owners saidthey were ""outraged"". Meanwhile, Dyfed-Powys Police said it was investigating threats against the marksman. In a statement on Sunday evening, the council said Lilleth was ""not afraid of humans"" and had entered a populated area. They said that the shooting had been approved beforehand by the police, the Welsh government and the chief veterinary officer for Wales. Borth Wild Animal Kingdom 'outraged' over lynx killing Escaped lynx 'humanely destroyed' Council investigating after lynx escape Lynx 'evades capture' overnight after escape from zoo A council spokeswoman said: ""It was not possible to assess the condition or temperament of the lynx but there were concerns about its likely behavioural response if it was startled or inadvertently confronted by a member of the public, especially by a young child. ""It must be remembered that the lynx is classified in legislation as 'dangerous and wild' and the authorities were dealing with an unmanaged escape situation."" She added that using a tranquiliser instead was ""specifically discussed"" but the terrain and vegetation in the area meant they were told it was ""not an option"". She said: ""On other occasions and in different circumstances it may be fitting to attempt to tranquilise an escaped animal but, based on the factors involved with this incident, it was decided that it was not appropriate."" Flowers have been left outside the zoo in tribute to Lilleth The council has beeninvestigating the animal's escape""to establish whether there have been any breaches of the operating licence and other related matters"". She is believed to have escapedafter making a ""giant leap"" over an electrified fence. There had been a number of sightings but she evaded capture and was at one point thought to be hiding in bushes near the zoo. Ceredigion council and Dyfed-Powys Police said they had tried a ""range of measures"" to capture the Lynx, including baited traps. The local authority has previously said it would carry out an inspection of the zoo later this month.

""For a few seconds at first it was barely detectable, I wasn't sure whether it was a minor tremor or just my imagination,"" he said. ""But soon enough it was unmistakable as the building started swaying from side to side."" This huge rock fell from a mountain in Darbandikhan, Iraq The earthquake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 23.2 km, and tremors were felt in Turkey, Israel and Kuwait. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake destroyed the historic city of Bam in south-east Iran, killing 26,000 people. Sunday's quake is the deadliest to hit Iran since 2012. But it is only the sixth earthquake of magnitude-7.0 or more in 2017 -there were 16 last year and 19 the year before,external. Analysis by Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent Iran is one of those regions of the world that is all too familiar with quakes, and has experienced some very big tremors in the past. In general terms, the big driver here is the clash between the Arabia and Eurasia tectonic plates. The former is pushing north by a couple of centimetres a year. In the south-east of the country, the Arabia plate is actually pushing under the Eurasia plate, but in the north-west these great slabs rub directly against each other. The Zagros mountains are a result of all this compression. Early reports indicate the quake occurred on a thrust fault. This means the crust on one side of the break in the rocks is moved vertically up and over the other side - which fits exactly with this general picture. Geological agencies now produce immediate bulletins on the likely expected casualties. This modelling work is based on factors such as the size of the quake, population density and what is known about local construction methods. It's inexact work, but the first bulletins suggested this event could produce many hundreds of deaths and perhaps thousands of injured individuals. Are you in the area?

Fresh Welsh Government bullying claims,"Fresh claims about bullying in the Welsh Government have been made by a former adviser to Wales' first minister. Steve Jones said he agreed with former cabinet minister Leighton Andrews, who hasdescribed a ""toxic"" atmosphereat the top of the administration. They spoke out following the death of sacked former communities minister Carl Sargeant who wasfound dead on Tuesday. The Welsh Government said it did not recognise Mr Jones's claims. Mr Sargeant was found dead at home four days after being sacked by First Minister Carwyn Jones over allegations of improper conduct towards women. Carl Sargeant: First minister orders independent inquiry Carwyn Jones 'has not answered questions' Before leaving the Welsh Government in September 2014, Steve Jones was a media adviser for the first minister and also worked on his Labour leadership campaign. In a statement, he said he agreed entirely with Mr Andrews's description of ""toxicity"" in the government and said that the behaviour of some was ""pure poison"". This video can not be played Mr Jones, speaking to BBC Wales Today via Skype, claims there was ""constant undermining"" of ministers ""Ministers were undermined by senior advisers playing power games and seeking to exert unreasonable control over government and the first minister himself,"" he said. Some ministers, including Mr Sargeant, ""would have their diaries unreasonably monitored and questioned, their policy proposals shelved and direct access to the first minister blocked"". ""It went way beyond any 'office politics' or personality clashes,"" he said. Mr Jones said at one stage he intended to resign because of the effect on his wellbeing but changed his mind when the first minister urged him to reconsider. ""Things improved for a few months, then the poison returned and it began to engulf others - advisers and ministers alike. ""It was clear that all this was getting Carl down. Mr Jones added: ""It became increasingly obvious that Carwyn was either unwilling or unable to address the culture that existed within his office. He allowed it to develop, fester and grow."" Carwyn Jones has ordered an independent inquiry into how he handled allegations against Carl Sargeant The Welsh Government said: ""We do not recognise these comments. All complaints regarding staff and special adviser conduct are taken seriously and dealt with accordingly."" Former communities secretary Mr Sargeant was being investigated over claims of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"" and was also suspended by Welsh Labour. The first minister has said he willorder an independent inquiryinto his handling of Mr Sargeant's dismissal. On Sunday, Wales' health secretary Vaughan Gething said he did not believe Mr Jones would resign following anger and criticism of his actions. But Bernie Attridge, a lifelong friend of Mr Sargeant and the deputy leader of Flintshire council, has called on the first minister to step aside.

"Celtic sued by family of fall death fanNathan McSeveney, 20, from Ayrshire, died after falling in a stairwell at Celtic Park in November 2014.7h7 hours agoGlasgow & West Scotland","Nathan McSeveney died after falling in a stairwell at Celtic Park in November 2014 The family of a football fan who died after falling in a stairwell at an international match at Celtic Park are suing the club. Nathan McSeveney, 20, from Cumnock in Ayrshire, died after Scotland's Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in November 2014. Lawyers for his family said they believed Celtic FC had ""failed in its duty of care to protect"" Mr McSeveney. Celtic said it did not accept liability for the accident. Mr McSeveney was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary from Exit 33 of the stadium on 14 November 2014 but died from his injuries. The family's lawyers, Thompsons Solicitors, said it was ""a tragic case that has devastated a family"". Partner Patrick McGuire added: ""It is our firm belief that the football club failed in its duty of care to protect this young man leading to this awful accident. ""The fact that they have now taken the obvious measure to make the area in question safer by erecting safety nets proves this. ""We will be fighting hard to make sure they family receive the justice they deserve."" A spokesman for Celtic said: ""Celtic Football Club has considerable sympathy with the McSeveney family for their terrible loss following this tragic accident. ""However, and while the club's sympathy is in no sense diminished, the club does not accept liability for the accident. ""Celtic Park is a very safe environment and complies with all applicable building standards. ""Celtic Park is regularly inspected and certified as safe by the relevant authorities, including an investigation immediately following the accident."" The spokesman added: ""The matter is in the hands of the club's insurers and solicitors and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.""

Ex-police chief 'told about porn claims',"Former Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said the allegations against Mr Green showed ""no criminality"" A former Scotland Yard chief was aware pornography had allegedly been found on Damian Green's office computer during a 2008-9 police probe, he has said. Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner between 2009-11, said he was briefed about the claims but regarded them as a ""side issue"". The allegations were first made public last week by former Met Assistant Commissioner, Bob Quick. First Secretary of State Mr Green said his accusers had ""ulterior motives"". This video can not be played Porn was allegedly found to have been viewed on Mr Green's office computer after police raids in 2008 Mr Green, who is Prime Minister Theresa May's second-in-command, said: ""I reiterate that no allegations about the presence of improper material on my parliamentary computers have ever been put to me or to the parliamentary authorities by the police. ""I can only assume that they are being made now, nine years later, for ulterior motives."" But Mr Quick, who led the investigation into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched, says pornography was found on a computer there. Both Sir Paul and Mr Quick gave evidence to aCabinet Office inquiry into Mr Green's conductlast week, led by senior Cabinet Office official Sue Gray. The inquiry, which is being held behind closed doors, is also looking at a separate claim that Mr Green, made inappropriate advances towards a female Conservative activist in 2015. He also denies that allegation. Damian Green denies claims police found pornography on a computer in his office Speaking to the BBC, Sir Paul said he thought the claim about Mr Green ""wasn't relevant to the criminal inquiry"" into Home Office leaks, which began in October 2008. Mr Green's home and office were searched as part of that probe and he was briefly arrested in November that year, but the then shadow immigration minister faced no further action. A review of the police inquiry found that ""less intrusive methods"" could have been used. Referring to the pornography allegations, Sir Paul said: ""I regret it's in the public domain. ""There was no criminality involved, there were no victims, there was no vulnerability and it was not a matter of extraordinary public interest."" Sir Paul added that it was not Scotland Yard's role to ""police the workplace"". The Met declined to say whether it was helping the Cabinet Office investigate the claims, but said in a statement: ""As this is not our inquiry the MPS does not believe it is appropriate to comment upon it.""

Gove under fire over Nazanin comments,"This video can not be played Michael Gove says he does not know why Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran Michael Gove has come under fire for saying he didn't know what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing in Iran when she was arrested in 2016. Mr Gove told Andrew Marrhe would ""take her husband's assurance"" that the British-Iranian citizen was on holiday. He was defending the foreign secretary, whose own comments have caused concern that her sentence could be extended. Labour said he ""was more interested in protecting (Boris) Johnson's job"" than Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's liberty. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said Mr Gove had ""compounded"" Mr Johnson's ""cavalier approach to international diplomacy"". Boris Johnson sorry if remarks 'caused anxiety' Mother caught in Iran power struggle Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran airport with her 18-month-old daughter in April 2016, one of several Iranians with dual nationality to be detained over a period of months. She was accused of trying to overthrow the Iranian regime - charges she has always denied - and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. She says she was on holiday in Iran so relatives could meet her young daughter. The arrestswere seen as part of an attempt by Iran's Revolutionary Guards to undermine President Hassan Rouhaniand the process of thawing relations with the West. Last week UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was criticised for suggesting she had been training journalists on the trip - causing concern it could cause her sentence to be lengthened. Mr Johnson has since said the government has ""no doubt"" she was on holiday ""and that was the sole purpose of her visit"". Asked on Sunday by Mr Marr what she had been doing in Iran, Mr Gove replied: ""I don't know"" adding there was ""no reason Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe should be in prison in Iran so far as any of us know"". He went on to say her husband was the person who would know and he would take his assurance that she was on holiday. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""If Theresa May was a strong prime minister, she'd have sacked him a long time ago"" He said: ""We make a big mistake if we think the right thing to do is to blame politicians in a democracy who are trying to do the right thing for the plight of a woman who is being imprisoned by a regime that is a serial abuser of human rights."" ""Who is in the dock here? Iran. It should be the actions of their judiciary and the revolutionary guards."" He added the UK should not ""play their game"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn andLondon Mayor Sadiq Khanhave both called for Mr Johnson to resign for putting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe at risk. Mr Corbyntold the Observer,externalMr Johnson should be sacked as foreign secretary for ""undermining our country"" and ""putting our citizens at risk"". And Labour's Tulip Siddiq, who is Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, told the BBC that she had repeatedly raised the details of the case in Parliament This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband said ""she was just a mum on holiday"" ""For Michael Gove to go on TV today and say he wasn't sure ... he should know that Nazanin was on holiday and in compounding the lie that was told about training journalists, he is only going to make life worse for my constituent."" It is understood that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard spoke to the foreign secretary on Sunday.Mr Ratcliffe told the BBC he hopedhe might be able to travel to Iran with Mr Johnson to meet his wife and see his daughter, who he has not seen in person since the arrest.

Medical concern for Briton held in Iran,"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband said ""she was just a mum on holiday"" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman being held in Iran, has seen a specialist after finding lumps in her breasts, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe also expressed concern that his wife appeared to be ""on the verge of a nervous breakdown"". She was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016, accused of trying to overthrow the regime, which she denies. Cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have beenaccused of bungling the UK's handling of the case. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family have issued a statement about her condition, saying she had been ""complaining of sharp stabbing pains in her breasts"" for more than a year. They said she had been given a mammogram by the prison's gynaecologist, which gave an inconclusive result. After insisting on seeing an outside specialist, the family said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was then taken to hospital for an ultrasound on Saturday. They said although the doctor thought the lumps were likely to be benign, he did note her family having a history of breast cancer. She was given anti-inflammatory medication and vitamin pills and was to be seen by the specialist again next week to see whether there was any improvement or whether she might need surgery, the family said. Boris Johnson sorry if remarks 'caused anxiety' Mother caught in Iran power struggle 'My wife's been punished without crime' The full details of the allegations against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe have never been made fully public. She maintains the purpose of her trip to Iran was to visit family and for her daughter to meet her grandparents but speaking in Westminster on 1 November, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appeared to contradict her account when he wrongly said she had been training journalists there. Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was recalled to court in Iran and his remark cited as evidence against her, prompting fears her five-year sentence could be extended. However, her family say there have been no developments on new charges against her since her court appearance. Her lawyer also says he has not been contacted by the Iranian judiciary. In the statement her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, describes his earlier phone conversation with Mr Johnson and says the minister is trying to find time to meet him ""in the next few days"". This video can not be played Michael Gove says Richard Ratcliffe was the person who would know what his wife was doing in Iran It came after Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran when she was arrested. He later said he would ""take her husband's assurance"" that she was on holiday. Amid calls for his resignation over the matter, the foreign secretary earlier this week clarified that the UK government had ""no doubt"" that a holiday was the sole purpose of her visit to Iran. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had been angered by Mr Johnson's initial remarks and Iranian media coverage of her case. But he restated his belief that it was not in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's interests for anyone to resign.

The Russian Revolution and Me," The first decrees of the Soviet government Troops on the streets At the end of October 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power. Vladimir Raffe's father watched the revolution unfolding on the streets of Moscow: ""A young guard walks up and down by the Kremlin gates, bayonet in hand, cigarette in his mouth. Round the corner, in Nikolskaya Street, revolutionaries push a cannon past the Muir and Merrilees department store. The Kremlin gates close. The guards disappear. ""He’s the boy on the right in this photo, which was taken in 1907."" Russians fight Russians Not everyone welcomed Russia's new rulers. Mikhail Solovyev's great-uncle Victor Bakhmurin was a student at the Imperial Russian Army Artillery school: ""A month after the revolution, Viktor and his fellow students joined a volunteer force fighting the Bolsheviks in southern Russia.  He was badly injured and ended up in a Russian hospital in Constantinople, now Istanbul, in Turkey. ""This photo was taken in Constantinople and sent to my grandmother. She tore off the top, so if the police searched her house they couldn't tell who was in the picture."" Upheaval and chaos In the upheaval of the revolution and ensuing civil war, many people became separated from loved ones. Fereydoun from Iran shared the story of his grandfather, Hassan-gholi, who fell in love with a Russian girl while working in a Moscow factory: ""This is a picture of me and my grandfather. Just before the revolution he went back to Iran to visit his parents. When he returned, Russia was in chaos and he couldn’t find the girl or her family. Hunger As the Bolsheviks fought to hold on to power, supply systems broke down and food shortages became a fact of life for many. Younes, from Iran, remembers a story told by his Russian grandfather who later fled to Iran: ""When he was little the authorities gathered all the poor, hungry children in the town in a big building and told them to pray to God for food. ""Then they told them to ask the same from Lenin. And as soon as they did, the doors opened and they were given lots to eat. I don’t know how true this story is, but when I was growing up it made me think a lot about whether God really existed."" World War One draws to a close After Lenin pulled Russia out of World War One, Britain and other allied countries deployed troops to northern Russia to stop the Germans opening up the eastern front.  Andrey Kachkin's grandfather Semyon was a Bolshevik naval officer with the Baltic Fleet: ""In 1919 my grandfather was serving on a warship called the Gavriil, which was blown up by a British mine in the Baltic Sea. He survived and after the Second World War he returned to the area - on the Gulf of Finland - and bought a house which is still my home today."" Rebellion in the Caucasus In the Caucasus mountains, on the southern edges of the Russian Empire, the revolution opened a brief window of independence for countries like Georgia. For another nation, the Chechens, it also raised hopes of a chance to finally break free from Russian domination.  Dr Taha Sultan Murad from Jordan remembers his father, Sultan Murad, who went to Georgia in 1920 to join the fight for Chechen independence: ""He travelled with Said Shamil, the grandson of Imam Shamil, the 19th Century Chechen resistance fighter.  Here they are in this photograph. My father is on the right. Despite their efforts, the entire Caucasus region was eventually conquered by the Red Army. For Chechens the revolution wreaked havoc, destroying our religion and killing so many of our people."" The fall of the aristocracy For the Russian aristocracy, the revolution brought an abrupt end to a life of wealth and privilege. Many fled the country. Those who stayed behind found there was no place for them in Russia's new society. Anastasia Zabalueva's great-grandfather was one of them: ""My great-grandfather was a count from Ufa province. His family owned vast estates and gold mines. He was involved with the revolutionary movement, and even worked closely with Lenin. ""After the revolution all his property was confiscated, and he ended up on the edge of poverty. All his former comrades turned their backs on him, afraid to be associated with an aristocrat."" The revolution reaches Central Asia Across the Russian Empire, the old order was overturned. In Central Asia it spelled the end for the khans and emirs who had ruled once powerful city states. Abdusattar Alimi is the youngest son of the last emir of Bukhara: ""My father Said Mir Mohammed Alim Khan, was forced to flee Bukhara in 1920 when it was taken by the Bolsheviks. I was born in Kabul, in Afghanistan, but all my life I have thought of Bukhara as my real home and I have longed to go there. When the Russians invaded Afghanistan my family fled again, to Pakistan. ""I’m 74 now and in my old age I’ve moved again, to Turkey, to be with my children.  But I still dream of  Bukhara, the place I should have been born."" Emigration After the revolution, Russian emigres scattered across the world.  Igor Fleischer Shevelev from Paraguay grew up in the household of a White Russian general who decided to make a new life in South America: ""Juan Belaieff, or Ivan Belayev in Russian, was a very distinguished man who always dressed in military attire. ""He became a national hero in Paraguay for his work mapping the country. He was an expert on indigenous people and they were always coming to the house to visit him. ""When he died, he was given a full military funeral and the leader of one of the indigenous tribes escorted his coffin to be buried on their land, as he had requested."" ""By 1928 the family were so poor and hungry that they decided to go to Iran. On the way their nine-year old son and baby daughter died of typhus. Our mother, who was six, was the only one to survive. ""Grandmother Anastasia left her mother behind in Russia, and she never saw her again. She never wanted to talk about what happened because she was always afraid the soldiers would come back."" The lawyer from Samarkand Stalin's purges reached the very edges of the Soviet Union. Diloram from London tells the story her grandfather, Narzyqul Mirza,  a prominent lawyer from Samarkand, who had supported the revolution: ""He was falsely accused of spying and sent into exile in the Russian Far East. He never returned. My father was only five years old at the time and he grew up with the terrible label 'son of an enemy of the people'. ""It left a deep scar on our family and we’re still living with the consequences."" Escape from the camps At the start of World War Two, 19-year old  Kadyrmambet Choro Uulu from Kyrgyzstan was expecting to be called up to the army. But as the grandson of wealthy pre-revolutionary landowners, a very different fate awaited him. His grandson Almaz tells the story: ""Kadyrmambet was arrested and sent to a labour camp in the Urals. Conditions were so terrible that he and some of the other Kyrgyz prisoners decided to escape. Sixty young men made a run for it, but only three survived. He was one of them. ""Back home in their village in Kyrgyzstan, people understood  they had been unjustly imprisoned and  had suffered enough. The local authorities left them alone. My grandfather went on to study at college and spent the rest of his life working in the village."" From Detroit to the Gulag Soviet citizens who had travelled abroad were a particular target for Stalin's secret police. Igor Artsybushev's grandfather, also called Igor, was sent to work at the Ford factory in Detroit in the 1920s, to learn about the US motor industry: ""He returned home in 1933 to a job at the new tractor factory in Chelyabinsk. ""In 1939 he was arrested and he spent most of the next 15 years in the Gulag. He was finally released after Stalin’s death. He lost the best years of his life and came home to two teenage children who hardly knew him. I grew up listening to his stories about America and about the labour camps. It had a profound effect on me."" Famine and the Cossacks At the beginning of the 1930s, the Soviet authorities' attempts to force the peasantry into collective farms, caused a catastrophic famine. Among those affected were the Cossacks of the Kuban region in southern Russia. Natalia Evdoshenko's grandmother Pelageya Kovalenko was one of them: ""My grandmother was born in 1917. Her father was killed fighting against the Bolsheviks. Her mother refused to join a collective farm and like many Kuban Cossacks she died in the famine. ""There she was forced into a marriage by a local man, and that's how my mother and two of her brothers were born. All three children finished school with distinction, and for us it worked out well. ""But I keep thinking about the tragic fate of the Kuban Cossacks whose lives were completely destroyed by the Soviets."" A parade of young Russian sportsmen during the Mayday celebrations in Red Square, Moscow, 1 May 1969 Vietnam's first seismologist In the decades after the Russian Revolution, many liberation movements and uprisings around the world took their inspiration from the momentous events of 1917. Nga Pham is from Vietnam, where the Communist Party staged its own revolution against French colonial rule in 1945: ""My father, Pham Van Thuc, is one of Vietnam’s first seismologists. He always said someone from his modest background would never have achieved this without the legacy of both revolutions. In 1967 he was sent to Moscow to study geophysics.  He travelled across the Soviet Union studying volcanoes and earthquakes.  He was very upset when the USSR fell apart."" Vladimir and Ernesto Like many Latin American countries, Venezuela experienced a surge of support for Communism in the 1960s. Many children born at that time were given revolutionary names. Vladimir Villegas is one of them: ""My parents were members of the Venezuelan Communist Party. They called me Vladimir after Lenin. My brother is called Ernesto, after Che Guevara. My father travelled to Russia several times to represent the party in Moscow. ""This is a photograph of him and me outside Lenin’s mausoleum on Red Square. I have met many Venezuelans with similar names, from different backgrounds and social classes… I suppose I’m lucky my parents didn’t call me Stalin!"" The Iranian branded a communist In 1963 Ali Ahmad from Iran applied to study at the newly-opened Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, which was offering free education to students from the developing world: ""I applied,  but I never followed it up because I didn’t have any money to keep studying. Years later, after the Iranian revolution, my application came back to haunt me. ""Every time I applied for a new passport I would be asked by the authorities to explain why I applied to study in a communist country. Finally in 1995, I was banned from travelling abroad altogether. The poet from Afghanistan In 1965 Afghan poet Sulaiman Layeq became one of the founding members of the left-wing People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan: ""My father was a religious scholar and he expected me to follow in his footsteps. But at Kabul University I was introduced to left-wing politics and the ideals of the Russian Revolution. I am also a writer, and my work has been translated into Russian and other languages of the Soviet bloc countries where it was well received."" ""This photograph was taken in 1973 when I was attending a conference of Asian and African writers in Kazakhstan. I'm on the right. I admired the Soviet Union and you could say that both politically and in my work as a writer, it had significant and very positive impact on my life."" The Kyrgyz Young Pioneer It was a right of passage for all Soviet school children to join the Young Pioneers children's organisation. Ondurush Toktonazarov, from Kyrgyzstan became a member in 1967 at the age of 10: ""It was the 50th anniversary of the Russian Revolution.   Our village club was packed with people and I was wearing my red Pioneer tie. ""We had to recite a poem about Lenin. 'He gave us our future, he gave us education! He gave us the star that burns in our country.' I remember shouting it out as loudly as I could. I recited it so well that I was given a prize. Everything has changed so much since those days, but I’ll never forget that moment."" The fine arts scholar from Mali In 1979 students from Leningrad University joined the annual parade to celebrate the revolution. In the crowd was Oumar Kamara from Mali, one of many young Africans who came to the Soviet Union to get a higher education: ""This a photograph of me with my university friends from Congo, Vietnam and Russia.  I’m the one in the big coat and the Russian fur hat. I studied fine arts and archaeology in the USSR from 1979 to 1982. It changed my life. I still love Russia and I’m nostalgic for that time. The ideals of the revolution shaped us all intellectually. ""I really appreciate the education system in the USSR and when I compare it to what we have in Mali I can see that our system still has too many failings."" The little girl who loved Lenin Even at kindergarten, Soviet children held special concerts every year to celebrate the revolution and they were taught to idolise the Bolshevik leaders. Oxana from Ufa shared this memory: ""Our teachers used to tell us Lenin was the kindest and wisest man on Earth. When I was six, my mum took me the dentist for the first time. I was so scared. I was left alone in the corridor for a few minutes with only a bust of Lenin for company. So I climbed on a bench next to it and kissed Lenin. I was convinced he would make me stronger and braver."" The Indian radical The Russian Revolution inspired a whole generation of communists in India. Many, like Subhashini Ali,from Uttar Pradesh, are still active in politics today: ""My mother, Lakshmi Swaminadhan, was born just a year after the revolution and it had a big influence on her life.  A close family friend who was a revolutionary taught her to sing the Internationale and told her stories about the Soviet Union. ""Always a radical and an idealist,  she finally joined the Indian Communist Party in 1971, saying she felt ‘she had come home’. ""It was only when I started studying Marxism that I personally understood why the existence of the Soviet Union, and the strength it had attained at such terrible cost to its own people, had been essential to the successes of revolutions in Cuba and elsewhere. ""The astonishing role of Russian women in the revolution and the rights that they achieved was a source of inspiration and wonder. For people struggling for a new world based on equality and justice – the Soviet Union will always remain an inspiration, a reminder that such a world is possible."" Proud to be a Young Communist In 1981 Irina Prokofyeva left school. Although she couldn't have known it then, the Soviet Union had just entered its final decade: ""This is me in my last year at school. I was so proud to be a member of the Communist Youth League – the Komsomol – and I still am. I feel incredibly nostalgic about the Soviet times that are now gone. I was so happy then. ""My mum had a friend called Vladlen after Vladimir Lenin. She also knew two people called Kim - a popular name from an acronym of the Russian words for The Young Communist International. I still think they are beautiful names."" Falling statues In 1988 Faraj from Tehran went to Bulgaria on his first ever trip abroad: ""I grew up with stories about the Russian Revolution and how it had brought equality to all. It was an inspiration for many Iranians who took part in our own revolution in 1979. ""I was taken aback by the levels of poverty I saw in Bulgaria. Standing in front of the huge Lenin statue in the capital, Sofia, I started thinking about all the statues of the Shahs that I had seen coming down.  I suddenly had this very strong feeling that Lenin’s statue would come down too, and just three years later it did."" South Africa vs the Soviet Union In 1986, 18-year-old Paul Morris joined the South African Defence Force and was sent to fight Soviet-backed forces on the Angolan border. The young conscripts were told that the apartheid regime in South Africa was the last bastion holding out against communism on the continent: ""As a suburban white kid, I was fairly uninformed about politics. I was against the idea of apartheid but didn’t have the political depth to make any serious protest.  I joined up reluctantly but told myself that we were fighting communism,  and we needed to do this. Lenin and McDonalds Dariush was a schoolboy in Tajikistan at the end of the 1980s: ""My friends used to call me Moscow Boy because I was the only person in the class who had been to Moscow and seen Lenin’s mausoleum. We were brought up to think of Lenin as a god-like figure. ""A year before the Soviet Union collapsed, I went back to Moscow. It was a big shock for me to realise that no-one cared about Lenin anymore and the queue for McDonalds was longer than the one for his mausoleum."" Hijab returns to Uzbekistan As the USSR broke apart, Soviet people began rediscovering their religious and cultural traditions. Shohi, from Uzbekistan, was among them: ""My great-grandmother Zubaida was one of the first women in Samarkand to stop wearing the Islamic veil. I wonder what she would have thought if she’d known that a century later her great-granddaughter – that’s me – would chose to wear the hijab again. ""I did it because my husband’s family were religious. But as time passed, attitudes began to change in Uzbekistan and the hijab was no longer considered acceptable. When I applied to do a post-graduate degree, I was told quietly that I would never get in unless I took off my headscarf. ""I am a principled person. For me it had to be either proper full hijab or nothing at all. So eventually I took my headscarf off. I suppose in a way my story makes me a bit of a revolutionary – just like my great-grandmother Zubaida!"" Built with Shorthand"
Spanish PM vows to end Catalonia 'havoc',"PM Mariano Rajoy (L) joined the leader of his PP party in Catalonia for campaigning on Sunday Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said regional elections next month in Catalonia will help end ""separatist havoc"" in the north-eastern region. He addressed a campaign event on his first visit there since imposing direct rule on the region a fortnight ago. Defending his decision in Barcelona, he said he had ""exhausted all roads"" after the Catalan government's unilateral declaration of independence last month. Several key Catalan leaders are currently being detained over the move. Some 750,000 people protested in Barcelona on Saturday against the arrests, local police estimated. Would Catalonia be a viable country? Basque leaders worry about Catalan chaos The crisis was sparked by a disputed referendum held in Catalonia in October, which had been declared illegal by the Spanish courts. Catalan officials said the independence campaign won 92% of the vote, from a turnout of 43%. Many of those who were against independence did not cast votes, refusing to recognise the legitimacy of the referendum. The Catalan government subsequently declared independence. In response, the Spanish government dissolved the region's parliament, imposed direct rule and called a snap regional election on 21 December. Protesters shone their mobile phone torches during Saturday's rally in Barcelona Speaking at a campaign event in Barcelona for his Popular Party (PP) on Sunday, Mr Rajoy called on the participation of the ""silent majority"" to ""convert their voice into a vote"". ""We must reclaim Catalonia from the havoc of separatism,"" he added, saying: ""With democracy, we want to reclaim Catalonia for everyone."" He told PP supporters that the right result would boost Spain's economic growth next year to above 3%. He called on companies not to leave the region, after hundreds of firms moved their headquarters away amid uncertainty over the region - which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy. He also urged people in Spain to continue buying Catalan products. By James Reynolds in Barcelona For a short while, the man who ultimately runs Catalonia was in Catalonia. But Mariano Rajoy's advisors made sure he would not run into vocal pro-independence opponents. Instead, he spoke to the party faithful. Mr Rajoy's main campaign event was held inside a hotel ballroom, in front of mostly older supporters. Spain's prime minister came here in order to win the regional Catalan election he's called for 21 December. His People's Party doesn't command widespread support in this region. Mr Rajoy's supporters waved flags left for them on their seats But the pro-Spain movement as a whole makes up about half the population of Catalonia. An election victory for this sector would make it much harder for pro-independence forces to make another attempt to break away from Spain. After speaking for 25 minutes, Mr Rajoy posed for pictures and made his way out of the hotel amid a crush of supporters. ""Will you meet your opponents?"" I asked him. ""Yes,"" he said. But he didn't say where or when. Since the crackdown by Madrid,Catalonia's sacked President Carles Puigdemont has gone into self-imposed exile in Belgium, and many of his top allies have been remanded in custody. Thousands took to the streets of Barcelona on Saturday calling on Spain to free the ministers, as well as two grassroots campaign leaders being detained. They marched behind a banner declaring ""We are a republic"", and carried placards that said the detainees were political prisoners. The sacked former ministers are accused of alleged rebellion and sedition, while the two activists were arrested over a mass protest before the referendum. This video can not be played Here's what protesters in Catalonia are singing about The left-wing ERC party, a key ally of Mr Puigdemont, has announced that some of the prisoners, including party leader Oriol Junqueras, as well as some of the sacked ministers who also went to Belgium, will stand on its electoral list. However, the ERC has rejected a call from Mr Puigdemont to fight the election as part of a single pro-independence bloc with other parties - as they did in 2015. A recent opinion poll in Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia suggests that the ERC will win the biggest share of the vote in December.,external Mr Rajoy's PP won just 8.5% of the vote in the last regional elections two years ago. Mr Rajoy was mocked as the Devil on this recent placard in Barcelona In another development, the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, condemned Catalonia's pro-independence leaders. Ms Colau, who was elected in 2015 on an anti-capitalist platform and whose party is standing in the regional parliamentary election for the first time, said leaders of the independence movement had ""tricked the population for their own interests"". However, her party has also voted to break a pact with the Socialist party in Barcelona in protest at its support for the national government's decision to invoke Article 155 of the constitution, imposing direct rule on Catalonia.

Mr Barnier was talking to French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche,externaldays after giving the UK a two-week deadline to clarify key issues. Failing to reach an agreement was not his preferred option, he stressed. The UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis has said it is time for both sides ""to work to find solutions"".

Everyone needs to plan for it, member states and businesses alike. We too are preparing for it technically. ""A failure of the negotiations would have consequences on multiple domains."" Mr Barnier has asked the UK to clarify its stance on its financial obligations to the EUif future trade talks are to go ahead in December. But Mr Davis has made conflicting remarks, suggesting the UK would not have to give a figure for a financial settlement before it could move on to talks about a future trading relationship. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, he said: ""In every negotiation, each side tries to control the timetable. The real deadline on this is, of course, December."" Mr Davis was referring to the next EU summit which will take place in Brussels in December.

How UK plans to protect wildlife post-Brexit,"Some MPs are concerned Brexit poses a risk to UK wildlife and habitats A new environment watchdog to protect UK wildlife, land, water and air once Britain leaves the European Union is being planned by the government. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the body would hold the powerful to account and deliver a green Brexit. The plans come amid concerns that environmental regulations enshrined in EU law could be lost after Brexit. Mr Gove toldthe Andrew Marr Showstandards would not be sacrificed as part of a potential US free trade deal. Mr Gove wants the watchdog to be independent of government -  able to speak its mind freely, he said, with clear legal authority. Writing in The Telegraph,external, he said the watchdog would have ""real bite"" but did not outline exact planned powers. He said it was important that environmental enforcement and policymaking remained bound to a clear set of principles once Britain leaves the EU. He added that the watchdog would make a national policy statement to ensure policymakers protect the environment, and remain grounded by rigorous scientific evidence. Law needed to limit Brexit's environmental impact, say MPs Inside a US/UK trade deal Reality Check: Are millions of trees being planted? Speaking to Andrew Marr, Mr Gove rejected suggestions from US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the UK may relax its policies to secure an agreement post-Brexit. ""While we do want a trade deal with the United States, we will not lower environment or animal welfare standards,"" he said. ""Free trade is a good thing, but free trade flounders on the rocks of public opinion if it is used as a Trojan horse for lowering environmental standards, so we're not going there."" Some MPs are worried Brexitposes a risk to UK wildlife and habitats- with the cross-party Environmental Audit Committee calling for the creation of new environmental protection law. Labour's Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, told BBC News earlier this year: ""European law protects huge amounts of the UK's environment, farming and countryside."" The government has said the EU Withdrawal Bill - which goes before MPs for debate this week - will incorporate many of these regulations. Mr Gove also outlined his vision for British agriculture and wildlife once Britain leaves the EU. Describing British farmers as the ""best in the world"", he said he wanted to ""help support farmers produce food in a sustainable and productive way"". Mr Gove told Marr that in the event of a no deal scenario, British food would still be ""increasingly in demand worldwide"". ""The trend overall globally is toward greater quality and British farmers are in the best position to meet that,"" he added. He also revealed plans to plant 11 million trees over the next decade, and encourage a ""wider range of species"". ""I want the number of birds to increase - particularly farmland birds,"" he concluded.

Trump trades 'fat' barb with N Korea,"Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump have previously called each other mad President Donald Trump has again traded barbs with North Korea, shortly before offering to mediate in a heated regional dispute. He took to Twitter to complain he would never call North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ""short and fat"", after its foreign ministry called him ""old"". It was one of a series of remarks he made on social media before volunteering his services over maritime claims in the South China Sea. ""I'm a very good mediator,"" he said. China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims to territory in the South China Sea. Trump's tour leaves observers perplexed Why is the South China Sea contentious? Tensions with China have been high in both Vietnam and the Philippines, inflamed by the formers island-building and naval patrols. A framework for a code of conduct was agreed in August, but this is still only an outline, with more negotiations due to take place before it can be legally binding. Mr Trump, who has long styled himself as a dealmaker, suggested his expertise could aid the process. ""If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know,"" Mr Trump told his Vietnamese counterpart, Tran Dai Quang, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Hanoi. Mr Trump offered to help his Vietnamese counterpart, Tran Dai Quang (pictured together) Mr Trump's own dispute with North Korea continues to escalate, at least in the insults traded across Twitter and in official statements. On Saturday, North Korea denounced Mr Trump's Asia trip, calling it a ""warmonger's visit"" and again described the president as a ""dotard"" - a centuries-old insult for an elderly person. Mr Trump responded with a passive aggressive tweet, suggesting he would never call Mr Kim was ""short and fat"", and complaining: ""Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!""

President Trump has not ruled out friendly relations with North Korea. Asked at a news conference in Vietnam if he could see himself being friends with Mr Kim, the president said: ""That might be a strange thing to happen but it's a possibility. ""If it did happen it could be a good thing I can tell you for North Korea, but it could also be good for a lot of other places and be good for the rest the world. ""It could be something that could happen. I don't know if it will but it would be very, very nice."" The Vietnamese leg of Mr Trump's five-nation Asia tour was met with protests. Mai Khoi, a singer and dissident, said police confined her to her home and threatened her with eviction, after she defied a ban on protests. Ms Khoi, who wasbarred from standing for parliament last year, said she was escorted home after she flashed a sign insulting the president as his motorcade passed by. She said she was protesting against Donald Trump's attitude to women and his failure to meet with human rights activists in Vietnam.

More charges for mother jailed in Iran,"Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has served 19 months of her five-year sentence A British-Iranian mother being held in Iran faces two more charges in relation to her alleged involvement in trying to overthrow the government. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, has served 19 months of a five-year term for alleged security offences. The charity worker was arrested at Tehran Airport in April 2016 while visiting family in Iran with her daughter. She rejects the charges, which carry an extra 16 years in prison if proven. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has worked for the charity the Thomson Reuters Foundation and the BBC,lost her final appeal in April 2017. Under the previous charges, which have not been made public, she was accused of plotting to topple the regime in Tehran. The latest charges allege Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe joined organisations which specifically worked to overthrow the government. She is also accused of attending a demonstration outside the Iranian Embassy in London - it is claimed a photo was found during a search of her private email account. Her family has paid bail to stop her being put back in solitary confinement and a date for the full trial has not been set. This video can not be played Speaking to the BBC in January 2017, Richard Ratcliffe recalls the moment he realised his wife would not be returning to the UK Iran does not recognise dual nationals and denies them access to consular assistance. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was seeking more information from the Iranian authorities and both the prime minister and foreign secretary had raised the case with Tehran and at the UN General Assembly. Middle East minister Alistair Burt has met Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family both in London and in Tehran to discuss her case, and hopes to meet with them again later this month. A spokesman for the FCO said: ""We continue to be concerned for the welfare for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and have repeatedly raised this with the Iranian authorities, urging them to provide all necessary medical assistance. ""We will continue to raise all our dual national detainees, including Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case with the Iranian government at every available opportunity."" Richard Radcliffe has said he believes his family is being used as a ""bargaining chip"" over UK-Iran politics Speaking from the UK, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard, said the UK and Iran need to look after its citizens. ""The Iranian Ambassador and the UK government need to stand up, and say they will protect British Iranians. ""It is not enough just to focus in public on their business deals, and to keep a silent pretence. It looks like heads in the sands."" Monique Villa, CEO at the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said the accusation Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was trying to overthrow the regime is a ""complete invention"". ""The Thomson Reuters Foundation doesn't work in Iran and has no programme or dealings with Iran. ""We continue to assert that she is 100% innocent and that these ludicrous charges must be dropped immediately."" She added the charity worker was subject to ""inhumane treatment"" which had already caused ""irreparable damage"".

Caught in Iran power struggle,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran The case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is first and foremost a story of terrible personal suffering for a young woman, her husband and their baby girl. Eighteen months into a five-year sentence, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces the prospect of up to 16 years in an Iranian jail. It is also, however, a story of an internal power struggle in Iran, as well as of the nation's deeply difficult relationship with the UK. To understand how she fits into this, the first thing to examine is the timing of her arrest. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in April 2016, a few months ahead of the first anniversary of Iran's historic nuclear deal. This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife is innocent The accord, on which President Hassan Rouhani had staked his reputation, was bitterly opposed by elements of the powerful Revolutionary Guards. They had often benefited financially from the sanctions regime. They were adamant that the nuclear deal must be seen as a failure, that it had changed nothing and that compromise with the West was a fruitless exercise. Arrests of a number of Iranians with dual nationality came about in this context: Siamak Namzi, an Iranian-American businessman, was detained in October 2015 Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a charity worker, was held the following April Homa Hoodfar, a Iranian-Canadian academic, was detained in June last year. Iran is in the grip of an ideological power-struggle, with two competing world views. President Rouhani came to power promising to open Iran up to the world; the supreme leader, the Revolutionary Guards and the judiciary have a far more hardline position, both in relation to how the country should be run as well as its foreign relations. Profile: Hassan Rouhani presents a vision for a moderate, modern and outward-looking Iran All the arrests were seen as an attempt by the Revolutionary Guards to undermine not just the president, but the very process of thawing relations with the West. Of the three dual-national prisoners arrested after the deal was agreed, only one has since been released: Ms Hoodfar was sent home a few months later on what the Iranians called ""humanitarian grounds"". The only significant difference between her case and Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's was their nationalities: one was half-Canadian, the other half-British. To Iranian minds, the UK is viewed with almost unique suspicion. Indeed, in 2009 the supreme leader said that of all the world's ""arrogant powers"", the UK was the ""most evil"". To understand why, one must go back to the 1953 coup-d'Ã©tat that overthrew nationalist Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, returning the autocratic Shah to power. Behind it were the British and American intelligence agencies. Almost 300 people were killed in the streets of Tehran after protesting against the prime minister's removal in a US- and British-organised coup in 1953 This led to deep-rooted suspicions of the West's intentions; once the Shah was ousted by the Islamic Revolution of 1979, those suspicions became open hostilities. Relations have never really recovered. Over the years there have been a number of key points, notably the 1989 fatwah calling for the death of British author Salman Rushdie. His book, The Satanic Verses, was denounced as blasphemous by the supreme leader; he called on Muslims around the world to try and kill Rushdie. The controversy led to a severing of diplomatic ties, which were not repaired until 1998. In 2007, 15 British Royal Navy personnel were detained off the South Coast of Iran. They were paraded on TV, a show of power by Tehran, but ultimately released under diplomatic pressure. The 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was followed by peaceful street protests, which the supreme leader accused the West of encouraging.  A number of staff at the British embassy were arrested and forced to sign confessions. In November 2011, relations deteriorated further. After the UK increased sanctions on Iran, the parliament voted to expel the British ambassador. Before he could pack his bags, members of the hardline Basij militia ransacked the British embassy in Tehran. It did not re-open until 2014. But, it is not just the British government that has been viewed with great hostility. Western media, most notably the BBC's Persian Service, has long been regarded with deep distrust, fear and often hatred by the hardline Iranian establishment. For years Persian Service journalists have been harassed and intimidated by the Iranian authorities. Two months ago all the assets of 150 BBC staff, former staff and contributors were frozen for ""conspiracy against national security"". And here we come to the final part of the story of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Many years ago, she worked for BBC Media Action, the charitable wing of the BBC. Although it has no direct connection to the BBC's Persian service, it has been used as evidence that she was in Iran for political reasons. This video can not be played Mr Johnson called the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case It is, therefore, for this reason that the recent comments by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were so controversial, and potentially damaging. By stating that she was involved in ""training journalists"", he has given ammunition to those elements of the establishment who view her as just another example what the supreme leader described as ""an infiltration project"" by the West. All the while, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe languishes in Tehran's Evin jail. Her daughter, who has now forgotten how to speak English, can only see her for an hour-and-a-half a week. Meanwhile her husband Richard suffers in London. The future of a family, half-British, half-Iranian, has been torn apart by the suspicion and distrust caused by their own countries' pasts.

Charges against detained mother 'absurd',"This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe: ""She's a loyal and proud Iranian"" The husband of a British mother detained in Iran has said the idea she could be involved in trying to overthrow the regime is ""absurd"". Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 37, is due on trial on as yet unspecified charges after being arrested in April. Speaking to the BBC on the couple's seventh wedding anniversary, Richard Ratcliffe, from north London, said his wife was ""a proud and loyal Iranian"". Prime Minister Theresa May raised the case with Iran's president last week. The British-Iranian charity worker was arrested while she was at an airport with her daughter Gabriella while visiting her family on holiday. Iranian officials have previously accused Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe of leading a ""foreign-linked hostile network"". Richard's only contact with his daughter is via Skype Mr Ratcliffe told the BBC's Caroline Hawley her arrest was ""so absurd"", adding: ""The idea that anyone with a baby could be busy overthrowing the regime is obviously nonsense."" He said his wife had been under ""intense interrogation"" for the first two months of her imprisonment and was kept in solitary confinement. She lost a lot of weight and became very weak, he said, adding: ""When she came out of solitary that was when she couldn't walk without blackouts and her hair was falling out."" Mr Ratcliffe believes his wife is being used as a pawn in a larger dispute. ""There is definitely a political game going on between different parts of the Iranian government and the Iranian regime, so the revolutionary guard versus the government, and she's caught up in that. ""There have been various attempts by the Iranian government to improve relations with the West and this is almost as provocative as possible to stop that happening."" Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had been caught up in a ""political game"" His daughter has had her passport confiscated and is currently being taken care of by relatives in Tehran, he said. ""There's a picture in Nazanin's parents' living room of our wedding and she'll go and point to the wedding photo if she wants to speak to daddy or if she wants to speak to mummy,"" he added. ""But, of course, she associates where she sees them, so she knows she sees mummy at prison at the moment. She knows that she sees daddy on the telephone."" He admitted being away from his daughter was ""tough"" and said ""online parenting"" was not the same as watching your daughter grow up. However, he said it was a ""small mercy"" she was with relatives in Iran. He welcomed the involvement of Mrs May - who ""raised concerns"" about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other cases of detained nationals during a phone call with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. ""We are still at the stage where we are not clear what is going on or how the process is working,"" Mr Ratcliffe added. ""Certainly the fact that Theresa May has raised Nazanin's case, and that it has reached that level - that can only help the situation."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said the PM had ""stressed the importance of resolving these cases as we worked to strengthen our diplomatic relationship"". Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, travelled to Iran on an Iranian passport. She is being prosecuted in Tehran's Revolutionary Court and her case is to be handled by judge Abolghassem Salavati.

Mother jailed in Iran loses final appeal,"Iran's supreme court has upheld a five-year prison sentence given to a British-Iranian woman for security offences. Charity worker, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, was arrested at Tehran Airport in April 2016 while visiting family in Iran with her daughter. The 38-year-old, who maintains her innocence, has lost the final stage of her appeal against the sentence. Her husband said there were no more legal options to overturn the sentence. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the charity the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was imprisoned for five yearsin Septemberand then lost an initial appeal against her sentencein January. She was accused of allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, but the official charges against her have not been made public. Iran refuses to recognise dual nationals and denies them access to consular assistance. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has said it is ""deeply concerned"" by the latest court decision. The British ambassador to Iran visited Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's two-year-old daughter Gabriella last year, who has been placed in the care of her Iranian grandparents, after the Iranian government confiscated her passport. A spokesman for the FCO said: ""Iran continues to refuse the UK access to her. The prime minister and foreign secretary have both raised Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case with their counterparts in Iran. ""We continue to press the Iranians for access and for due process to be followed, and are ready to help get her daughter back safely to the UK if requested."" Charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran are 'absurd' Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe family 'treated like a bargaining chip' But speaking from the UK, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard, said he would continue to put pressure on the UK government. ""We've had a year, the legal process is finished, so I think the government needs to step up, find a way to visit her, say that she's innocent and call for her release publicly,"" he said. ""As her husband, I can say Nazanin is innocent until I am blue in the face. I have spent a year doing it. ""But it makes a clear difference that the government hasn't. It indulges the whispers."" This video can not be played Speaking to the BBC in January 2017, Richard Ratcliffe recalls the moment he realised his wife would not be returning to the UK. Monique Villa, CEO at Thomson Reuters Foundation, said she was ""entirely convinced"" of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's innocence and called for her immediate release. She said: ""This extinguishes the last hope we have had of legally overturning a punishment where the crime remains a mystery. ""Nazanin was given no court hearing for this final judgement. She is not a spy but an innocent mother who travelled to Iran only to show her baby to her parents."" Ms Villa added that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe has never had dealings with Iran in her professional capacity at the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Gove: Blame Iran not Boris in Nazanin case,"This video can not be played Michael Gove says he does not know why Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran Michael Gove has come under fire for saying he didn't know what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing in Iran when she was arrested in 2016. Mr Gove told Andrew Marrhe would ""take her husband's assurance"" that the British-Iranian citizen was on holiday. He was defending the foreign secretary, whose own comments have caused concern that her sentence could be extended. Labour said he ""was more interested in protecting (Boris) Johnson's job"" than Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's liberty. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said Mr Gove had ""compounded"" Mr Johnson's ""cavalier approach to international diplomacy"". Boris Johnson sorry if remarks 'caused anxiety' Mother caught in Iran power struggle Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran airport with her 18-month-old daughter in April 2016, one of several Iranians with dual nationality to be detained over a period of months. She was accused of trying to overthrow the Iranian regime - charges she has always denied - and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. She says she was on holiday in Iran so relatives could meet her young daughter. The arrestswere seen as part of an attempt by Iran's Revolutionary Guards to undermine President Hassan Rouhaniand the process of thawing relations with the West. Last week UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was criticised for suggesting she had been training journalists on the trip - causing concern it could cause her sentence to be lengthened. Mr Johnson has since said the government has ""no doubt"" she was on holiday ""and that was the sole purpose of her visit"". Asked on Sunday by Mr Marr what she had been doing in Iran, Mr Gove replied: ""I don't know"" adding there was ""no reason Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe should be in prison in Iran so far as any of us know"". He went on to say her husband was the person who would know and he would take his assurance that she was on holiday. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""If Theresa May was a strong prime minister, she'd have sacked him a long time ago"" He said: ""We make a big mistake if we think the right thing to do is to blame politicians in a democracy who are trying to do the right thing for the plight of a woman who is being imprisoned by a regime that is a serial abuser of human rights."" ""Who is in the dock here? Iran. It should be the actions of their judiciary and the revolutionary guards."" He added the UK should not ""play their game"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn andLondon Mayor Sadiq Khanhave both called for Mr Johnson to resign for putting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe at risk. Mr Corbyntold the Observer,externalMr Johnson should be sacked as foreign secretary for ""undermining our country"" and ""putting our citizens at risk"". And Labour's Tulip Siddiq, who is Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, told the BBC that she had repeatedly raised the details of the case in Parliament This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband said ""she was just a mum on holiday"" ""For Michael Gove to go on TV today and say he wasn't sure ... he should know that Nazanin was on holiday and in compounding the lie that was told about training journalists, he is only going to make life worse for my constituent."" It is understood that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard spoke to the foreign secretary on Sunday.Mr Ratcliffe told the BBC he hopedhe might be able to travel to Iran with Mr Johnson to meet his wife and see his daughter, who he has not seen in person since the arrest.

In pictures: Armistice Day around the world,"World War One officially ended at 11:00 French time on 11 November, 1918. Almost a century later, in Australia, Sydney's iconic opera house was lit up with poppies - the symbol adopted by the Poppy Appeal, in aid of those serving in the British armed forces, back after its formation in 1921. Members of the Sri Lankan navy observed a silence in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Here it is known as ""Poppy Day"". By the time the Great War, as it was known then, ended, about 17 million soldiers and civilians had died. Soldiers laid a wreath of poppies in Belgrade, Serbia. Poppies were the first flower to grow on the battlefields after the war. A day has been set aside to remember those killed in wars ever since 1919. In France, one town was not only remembering the end of World War One, but the loss of one of its citizens, Chloe Boissinot, killed in the jihadist attacks on Paris two years ago. The Treaty of Versailles was signed in France in 1919, imposing harsh terms on Germany. Princess Anne travelled to the Ypres Monument at the Menenpoort (Menin Gate) in Belgium. Thousands gathered here in July to mark a century since the Battle of Passchendaele began, which left 320,000 dead or wounded on the Allied side alone. Canada was also due to mark Remembrance Day, but these red ribbons had already been tied to Rose of Sharon trees in honour of the 516 troops who lost their lives in the Korean War.

The royals watched a parade of veterans who gathered to honour comrades and family members. A traditional gun salute marked the end of the two-minute silence in London, before the Last Post was played on Whitehall. It was a chance for a moment of reflection for this ex-serviceman at a ceremony in Fort William.

Spain's PM vows to end Catalonia 'havoc',"PM Mariano Rajoy (L) joined the leader of his PP party in Catalonia for campaigning on Sunday Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said regional elections next month in Catalonia will help end ""separatist havoc"" in the north-eastern region. He addressed a campaign event on his first visit there since imposing direct rule on the region a fortnight ago. Defending his decision in Barcelona, he said he had ""exhausted all roads"" after the Catalan government's unilateral declaration of independence last month. Several key Catalan leaders are currently being detained over the move. Some 750,000 people protested in Barcelona on Saturday against the arrests, local police estimated. Would Catalonia be a viable country? Basque leaders worry about Catalan chaos The crisis was sparked by a disputed referendum held in Catalonia in October, which had been declared illegal by the Spanish courts. Catalan officials said the independence campaign won 92% of the vote, from a turnout of 43%. Many of those who were against independence did not cast votes, refusing to recognise the legitimacy of the referendum. The Catalan government subsequently declared independence. In response, the Spanish government dissolved the region's parliament, imposed direct rule and called a snap regional election on 21 December. Protesters shone their mobile phone torches during Saturday's rally in Barcelona Speaking at a campaign event in Barcelona for his Popular Party (PP) on Sunday, Mr Rajoy called on the participation of the ""silent majority"" to ""convert their voice into a vote"". ""We must reclaim Catalonia from the havoc of separatism,"" he added, saying: ""With democracy, we want to reclaim Catalonia for everyone."" He told PP supporters that the right result would boost Spain's economic growth next year to above 3%. He called on companies not to leave the region, after hundreds of firms moved their headquarters away amid uncertainty over the region - which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy. He also urged people in Spain to continue buying Catalan products. By James Reynolds in Barcelona For a short while, the man who ultimately runs Catalonia was in Catalonia. But Mariano Rajoy's advisors made sure he would not run into vocal pro-independence opponents. Instead, he spoke to the party faithful. Mr Rajoy's main campaign event was held inside a hotel ballroom, in front of mostly older supporters. Spain's prime minister came here in order to win the regional Catalan election he's called for 21 December. His People's Party doesn't command widespread support in this region. Mr Rajoy's supporters waved flags left for them on their seats But the pro-Spain movement as a whole makes up about half the population of Catalonia. An election victory for this sector would make it much harder for pro-independence forces to make another attempt to break away from Spain. After speaking for 25 minutes, Mr Rajoy posed for pictures and made his way out of the hotel amid a crush of supporters. ""Will you meet your opponents?"" I asked him. ""Yes,"" he said. But he didn't say where or when. Since the crackdown by Madrid,Catalonia's sacked President Carles Puigdemont has gone into self-imposed exile in Belgium, and many of his top allies have been remanded in custody. Thousands took to the streets of Barcelona on Saturday calling on Spain to free the ministers, as well as two grassroots campaign leaders being detained. They marched behind a banner declaring ""We are a republic"", and carried placards that said the detainees were political prisoners. The sacked former ministers are accused of alleged rebellion and sedition, while the two activists were arrested over a mass protest before the referendum.

However, the ERC has rejected a call from Mr Puigdemont to fight the election as part of a single pro-independence bloc with other parties - as they did in 2015.

Ms Colau, who was elected in 2015 on an anti-capitalist platform and whose party is standing in the regional parliamentary election for the first time, said leaders of the independence movement had ""tricked the population for their own interests"".

Sick children 'denied' out-of-hours care,"Hayley and Holly Smallman ""She can have up to 40 seizures a day - potentially each one could be dangerous."" Hayley Smallman's 15-year-old daughter Holly has a series of complex, life-limiting health conditions. Her cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease and epilepsy mean she needs 24-hour care at their home in Liverpool. It is estimated there are 40,000 children like Holly living with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions in England alone. Many of them need palliative care round-the-clock, which is largely provided at home by their families but with the support of community children's nurses and community paediatricians. Hayley says: ""I have a community matron and a community physio. They work Monday to Friday, 9am till 5pm. They are great."" But when it comes to out-of-hours and weekends, Hayley says she is left without any support. ""We don't have anyone through the night, we don't really have anyone at the weekend. ""I'm dealing with life-threatening situations, and if I make the wrong decision that could have a serious impact on Holly. ""I feel like I'm trying to do a job, but I'm not given the right tools to do the job, and I feel quite isolated and alone and scared sometimes. ""I'm not a clinician, I'm a mum. To have that support, it's like when somebody gives you that hug and says, 'it's going to be ok.' ""Sometimes we need that - it shouldn't be a luxury - it's a necessity."" Holly with her mum Hayley and dad Gary Hayley is not alone. BBC Radio 5 live Investigates has seen a new report by the charity Together for Short Lives which describes the commissioning of children's palliative care as 'patchy and inconsistent'. The charity submitted Freedom of Information requests to every Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) in England asking what services they commission for children who need palliative care. In all, 199 (94%) CCGs provided data. It revealed that, while nearly all CCGs commission community children's nursing teams, just two-thirds (67%) could say that they commission them to provide care out-of-hours and at weekends. If this support isn't in place, families say they have to call an ambulance or go to A&E. ""We know how much it disrupts Holly to take her into hospital because she's so comfortable at home,"" said Hayley. ""Also, because she is so immunocompromised, going into a hospital environment potentially brings more risk to her."" Liverpool CCG said it couldn't comment on individual cases, but that it did offer out-of-hours access to very high quality children's palliative care. Services are provided by Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust. Alder Hey said: ""The community children's nursing team is commissioned to provide an extended hours seven day service, but not 24/7. ""The community paediatricians do not provide a 24/7 service except for safeguarding."" Liverpool CCG added: ""It would not be appropriate for us to discuss details about an individual's care, but we would urge the family to raise any issues about their care with their provider in the first instance, or with us as a commissioner if they would prefer."" Following a review in 2015 into end-of-life care the government said that, where possible, children should be cared for at home with the support of community services. But this new research shows that only a third of CCG's in England could say they are implementing this commitment. Barbara Gelb, chief executive of Together for Short Lives, said the government should undertake a review of children's palliative care as a matter of urgency: ""It is not a nine-to-five job. A child's condition can deteriorate very quickly, and being able to call on a community service in the middle of the night is crucial to help families cope at these times. "" A spokesperson for NHS Clinical Commissioners, the membership organisation for CCGs, said it was encouraged that the report showed improvement in some aspects but acknowledged there was more work to be done. It added, ""Commissioners are having to make really difficult decisions on a daily basis about how to use the finite funding they have been allocated"". The  Department of Health has said it will look at the report's recommendations closely. A spokesperson said the NHS is expected to provide ""a personalised and dignified service"" that takes account of families' wishes. They added ""We recently published the government's end of life care commitment so that by 2020 there will be significant progress in patient choice, increased personalisation of care and improved quality and availability of services"". 5 live Investigates is broadcast on Sunday 12th November 2017 at 11am GMT.

Celtic sued by family of fall death fan,"Nathan McSeveney died after falling in a stairwell at Celtic Park in November 2014 The family of a football fan who died after falling in a stairwell at an international match at Celtic Park are suing the club. Nathan McSeveney, 20, from Cumnock in Ayrshire, died after Scotland's Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in November 2014. Lawyers for his family said they believed Celtic FC had ""failed in its duty of care to protect"" Mr McSeveney. Celtic said it did not accept liability for the accident. Mr McSeveney was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary from Exit 33 of the stadium on 14 November 2014 but died from his injuries. The family's lawyers, Thompsons Solicitors, said it was ""a tragic case that has devastated a family"". Partner Patrick McGuire added: ""It is our firm belief that the football club failed in its duty of care to protect this young man leading to this awful accident. ""The fact that they have now taken the obvious measure to make the area in question safer by erecting safety nets proves this. ""We will be fighting hard to make sure they family receive the justice they deserve."" A spokesman for Celtic said: ""Celtic Football Club has considerable sympathy with the McSeveney family for their terrible loss following this tragic accident. ""However, and while the club's sympathy is in no sense diminished, the club does not accept liability for the accident. ""Celtic Park is a very safe environment and complies with all applicable building standards. ""Celtic Park is regularly inspected and certified as safe by the relevant authorities, including an investigation immediately following the accident."" The spokesman added: ""The matter is in the hands of the club's insurers and solicitors and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.""

"Trump trades 'fat' barb with N KoreaThe US president hits back at Kim Jong-un, then offers his services as mediator in an Asian dispute.2h2 hours agoUS & Canada","Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump have previously called each other mad President Donald Trump has again traded barbs with North Korea, shortly before offering to mediate in a heated regional dispute. He took to Twitter to complain he would never call North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ""short and fat"", after its foreign ministry called him ""old"". It was one of a series of remarks he made on social media before volunteering his services over maritime claims in the South China Sea. ""I'm a very good mediator,"" he said. China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims to territory in the South China Sea. Trump's tour leaves observers perplexed Why is the South China Sea contentious? Tensions with China have been high in both Vietnam and the Philippines, inflamed by the formers island-building and naval patrols. A framework for a code of conduct was agreed in August, but this is still only an outline, with more negotiations due to take place before it can be legally binding. Mr Trump, who has long styled himself as a dealmaker, suggested his expertise could aid the process. ""If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know,"" Mr Trump told his Vietnamese counterpart, Tran Dai Quang, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Hanoi. Mr Trump offered to help his Vietnamese counterpart, Tran Dai Quang (pictured together) Mr Trump's own dispute with North Korea continues to escalate, at least in the insults traded across Twitter and in official statements. On Saturday, North Korea denounced Mr Trump's Asia trip, calling it a ""warmonger's visit"" and again described the president as a ""dotard"" - a centuries-old insult for an elderly person. Mr Trump responded with a passive aggressive tweet, suggesting he would never call Mr Kim was ""short and fat"", and complaining: ""Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!""

As the president took to social media, three US aircraft carriers were taking part in a military exercise in the Western Pacific, in a show of strength aimed at North Korea.

President Trump has not ruled out friendly relations with North Korea. Asked at a news conference in Vietnam if he could see himself being friends with Mr Kim, the president said: ""That might be a strange thing to happen but it's a possibility. ""If it did happen it could be a good thing I can tell you for North Korea, but it could also be good for a lot of other places and be good for the rest the world. ""It could be something that could happen. I don't know if it will but it would be very, very nice."" The Vietnamese leg of Mr Trump's five-nation Asia tour was met with protests. Mai Khoi, a singer and dissident, said police confined her to her home and threatened her with eviction, after she defied a ban on protests. Ms Khoi, who wasbarred from standing for parliament last year, said she was escorted home after she flashed a sign insulting the president as his motorcade passed by. She said she was protesting against Donald Trump's attitude to women and his failure to meet with human rights activists in Vietnam.

Spain PM visits after big Catalan protestMariano Rajoy makes a first trip after imposing direct rule in response to a push for independence.1han hour agoEurope,"PM Mariano Rajoy (L) joined the leader of his PP party in Catalonia for campaigning on Sunday Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said regional elections next month in Catalonia will help end ""separatist havoc"" in the north-eastern region. He addressed a campaign event on his first visit there since imposing direct rule on the region a fortnight ago. Defending his decision in Barcelona, he said he had ""exhausted all roads"" after the Catalan government's unilateral declaration of independence last month. Several key Catalan leaders are currently being detained over the move. Some 750,000 people protested in Barcelona on Saturday against the arrests, local police estimated. Would Catalonia be a viable country? Basque leaders worry about Catalan chaos The crisis was sparked by a disputed referendum held in Catalonia in October, which had been declared illegal by the Spanish courts. Catalan officials said the independence campaign won 92% of the vote, from a turnout of 43%. Many of those who were against independence did not cast votes, refusing to recognise the legitimacy of the referendum. The Catalan government subsequently declared independence. In response, the Spanish government dissolved the region's parliament, imposed direct rule and called a snap regional election on 21 December. Protesters shone their mobile phone torches during Saturday's rally in Barcelona Speaking at a campaign event in Barcelona for his Popular Party (PP) on Sunday, Mr Rajoy called on the participation of the ""silent majority"" to ""convert their voice into a vote"". ""We must reclaim Catalonia from the havoc of separatism,"" he added, saying: ""With democracy, we want to reclaim Catalonia for everyone."" He told PP supporters that the right result would boost Spain's economic growth next year to above 3%. He called on companies not to leave the region, after hundreds of firms moved their headquarters away amid uncertainty over the region - which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy. He also urged people in Spain to continue buying Catalan products. By James Reynolds in Barcelona For a short while, the man who ultimately runs Catalonia was in Catalonia. But Mariano Rajoy's advisors made sure he would not run into vocal pro-independence opponents. Instead, he spoke to the party faithful. Mr Rajoy's main campaign event was held inside a hotel ballroom, in front of mostly older supporters. Spain's prime minister came here in order to win the regional Catalan election he's called for 21 December. His People's Party doesn't command widespread support in this region. Mr Rajoy's supporters waved flags left for them on their seats But the pro-Spain movement as a whole makes up about half the population of Catalonia. An election victory for this sector would make it much harder for pro-independence forces to make another attempt to break away from Spain. After speaking for 25 minutes, Mr Rajoy posed for pictures and made his way out of the hotel amid a crush of supporters. ""Will you meet your opponents?"" I asked him. ""Yes,"" he said. But he didn't say where or when. Since the crackdown by Madrid,Catalonia's sacked President Carles Puigdemont has gone into self-imposed exile in Belgium, and many of his top allies have been remanded in custody. Thousands took to the streets of Barcelona on Saturday calling on Spain to free the ministers, as well as two grassroots campaign leaders being detained. They marched behind a banner declaring ""We are a republic"", and carried placards that said the detainees were political prisoners. The sacked former ministers are accused of alleged rebellion and sedition, while the two activists were arrested over a mass protest before the referendum.

The Met said it was called to reports of an attack at the park at around 19:20 GMT and found Michael with multiple stab wounds. He was pronounced dead at the scene just under an hour later. A post-mortem examination at the Princess Royal University Hospital confirmed the cause of death as stab wounds to the chest and haemorrhage.

This is not a witch hunt - Harman,"Labour MP Harriet Harman has told BBC News that the string of allegations of sexual abuse and harassment against MPs is not a witch hunt. She said: ""There are a lot of men saying this has been blown out of all proportion, it's a witch hunt. No, it's not a witch hunt, it's long overdue."" Her comments follow the suspensions of a Conservative and a Labour MP. Meanwhile,SNP MSP Mark McDonald has quit as a Scottish government minister over ""inappropriate"" behaviour. Ina statement,externalhe said it had been brought to his attention that some of his ""previous actions have been considered to be inappropriate"". ""I apologise unreservedly to anyone I have upset or who might have found my behaviour inappropriate,"" Mr McDonald, who represents Aberdeen Donside at Holyrood, said. Conservative MPCharlie Elphickeand Labour's Kelvin Hopkins were suspended from their parties on Friday, while Defence SecretarySir Michael Fallon resignedearlier this week. On Saturday morning, Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, urged people ""not to rush to judgement"", telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he believes the scandal is turning into a ""witch hunt"". ""I don't think there's anybody who would seek to defend rape or sexual abuse in the context there's no proof that I can see yet of any wrongdoing. How does a member of Parliament refute that?"" What counts as inappropriate behaviour? Harassment in Westminster: the allegations and denials Tories publish new code of conduct On Friday, the Conservatives published anew code of conductand are immediately adopting a new complaints procedure. Mrs May is also meeting opposition party leaders on Monday to discuss proposals to bring forward a new grievance system for Westminster staff and MPs. Ms Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, said that she thought Prime Minister Theresa May took ""very bold action"" in relation to Sir Michael's resignation. Sir Michael, who quit office on Wednesday saying his general conduct fell short of expected standards, has ""categorically denied"" allegations over his conduct. This video can not be played The scandal is turning into a ""witch hunt"", says Tory MP Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Week in Westminster that Mrs May's actions have made her ""hopeful"" that the parties can work together to change standards. She said people were put off from making complaints for fear of being disloyal to their party and ""helping"" the other side. But now, she said, ""there's a bigger fight"". ""We're all tribal beasts, that's why we're there [in parliament] and that has dampened down any ability to speak out,"" she said. ""I think that's changed after this week."" Ms Harman said that Parliament has a ""sea change opportunity"" to address the issue - and to help those who speak out. She added: ""If you point your finger at a powerful man, they won't just sit there, they will fight back. So there will be some backlash about this amongst the corridors [of Westminster]."" Dover MP Charlie Elphicke denies any wrongdoing On Friday, Charlie Elphicke, a former party whip who has been the Conservative MP for Dover since 2010, was suspended by the party after ""serious allegations"" were referred to the police. Denying any wrongdoing in a post on Twitter, the married 46-year-old wrote: ""The party tipped off the press before telling me of my suspension. I am not aware of what the alleged claims are."" LabourMPs Clive Lewis and Kelvin Hopkins are being investigatedby the party over allegations about their behaviour. But Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale told BBC Radio 4: ""We're in danger of getting into a situation where nobody half bright, half sensible, half decent, will want to go into the House of Commons - and that will not be good for democracy. ""We should look at the facts...by all means throw book at them, but don't throw the book at them until the case is proven."" This video can not be played I was groped and flashed at - Emily Thornberry Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, told BBC Breakfast that the House of Commons has ""no real structure"" for complaints. She said it is ""the most unusual workplace"" where the rules around sexual harassment are ""lax if not non-existent"". ""In this sense it needs to get into line. Other big companies have a sexual harassment policy, they have a staff handbook. All those things do not exist for MPs"", she said. On top of that, she added, ""you've got a whole political culture which has thrived on favours and bullying"" as well as partisan ""one-upmanship"" where people are ""incredibly loyal to their parties"". This video can not be played Labour's shadow chancellor says Parliament must 'give women the confidence to work in safety' Alongside the new code of conduct and complaints procedure, the Conservatives have set up a a hotline for reporting potential breaches and a more detailed investigatory process. Labour has introduced a new complaints procedure, while the Liberal Democrats continue to review their complaints procedures. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said any complaints system has to apply to all political parties, and must be ""fair and objective"". ""There should be an element of independence [in the system], particularly for support as well, so people can feel confident about where they can report these things and at the same time how it can be dealt with."" Mrs May said Parliament must do its bit as well as the individual parties - as it was not fair to expect potentially vulnerable people to ""navigate different grievance procedures according to political party"". Lord Bew, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told the Today programme that the ""burning issue"" at stake is the reputation of parliament. He said it was vital that cases were not dealt with internally by the parties, but by those outside parliament who could ""give some reassurance to the public that this is not just another cover-up"".

Bell ringers sought to mark WW1 centenary,"Some 1,400 bell ringers are to be recruited in 2018 to mark 100 years since World War One ended. They will represent the 1,400 bell ringers who died in the conflict. Bells in churches and cathedrals will ring out on 11 November next year and Big Ben will also strike to mark the centenary of Armistice Day. Church bells were rung in celebration when armistice was declared in 1918, after having been restricted during the four-year war. Remembrance Day: UK events to mark nation's war dead Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said: ""On November 11, 1918, the ringing of church bells erupted spontaneously across the country, as an outpouring of relief that four years of war had come to an end. ""I am pleased that to honour that moment."" Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said it was a priority to ""keep the history of the First World War alive for generations to come"". On Saturday,events were held around the UK to mark the 99th anniversary of Armistice Daywith Big Ben chiming for the first time since August.

Ex-police chief 'told about porn claims'Sir Paul Stephenson says he was told material was allegedly found on Damian Green's computer in 2008.,"Former Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said the allegations against Mr Green showed ""no criminality"" A former Scotland Yard chief was aware pornography had allegedly been found on Damian Green's office computer during a 2008-9 police probe, he has said. Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner between 2009-11, said he was briefed about the claims but regarded them as a ""side issue"". The allegations were first made public last week by former Met Assistant Commissioner, Bob Quick. First Secretary of State Mr Green said his accusers had ""ulterior motives"". This video can not be played Porn was allegedly found to have been viewed on Mr Green's office computer after police raids in 2008 Mr Green, who is Prime Minister Theresa May's second-in-command, said: ""I reiterate that no allegations about the presence of improper material on my parliamentary computers have ever been put to me or to the parliamentary authorities by the police. ""I can only assume that they are being made now, nine years later, for ulterior motives."" But Mr Quick, who led the investigation into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched, says pornography was found on a computer there. Both Sir Paul and Mr Quick gave evidence to aCabinet Office inquiry into Mr Green's conductlast week, led by senior Cabinet Office official Sue Gray. The inquiry, which is being held behind closed doors, is also looking at a separate claim that Mr Green, made inappropriate advances towards a female Conservative activist in 2015. He also denies that allegation. Damian Green denies claims police found pornography on a computer in his office Speaking to the BBC, Sir Paul said he thought the claim about Mr Green ""wasn't relevant to the criminal inquiry"" into Home Office leaks, which began in October 2008. Mr Green's home and office were searched as part of that probe and he was briefly arrested in November that year, but the then shadow immigration minister faced no further action. A review of the police inquiry found that ""less intrusive methods"" could have been used. Referring to the pornography allegations, Sir Paul said: ""I regret it's in the public domain. ""There was no criminality involved, there were no victims, there was no vulnerability and it was not a matter of extraordinary public interest."" Sir Paul added that it was not Scotland Yard's role to ""police the workplace"". The Met declined to say whether it was helping the Cabinet Office investigate the claims, but said in a statement: ""As this is not our inquiry the MPS does not believe it is appropriate to comment upon it.""

"60,000 join nationalist march in PolandRight-wing rally-goers light flares and carry Polish flags as they march through Warsaw.11h11 hours agoEurope","This video can not be played These were the scenes in 2017 when a nationalist march and counter-protest took place in Warsaw Tens of thousands of people joined a nationalist march in Warsaw on Saturday, organised to coincide with Poland's independence day. Marchers chanted religious slogans such as ""God, honour, country"" and some called out racist chants including ""Pure Poland, white Poland"". An ""anti-fascist"" counter-protest attracted about 2,000 people. Police estimated that 60,000 people took part in the main march. It attracted far-right agitators from elsewhere in Europe, including Tommy Robinson from the UK and Roberto Fiore from Italy. Kamil Staszalek, 30, said he was there to ""honour the memory of those who fought for Poland's freedom"". ""I'd say some people here do have extreme views, maybe even 30% of those marching, but 70% are simply walking peacefully, without shouting any fascist slogans,"" he told the AFP news agency. Supporters of the country's governing conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party took part in the annual march, which takes place alongside other events. Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak called the event a ""beautiful sight"". ""We are proud that so many Poles have decided to take part in a celebration connected to the Independence Day holiday,"" he said. Andy Eddles, a British language teacher who has been living in Poland for 27 years, said he was ""shocked that they're allowed to demonstrate on this day"". ""It's 50,000 to 100,000 mostly football hooligans hijacking patriotism,"" the 50-year-old, who joined the counter-protest, told AFP. ""For me it's important to support the anti-fascist coalition, and to support fellow democrats, who are under pressure in Poland today,"" he said. The nationalist marchers carried Polish flags and threw red smoke bombs. Pawel, 21, from the southern city of Rzeszow told AFP it was ""important because religion is important in our country and we don't want Islamisation, of Europe or especially Poland"".Other events were also held in the city for Independence Day, which marks the country regaining independence 123 years after it was carved up by Tsarist Russia, Prussia, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. An official ceremony was hosted by President Andrzej Duda. All living former Polish presidents attended, as well as the European Union president Donald Tusk. European Council President Donald Tusk lays a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier ""Independence Day has always been and will continue to be a celebration of all Poles and not just one party. No politician in Poland has ever had nor will ever have a monopoly on patriotism,"" Mr Tusk said as he arrived at the airport in Warsaw. Poland was the only EU country to vote against Mr Tusk's reelection as EU president in March.

Spain PM visits after big Catalan protest,"PM Mariano Rajoy (L) joined the leader of his PP party in Catalonia for campaigning on Sunday Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said regional elections next month in Catalonia will help end ""separatist havoc"" in the north-eastern region. He addressed a campaign event on his first visit there since imposing direct rule on the region a fortnight ago. Defending his decision in Barcelona, he said he had ""exhausted all roads"" after the Catalan government's unilateral declaration of independence last month. Several key Catalan leaders are currently being detained over the move. Some 750,000 people protested in Barcelona on Saturday against the arrests, local police estimated. Would Catalonia be a viable country? Basque leaders worry about Catalan chaos The crisis was sparked by a disputed referendum held in Catalonia in October, which had been declared illegal by the Spanish courts. Catalan officials said the independence campaign won 92% of the vote, from a turnout of 43%. Many of those who were against independence did not cast votes, refusing to recognise the legitimacy of the referendum. The Catalan government subsequently declared independence. In response, the Spanish government dissolved the region's parliament, imposed direct rule and called a snap regional election on 21 December. Protesters shone their mobile phone torches during Saturday's rally in Barcelona Speaking at a campaign event in Barcelona for his Popular Party (PP) on Sunday, Mr Rajoy called on the participation of the ""silent majority"" to ""convert their voice into a vote"". ""We must reclaim Catalonia from the havoc of separatism,"" he added, saying: ""With democracy, we want to reclaim Catalonia for everyone."" He told PP supporters that the right result would boost Spain's economic growth next year to above 3%. He called on companies not to leave the region, after hundreds of firms moved their headquarters away amid uncertainty over the region - which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy. He also urged people in Spain to continue buying Catalan products. By James Reynolds in Barcelona For a short while, the man who ultimately runs Catalonia was in Catalonia. But Mariano Rajoy's advisors made sure he would not run into vocal pro-independence opponents. Instead, he spoke to the party faithful. Mr Rajoy's main campaign event was held inside a hotel ballroom, in front of mostly older supporters. Spain's prime minister came here in order to win the regional Catalan election he's called for 21 December. His People's Party doesn't command widespread support in this region. Mr Rajoy's supporters waved flags left for them on their seats But the pro-Spain movement as a whole makes up about half the population of Catalonia. An election victory for this sector would make it much harder for pro-independence forces to make another attempt to break away from Spain. After speaking for 25 minutes, Mr Rajoy posed for pictures and made his way out of the hotel amid a crush of supporters. ""Will you meet your opponents?"" I asked him. ""Yes,"" he said. But he didn't say where or when. Since the crackdown by Madrid,Catalonia's sacked President Carles Puigdemont has gone into self-imposed exile in Belgium, and many of his top allies have been remanded in custody. Thousands took to the streets of Barcelona on Saturday calling on Spain to free the ministers, as well as two grassroots campaign leaders being detained. They marched behind a banner declaring ""We are a republic"", and carried placards that said the detainees were political prisoners. The sacked former ministers are accused of alleged rebellion and sedition, while the two activists were arrested over a mass protest before the referendum. This video can not be played Here's what protesters in Catalonia are singing about The left-wing ERC party, a key ally of Mr Puigdemont, has announced that some of the prisoners, including party leader Oriol Junqueras, as well as some of the sacked ministers who also went to Belgium, will stand on its electoral list. However, the ERC has rejected a call from Mr Puigdemont to fight the election as part of a single pro-independence bloc with other parties - as they did in 2015. A recent opinion poll in Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia suggests that the ERC will win the biggest share of the vote in December.,external Mr Rajoy's PP won just 8.5% of the vote in the last regional elections two years ago. Mr Rajoy was mocked as the Devil on this recent placard in Barcelona In another development, the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, condemned Catalonia's pro-independence leaders. Ms Colau, who was elected in 2015 on an anti-capitalist platform and whose party is standing in the regional parliamentary election for the first time, said leaders of the independence movement had ""tricked the population for their own interests"". However, her party has also voted to break a pact with the Socialist party in Barcelona in protest at its support for the national government's decision to invoke Article 155 of the constitution, imposing direct rule on Catalonia.

Trump calls Kim Jong-un 'short and fat',"Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump have previously called each other mad President Donald Trump has again traded barbs with North Korea, shortly before offering to mediate in a heated regional dispute. He took to Twitter to complain he would never call North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ""short and fat"", after its foreign ministry called him ""old"". It was one of a series of remarks he made on social media before volunteering his services over maritime claims in the South China Sea. ""I'm a very good mediator,"" he said. China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims to territory in the South China Sea. Trump's tour leaves observers perplexed Why is the South China Sea contentious? Tensions with China have been high in both Vietnam and the Philippines, inflamed by the formers island-building and naval patrols. A framework for a code of conduct was agreed in August, but this is still only an outline, with more negotiations due to take place before it can be legally binding. Mr Trump, who has long styled himself as a dealmaker, suggested his expertise could aid the process. ""If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know,"" Mr Trump told his Vietnamese counterpart, Tran Dai Quang, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Hanoi. Mr Trump offered to help his Vietnamese counterpart, Tran Dai Quang (pictured together) Mr Trump's own dispute with North Korea continues to escalate, at least in the insults traded across Twitter and in official statements. On Saturday, North Korea denounced Mr Trump's Asia trip, calling it a ""warmonger's visit"" and again described the president as a ""dotard"" - a centuries-old insult for an elderly person. Mr Trump responded with a passive aggressive tweet, suggesting he would never call Mr Kim was ""short and fat"", and complaining: ""Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!""

As the president took to social media, three US aircraft carriers were taking part in a military exercise in the Western Pacific, in a show of strength aimed at North Korea. US Pacific Fleet commander Scott Swift said the triple-carrier drill was the first in the region since 2007. South Korean and Japanese ships were also due to take part in the exercises, which began on Saturday and will continue until Tuesday. Allow Twitter content?

President Trump has not ruled out friendly relations with North Korea. Asked at a news conference in Vietnam if he could see himself being friends with Mr Kim, the president said: ""That might be a strange thing to happen but it's a possibility. ""If it did happen it could be a good thing I can tell you for North Korea, but it could also be good for a lot of other places and be good for the rest the world. ""It could be something that could happen. I don't know if it will but it would be very, very nice."" The Vietnamese leg of Mr Trump's five-nation Asia tour was met with protests. Mai Khoi, a singer and dissident, said police confined her to her home and threatened her with eviction, after she defied a ban on protests. Ms Khoi, who wasbarred from standing for parliament last year, said she was escorted home after she flashed a sign insulting the president as his motorcade passed by. She said she was protesting against Donald Trump's attitude to women and his failure to meet with human rights activists in Vietnam. Mr Trump will travel to Manila later on Sunday for the final stop on his Asia tour, before flying back to the US.

Plan for post-Brexit environment watchdog,"Some MPs are concerned Brexit poses a risk to UK wildlife and habitats A new environment watchdog to protect UK wildlife, land, water and air once Britain leaves the European Union is being planned by the government. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the body would hold the powerful to account and deliver a green Brexit. The plans come amid concerns that environmental regulations enshrined in EU law could be lost after Brexit. Mr Gove toldthe Andrew Marr Showstandards would not be sacrificed as part of a potential US free trade deal. Mr Gove wants the watchdog to be independent of government -  able to speak its mind freely, he said, with clear legal authority. Writing in The Telegraph,external, he said the watchdog would have ""real bite"" but did not outline exact planned powers. He said it was important that environmental enforcement and policymaking remained bound to a clear set of principles once Britain leaves the EU. He added that the watchdog would make a national policy statement to ensure policymakers protect the environment, and remain grounded by rigorous scientific evidence. Law needed to limit Brexit's environmental impact, say MPs Inside a US/UK trade deal Reality Check: Are millions of trees being planted? Speaking to Andrew Marr, Mr Gove rejected suggestions from US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the UK may relax its policies to secure an agreement post-Brexit. ""While we do want a trade deal with the United States, we will not lower environment or animal welfare standards,"" he said. ""Free trade is a good thing, but free trade flounders on the rocks of public opinion if it is used as a Trojan horse for lowering environmental standards, so we're not going there."" Some MPs are worried Brexitposes a risk to UK wildlife and habitats- with the cross-party Environmental Audit Committee calling for the creation of new environmental protection law. Labour's Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, told BBC News earlier this year: ""European law protects huge amounts of the UK's environment, farming and countryside."" The government has said the EU Withdrawal Bill - which goes before MPs for debate this week - will incorporate many of these regulations. Mr Gove also outlined his vision for British agriculture and wildlife once Britain leaves the EU. Describing British farmers as the ""best in the world"", he said he wanted to ""help support farmers produce food in a sustainable and productive way"". Mr Gove told Marr that in the event of a no deal scenario, British food would still be ""increasingly in demand worldwide"". ""The trend overall globally is toward greater quality and British farmers are in the best position to meet that,"" he added. He also revealed plans to plant 11 million trees over the next decade, and encourage a ""wider range of species"". ""I want the number of birds to increase - particularly farmland birds,"" he concluded.

Trump: Putin and I had 'good discussions',"This video can not be played Mr Putin stood up to greet Mr Trump US President Donald Trump said he had ""good discussions"" with Russian leader Vladimir Putin when they met briefly at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam. On Twitter, he blasted ""haters and fools"", who, he said, do not encourage good relations between the countries. Earlier he said Mr Putin told him he was insulted by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US election. The US intelligence community has previously concluded that Russia tried to sway the poll in Mr Trump's favour. ""He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election,"" the US president said. However, after intense criticism, Mr Trump clarified that he supported US intelligence agencies in their conclusion. ""As to whether or not I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies. I believe in our... intelligence agencies,"" he said. ""What he believes, he believes,"" he added, of Mr Putin's belief that Russia did not meddle. The two leaders had no formal bilateral talks during the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) event, but meet in passing on three occasions. They spoke about the Syria crisis and the election allegations, according to Mr Trump. Republican Senator John McCain, a vehement critic of Mr Trump, called him naive for ""taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community"". A CIA statement passed to US media said: ""The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed."" Allow Twitter content?

In his tweets, Mr Trump also said his predecessor, Barack Obama lacked ""chemistry"" with President Putin. The US justice department has appointed special investigator Robert Mueller to examine any possible collusion involving Mr Trump's team, and legal action has already been taken against several former aides. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? President Trump has refused to acknowledgea reported assessment by the CIA and other intelligence agencies that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the run-up to last year's presidential election. The presidential campaign was fiercely contested The contents of the emails, passed to Wikileaks and posted online, were embarrassing to the Democrats and shook up the presidential campaign, which ended in defeat for Hillary Clinton. In addition to the Mueller inquiry, congressional committees have been set up to carry out their own investigations. Relations between the US and Russia have been strained for years, with the Kremlin long accusing Washington of seeking to sway elections in Russia and other ex-Soviet states including Ukraine and Georgia. While Russian hackers are widely suspected of involvement, there has been no conclusive link to the Kremlin. Denying that Russia had tried to interfere last year by fostering contacts with Mr Trump's campaign, Mr Putin told reporters in Vietnam: ""Everything about the so-called Russian dossier in the US is a manifestation of a continuing domestic political struggle."" Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House 18 revelations from Wikileaks emails Russia's 'cyber war' against the West He said he believed Mr Putin had been ""very insulted by"" the allegations and that was ""not a good thing"" for America. ""He [Putin] said he didn't meddle,"" he added. ""I asked him again."" Asked if he believed Mr Putin, he replied, ""He is very, very strong in the fact that he didn't do it. You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he has nothing to do with that. Now, you are not going to get into an argument, you are going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine."" Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Da Nang Donald Trump once again goes against the findings of his own intelligence agencies. Because although the US justice department is investigating the scale and nature of Russian interference in the election of 2016 (and any links to the Trump campaign), the American intelligence community has already long determined that Russia did, indeed, interfere. Yet Mr Trump suggested this story was not only entirely fabricated by his political opponents, it might even be costing lives in Syria, because it is getting in the way of his relationship with the Russian president and hampering their ability to help solve the conflict together. ""People will die because of it, and it's a pure hit job, and it's artificially induced and that's a shame,"" he said. It is hard to know what the president hopes to achieve with this type of rhetoric. The investigation goes on. Mr Trump and Mr Putin met for the first time in July at a G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg. In Da Nang they were seen chatting briefly on three occasions within 24 hours during the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit. However, they had no formal bilateral meeting, with Mr Putin blaming it on scheduling and protocol. Mr Putin said he regretted that his talks with Mr Trump were too brief They had warm words for each other, with the US president talking of their mutual ""very good feeling"" and the Russian leader describing his counterpart as ""well-mannered... and comfortable to deal with"". They did manage to sign offa statement vowing to continue the battle against so-called Islamic State in Syriauntil the militants are defeated and calling for a political solution to the conflict. Last month,former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to having lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He testified that Russian nationals had contacted him in an attempt to gain influence with the Trump campaign, offering ""dirt"" in the form of ""thousands of emails"" on Mrs Clinton in April 2016 - two months before the DNC emails were leaked. The two leaders had three brief conversations in Vietnam Mr Trump has played down the importance of Mr Papadopoulos, calling him a ""low-level volunteer"" and ""liar"". On Saturday, Mr Putin brushed aside US media reports that a woman wrongly identified by Mr Papadopoulos as the Russian president's niece had offered to help broker meetings with Kremlin officials. ""I do not know anything about it and I think it is just some fantasies,"" Mr Putin said. Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and an associate were also placed under house arrest on charges of money laundering as a result of the Mueller inquiry, but the charges do not relate to the election.

Barcelona rally urges prisoners' release,"This video can not be played Huge pro-independence rally in Barcelona Three-quarters of a million people have rallied in Barcelona to protest against Spain's detention of Catalan independence leaders, police estimate. They shone phone torches in unison at sunset as calls were made to free eight regional ministers and two grassroots campaign leaders being held on remand. Some of the detainees will be included on the list of a Catalan separatist party at next month's snap election. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is to visit the city on Sunday. In another development, Barcelona's mayoress has condemned pro-independence leaders. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Basque leaders worry about Catalan chaos The Catalan parliament declared independence last month following an unrecognised referendum on independence from Spain. Madrid responded by dissolving the parliament and calling a regional election on 21 December. Since the crackdown by Madrid,Catalonia's sacked President Carles Puigdemont has gone into self-imposed exile in Belgium,  and his top allies have been prosecuted. A lawyer whose firm represents two of his imprisoned former ministers told BBC News their situation had been made worse by Mr Puigdemont's decision to flee. James Reynolds, BBC News, Barcelona The pro-independence movement has proven its ability to mobilise large numbers of demonstrators. Many came to this latest protest from small towns and villages in Catalonia - a sign of the movement's reach. Their immediate aim is to call for the release of the eight politicians and two activists remanded in custody on charges of sedition and rebellion. The authorities in Madrid insist that the case is purely a matter for the courts, but the detention of politicians and activists does have a political impact. Imprisonment may have served to increase their popularity. It may galvanise the pro-independence movement as the regional election approaches. The pro-independence camp wants to win a clear parliamentary majority. That would allow their side to have another go at trying to break away from Spain. But the pro-union camp, which represents the other half of Catalan society, will also campaign vigorously. Protesters marched behind a banner declaring ""We are a republic"" and carried placards declaring the 10 detainees political prisoners. This video can not be played Here's what protesters in Catalonia are singing about The sacked former ministers are being investigated for alleged rebellion and sedition, while the two activists were arrested over a mass protest before the referendum. There were performances and speeches to the crowd. Protesters chanted ""Puigdemont for president"" and a cellist played a traditional Christmas carol, The Song of the Birds, which is associated with Catalans driven into political exile. The left-wing ERC party, a key ally of Mr Puigdemont, has announced that some of the prisoners, including party leader Oriol Junqueras, as well as some of the sacked ministers who also went to Belgium, will stand on its electoral list. However, the ERC has rejected a call from Mr Puigdemont to fight the election as part of a single pro-independence bloc with other parties - as they did in 2015. A recent opinion poll in Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia suggests that the ERC will win the biggest share of the vote in December.,external Mr Rajoy was mocked as the Devil on this recent placard in Barcelona The Spanish prime minister is to make his first appearance in Catalonia since implementing direct rule two weeks ago. He is expected to address a meeting of supporters of his centre-right Popular Party, who firmly want Catalonia to remain a part of Spain. Ada Colau, who was elected mayoress in 2015 on an anti-capitalist platform and whose party (a merger of left-wing parties) is standing in the regional parliamentary election for the first time, said leaders of the independence movement had ""tricked the population for their own interests"". Ms Colau, seen here kissing her baby, has kept her distance from both separatists and unionists ""They've provoked tensions and carried out a unilateral independence declaration which the majority do not want,"" she told a meeting of her Catalunya en ComÃº (English: Catalonia in Common) party.

Rajoy to kick off campaign in Catalonia,"PM Mariano Rajoy (L) joined the leader of his PP party in Catalonia for campaigning on Sunday Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said regional elections next month in Catalonia will help end ""separatist havoc"" in the north-eastern region. He addressed a campaign event on his first visit there since imposing direct rule on the region a fortnight ago. Defending his decision in Barcelona, he said he had ""exhausted all roads"" after the Catalan government's unilateral declaration of independence last month. Several key Catalan leaders are currently being detained over the move. Some 750,000 people protested in Barcelona on Saturday against the arrests, local police estimated. Would Catalonia be a viable country? Basque leaders worry about Catalan chaos The crisis was sparked by a disputed referendum held in Catalonia in October, which had been declared illegal by the Spanish courts. Catalan officials said the independence campaign won 92% of the vote, from a turnout of 43%. Many of those who were against independence did not cast votes, refusing to recognise the legitimacy of the referendum. The Catalan government subsequently declared independence. In response, the Spanish government dissolved the region's parliament, imposed direct rule and called a snap regional election on 21 December. Protesters shone their mobile phone torches during Saturday's rally in Barcelona Speaking at a campaign event in Barcelona for his Popular Party (PP) on Sunday, Mr Rajoy called on the participation of the ""silent majority"" to ""convert their voice into a vote"". ""We must reclaim Catalonia from the havoc of separatism,"" he added, saying: ""With democracy, we want to reclaim Catalonia for everyone."" He told PP supporters that the right result would boost Spain's economic growth next year to above 3%. He called on companies not to leave the region, after hundreds of firms moved their headquarters away amid uncertainty over the region - which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy. He also urged people in Spain to continue buying Catalan products. By James Reynolds in Barcelona For a short while, the man who ultimately runs Catalonia was in Catalonia. But Mariano Rajoy's advisors made sure he would not run into vocal pro-independence opponents. Instead, he spoke to the party faithful. Mr Rajoy's main campaign event was held inside a hotel ballroom, in front of mostly older supporters. Spain's prime minister came here in order to win the regional Catalan election he's called for 21 December. His People's Party doesn't command widespread support in this region. Mr Rajoy's supporters waved flags left for them on their seats But the pro-Spain movement as a whole makes up about half the population of Catalonia. An election victory for this sector would make it much harder for pro-independence forces to make another attempt to break away from Spain. After speaking for 25 minutes, Mr Rajoy posed for pictures and made his way out of the hotel amid a crush of supporters. ""Will you meet your opponents?"" I asked him. ""Yes,"" he said. But he didn't say where or when. Since the crackdown by Madrid,Catalonia's sacked President Carles Puigdemont has gone into self-imposed exile in Belgium, and many of his top allies have been remanded in custody. Thousands took to the streets of Barcelona on Saturday calling on Spain to free the ministers, as well as two grassroots campaign leaders being detained.

Putin insulted by meddling claim - Trump,"This video can not be played Mr Putin stood up to greet Mr Trump US President Donald Trump said he had ""good discussions"" with Russian leader Vladimir Putin when they met briefly at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam. On Twitter, he blasted ""haters and fools"", who, he said, do not encourage good relations between the countries. Earlier he said Mr Putin told him he was insulted by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US election. The US intelligence community has previously concluded that Russia tried to sway the poll in Mr Trump's favour. ""He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election,"" the US president said. However, after intense criticism, Mr Trump clarified that he supported US intelligence agencies in their conclusion. ""As to whether or not I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies. I believe in our... intelligence agencies,"" he said. ""What he believes, he believes,"" he added, of Mr Putin's belief that Russia did not meddle. The two leaders had no formal bilateral talks during the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) event, but meet in passing on three occasions. They spoke about the Syria crisis and the election allegations, according to Mr Trump. Republican Senator John McCain, a vehement critic of Mr Trump, called him naive for ""taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community"". A CIA statement passed to US media said: ""The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed."" Allow Twitter content?

In his tweets, Mr Trump also said his predecessor, Barack Obama lacked ""chemistry"" with President Putin. The US justice department has appointed special investigator Robert Mueller to examine any possible collusion involving Mr Trump's team, and legal action has already been taken against several former aides. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? President Trump has refused to acknowledgea reported assessment by the CIA and other intelligence agencies that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the run-up to last year's presidential election. The presidential campaign was fiercely contested The contents of the emails, passed to Wikileaks and posted online, were embarrassing to the Democrats and shook up the presidential campaign, which ended in defeat for Hillary Clinton. In addition to the Mueller inquiry, congressional committees have been set up to carry out their own investigations. Relations between the US and Russia have been strained for years, with the Kremlin long accusing Washington of seeking to sway elections in Russia and other ex-Soviet states including Ukraine and Georgia. While Russian hackers are widely suspected of involvement, there has been no conclusive link to the Kremlin. Denying that Russia had tried to interfere last year by fostering contacts with Mr Trump's campaign, Mr Putin told reporters in Vietnam: ""Everything about the so-called Russian dossier in the US is a manifestation of a continuing domestic political struggle."" Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House 18 revelations from Wikileaks emails Russia's 'cyber war' against the West He said he believed Mr Putin had been ""very insulted by"" the allegations and that was ""not a good thing"" for America. ""He [Putin] said he didn't meddle,"" he added. ""I asked him again."" Asked if he believed Mr Putin, he replied, ""He is very, very strong in the fact that he didn't do it. You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he has nothing to do with that. Now, you are not going to get into an argument, you are going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine."" Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Da Nang Donald Trump once again goes against the findings of his own intelligence agencies. Because although the US justice department is investigating the scale and nature of Russian interference in the election of 2016 (and any links to the Trump campaign), the American intelligence community has already long determined that Russia did, indeed, interfere. Yet Mr Trump suggested this story was not only entirely fabricated by his political opponents, it might even be costing lives in Syria, because it is getting in the way of his relationship with the Russian president and hampering their ability to help solve the conflict together. ""People will die because of it, and it's a pure hit job, and it's artificially induced and that's a shame,"" he said. It is hard to know what the president hopes to achieve with this type of rhetoric. The investigation goes on. Mr Trump and Mr Putin met for the first time in July at a G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg. In Da Nang they were seen chatting briefly on three occasions within 24 hours during the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit. However, they had no formal bilateral meeting, with Mr Putin blaming it on scheduling and protocol. Mr Putin said he regretted that his talks with Mr Trump were too brief They had warm words for each other, with the US president talking of their mutual ""very good feeling"" and the Russian leader describing his counterpart as ""well-mannered... and comfortable to deal with"". They did manage to sign offa statement vowing to continue the battle against so-called Islamic State in Syriauntil the militants are defeated and calling for a political solution to the conflict. Last month,former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to having lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He testified that Russian nationals had contacted him in an attempt to gain influence with the Trump campaign, offering ""dirt"" in the form of ""thousands of emails"" on Mrs Clinton in April 2016 - two months before the DNC emails were leaked. The two leaders had three brief conversations in Vietnam Mr Trump has played down the importance of Mr Papadopoulos, calling him a ""low-level volunteer"" and ""liar"". On Saturday, Mr Putin brushed aside US media reports that a woman wrongly identified by Mr Papadopoulos as the Russian president's niece had offered to help broker meetings with Kremlin officials. ""I do not know anything about it and I think it is just some fantasies,"" Mr Putin said. Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and an associate were also placed under house arrest on charges of money laundering as a result of the Mueller inquiry, but the charges do not relate to the election.

"Sick children 'denied' out-of-hours careChildren with life-limiting illnesses are being denied out of hours care, according to a new report.4m5 minutes agoHealth","Hayley and Holly Smallman ""She can have up to 40 seizures a day - potentially each one could be dangerous."" Hayley Smallman's 15-year-old daughter Holly has a series of complex, life-limiting health conditions. Her cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease and epilepsy mean she needs 24-hour care at their home in Liverpool. It is estimated there are 40,000 children like Holly living with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions in England alone. Many of them need palliative care round-the-clock, which is largely provided at home by their families but with the support of community children's nurses and community paediatricians. Hayley says: ""I have a community matron and a community physio. They work Monday to Friday, 9am till 5pm. They are great."" But when it comes to out-of-hours and weekends, Hayley says she is left without any support. ""We don't have anyone through the night, we don't really have anyone at the weekend. ""I'm dealing with life-threatening situations, and if I make the wrong decision that could have a serious impact on Holly. ""I feel like I'm trying to do a job, but I'm not given the right tools to do the job, and I feel quite isolated and alone and scared sometimes. ""I'm not a clinician, I'm a mum. To have that support, it's like when somebody gives you that hug and says, 'it's going to be ok.' ""Sometimes we need that - it shouldn't be a luxury - it's a necessity."" Holly with her mum Hayley and dad Gary Hayley is not alone. BBC Radio 5 live Investigates has seen a new report by the charity Together for Short Lives which describes the commissioning of children's palliative care as 'patchy and inconsistent'. The charity submitted Freedom of Information requests to every Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) in England asking what services they commission for children who need palliative care. In all, 199 (94%) CCGs provided data. It revealed that, while nearly all CCGs commission community children's nursing teams, just two-thirds (67%) could say that they commission them to provide care out-of-hours and at weekends. If this support isn't in place, families say they have to call an ambulance or go to A&E. ""We know how much it disrupts Holly to take her into hospital because she's so comfortable at home,"" said Hayley. ""Also, because she is so immunocompromised, going into a hospital environment potentially brings more risk to her."" Liverpool CCG said it couldn't comment on individual cases, but that it did offer out-of-hours access to very high quality children's palliative care. Services are provided by Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust. Alder Hey said: ""The community children's nursing team is commissioned to provide an extended hours seven day service, but not 24/7. ""The community paediatricians do not provide a 24/7 service except for safeguarding."" Liverpool CCG added: ""It would not be appropriate for us to discuss details about an individual's care, but we would urge the family to raise any issues about their care with their provider in the first instance, or with us as a commissioner if they would prefer."" Following a review in 2015 into end-of-life care the government said that, where possible, children should be cared for at home with the support of community services. But this new research shows that only a third of CCG's in England could say they are implementing this commitment. Barbara Gelb, chief executive of Together for Short Lives, said the government should undertake a review of children's palliative care as a matter of urgency: ""It is not a nine-to-five job. A child's condition can deteriorate very quickly, and being able to call on a community service in the middle of the night is crucial to help families cope at these times. "" A spokesperson for NHS Clinical Commissioners, the membership organisation for CCGs, said it was encouraged that the report showed improvement in some aspects but acknowledged there was more work to be done. It added, ""Commissioners are having to make really difficult decisions on a daily basis about how to use the finite funding they have been allocated"". The  Department of Health has said it will look at the report's recommendations closely. A spokesperson said the NHS is expected to provide ""a personalised and dignified service"" that takes account of families' wishes. They added ""We recently published the government's end of life care commitment so that by 2020 there will be significant progress in patient choice, increased personalisation of care and improved quality and availability of services"". 5 live Investigates is broadcast on Sunday 12th November 2017 at 11am GMT.
