How is it going with those grand COP26 commitments?,"Is the progress that was made at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit already in jeopardy because of challenges in the year ahead? 2021 was a momentous year for climate change. As well as a host of extreme, destructive eventsinfluenced by rising temperatures, the past 12 months have seen unprecedented political engagement on the issue, culminating in the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November. Progress was undoubtedly madeand the overall thrust of the meeting was towards more rapid action on a whole host of measures to curb emissions. But there are now growing concerns that this momentum may dissipate over the coming months. The most grievous blow comes from the US. Thepotential failureof President Biden to get his Build Back Better act through Congress would significantly impact the ability of the US to meet the tough climate targets that the White House has committed to. It would also hugely affect the relatively unified approach to climate change on display among world leaders at COP26. ""Everything that Biden pledged, led to this relatively good atmosphere and a sense of momentum in Glasgow,"" said Dr Joanna Depledge, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance. ""But these were just promises, he needs to get the bill through Congress. And it's now looking increasingly dicey. He can do some things with executive orders, but that certainly isn't the kind of sustained institutional climate legislation change that we're really looking for."" ""I think the situation to us, is critical."" The despair among many in the US over the possible failure of President Biden's bill will also have knock-on effects throughout the world. This will certainly be the case in China, a country smarting from the perception that itflexed its political muscle in Glasgowto get its way. Biden's political difficulties with the bill are seen as more evidence that the ""West is declining"". COP26 President Alok Sharma feeling the emotional burden as the talks went deep into overtime ""I am worried 2022 will see a fuller display of geopolitical tension dominating the climate agenda,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace East Asia. He is also concerned that themooted introduction of carbon taxes on imported goods into Europecould elevate a sense of unfairness and frustration in Beijing. ""The Chinese side will see how they are treated vis-a-vis others and make its judgment on whether the game is fair, and most importantly, if it is about the environment at all, or just geopolitics and trade,"" he told BBC News. Overall, I am looking at a more turbulent year ahead. The years before the Paris agreement were an example of geopolitics helping the climate agenda forward. What lies ahead may be the opposite."" This pessimistic outlook is echoed by the fact that next year's COP is being held in Egypt, and the one after that in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). ""Neither of these countries could be described as climate leaders,"" said Prof J Timmons Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island, US. The good side is that COP27 will be in a developing country, and some issues like loss and damage [who pays for the impact of climate change in the worst affected countries, and how it is paid] may get more traction, but on the issue of emissions reductions, it's not clear that they're going to be leaders."" Another key concern heading into 2022 is that some countries may simply ignore aspects of the Glasgow climate pact that they don't like. One key measure in the deal was the request for all countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" their national climate pledges by the time delegates gather in Egypt late in 2022. Despite agreeing to this, a number of countries now say they simply won't update their plans, among them Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand's climate minister James Shawtold national media,externalthat this provision really only applied to large emitters like India, China, Russia and Brazil which hadn't significantly strengthened their plans in time for Glasgow. A deal to help South Africa away from coal could become the model for others However, there are also some positive developments in the offing that could make a significant difference to the general mood around climate change. During COP26, the UK, EU, US, Germany and Franceagreed to pay $8.5bnto help South Africa abandon coal. Now, those close to the negotiations say that two new deals to help India and Indonesia move away from the most carbon-intensive energy source are in the pipeline. These will be expensive, running into the tens of billions, but if they happen, they would represent a massive step away from fossil fuels. These types of arrangements, and the commitment to doubling adaptation finance made by richer countries will be key to progress in 2022, say officials. Another positive is that the UK's presidency continues right up to next November when Egypt takes over. COP26 President Alok Sharma has made it clear that he intends to push forward over the coming months in efforts to ensure that the agreements secured in Glasgow on deforestation, coal, finance and cars will start to be implemented. Mr Sharma's background as an auditor will come in handy in making sure there's no slippage over the integrity of the commitments made. ""The UK, as hosts of COP26, spent the last two years working tirelessly with countries to build trust, which ultimately allowed us to deliver the Glasgow climate pact,"" he told BBC News. ""We will continue in the same vein through 2022 to make sure countries keep their promises, re-visit their emissions reductions targets, get finance flowing, and deliver on the many commitments made during the two weeks of the summit."" Another positive is the fact that Germany will chair the G7 group of countries. The co-leader of the German Green party is now the country's foreign minister, so climate will remain high on the international diplomatic agenda. Infrastructure investment in the wake of the Covid pandemic, especially in middle income countries, also offers a great chance to lock in significant action to limit emissions. The final agreement on the rules for carbon markets, agreed in Glasgow, has coincided with a record rise in the price of carbon permits in Europe and the UK. While this has downsides, a sustained high carbon price could significantly speed up a transition to cleaner sources of energy. But, as ever, global events could see all these potential positives quickly pale. Disputes between Russia and Ukraine, China's disengagement and a drubbing for the Democrats in mid-term elections in the US could all derail or at least delay any further progress on climate change. And stalling or taking small steps right now would be a disaster for efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. ""Right now, incremental steps are a death sentence,"" said Prof Roberts. Floods in Malaysia at the end of 2021 had a severe impact on people and property However, the climate negotiations process is highly unpredictable - and even when things appear to be at their darkest, countries are often able to make sufficient compromises to keep things moving forward. Certainly the COP26 president says he's determined to push ahead and that the UK can be a role model for others. ""Leaving COP26 with the Glasgow climate pact was a historic moment demonstrating the world's shared commitment to taking real climate action,"" said Alok Sharma. ""As we look ahead, the most pressing issue is the timescale on when this action takes place and the reality is that the world needs to act at a much faster pace."" ""I believe we will reach a net zero world, and the UK is leading the way through our own actions such as rapidly expanding our renewables sector and working to eliminate the use of coal from our electricity generation in 2024, the question is whether that will be fast enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change.""

The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down,"The first time I saw Ghislaine Maxwell, I followed her from the door of her luxurious brownstone down the streets of Manhattan, asking her about the horrific allegations against her. Nearly a decade later, I saw her for the final time, in court and no longer able to run away from the truth about her life with Jeffrey Epstein. This is one of the most high-profile convictions of a woman for enabling a sex trafficking ring. And most importantly, it's a major victory for the more than 100 accusers who fought for more than a decade to have Epstein and his co-conspirators face criminal charges. The 60-year-old daughter of a British media tycoon has been found guilty of grooming and trafficking girls as young as 14 years old for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There were several powerful moments inside a packed courtroom in New York City, mainly from the prosecution which kept its case simple to avoid overwhelming the jury. Their aim was to show Maxwell was Epstein's partner in crime, a sexual predator whose modus operandi was clearly illustrated by four victims' experiences. Follow reaction to the verdict The prosecution's opening statement to the jury began with 11 words that sounded like the start of a children's book. ""I want to tell you about a young girl named Jane."" But for these women this was no fairytale. It was a nightmare and it was very real. How real became apparent the following day when Jane took the stand. She testified that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein approached her when she was 14 years old at a summer arts camp in 1994. Over the next two years, she said she was abused about every other week with Maxwell sometimes taking part. This was one of her key exchanges with prosecutors: Q. What was Maxwell's demeanour like during these incidents? A. I would say that it seemed very casual, like it was - like it was very normal, like it was not a big deal. Q. And when she behaved like that, how did that make you feel? A. Well, it made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me; I'd never seen anything like this or felt any of this, and it was very embarrassing.  You know, it's all these mixed emotions.  When you're 14, you have no idea what's going on. The other accusers would later recount similar experiences. Maxwell argued she was unaware of Epstein's abuse One of the most heart wrenching testimonies came from Carolyn, who testified under her first name. The woman was visibly broken down by years of trauma and addiction to pain killers and cocaine. She had been raped by her grandfather at four years old, dropped out of school in the 7th grade, and was neglected by a mother who abused substances. Carolyn told the court it was one of Epstein's most outspoken accusers Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, that first told her at 14 years old that she could make money by massaging a wealthy friend of hers. Carolyn met Ghislaine Maxwell when she showed up at Epstein's mansion in 2001. Maxwell, she said, told Virginia to take her upstairs to the massage room and ""show her what to do."" Prosecutors told jurors that by this time period, Maxwell had devised a pyramid scheme of abuse that no longer required her to personally find young girls for Epstein. Instead, they would reward vulnerable girls who brought someone new with extra cash. Carolyn was paid hundreds of dollars to ""massage"" Epstein on each of the over 100 encounters until she ""became too old."" She brought three other friends to Epstein. Carolyn said Maxwell once told her ""she had a great body for Epstein and his friends"" before touching her breasts. Maxwell was convicted on five counts: conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity conspiracy to commit sex trafficking sex trafficking of minors The teenage girls often came from troubled homes. Their families faced things like bankruptcy, substance abuse or previous sexual assault. And even when they didn't, Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein lured them in with friendship, gifts, and promises to help their careers or to pay for schooling. That ""grooming"" process, prosecutors said, was a key part of Maxwell's ""playbook."" She then used the ruse of massages as an excuse to get the girls to touch Epstein and to normalise sexual contact. Prosecutors said Maxwell would walk the girls into a room to be molested and abused, and sometimes was present ""to make it all feel normal and casual."" The two other accusers in the indictment were at or over the age of consent in the places the abuse took place, and therefore the judge ruled the sex acts weren't illegal. Still, Kate going by a pseudonym, and Annie Farmer who publicly identified herself, were equally compelling on the stand to prove Maxwell's grooming tactics. Key moments from trial Who is Ghislaine Maxwell? Ghislaine Maxwell's family had complained about her treatment in prison, saying it amounted to torture. Nevertheless, in court Maxwell was an extremely engaged and animated defendant. She carefully studied exhibits, looked witnesses in the eye, and often passed notes to her lawyers to convey her thoughts. She appeared to be in good spirits, hugging her defence team and blowing kisses and waving to her family in court. Her steely defiance was best captured when the judge Alison Nathan asked her if she would testify in her own defence. Instead of responding to the judge with a simple yes or no, she stood up and informed the court that there was ""no need"" for her to do so because the prosecution had not proven its case. Her defence case, in contrast, was less assured. Lawyers called on just nine witnesses over two days. Their strategy relied heavily on poking holes in the case brought by prosecutors, who bear the burden of proving the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt. This video can not be played Watch: The secret lives of Maxwell and Epstein The entire foundation of the prosecution's case rested on the four accusers' credibility. It is because their testimony was so convincing to jurors that Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted. Legal experts said attacking the women's memories and motives didn't help the defendant. ""Ghislaine Maxwell had the disadvantage of having to explain this parade of young girls who were coming in and out of the home daily underneath her supervision,"" says Mitchell Epner, a former prosecutor. ""She claimed she knew none of that. And when the jurors concluded that she was a liar, they concluded she was a predator."" Ghislaine Maxwell 'won't get fair trial' - brother One of the only pieces of physical evidence displayed in the courtroom was a green folding massage table taken from a police raid of Epstein's Palm Beach estate in 2005. It was an attempt from the prosecution to almost recreate the scene of the crimes right there in the middle of the courtroom. A retired police officer testified that they also recovered a box of sex toys. A hard drive recovered during a separate raid by the FBI of Epstein's Manhattan mansion contained emails sent by Ghislaine Maxwell to a staff member in which she complains that the house manager, Juan Alessi, did not tidy up Epstein's massage creams. That led the police to Mr Alessi, who provided some of the most damning and X-rated corroborating testimony in the whole trial.  Reporters covering the case had to hurriedly write notes to keep up with his startling revelations about the household. He told the court that Epstein would have three massages a day. When Mr Alessi would clean up after, he would put the sex toys back where they belonged, in a basket in Ghislaine Maxwell's closet, off the master bedroom she shared with Epstein. Mr Alessi said Epstein or Maxwell would sometimes direct him to contact and pick up young women for massages. He recalled seeing two underage girls that appeared to be 14 or 15 years old, Jane and Virginia Roberts. House rules, including in a 59-page manual, Mr Alessi said, told staff to be deaf, dumb and blind and forbade them from making eye contact with Epstein. ""There was a culture of silence. That was by design, the defendant's design, because behind closed doors, the defendant and Epstein were committing heinous crimes,"" Assistant US Attorney Lara Pomerantz said. This video can not be played Epstein accuser: Ghislaine Maxwell is a 'master manipulator' Police raids of Epstein's homes also produced intimate photos showing the duo's jet-setting, luxurious lifestyle and close connection. In one picture, the pair are seen relaxing at the Queen's Balmoral residence - when Prince Andrew reportedly invited the couple to the Scottish estate. In another, Ghislaine Maxwell is on a private plane with Epstein, massaging his foot and rubbing it against her cleavage. The staggering wealth on display from opulent properties in Palm Beach, New York and New Mexico only highlighted the vast power dynamics at play. The pair used wealth to lure and make young girls feel indebted to them. Several witnesses, including the four women, recalled how the duo would name drop their friends in high places, such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump or Prince Andrew, and display photos of them alongside the Pope John Paul II or Fidel Castro in their properties. None alleged any wrongdoing by Epstein and Maxwell's famous friends. These connections proved to be no insulation from justice and the conviction is a significant moment for people who are often found at the other end of the social ladder. ""This guilty verdict is immensely meaningful to sexual abuse victims everywhere,"" said Lisa Bloom, an attorney for eight of Epstein's victims. ""No matter who you are, no matter what kinds of circles you travel in, no matter how much money you have, no matter how many years have passed since the sexual abuse, justice is still possible.""

The downfall of a favourite daughter,"She was the toast of high society in London and New York. Now Ghislaine Maxwell has been sentenced to 20 years in jail for grooming and trafficking underage girls. Ghislaine Maxwell was born on Christmas Day 1961. Three days later, a car carrying her 15-year-old brother Michael crashed into a lorry along a foggy Oxfordshire road. Michael Maxwell would spend the remaining seven years of his life in a coma. Although she had been born into material abundance - her father was the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell - by every account, Ghislaine Maxwell's earliest years were disfigured by emotional neglect. Betty, her mother, later admitted in her memoir that after Michael's accident the baby ""was hardly given a glance"" by her devastated parents. One day in 1965, according to Betty, three-year-old Ghislaine Maxwell stood in front of her and declared: ""Mummy, I exist."" Betty also believed the toddler developed anorexia. To compensate, from this point both parents went to the opposite extreme and began lavishing affection on their youngest child. Robert Maxwell with seven of his nine children. Ghislaine Maxwell is pictured sitting on her mother's knee Though she was never spared the abuse and the rages her father would inflict on every one of his offspring, she would soon emerge as his favourite. And, Betty would later write in her 1994 memoir, that favourite daughter ""became spoiled, the only one of my children I can truly say that about"". The charges against Maxwell are so shocking - grooming and sex trafficking girls for abuse by the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein - it's tempting to look for an explanation in her dysfunctional childhood. But just as her crimes are impossible to excuse, Maxwell is a difficult woman to comprehend. For a life lived in public, the fine details of her biography have always been unusually elusive. Key moments in the sex trafficking trial How accusers' testimony brought Ghislaine Maxwell down What trial means for Prince Andrew Maxwell was raised in Headington Hill Hall, a vast Italianate mansion overlooking Oxford in the UK. Rather than buying it himself, her plutocrat father had somehow persuaded its owner, Oxford City Council, to rent it to him for a minimal sum in return for renovating the property. It was, he said, ""the best council house in the country"". Throughout Ghislaine Maxwell's childhood, lavish parties were thrown at Headington Hill Hall, with politicians, celebrities and media grandees in attendance. But after the VIPs had left the building it was a deeply emotionally austere place to grow up. Robert Maxwell had risen from extreme poverty in a Czechoslovak Jewish settlement - most of his family were murdered in the Holocaust - to become a British Army war hero, then an academic publishing magnate, a Labour MP and eventually owner of the Daily Mirror, one of the UK's biggest-selling newspapers. As a businessman, he was reviled as a bully. At home, meanwhile, he is depicted in Fall, John Preston's biography, as a ""draconian father"" who abused his children both physically and verbally. Robert Maxwell at a party on his yacht with daughter Ghislaine Maxwell and wife Betty, circa 1990 They would be interrogated at the dinner table about geopolitics or their plans for the future and reduced to tears if he considered their answers unsatisfactory. ""He would beat us with a belt - girls as well as boys,"" another of Robert's offspring, Ian, told Preston. Although his favourite, Ghislaine Maxwell wasn't immune from any of this. But while some of her siblings withdrew or rebelled, she was always anxious to please her father - she told Tatler in 2000 he was an ""inspiring"" parent - and dedicated herself to keeping him happy. It must have worked, after a fashion - Maxwell Snr later named his private yacht theLady Ghislaine, rather than after Betty or his three older daughters. And evidently, he had grand hopes for his youngest daughter - he apparently harboured ambitions of marrying her off to the late John F Kennedy Jnr. She was educated at Marlborough College and Oxford University, where she studied modern history and languages. ""It was very clear to me even as an undergraduate that she was interested in power and money,"" says the writer Anna Pasternak, who was a contemporary at Oxford and moved in the same social circles. ""She was one of those people at parties who always looked over your shoulder to see if there was somebody more powerful or more interesting while she was air-kissing you."" Rachel Johnson, the UK prime minister's sister and another Oxford contemporary, recently raised eyebrows when sherecalled,externalspotting Ghislaine Maxwell across the Balliol junior common room - ""a shiny glamazon with naughty eyes holding court astride a table, a high-heeled boot resting on my brother Boris's thigh."" After graduating, Maxwell's father appointed her as a director at Oxford United, the football club he owned and chaired, and also set her up with her own company supplying corporate gifts. But in the pages of Tatler or Nigel Dempster's Daily Mail gossip column, where she was now a regular fixture, she was usually described as a ""socialite"" rather than a businesswoman. She began dating Count Gianfranco Cicogna, an Italian aristocrat. She also founded a kind of private member's club exclusively for women. Pasternak attended on a few occasions and, while the idea seemed innovative at the time, she considered Maxwell an unlikely feminist champion. ""My recollection is that she was kind of breezily charming to other women, but I don't remember her being a very close friend of another woman,"" Pasternak says. ""I think that women weren't really important to her - only as a means to get to another powerful man."" In January 1991, after her father acquired the struggling New York Daily News, she was dispatched to its headquarters as his representative. It was her point of entry into the social scene of Manhattan. But in November that year, her world was upended. Her father vanished from the deck of theLady Ghislaineoff the Canary Islands and his body was later found floating in the sea. Ghislaine Maxwell flew straight to Las Palmas, where the yacht had been taken. By every account, she was inconsolable at the loss of her father. The day after his death, she was deputed to deliver an emotional speech to the world's press, who had gathered at the quayside. Ghislaine Maxwell, holding a framed photograph of her late father in Jerusalem, 1991 Soon enough it came out that Robert Maxwell had raided the Mirror Group's pension fund of Â£440m ($583m) as part of a scheme to artificially inflate the company's share price at the expense of 32,000 of his employees. Now the Maxwell family and the British government were left to pick up the pieces - the latter eventually paying Â£100m ($132m) towards a bailout of the fund. In June 1992, two of Robert's sons, Ian and Kevin, were arrested and charged with fraud. They were eventually acquitted in January 1996. While her father's guilt was obvious to most people, Ghislaine Maxwell continued to defend him. ""He wasn't a crook,""she told Vanity Fair's Edward Klein,externalin early 1992. ""A thief to me is somebody who steals money. Do I think that my father did that? No. I don't know what he did. Obviously, something happened. Did he put it in his own pocket? Did he run off with the money? No. And that's my definition of a crook."" While the rest of her siblings accepted Robert Maxwell's death was either an accident or suicide, his youngest daughter insisted he must have been murdered. Despite her protests, the fall-out from the Mirror pension scandal made the UK a less than welcoming place for her. In November 1992 it was reported that she had bought a $4,000 (Â£3,019) one-way Concorde ticket to New York. In 2005, Harry Mount was feeling lonely in Manhattan. Aged 33, he'd just been appointed as the Daily Telegraph's New York correspondent but, as yet, knew few people in the city. When a friend asked him if he wanted to tag along with him to a party at Ghislaine Maxwell's house, Mount jumped at the chance. She was, after all, well known as a prominent figure in Manhattan society who'd been photographed with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and even Pope John Paul II. Among the great and the good of US society, her cut-glass British accent and friendship with Prince Andrew marked her out as an exotic, alluring figure. When Mount arrived at her five-storey mansion on the Upper East Side, he was astonished when she bounded towards him and began bombarding him with questions. He recalls her listening intently to his replies as though he were the most fascinating person in the world. ""There was no reason why she should have been particularly friendly to me,"" says Mount, now editor of the Oldie magazine, where he haswritten about their encounter,external. ""She could well have frozen me out while being perfectly polite."" Mount assumed her effusiveness and charm were by-products of her troubled childhood. ""You end up with this mixture of great connections and confidence and you move among the great and the good - but fundamentally, you're not that sure of yourself,"" he says. ""And people who aren't sure of themselves are a bit nicer than those who often are."" It was only later that Mount realised there was something he had missed. Ghislaine Maxwell had reportedly been left with an Â£80,000 ($106,000)-a-year income from a trust fund. It should have occurred to him, he later reflected, that this amount wouldn't have been nearly enough to pay for her opulent house. Years later, prosecutors would suggest the property had been funded by Jeffrey Epstein. At that stage Mount didn't know about her connection to the well-known financier. But before long Epstein's relationship with Maxwell would be scrutinised by every journalist in the city. Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police Epstein had molested their daughter, and three years later he received an 18-month prison sentence. After his release, the allegations against him began to snowball. He was accused of running a ""vast network"" of girls for sex. He was arrested again in 2019 on charges of sex trafficking and died in his prison cell just over a month later. Inevitably the authorities' focus turned to Maxwell. Like her father, Epstein was an enormously wealthy man from humble origins - in his case, a working-class neighbourhood in Brooklyn. Also like Robert Maxwell, he would eventually be disgraced and die of an apparent suicide in disputed circumstances. Ghislaine Maxwell's relationship with Epstein was no doubt mutually beneficial. She could introduce him to her wealthy and powerful friends; he in turn had the capital to fund the kind of lifestyle she had grown up to expect. During the trial, as well as emphasising the pair's closeness, prosecutors noted that Maxwell ""was not a particularly wealthy person when she met Epstein"". Certainly, after she returned to New York in the wake her father's death, it was reported that she was working in real estate and living in a $2,000 (Â£1,500)-a-month apartment - a decent standard of living by any means, not least when the trust fund was taken into account, but nonetheless somewhat less than she might have been accustomed to. But the fine details of the relationship are not easy to pin down. When it began, how long it lasted and how exactly it should be characterised were all issues of contention at the trial, which has just concluded. Four charges in Maxwell's trial related to the period 1994-97, when the indictment stated that she was among Epstein's closest associates and also in an ""intimate relationship"" with him. By the 2000s, she was linked with another businessman, Ted Waitt. But it appeared that she carried on working for Epstein. By the time of a2003 profile,external, Epstein described Maxwell as his ""best friend"" and journalist Vicky Ward noted that much of his life appeared to be organised by her.Intimate photosof Maxwell and Epstein together released by prosecutors suggested they had remained close. In court documents, former employees at the Epstein mansion in Palm Beach described her as the house manager who supervised staff, looked after finances and acted as a social co-ordinator. A housekeeper testified that Maxwell gave staff a 58-page instruction manual and ordered them to speak only when spoken to, avoiding eye contact with Epstein. It's tempting to conclude that just as Maxwell learned to appease the whims of her capricious, bullying father, she applied those same skills on Epstein. Whatever the exact nature of their relationship, the prosecution portrayed their closeness as a crucial factor in their pattern of abuse - with Ghislaine Maxwell seeking out and grooming victims for Epstein. In December 2021, a jury found her guilty of five of six counts - including the most serious charge, that of sex trafficking of a minor. ""Ghislaine controlled the girls,"" Sarah Ransome, who says she was abused by Epstein, told the BBC's Panorama programme. ""She would be the one getting all the girls in check. She knew what Jeffrey likedâ¦ this was very much a joint effort."" In the months following Epstein's death, Maxwell went to ground. Newspapersspeculated as to her whereabouts,external. A photograph of her outside a Los Angeles branch of In-N-Out Burger appeared on front pages around the world. Then, in July 2020, she was arrested at her secluded mansion in the US state of New Hampshire. A few months later, it emerged to general surprise that she had married a tech CEO named Scott Borgerson. Maxwell was held at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn. While she waited for her trial to begin, her brother Ian told the BBC's Today programme that she was being held in a 6ft by 9ft (1.8m by 2.7m) cell with a concrete bed. ""She is under 24-hour, around-the-clock surveillance, with 10 cameras, including one that moves and tracks her movement,"" he said. ""She's not allowed to move into the corners of her cell and she's not allowed to be within two and a half feet of the cell door. That is her existence."" It was an ignominious fate for a woman who had spent most of her life surrounded by material riches. It was left to the prosecution to explain why on earth she would commit the crimes that had put her there. Prosecutors suggested money was an incentive. The journalist John Sweeney, who explored the case in his podcast Hunting Ghislaine and is writing a book about it, suggests a deeper psychological motive was at play. ""You can't understand what happened with Jeffrey Epstein without understanding her relationship with her father,"" he says. ""The truth is that Ghislaine learned to service her father and then had to service a second monster - that's what she's done her entire life."" Another similarity between Robert Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein is that both escaped a full reckoning for their crimes. And defence lawyers argued Ghislaine Maxwell was a scapegoat for Epstein - the age-old story of a woman taking the blame for the misdeeds of her partner. But Pasternak dismisses the idea that Maxwell is in any way less culpable than Epstein. ""There is absolutely no way that he could have had access to that many young girls, whose lives they've obliterated, without Ghislaine,"" says the author. While the trial was under way, Ian Maxwell wrote anarticle for The Spectator,externalputting across his sister's defence. It began with a reprimand to the media corps. They'd been pronouncing her name inaccurately, he said. It wasn't ""Jizlaine"". Instead, he insisted, it was ""Giilen"". For anyone following the case, it seemed remarkable that such a basic detail had been so consistently wrong. This was a woman, after all, who had lived her entire life in the news pages and gossip columns. But as the trial progressed it became apparent that so much that had been assumed about her - her relationship status at any one time, the source of her income, and, quite often, her whereabouts - were likely not as they seemed. Her crimes surely defy explanation, too. And for all that her rise and fall were conducted in public, Ghislaine Maxwell remains unknowable.

Police officer sacked over murder scene selfies,"PC Ryan Connolly was sacked after an investigation by Merseyside Police's anti-corruption unit A police officer who took selfies at a murder scene where a teenager was stabbed has been sacked. PC Ryan Connolly, who worked for Merseyside Police, also shared racist and homophobic pictures and took photos of mentally ill people being sectioned. Merseyside Police said the 37-year-old was sacked for gross misconduct after an anti-corruption investigation. Officers had found ""severely offensive"" photos taken between 2015 and 2018, the force said. The investigation found he had taken ""photographs of vulnerable people whilst on duty"" and his phone contained ""appalling homophobic, racist and offensive images"". The misconduct hearing was told he had taken a photo of the cordon at a murder scene where the teenager was stabbed in 2018 and shared a photo of a Ku Klux Klan member. PC Ryan Connolly's actions were described as ""deplorable"" Deputy Chief Constable Ian Critchley said: ""I am appalled by Connolly's actions, they are beyond comprehension and are not in keeping with the high standards and values that we expect here at Merseyside Police. ""Our officers carry out exceptionally brave selfless acts every single day, protecting the most vulnerable people in our communities, yet here we see the despicable acts of a very selfish individual who has no place in our police service. ""The behaviour of this officer is deplorable and serves to undermine the public's confidence and trust in the police. ""We are quite clear, if any officer is found to be behaving in a way that does not meet our high standards we will take swift and robust action."" Earlier this month, two Met Police officerswere jailed for taking photos of two murdered sistersand sharing the images on WhatsApp groups.

Who is Ghislaine Maxwell?,"After the death of US financier Jeffrey Epstein in jail, his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, came into the spotlight. Her trial on sex trafficking and other charges begins this week in New York City, where she has been jailed since her arrest in July 2020. She faces charges in the US after being arrested by the FBIon suspicion of having assisted Epstein's abuse of minors by helping to recruit and groom victims known to be underage. Four charges relate to the years 1994-97 when she was, according to the indictment, among Epstein's closest associates and also in an ""intimate relationship"" with him. Two other charges - of sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor - came in an amended indictment and relate to the period 2001 and 2004. Another two charges are allegations of perjury in 2016. She has pleaded not guilty on all charges. Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited, without the chance of bail, his trial on sex trafficking charges. Details of the allegations against Ms Maxwell emerged earlierin documents unsealed by a US judge,externalin August 2019 in a 2015 defamation case. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Ghislaine Maxwell 'won't get fair trial' - brother Virginia Giuffre, an alleged victim of Epstein, has accused Ms Maxwell of recruiting her as a masseuse to the financier at the age of 15. She sued Ms Maxwell in 2015 for defamation - a case which has since been settled - after the media heiress, daughter of the late newspaper tycoon, Robert Maxwell, said Ms Giuffre was a liar. Ms Maxwell denies any wrongdoing. The daughter of a disgraced newspaper tycoon, Ms Maxwell (R) is a well-connected socialite Another of Epstein's alleged victims, Sarah Ransome, has told BBC Panorama that Ms Maxwell worked closely with him. She said: ""Ghislaine controlled the girls. She was like the madam. She was like the nuts and bolts of the sex trafficking operation."" Ms Ransome said Ms Maxwell would visit Epstein on his private island in the Caribbean ""to make sure that the girls were doing what they were supposed to be doing"". She added: ""She knew what Jeffrey liked. She worked and helped maintain Jeffrey's standard by intimidation, by intimidating the girls, so this was very much a joint effort."" Ms Maxwell has previously denied any involvement in or knowledge of Epstein's abuse. Born on Christmas Day in 1961 outside Paris, Ms Maxwell is Oxford-educated and said to speak several languages, A well-connected socialite, she is said to have introduced Epstein to many of her wealthy and powerful friends, including Bill Clinton and the Duke of York(who was accused in the court papers of touching a woman at Jeffrey Epstein's US home, although the court subsequently struck out allegations against the duke). Buckingham Palace has said that ""any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors"" by the duke was ""categorically untrue"". Friends said that although Ms Maxwell and Epstein's romantic relationship lasted only a few years, she continued to work with him long afterward,the Washington Post reports,external. ""She had an upbringing and taste,externaland knew how to run a house and a boat and how to entertain,"" an acquaintance is quoted by the UK's Daily Telegraph as saying. ""You can't buy that. You can't buy access, either."" In a Vanity Fair profile published in 2003,Epstein said Ms Maxwell was not a paid employee, but rather his ""best friend"",external. In court documents, former employees at the Epstein mansion in Palm Beach describe her as the house manager, who oversaw the staff, handled finances and served as social co-ordinator, the Post reports. Ms Maxwell is the daughter of disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell, his ninth and youngest child. She is said to have had a very close relationship with her late father, and he named his luxury yacht - the Lady Ghislaine - after her. Ghislaine was said to be very close to her father, Robert Maxwell, who died nearly 30 years ago It was near this yacht that his body was found in the sea off the Canary Islands in November 1991. Although a verdict of accidental drowning was recorded, the mystery surrounding the circumstances of his death was never cleared up. The strange allure of Robert Maxwell,external He had succeeded in building a global publishing empire, but after his death, it emerged that  he had taken money from pension funds of his Mirror Group Newspapers to keep his companies afloat and boost the share price. Soon after her father's death, Ms Maxwell left the UK to settle in America, where she worked in real estate, and not long after met Jeffrey Epstein. She sold her Manhattan townhouse in 2016, and kept a low profile until she was arrested last July at her secluded mansion in the state of New Hampshire.

Scotland hits new daily Covid infections record,"A further 15,849 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland, by far the highest daily case number of the pandemic so far. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Omicron variant was spreading ""rapidly"" and now accounts for 80% of all cases. She said further ""steep increases"" in infections are expected in the coming days and weeks. However, no changes are to be made to restrictions in Scotland, with curbs expected to remain until 17 January. Ms Sturgeon also said a decision about whether to reduce the 10-day self-isolation period would be made in the coming week. Live: Holyrood recalled for Covid-19 update Scots urged not to travel to England for Hogmanay The daily infections record has been repeatedly broken in recent days as the faster-spreading Omicron variant takes hold in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said 28.9% of all tests carried out on Tuesday were positive, adding up to 15,849 cases - ""by some margin the highest overall daily case number reported in the pandemic to date"". The number of people in hospital with the virus increased by 80 to 679 - the highest since the start of December - with 36 in intensive care. The first minister said hospital figures were ""broadly stable"", but said the government must ""exercise caution"" given the time lag between rising case numbers and hospital admissions. She said the coming weeks would produce a ""clearer picture"" about the impact of Omicron, and that it was ""essential that we slow transmission as much as possible"" in the meantime. Scots have been asked to stay at home as much as possible in the coming weeks, and to socialise in groups of no more than three households. Large events have been cancelled and fresh restrictions placed on hospitality venues, with nightclubs closed entirely. Ms Sturgeon said these curbs were expected to continue until 17 January, and announced details of how Â£375m of financial support for businesses will be allocated. This includes Â£32m for hospitality and leisure firms, a further Â£10m for businesses ""most severely impacted by the requirement for table services"", Â£5m for nightclubs, and Â£17m for the events sector. What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Talks are also being held with the sports sector about the impact of the restrictions on large events like football matches. Ms Sturgeon said: ""There simply isn't an easy trade-off between protecting health and protecting the economy. ""If Covid continues to spread rapidly, the economic impact in the form of staff absences and diminished consumer confidence will be severe. We're already seeing those impacts. So doing nothing won't help business."" The data is jumping around a bit just now - in part because of reporting delays over Christmas but also strains in the system as more people come forward for tests. Almost 16,000 daily positive cases is probably in tune with the central estimates of modellers but we could still see a sharp rise over the next few days as the data starts to catch up. It may be that the worst-case scenario has been avoided because people have adapted their behaviour even before restrictions were brought in. For the first time in five days there is information on the numbers of people in hospital with Covid. It shows a small rise, but not a huge spike. Good news, but remember the early Omicron cases would largely be in young people who are less likely to become severely ill. We are still to see the impact of mixing across generations over Christmas. Early data from London, which is a little ahead of the rest of UK, show hospital admissions with Omicron are lower - even in older age groups - and that the number of people needing intensive care is even less. It also appears that many cases are incidental, with patients admitted for something else and then testing positive. But the experts continue to warn that even if Omicron is milder, a small proportion of a large number has the potential to cause major disruption for the NHS. Health and social care staff are exempt from 10-day isolation if they have a negative PCR test, but staff absences remain high, and it only takes a small increase in Covid patients for other care to be put on hold. We still don't know when the peak of this wave will hit, and how good boosters will be at protecting the most vulnerable.  Scientists will say it is still too early to draw any firm conclusions from the data. Ms Sturgeon also said ministers were ""weighing the risks and benefits"" of shortening the isolation period for Covid patients. People who test positive in Scotland have to isolate for 10 days, while those in Englandcan leave quarantine after seven daysif they record two negative tests. The first minister said consideration was being given to matching this, and to potentially easing the requirement for household contacts to isolate - something which is not required in England for double-vaccinated household contacts. She said any decision would be made in the coming week, and come into effect from 5 January. Nicola Sturgeon gave the Covid update to a virtual session of the Scottish Parliament The Scottish Conservatives have repeatedly called for the rules to be changed, saying they are causing staff shortages for key services. A total of 3,316 NHS staff were absent in the week to 28 December for Covid-related reasons, the highest level of absences since March and close to double the 1,771 recorded at the end of November. At Holyrood, Tory leader Douglas Ross called for immediate action, saying that ""the first minister's message on these essential changes is yet again to tune in next week"". Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar meanwhile called for the government to set out the scientific rationale for maintaining 10-day isolation whensome countries are cutting the requirement in half. He said: ""Staff absences are spiking now, and that is having knock on effects on our services and industries."" Ms Sturgeon said the decision was ""finely balanced"", saying that easing quarantine rules prematurely could actually increase pressure on the economy by spreading the virus faster.

How is it going with those grand COP26 commitments?Is the progress made in Glasgow in jeopardy from a rising tide of challenges in the year ahead?,"Is the progress that was made at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit already in jeopardy because of challenges in the year ahead? 2021 was a momentous year for climate change. As well as a host of extreme, destructive eventsinfluenced by rising temperatures, the past 12 months have seen unprecedented political engagement on the issue, culminating in the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November. Progress was undoubtedly madeand the overall thrust of the meeting was towards more rapid action on a whole host of measures to curb emissions. But there are now growing concerns that this momentum may dissipate over the coming months. The most grievous blow comes from the US. Thepotential failureof President Biden to get his Build Back Better act through Congress would significantly impact the ability of the US to meet the tough climate targets that the White House has committed to. It would also hugely affect the relatively unified approach to climate change on display among world leaders at COP26. ""Everything that Biden pledged, led to this relatively good atmosphere and a sense of momentum in Glasgow,"" said Dr Joanna Depledge, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance. ""But these were just promises, he needs to get the bill through Congress. And it's now looking increasingly dicey. He can do some things with executive orders, but that certainly isn't the kind of sustained institutional climate legislation change that we're really looking for."" ""I think the situation to us, is critical."" The despair among many in the US over the possible failure of President Biden's bill will also have knock-on effects throughout the world. This will certainly be the case in China, a country smarting from the perception that itflexed its political muscle in Glasgowto get its way. Biden's political difficulties with the bill are seen as more evidence that the ""West is declining"". COP26 President Alok Sharma feeling the emotional burden as the talks went deep into overtime ""I am worried 2022 will see a fuller display of geopolitical tension dominating the climate agenda,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace East Asia. He is also concerned that themooted introduction of carbon taxes on imported goods into Europecould elevate a sense of unfairness and frustration in Beijing. ""The Chinese side will see how they are treated vis-a-vis others and make its judgment on whether the game is fair, and most importantly, if it is about the environment at all, or just geopolitics and trade,"" he told BBC News. Overall, I am looking at a more turbulent year ahead. The years before the Paris agreement were an example of geopolitics helping the climate agenda forward. What lies ahead may be the opposite."" This pessimistic outlook is echoed by the fact that next year's COP is being held in Egypt, and the one after that in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). ""Neither of these countries could be described as climate leaders,"" said Prof J Timmons Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island, US. The good side is that COP27 will be in a developing country, and some issues like loss and damage [who pays for the impact of climate change in the worst affected countries, and how it is paid] may get more traction, but on the issue of emissions reductions, it's not clear that they're going to be leaders."" Another key concern heading into 2022 is that some countries may simply ignore aspects of the Glasgow climate pact that they don't like. One key measure in the deal was the request for all countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" their national climate pledges by the time delegates gather in Egypt late in 2022. Despite agreeing to this, a number of countries now say they simply won't update their plans, among them Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand's climate minister James Shawtold national media,externalthat this provision really only applied to large emitters like India, China, Russia and Brazil which hadn't significantly strengthened their plans in time for Glasgow. A deal to help South Africa away from coal could become the model for others However, there are also some positive developments in the offing that could make a significant difference to the general mood around climate change. During COP26, the UK, EU, US, Germany and Franceagreed to pay $8.5bnto help South Africa abandon coal. Now, those close to the negotiations say that two new deals to help India and Indonesia move away from the most carbon-intensive energy source are in the pipeline. These will be expensive, running into the tens of billions, but if they happen, they would represent a massive step away from fossil fuels. These types of arrangements, and the commitment to doubling adaptation finance made by richer countries will be key to progress in 2022, say officials. Another positive is that the UK's presidency continues right up to next November when Egypt takes over. COP26 President Alok Sharma has made it clear that he intends to push forward over the coming months in efforts to ensure that the agreements secured in Glasgow on deforestation, coal, finance and cars will start to be implemented. Mr Sharma's background as an auditor will come in handy in making sure there's no slippage over the integrity of the commitments made. ""The UK, as hosts of COP26, spent the last two years working tirelessly with countries to build trust, which ultimately allowed us to deliver the Glasgow climate pact,"" he told BBC News. ""We will continue in the same vein through 2022 to make sure countries keep their promises, re-visit their emissions reductions targets, get finance flowing, and deliver on the many commitments made during the two weeks of the summit."" Another positive is the fact that Germany will chair the G7 group of countries. The co-leader of the German Green party is now the country's foreign minister, so climate will remain high on the international diplomatic agenda. Infrastructure investment in the wake of the Covid pandemic, especially in middle income countries, also offers a great chance to lock in significant action to limit emissions. The final agreement on the rules for carbon markets, agreed in Glasgow, has coincided with a record rise in the price of carbon permits in Europe and the UK. While this has downsides, a sustained high carbon price could significantly speed up a transition to cleaner sources of energy. But, as ever, global events could see all these potential positives quickly pale. Disputes between Russia and Ukraine, China's disengagement and a drubbing for the Democrats in mid-term elections in the US could all derail or at least delay any further progress on climate change. And stalling or taking small steps right now would be a disaster for efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. ""Right now, incremental steps are a death sentence,"" said Prof Roberts. Floods in Malaysia at the end of 2021 had a severe impact on people and property However, the climate negotiations process is highly unpredictable - and even when things appear to be at their darkest, countries are often able to make sufficient compromises to keep things moving forward. Certainly the COP26 president says he's determined to push ahead and that the UK can be a role model for others. ""Leaving COP26 with the Glasgow climate pact was a historic moment demonstrating the world's shared commitment to taking real climate action,"" said Alok Sharma. ""As we look ahead, the most pressing issue is the timescale on when this action takes place and the reality is that the world needs to act at a much faster pace."" ""I believe we will reach a net zero world, and the UK is leading the way through our own actions such as rapidly expanding our renewables sector and working to eliminate the use of coal from our electricity generation in 2024, the question is whether that will be fast enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change.""

Scots urged not to travel to England for Hogmanay,"Scots have been urged not to travel to England for new year celebrations to get around the more stringent Covid-19 restrictions north of the border. There is no travel ban currently in place to stop people going to England, where nightclubs are still open. But Deputy First Minister John Swinney said doing so would go against the ""spirit"" of Scottish Covid-19 measures. He said travelling would be ""the wrong course of action"" due to the ""serious situation"" with the Omicron variant. Case numbers in Scotland hit ""alarming"" record highs over Christmas and Boxing Day, with the faster-spreading strain now accounting for the majority of all infections. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - who is to update MSPs in a virtual sitting of the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday afternoon - said she expected the figures to rise even more in the days ahead. Nicola Sturgeon warns Covid case numbers will rise Enjoy new year but be cautious, care minister says Scots have been encouraged to stay at home as much as possible, and to limit any social gatherings to no more than three households. Large events such as Edinburgh's traditional Hogmanay street party have been cancelled, withextra curbs in hospitality settingsand nightclubs shut down entirely. Clubs remain open south of the border, whereno new restrictions are being imposed, but Mr Swinney told BBC Breakfast that he would ""discourage"" anyone from travelling to England to see in the new year. He said: ""People are free to make their own judgments. But what we have got recognise is that Omicron is a serious threat to absolutely everybody within our society and we have all got to take measures to protect ourselves by limiting our social contacts and connections and by complying with the restrictions we have in place. ""I think it is the wrong course of action for people to take because we have a serious situation we have got to manage and we encourage everybody to play their part in addressing that."" People in England have been urged to be ""cautious"" while socialising, by taking lateral flow tests and sticking to well-ventilated areas. John Swinney said the Omicron variant was a ""serious threat"" Ms Sturgeon is to update MSPs on the latest data and plans when Holyrood is recalled from recess for a virtual sitting at 14:00. Mr Swinney said the current set of restrictions would be reviewed on 11 January, but warned that ""people can see with their own eyes the galloping pace at which Omicron is moving through Scotland"". He said ministers did not want to have curbs in place ""a minute longer than is necessary"", and praised people for a ""very significant level of public compliance and participation with the rules we have put in place"". The deputy first minister was also questioned about easing Scotland's self-isolation rules amid concerns that key services are running short of staff. People who test positive in Scotland have to isolate for 10 days, along with members of their immediate household, regardless of vaccination status. However in England, Covid patients can leave quarantine after seven days if they record two negative tests - and fully vaccinated household contacts are not legally required to isolate, but are ""strongly advised"" to test daily. What are the Covid self-isolation rules now? Opposition parties haveaccused Ms Sturgeon of being ""too cautious"" with the rules, calling for Scotland to move into line with England to allow more people out to work. Mr Swinney told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that ""active consideration"" was being given to reducing the quarantine period in Scotland  - but that this would need to be done based on health grounds, not economic ones. He said: ""The key question is whether or not the period required for self-isolation is necessary to ensure that we interrupt the circulation of the virus. That is the judgement that we will form based on the clinical advice and evidence presented to us. ""We serve nobody's interests well if we enable people to return to the labour market, to return to circulation in society, if they are still shedding the virus. That defeats the purpose of self-isolation."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland? LOCKDOWN:Six months that changed our lives CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

You can follow further updates to this story here. Today's coverage was provided by Bernd Debusmann, Max Matza, George Wright, Patrick Jackson, Jude Sheerin and Ritu Prasad. While Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted of five of
the six charges she faced, she is far from done with the legal process. She now faces up to 65 years behind bars. Judge Alison
Nathan, however, has yet to set a sentencing date. Her final sentence will be
up to the judge, who will also decide whether her sentences for each count are to be served
consecutively or concurrently. Maxwellâs defence team has said they will appeal the verdict. A successful appeal would require that they show that the
judge violated federal rules that somehow impacted the jurors as they came to a
verdict. While she waits for her sentencing date, Maxwell will remain
incarcerated in the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in the borough of
Brooklyn, where Maxwell has previously complained about conditions. Sarah Krissoff, a former prosecutor with the Southern District of New York, tells the BBC she expects ""a very significant prison sentence"" for Maxwell. ""Given the involvement of minors, the judge has really great discretion to impose a significant sentence, and based on the evidence that was presented at trial, frankly, I expect the judge to impose a very severe sentence upon her."" Nada TawfikBBC News, New York City A court sketch of Ghislaine Maxwell during her trial. This is one of the most high-profile convictions of a woman for enabling a sex trafficking ring. And most importantly, it's a major victory for the more than 100 accusers who fought for over a decade to have Epstein and his co-conspirators face criminal charges. Maxwell, the 60-year-old daughter of a British media tycoon, has been found guilty of grooming and trafficking girls as young as 14 years old for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There were several powerful moments inside a packed courtroom in New York City, mainly from the prosecution which kept its case simple to avoid overwhelming the jury. The entire foundation of the case rested on the four accusers' credibility. It is because their testimony was so convincing that Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted. Read Nada's full analysishere. Carolyn said she had been to Epstein's home hundreds of times Four women took the stand at Maxwellâs trial, testifying that they had been sexually abused by Epstein before they turned 18 and that Maxwell had urged, facilitated and participated in the abuse. Annie Farmerwas the only one who used her real name in her testimony. In court, she pointed at the defendant and accused her of groping her in a topless massage at age 16. Farmer also said Maxwell had neither said nor done anything as Epstein had groped her at a cinema. Janewas the first accuser to take the stand. She said she had been molested by Epstein from the age of 14, and that Maxwell had âinstructedâ her on how to massage Epstein, being ""casual"" about the abuse. Katewas another accuser - a British woman who said Maxwell had asked her if she knew any other ""cute, young pretty girls"" who could ""have sex with Epstein"". Kate alleged that the socialite had often called her a âgood girlâ and had even laid out a schoolgirl dress for her to wear for Epstein. Carolynsaid she had been to Epsteinâs Florida home âhundreds of timesâ between the ages of 14 to 18, with Maxwell calling to set up the massage appointments and then paying her afterwards. An ex-boyfriend of Carolyn corroborated the testimony, saying he had driven her to and from the home, and had seen the money. Ghislaine
Maxwell was one considered the toast of high society in London and New York. Born into a
life of opulence and privilege to publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell in 1961, Ghislaine
became anxious to please her overbearing father even as her siblings rebelled or withdrew
from family life. She later
defended him even after news that he had raided the Mirror Groupâs pension fund
of Â£440m ($583m) as part of a scheme to artificially inflate the company's
share price at the expense of 32,000 of his employees. âHe wasnât a crook,â she
told Vanity Fair in 1992. After learning
to appease her fatherâs whims, she did the same for Jeffrey Epstein. Read morehere. Ghislaine Maxwell sitting on her mother's lap in a family photo. Ghislaine Maxwell, holding a framed photograph of her late father, Jerusalem, Israel, 1991 Maxwell's lawyer, Bobbi Sternheim, has just emerged from court and delivered this brief statement. ""We firmly believe in Ghislaine's innocence. Obviously we are very disappointed with the verdict. ""We have already started working on the appeal and we are confident she will be vindicated."" Ghislaine
Maxwellâs legal troubles are not over. She still faces perjury charges for
allegedly lying under oath about her role in Jeffrey Epsteinâs abuses. The perjury
charges stem from accusations that she lied during a 2016 deposition for a
lawsuit filed against Epstein by one of the accusers, Virginia Giuffre. During the
deposition, Maxwell repeatedly said she was largely unaware of Epsteinâs abuses.
Federal prosecutors accused her of making âfalse declarationsâ. While the charges
were originally included in an indictment against Maxwell released after she
was arrested in July 2020, in April Judge Alison Nathan granted a request from Maxwellâs
attorneys to separate the charges from the rest of the counts. The perjury charges
each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Giuffreâs 2015
lawsuit against Maxwell alleged that Maxwell recruited her when she was still a
teenager and of trafficking her for sexual abuse between 1999 and 2002. Tara Palmeri, a journalist who spoke to witnesses and accusers in this trial, tells the BBC she thinks this conviction could be the ""tip of the iceberg"". Palmeri says Jeffrey Epstein used vulnerable women to recruit other victims, who may not have realised they were being manipulated. Watch the interview in full below. This video can not be played Maxwell case could be the 'tip of the iceberg' If you're just joining us, here's what you need to know: A large crowd of journalists is waiting outside the court from any further comment from the lawyers in the trial. Earlier, the federal prosecutors who tried the case were seen leaving the court. They gave no comment to reporters and showed no outward display of emotion. There has been some suggestion that one of Maxwell's lawyers may address the journalists on this chilly New York City evening. Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as family members, have repeatedly complained about her conditions in jail and her legal team has made several applications for bail, which so far have all been denied. Her siblings even filed a legal complaint to the United Nations calling her detention âarbitraryâ and her jail conditions âinhumaneâ. Earlier this year her brother Ian told the BBC the way she was being treated in jail was  ""degrading"" and ""amounts to torture"". He said she was being held under constant surveillance in a 6x9ft (1.8x2.7m) cell with no natural light, and the food was ""basically inedible"". Following her conviction, Maxwell faces the possibility of spending the rest of her life behind bars. This video can not be played Ghislaine Maxwell 'is losing her hair' in prison, says her brother One of Jeffrey
Epsteinâs accusers has said that the jury in the Maxwell trial has finally
given her justice after years of waiting. Virginia Giuffre,
38, claims that she was brought to the UK at the age of 17 to have sex with Prince
Andrew and has filed a civil case against him in New York claiming he abused her
â including once at Maxwellâs London home. He has denied
the charges. In a statement
following the news of the verdict against Maxwell, Giuffre said that her âsoul
yearned for justice for years and today the jury gave me just thatâ. âI will remember
this day always. Having lived with the horrors of Maxwellâs abuse, my heart
goes out to the many girls and young women who suffered at her hands and whose
lives she destroyed,â she said. Giuffre added
that she hopes the verdict is ânot the end but rather another step in justice
being servedâ. âMaxwell did
not act alone. Others must be held accountable,â she said. âI have faith that
they will be.â Ghislaine Maxwellâs relationship to Jeffrey Epstein - the disgraced US financier who took his own life in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial  - came into the spotlight after his death. A well-connected socialite, she is said to have introduced Epstein to wealthy and powerful figures, including Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. According to reports, Maxwell and Epstein's romantic relationship lasted only a few years, but she continued to work with him long afterwards. ""She had an upbringing and taste,externaland knew how to run a house and a boat and how to entertain,"" an acquaintance was quoted by the UK's Daily Telegraph as saying. ""You can't buy that. You can't buy access, either."" In a Vanity Fair profile published in 2003,Epstein said Ms Maxwell was not a paid employee, but rather his ""best friend"",external. She is accused of having assisted Epstein's abuse of minors by helping to recruit and groom victims known to be underage. Ms Maxwell denies any wrongdoing and has previously denied any involvement in or knowledge of Epstein's abuse. Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein in a photograph released by the US Attorney's Office Ghislaine Maxwellâs father, Robert Maxwell, was a controversial and ruthless newspaper baron, football club owner and onetime Labour MP. He became an outsized figure in British life but rose from very different circumstances. Born in a humble village in what was then Czechoslovakia,  he escaped poverty and Nazi persecution in Eastern Europe, fought alongside the British Army across Europe and eventually became one of the most powerful men in British publishing. In 1991, at age 68,  his body was found in the sea off the Canary Islands near his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine - named after his daughter. Although a verdict of accidental drowning was recorded, the mystery surrounding the circumstances of his death was never cleared up. He had succeeded in building a global publishing empire, but after his death, it emerged that he had taken money from the pension funds of his Mirror Group Newspapers. Of Ghislaineâs siblings, her brother Ian has been one of her more vocal defenders, recently telling the BBC he doubted his sister would get a fair hearing.

The prosecutionâs evidence against Ghislaine Maxwell was âoverwhelmingâ,
says Mark Richards, the trial attorney who successfully defended US teenager
Kyle Rittenhouse, who fatally shot two people during unrest in Wisconsin in 2020. âThey had Epsteinâs history. Most of the people in the US
know about some part of the history, so the defence had to overcome that, along
with I think a lot of evidence,â Richards told the BBC. âTheyâre salacious
charges.â Richards said that while the incidents detailed in court by
Maxwellâs accusers took place at various times and locations, there was âa certain
consistencyâ to them. âIf itâs one accuser, a jury is going to say she could be mistaken or could be lying,â he said. âBut when you start having four accusers with
corroborating evidence such as the pilots, some of the household staff, it
becomes overwhelming.â The duty of the defence team, Richards added, would have been to âcome
up with a narrative that at least equals the governmentâs.â âI donât think in this case they were able to put together a
narrative that runs counter sufficiently enough to cast reasonable doubt,â he
said.

""Nobody wants to go to court and testify in a sexual assault trial. Most people won't even call an attorneyâ¦ it takes extraordinary courage,"" she told the BBC. ""They did it because they wanted to get justice against Ghislaine Maxwell - convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, I can now say,"" she added. ""Itâs tremendously inspiring and it lifts up all survivors of sexual abuse."" She said survivors have reached out to her. ""Some of them have already reached out to me and said: 'Maybe I can really win in my case because now I see this is what has happened in Ghislaine Maxwell's case."" The Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in New York City During the monthlong trial, Maxwell's lawyers argued she was a scapegoat for Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, while prosecutors sought to link the duo as ""partners in crime"" running a ""pyramid scheme of abuse"".

Teresa Helm, one of Jeffrey Epsteinâs accusers has just sent us this statement, praising the women that testified during the trial. ""Justice takes the lead today,"" she says.

""Ghislaine Maxwell will never again have the opportunity to take anything from anyone. She will reside on the other side of freedom. ""Us survivors, we go free.""

Dershowitz himself was accused by Giuffre of participating in Epstein's sex ring. He has denied the allegations. The government ""didn't use as a witness the woman who accused Prince Andrew, accused me, accused many others, because the government didn't believe she was telling the truth"", Dershowitz told BBC News, in reference to Giuffre.

Warning over patchy Covid test supply,"Pharmacists are warning of patchy supplies of rapid Covid tests following changes to self-isolation rules. They said demand for lateral flow tests increased after changes allowed people with Covid in England to end isolation after seven days if they test negative. The Association Of Independent Multiple Pharmacies said staff and customers were stressed over the lack of supply. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said test availability is refreshed throughout the day. ""During periods of exceptional demand there may be temporary pauses in ordering or receiving tests, to ensure we manage distribution across the system"", it added. Labour said the situation was a ""total shambles"" and the government should help people ""trying to do the right thing"" by ordering tests. What are the rules for new year? How many cases are in my area Live updates: No plans to cut self-isolation further Omicron cases now constitute more than 90% of all community Covid cases in England, the UKHSA said on Wednesday. A total of 10,462 people were in hospital with Covid in England as of Wednesday morning, according to figures from NHS England. This is up 48% from a week ago and is the highest number of admissions since 1 March. Not all the patients in hospital will have been admitted for Covid - latest data suggests about three in 10 have the virus but were admitted to hospital for something else. The number of people with Covid in hospital has risen above 10,000 in England for the first time in nearly 10 months. There are currently 10, 462 patients with the virus in hospital. That is the highest level since the start of March - and means the numbers have risen by 2,000 in just two days. Admissions for Covid are rising, the weekly average is more than 50% higher than it was a week ago. But other factors are likely to have contributed to the increase, including a drop in the numbers being discharged. Last Christmas the numbers leaving hospital more than halved as it is more difficult to discharge patients over the festive period. It means there are likely to be hundreds of patients in hospital who have recovered from Covid but just have not left yet. The proportion of hospitalisations for what is known as an incidental admission is also growing and contributing to the increase. These are people being treated for something else, but happen to have Covid. Last week, these cases accounted for around three in 10 patients in hospital, but the expectation is this will have increased by now. But the numbers who are acutely unwell with Covid are still going up and it could be the end of January before they peak. Hospital cases are though rising more slowly than cases, once again showing the Omicron variant is leading to milder illness. The latest daily Covid case number stands at a record 117,093. Partial data from the UK nations means a full national picture will only be available again in the first week of January. The warnings about the supply of rapid lateral flow Covid tests come after several changes to self-isolation rules. Those who test positive for Covid can now leave home after seven days - as long as they test negative via lateral flow devices on day six and seven - in England. And fully-vaccinated close contacts of positive cases, including those in the same household, can go about their daily lives as normal with a daily negative lateral flow test in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Association Of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a very high demand for lateral flow tests since the changes. ""Every five minutes, approximately, somebody comes into the pharmacy and asks for tests,"" she said. ""But unfortunately because of the issues around supply being patchy and inconsistent it means that those who come forward for the test don't always get it, which is very stressful not just for the pharmacy but also for the patients."" Thorrun Govind, chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in England, said having an online collection code for lateral flow tests does not guarantee they will be in stock at a chemists. She also urged the public not to become angry with pharmacy staff and pleaded for patience amid the increased demand. This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson call for people to ""enjoy New Year in a cautious way... but above all get a booster"" The UKHSA said that the delivery capacity for lateral flow testing kits has doubled to 900,000 a day since 18 December, due to unprecedented demand. Lateral flow tests are alsoavailable to order online,externalfor delivery through Royal Mail - but many people have reported problems placing orders, with the website often saying ""sorry, there are no home delivery slots left for rapid lateral flow tests right now"". The UKHSA said ""exceptionally high demand"" for Covid PCR appointments - tests used to confirm a positive lateral flow result - could lead to temporary reduced availability in some areas but currently there are tests available to book online. ""We have made 100,000 more PCR booking slots available per day since mid-December and we are continuing to rapidly expand capacity, with over half a million tests carried out on 23 December alone."" The agency also said Christmas post schedules could be impact deliveries - but work and pensions minister Chloe Smith said people should ""persevere"" in their efforts to secure Covid tests. Separately, record demand for Covid PCR testshas left some people waiting up to five daysfor results in Scotland. In other developments: Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people who have not been fully vaccinated were ""eight times more likely"" to get seriously ill with Covid Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, said staff absence ""is a huge issue for the NHS right now"" Health Secretary Sajid Javidcriticised restrictions in Wales after group run organisers Parkruncancelled meets following the introduction of fresh Covid curbs there People in Scotland have been urged not to travel to England for new year celebrationsas doing so would go against the ""spirit"" of restrictions, the Scottish government says. Free-to-order rapid tests are seen as a crucial way to keep safe as Covid cases surge. Countries like the US have scrambled to follow the UK's lead in providing mass lateral flow tests free of charge. They are useful in showing whether a person is infectious - providing trustworthy results in just 30 minutes. They are used: To allow people with Covid to leave isolation after seven days - by testing negative on day six and seven - in England By those in close contact with Covid cases to avoid isolation through daily rapid testing in England, Wales and Northern Ireland To reassure people without symptoms they are not infectious before seeing vulnerable relatives or attending new year gatherings In secondary schools, which require regular rapid testing, as well as some workplaces There have been calls by some scientists and business leaders for the government to follow theexample of US health officialsand reduce the isolation period in England for people with asymptomatic Covid, to five days. But a government spokesperson said the current isolation period - which was recently lowered from 10 to seven days - remained ""critical for limiting the spread of the virus"". They said: ""There are no further changes to the isolation period planned at this time, but we keep all rules under review based on the latest health data"". Unlike Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the government has decided against introducing new Covid measures in England ahead of the new year.

Scotland hits another record cases high,"A further 15,849 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland, by far the highest daily case number of the pandemic so far. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Omicron variant was spreading ""rapidly"" and now accounts for 80% of all cases. She said further ""steep increases"" in infections are expected in the coming days and weeks. However, no changes are to be made to restrictions in Scotland, with curbs expected to remain until 17 January. Ms Sturgeon also said a decision about whether to reduce the 10-day self-isolation period would be made in the coming week. Live: Holyrood recalled for Covid-19 update Scots urged not to travel to England for Hogmanay The daily infections record has been repeatedly broken in recent days as the faster-spreading Omicron variant takes hold in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said 28.9% of all tests carried out on Tuesday were positive, adding up to 15,849 cases - ""by some margin the highest overall daily case number reported in the pandemic to date"". The number of people in hospital with the virus increased by 80 to 679 - the highest since the start of December - with 36 in intensive care. The first minister said hospital figures were ""broadly stable"", but said the government must ""exercise caution"" given the time lag between rising case numbers and hospital admissions. She said the coming weeks would produce a ""clearer picture"" about the impact of Omicron, and that it was ""essential that we slow transmission as much as possible"" in the meantime. Scots have been asked to stay at home as much as possible in the coming weeks, and to socialise in groups of no more than three households. Large events have been cancelled and fresh restrictions placed on hospitality venues, with nightclubs closed entirely. Ms Sturgeon said these curbs were expected to continue until 17 January, and announced details of how Â£375m of financial support for businesses will be allocated. This includes Â£32m for hospitality and leisure firms, a further Â£10m for businesses ""most severely impacted by the requirement for table services"", Â£5m for nightclubs, and Â£17m for the events sector. What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Talks are also being held with the sports sector about the impact of the restrictions on large events like football matches. Ms Sturgeon said: ""There simply isn't an easy trade-off between protecting health and protecting the economy. ""If Covid continues to spread rapidly, the economic impact in the form of staff absences and diminished consumer confidence will be severe. We're already seeing those impacts. So doing nothing won't help business."" The data is jumping around a bit just now - in part because of reporting delays over Christmas but also strains in the system as more people come forward for tests. Almost 16,000 daily positive cases is probably in tune with the central estimates of modellers but we could still see a sharp rise over the next few days as the data starts to catch up. It may be that the worst-case scenario has been avoided because people have adapted their behaviour even before restrictions were brought in. For the first time in five days there is information on the numbers of people in hospital with Covid. It shows a small rise, but not a huge spike. Good news, but remember the early Omicron cases would largely be in young people who are less likely to become severely ill. We are still to see the impact of mixing across generations over Christmas. Early data from London, which is a little ahead of the rest of UK, show hospital admissions with Omicron are lower - even in older age groups - and that the number of people needing intensive care is even less. It also appears that many cases are incidental, with patients admitted for something else and then testing positive. But the experts continue to warn that even if Omicron is milder, a small proportion of a large number has the potential to cause major disruption for the NHS. Health and social care staff are exempt from 10-day isolation if they have a negative PCR test, but staff absences remain high, and it only takes a small increase in Covid patients for other care to be put on hold. We still don't know when the peak of this wave will hit, and how good boosters will be at protecting the most vulnerable.  Scientists will say it is still too early to draw any firm conclusions from the data. Ms Sturgeon also said ministers were ""weighing the risks and benefits"" of shortening the isolation period for Covid patients. People who test positive in Scotland have to isolate for 10 days, while those in Englandcan leave quarantine after seven daysif they record two negative tests. The first minister said consideration was being given to matching this, and to potentially easing the requirement for household contacts to isolate - something which is not required in England for double-vaccinated household contacts. She said any decision would be made in the coming week, and come into effect from 5 January. Nicola Sturgeon gave the Covid update to a virtual session of the Scottish Parliament The Scottish Conservatives have repeatedly called for the rules to be changed, saying they are causing staff shortages for key services. A total of 3,316 NHS staff were absent in the week to 28 December for Covid-related reasons, the highest level of absences since March and close to double the 1,771 recorded at the end of November. At Holyrood, Tory leader Douglas Ross called for immediate action, saying that ""the first minister's message on these essential changes is yet again to tune in next week"". Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar meanwhile called for the government to set out the scientific rationale for maintaining 10-day isolation whensome countries are cutting the requirement in half. He said: ""Staff absences are spiking now, and that is having knock on effects on our services and industries."" Ms Sturgeon said the decision was ""finely balanced"", saying that easing quarantine rules prematurely could actually increase pressure on the economy by spreading the virus faster.

Changes to Covid testing due to record PCR demand,"Close contacts who are fully-vaccinated are no longer required to isolate until receiving a PCR result New Covid-19 testing measures have been put in place to cope with the rise in demand for PCR tests due to the Omicron variant. The Public Health Agency (PHA) has urged members of the public to only book PCR tests when necessary. Fully-vaccinated people identified as close contacts are now advised to take daily lateral flow tests for 10 days following their exposure to the virus. They should only book a PCR if a lateral flow is positive. Unvaccinated people will have to continue to self-isolate for 10 days. However, the PHA has stressed that those displaying symptoms should book a PCR test as soon as possible. Previously, close contacts of a confirmed case of Covid-19 were told to self-isolate and get a PCR test, even if fully vaccinated. PCR tests have been taken by record numbers of people in Northern Ireland this week, according to the PHA. The agency said more than 21,000 tests were carried out on 27 December alone. Recently people have been finding it difficult to secure an in-person PCR slot using the UK's official booking website. Demand for lateral flow tests has quadrupled in some cases, according to Community Pharmacy NI The PHA's deputy director of public health said the testing model was being adapted to make sure ""people with symptoms can get tested in a timely way for the next fortnight"". ""As Omicron continues to spread in Northern Ireland, we are seeing the expected rapid increase in the number of people going for PCR testing,"" said Dr BrÃ­d Farrell. ""While this shows that people are taking the issue seriously, and we thank them for that, it is also important that we protect the testing system so that those who need to be tested by PCR can get it."" Children under five years of age are no longer required to take a PCR test - even if they have symptoms like a cough or temperature - unless advised to by a doctor. The PHA has encouraged parents to instead carry out a lateral flow test on children, and to only seek a PCR test if the lateral flow returns a positive result. Lateral flow tests show results in 20 to 30 minutes, while PCR test swabs must be sent to a lab for analysis. Omicron and Delta driving case tsunami - WHO What are the rules in Northern Ireland? Warning over patchy lateral flow Covid test supply The changes in the testing system, which came into effect at midday, come as14 more Covid-19-related deaths were recorded in Northern Irelandby the Department of Health on Wednesday. The deaths occurred in the period between midnight on 23 December and midnight on 28 December. During that time, the department reported there had been 22,972 positive cases of coronavirus. This was more than double the 11,348 cases reported during the comparable five-day period the previous week. Earlier, the chief executive of Community Pharmacy NI called on the Department of Health to help ramp up the supply of Covid-19 tests to pharmacies. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Gerard Greene said demand for lateral flow tests had outstripped supply but pharmacies in Northern Ireland would be replenished with stock in the coming days. The Department of Health recommends people take regular rapid lateral flow tests twice-weekly He said that in some cases demand for tests had quadrupled in line with the current public health messaging around self-isolation and testing. The Department of Healthrecommends people take regular rapid lateral flow tests twice-weekly,external, particularly if they are planning to mix with others outside of their household. People who test positive in Northern Ireland are required to self-isolate for at least 10 days from when their symptoms started. Northern Ireland's vaccination centres, for first, second and booster jabs,have remained open during the Christmas period,external. The Western Health Trust has announced it is temporarily suspending visiting on all its sites and facilities, which include Altnagelvin Area Hospital and the South West Acute Hospital. The suspension will apply from midnight and is to be reviewed on Friday. The trust said it had taken the decision due to continued pressures on its hospitals and care facilities, and the general increase in Covid transmission in the community. Some theatres have chosen to cancel performances due to Covid-19 Meanwhile, some theatres in Northern Ireland cancelled their remaining Christmas performances due to Covid-19. Theatre companies said more financial support is needed from the executive to pay staff wages after cancellations. The MAC theatre in Belfast said it took the decision not go ahead with its remaining shows of The Untold Truth of Captain Hook. The theatre said it would be closed until 5 January due to the impact of Covid-19. The Waterfront Hall pulled all remaining performances of its pantomime Cinderella and adult pantomime Cinder on Tinder. Producer Liam McMullan, from GBL Productions, said he has had to cancel 30 performances with about 350 people booked in per show. The cast performed 37 shows before the cancellation and Mr McMullan said it cost between Â£50,000 and Â£70,000 to put on a production. How do you socially distance as a panto horse?

MP releases photograph of death threat letter,"An image of the note has been shared to help identify the handwriting A Welsh MP has released a photograph of a death threat that was sent to her office. The handwritten note saying ""traitors hang"", with an image of a noose, was sent to Ynys MÃ´n MP Virginia Crosbie's Holyhead constituency office on 23 December. Ms Crosbie said North Wales Police was investigating. Sharing a photo of the note, she asked people to call the police immediately if they recognised the handwriting. The letter was opened by a member of staff and Ms Crosbie said such threats required a zero tolerance approach. ""I will not be stopped from doing the job I was elected to do by the people of Anglesey and the coward or cowards who sent this note will not undermine democracy,"" said Ms Crosbie. ""Too many times this sort of behaviour is tolerated but not by me. I will call out and relentlessly use all the avenues available to pursue all those who threaten myself, my family and my staff."" Death threat to Welsh MP after plea for kindness 'Every MP has had vile threats to their lives' MP death threat over 'kiss ginger' line Virginia Crosbie won the Ynys MÃ´n seat at the 2019 general election Thanking the police for taking the matter so seriously, she added: ""This corrosive behaviour is harming democracy and stopping people, especially women, from standing for public office. It has no place in our society and my approach remains one of zero tolerance. ""It's absolutely vital in a democratic society that we have disagreements and debate, not death threats. ""I would like to praise my staff for all the work they do, including having to see this sort of cowardly communication when they are opening the post. They shouldn't have to.""

"Scotland hits new daily Covid infections recordA further 15,849 cases of Covid-19 are reported in Scotland as the Omicron variant spreads.Scotland politics","A further 15,849 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland, by far the highest daily case number of the pandemic so far. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Omicron variant was spreading ""rapidly"" and now accounts for 80% of all cases. She said further ""steep increases"" in infections are expected in the coming days and weeks. However, no changes are to be made to restrictions in Scotland, with curbs expected to remain until 17 January. Ms Sturgeon also said a decision about whether to reduce the 10-day self-isolation period would be made in the coming week. Live: Holyrood recalled for Covid-19 update Scots urged not to travel to England for Hogmanay The daily infections record has been repeatedly broken in recent days as the faster-spreading Omicron variant takes hold in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said 28.9% of all tests carried out on Tuesday were positive, adding up to 15,849 cases - ""by some margin the highest overall daily case number reported in the pandemic to date"". The number of people in hospital with the virus increased by 80 to 679 - the highest since the start of December - with 36 in intensive care. The first minister said hospital figures were ""broadly stable"", but said the government must ""exercise caution"" given the time lag between rising case numbers and hospital admissions. She said the coming weeks would produce a ""clearer picture"" about the impact of Omicron, and that it was ""essential that we slow transmission as much as possible"" in the meantime. Scots have been asked to stay at home as much as possible in the coming weeks, and to socialise in groups of no more than three households. Large events have been cancelled and fresh restrictions placed on hospitality venues, with nightclubs closed entirely. Ms Sturgeon said these curbs were expected to continue until 17 January, and announced details of how Â£375m of financial support for businesses will be allocated. This includes Â£32m for hospitality and leisure firms, a further Â£10m for businesses ""most severely impacted by the requirement for table services"", Â£5m for nightclubs, and Â£17m for the events sector. What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Talks are also being held with the sports sector about the impact of the restrictions on large events like football matches. Ms Sturgeon said: ""There simply isn't an easy trade-off between protecting health and protecting the economy. ""If Covid continues to spread rapidly, the economic impact in the form of staff absences and diminished consumer confidence will be severe. We're already seeing those impacts. So doing nothing won't help business.""

Warning over patchy lateral flow Covid test supply,"Pharmacists are warning of patchy supplies of rapid Covid tests following changes to self-isolation rules. They said demand for lateral flow tests increased after changes allowed people with Covid in England to end isolation after seven days if they test negative. The Association Of Independent Multiple Pharmacies said staff and customers were stressed over the lack of supply. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said test availability is refreshed throughout the day. ""During periods of exceptional demand there may be temporary pauses in ordering or receiving tests, to ensure we manage distribution across the system"", it added. Labour said the situation was a ""total shambles"" and the government should help people ""trying to do the right thing"" by ordering tests. What are the rules for new year? How many cases are in my area Live updates: No plans to cut self-isolation further Omicron cases now constitute more than 90% of all community Covid cases in England, the UKHSA said on Wednesday. A total of 10,462 people were in hospital with Covid in England as of Wednesday morning, according to figures from NHS England. This is up 48% from a week ago and is the highest number of admissions since 1 March. Not all the patients in hospital will have been admitted for Covid - latest data suggests about three in 10 have the virus but were admitted to hospital for something else. The number of people with Covid in hospital has risen above 10,000 in England for the first time in nearly 10 months. There are currently 10, 462 patients with the virus in hospital. That is the highest level since the start of March - and means the numbers have risen by 2,000 in just two days. Admissions for Covid are rising, the weekly average is more than 50% higher than it was a week ago. But other factors are likely to have contributed to the increase, including a drop in the numbers being discharged. Last Christmas the numbers leaving hospital more than halved as it is more difficult to discharge patients over the festive period. It means there are likely to be hundreds of patients in hospital who have recovered from Covid but just have not left yet. The proportion of hospitalisations for what is known as an incidental admission is also growing and contributing to the increase. These are people being treated for something else, but happen to have Covid. Last week, these cases accounted for around three in 10 patients in hospital, but the expectation is this will have increased by now. But the numbers who are acutely unwell with Covid are still going up and it could be the end of January before they peak. Hospital cases are though rising more slowly than cases, once again showing the Omicron variant is leading to milder illness. The latest daily Covid case number stands at a record 117,093. Partial data from the UK nations means a full national picture will only be available again in the first week of January. The warnings about the supply of rapid lateral flow Covid tests come after several changes to self-isolation rules. Those who test positive for Covid can now leave home after seven days - as long as they test negative via lateral flow devices on day six and seven - in England. And fully-vaccinated close contacts of positive cases, including those in the same household, can go about their daily lives as normal with a daily negative lateral flow test in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Association Of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a very high demand for lateral flow tests since the changes. ""Every five minutes, approximately, somebody comes into the pharmacy and asks for tests,"" she said. ""But unfortunately because of the issues around supply being patchy and inconsistent it means that those who come forward for the test don't always get it, which is very stressful not just for the pharmacy but also for the patients."" Thorrun Govind, chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in England, said having an online collection code for lateral flow tests does not guarantee they will be in stock at a chemists. She also urged the public not to become angry with pharmacy staff and pleaded for patience amid the increased demand. This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson call for people to ""enjoy New Year in a cautious way... but above all get a booster"" The UKHSA said that the delivery capacity for lateral flow testing kits has doubled to 900,000 a day since 18 December, due to unprecedented demand. Lateral flow tests are alsoavailable to order online,externalfor delivery through Royal Mail - but many people have reported problems placing orders, with the website often saying ""sorry, there are no home delivery slots left for rapid lateral flow tests right now"". The UKHSA said ""exceptionally high demand"" for Covid PCR appointments - tests used to confirm a positive lateral flow result - could lead to temporary reduced availability in some areas but currently there are tests available to book online. ""We have made 100,000 more PCR booking slots available per day since mid-December and we are continuing to rapidly expand capacity, with over half a million tests carried out on 23 December alone."" The agency also said Christmas post schedules could be impact deliveries - but work and pensions minister Chloe Smith said people should ""persevere"" in their efforts to secure Covid tests. Separately, record demand for Covid PCR testshas left some people waiting up to five daysfor results in Scotland. In other developments: Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people who have not been fully vaccinated were ""eight times more likely"" to get seriously ill with Covid Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, said staff absence ""is a huge issue for the NHS right now"" Health Secretary Sajid Javidcriticised restrictions in Wales after group run organisers Parkruncancelled meets following the introduction of fresh Covid curbs there People in Scotland have been urged not to travel to England for new year celebrationsas doing so would go against the ""spirit"" of restrictions, the Scottish government says. Free-to-order rapid tests are seen as a crucial way to keep safe as Covid cases surge. Countries like the US have scrambled to follow the UK's lead in providing mass lateral flow tests free of charge. They are useful in showing whether a person is infectious - providing trustworthy results in just 30 minutes. They are used: To allow people with Covid to leave isolation after seven days - by testing negative on day six and seven - in England By those in close contact with Covid cases to avoid isolation through daily rapid testing in England, Wales and Northern Ireland To reassure people without symptoms they are not infectious before seeing vulnerable relatives or attending new year gatherings In secondary schools, which require regular rapid testing, as well as some workplaces There have been calls by some scientists and business leaders for the government to follow theexample of US health officialsand reduce the isolation period in England for people with asymptomatic Covid, to five days. But a government spokesperson said the current isolation period - which was recently lowered from 10 to seven days - remained ""critical for limiting the spread of the virus"". They said: ""There are no further changes to the isolation period planned at this time, but we keep all rules under review based on the latest health data"". Unlike Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the government has decided against introducing new Covid measures in England ahead of the new year.

"UK cost of living squeeze in 2022, says think tank","Millions of families are facing a ""year of the squeeze"" in 2022, a think tank has warned. The Resolution Foundation predicts higher energy bills, stagnant wages and tax rises could leave households with a Â£1,200 a year hit to their incomes. Itsreport,externalhighlights the rise in the energy price cap and National Insurance contributions in April. The government says it has put Â£4.2bn in place to support families. According to the Resolution Foundation, millions of families are facing a ""cost-of-living catastrophe"" next year. It says a 1.25% increase in National Insurance contributions will cost the average household Â£600 a year while the higher energy bills cap is expected to add an additional Â£500 to spending. Both will come into force in April. The impact of the failure of many firms in the energy sector would see another Â£100 added to gas and electricity bills. Customers of collapsed energy companies have been shifted to new suppliers but it means they could pay a different - and potentially more expensive - tariff than their previous energy deal. UK prices rise at fastest rate in 10 years National Insurance: Whatâs the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? Urgent action needed on energy prices - Ovo boss In recent months, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. Last week, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about Â£2,000 next year. Earlier this week, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng met bosses from the UK's energy companies and the industry's regulator Ofgem ""to discuss the ongoing effects of record high global gas prices on the sector"". Labour has suggested the government immediately remove VAT from household energy bills over winter to help households. Stephen Fitzpatrick, chief executive of Ovo Energy, who attended the virtual meeting on Monday, also suggested the government should remove ""some of the environmental social policy costs that we have seen increase over the years"". Meanwhile, the cost of living in the UK surged by 5.1% in the 12 months to November - the highest increase in 10 years - Office for National Statistics data showed. Inflation is set to peak at 6% in the spring, according to the Bank of England, and the Resolution Foundation warned that real wage growth, which was flat in October, ""almost certainly started falling last month and is unlikely to start growing again until the final quarter of 2022"". Resolution Foundation chief executive Torsten Bell, said: ""The overall picture is likely to be one of prices surging and pay packets stagnating."" He told the BBC that the UK employment market had shown signs of resilience during the pandemic following the end of the government's furlough scheme on 30 September, with the unemployment rate close to pre-Covid levels at 4.2%. He also highlighted that the national living wage will rise in April, by 6.6%, which he said means ""the lowest earners will be protected from some of these price rises we are seeing"". However, Mr Bell said that while some areas of the workforce have seen sharp wage rises - such as in-demand HGV drivers - ""overall the story is prices going up for everybody while wages go up for some"". Mr Bell said Chancellor Rishi Sunak could face increased pressure to take action to alleviatehis economic plan set out in the Autumn Budget. The report by the foundation says that poorer families are going to be the worse hit by the ""year of the squeeze"", as they spend a higher proportion of their income on energy. A government spokesman said its help included reducing the Universal Credit taper, as well as measures to assist with bills, including cold weather payments and a freeze in alcohol and fuel duty.

Today's contributors to the live page were Jen Meierhans, Jack Hunter, Becky Morton, Joshua Cheetham, Claire Heald and James Clarke. As ever, you can follow any major developments on the news site - just go to thefront page. And for more in-depth coverage, you can go to our dedicated coronavirus sectionhere. We'll be back with more updates tomorrow. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus stories from the UK and around the world:  Seattle police are investigating after a bar patron attacked a bartender when they were asked for proof of vaccination. In a statement, police said the suspect slashed the worker's face with a sharpened broomstick, and is still at large. The bartender, Felicite Ogilvy, told local outlet KOMO the man said he'd received one vaccine dose, but didn't have his proof of vaccine card. After an argument, some of Ogilvy's coworkers tried to calm the situation, according to KOMO, but the man allegedly attacked her with the broomstick. In light of the incident, Ogilvy says she doesn't agree with having to enforce Covid restrictions. ""Why am I getting hurt?"" she asks. ""Why am I the one who has to control this?"" Scenes like this have been common recently... Pharmacists have been warning of patchy supplies of rapid Covid tests after an increase in demand. Jane, from Yeovil, said she had tried five pharmacies and none had any lateral flow tests available, while she was also unable to order any online from the government website. She told the BBC she needed the tests to visit family in Gloucestershire and had been forced to borrow testing kits from them and sit outside their house in the car waiting for a result. Jane also volunteers at her local hospital and needs to take a test to do so. We've got a little bit more detail on the figures we've brought you in the past hour showing there are more people in hospital in England with coronavirus than there have been at any time since March. A total of 10,462 people were in hospital with the virus as of 08:00 GMT this morning. During the second wave, the figure peaked at 34,336 on 18 January. In London, 3,310 people were in hospital with Covid-19 this morning, up 63% on the previous week and the highest number since 16 February. The second-wave peak for London was 7,917 on 18 January. While we're talking about coronavirus statistics, it's worth mentioning there's been a delay to today's UK-wide Covid data, which we usually bring you at about 16:00. But we'll have updates on today's reported cases and deaths if they are published before we go. And if not, you'll be able to see those details elsewhere on our site when they are available. More companies have cancelled in-person appearances at next month's CES technology industry trade show, amid concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant. The latest to withdraw are chip maker AMD and PC manufacturer MSI. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Intel and Microsoft have already said they will not attend in person. Organisers had hoped January's event - one of the industry's most important showcases of new consumer gadgets - could return to close to normal. Attendees must be fully vaccinated, wear masks and have been asked to test themselves for Covid within the 24-hour period prior to entering one of the exhibition venues. Social-distancing measures will also be in place. Read more. As China battles with Covid outbreaks, four people accused of people trafficking have been paraded through the streets of Jingxi, in Guangxi province. Images and video of the incident, which took place on 28 December, show four men in hazmat suits and face shields being escorted through the city by police. They were carrying placards displaying their names and photos. Some people could be seen watching the event unfold. China's borders are largely closed due to the pandemic, as it attempts to tackle a new Covid wave. State-run Guangxi Daily said the disciplinary action against the men helped to deterr border-related crimes andencouraged compliance with epidemic prevention and control.,external The shaming drew mixed reactions online, including in state-owned media. Read more here. More than a third of London's fire engines were out of action on Christmas Day as hundreds of staff were being forced to isolate, according to the London Fire Brigade. Fifty fire engines out of a total of 142 were affected during the day shift on 25 December, with 42 affected the previous day. Some 740 operational firefighters in the capital had tested positive or were self-isolating on 27 December, meaning 15% were unable to work, according to the latest figures. The figure is up from 10% on 16 December. The Fire Brigades Union London regional secretary Jon Lambe says: âOmicron is directly affecting the level of fire and rescue cover Londoners receive: over a third of fire engines being unavailable is a huge shortage that could have serious impacts."" London was the first area of the UK to be hit by Omicron and the high number of cases has also led to staff shortages in other sectors, such as the NHS. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of people with Covid in hospital has risen above
10,000 in England for the first time in nearly 10 months. There are currently 10,462 patients with the virus in
hospital. That is the highest level since the start of March â and
means the numbers have risen by 2,000 in just two days. Admissions for Covid are rising, the weekly average is
more than 50% higher than it was a week ago. But other factors are likely to have contributed to the
increase, including a drop in the numbers being discharged. Last Christmas the numbers leaving hospital more than halved, as it is more difficult to discharge patients over the festive period. It means there are likely to be
hundreds of patients in hospital who have recovered from Covid but just have
not left yet. The proportion of hospitalisations
for what is known as an incidental admission is also growing and contributing
to the increase. These are people being treated for something else, but who just
happen to have Covid. Last week these cases accounted
for around three in 10 patients in hospital, but the expectation is this will
have increased by now. But the numbers who are acutely
unwell with Covid are still going up and it could be the end of January before
they peak. Hospital cases are
though rising more slowly than cases, once again showing the Omicron variant is
leading to milder illness. Not reducing Covid controls, including self-isolation periods, is ""advisable"", a World Health Organization (WHO) chief says. Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, warns governments needed to be ""careful"" about reducing restrictions, despite early suggestions Omicron may be less severe. He tells a WHO press conference: ""Even with the previous variants most people will incubate and show symptoms or be positive within that first six days or so, and the chances then of being positive or transmitting the disease after that are lower, but it is then for governments to make that judgement call of when to allow people out of a quarantine situation with extra tests. ""The most important thing at this moment is we need to be careful about changing tactics and strategies immediately on the basis of what we're seeing in early Omicron data. ""I think it will be advisable at this point if we don't see huge shifts, huge moves in reducing control measures for Covid-19 purely on the basis of initial and preliminary studies,"" he added. England has reduced the isolation period for positive cases to seven days, if individuals get a negative lateral flow result on days six and seven. The UShas halved isolation time to five daysto alleviate disruption caused by staff shortages. Parkrun events bring together people of all ages and abilities to exercise Banning mass outdoor group exercise in Wales is unjustified and disproportionate, the UK's health secretary says. The popular 5km (3.1 mile) run event Parkrun decided to cancel events in Wales after the Welsh government restricted outdoor events to 50 people. Sajid Javid says Parkrun has ""helped so many people improve their health"" across the UK. A Welsh government spokesperson says it understands the importance of exercise for health and wellbeing but Wales is facing ""a very serious situation"" with Omicron. Read more. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said it is investigating or observing 89 cruise ships with Covid outbreaks onboard. In an update on Tuesday, the public health body said it had begun investigating an additional 38 ships, and 48 others were ""under observation"". Those under investigation include ships from Carnival, Disney, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line. Three more ships are being monitored by the CDC due to reports of Covid infections, but case numbers are below the agency's threshold to begin an investigation. In a statement the Cruise Lines International Association, an industry body, says its members ""[continue] to have very productive dialogue and are working together with the CDC in the interest of public health and safety"". Emma Burrows, from Oundle near Peterborough, has been struggling to get hold of lateral flow tests for her family of five. She's been checking pharmacists for the past few days but none were unavailable. Emma finally managed to order some online but they haven't arrived yet. âI am in a household of five, and so each time we test we use most of a box,"" she says. âMy biggest concern now is availability when the children go back to school and when I go back to work. âMy partner and I are electricians and are going into homes where often our customers are elderly or vulnerable. âWe want to be testing regularly and keeping ourselves, our families and our customers safe."" More than 90% of all community Covid cases in England are the Omicron variant, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Some 32,923 new confirmed Omicron cases have been reported - although the true figure is believed to be much higher as not all tests can identify the variant and not everyone will come forward for testing. Long queues have formed at some testing centres in Australia Australia is trying to make urgent changes to its Covid testing rules to ease pressure on test sites as cases there rise. Hours-long queues have formed outside some testing centres as national daily infections have reached almost 20,000, a new record. Some people who have Covid symptoms have reportedly been refused PCR.tests But Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the country needs ""a gear change"" to manage the testing demand and redefine who counts as a close contact of a positive case. That would mean most people would not have to get a PCR test or isolate themselves if they are identified as a close contact. Dave Chisnall has withdrawn from the tournament The defending world darts champion says the competition could be postponed after a third player pulled out after testing positive for coronavirus. Gerwyn Price tweeted that the William Hill World Darts Championship should be postponed after Dave Chisnall withdrewfrom the tournament earlier with Covid. He later eased back slightly on that stance, saying: ""There's a lot of hard work gone into getting events like the World Championship on, so postponing probably isn't the best option - but an option I wouldn't disagree with."" The latest withdrawal is another blow for the integrity of the showpiece tournament, after three-time world championMichael Van Gerwen pulled out on Tuesday. Van Gerwen has told Dutch media AD Sportwereld he feels ""sour"" at his withdrawal and called on the PDC to do more. ""They actually have to check everyone at the door every day - they didn't do that,"" he says. ""The control has not been strong enough. It is just a big corona bomb now."" As concerns mount for another global wave of Covid, France has reported 208,000 new cases over the past 24 hours - another national and European record. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said that, at the current rate, two people were testing positive for Covid every second in France. ""We have never experienced such a situation,"" he has told politicians, warning France could see as many as 250,000 daily cases by the start of January. The French Hospital Federation has also said the ""most difficult weeks are yet to come"". Prime Minister Jean Castex announced new restrictions earlier this week, and the country's booster rollout has ramped up, with more than 23 million people having received a booster to date. The UK Health Security Agency says PCR test appointments are rapidly expanding after slots were temporarily unavailable in some nations this morning. A UKHSA spokesperson says PCR tests can be booked online but high demand can lead to temporary reduced availability in some areas. âWe have made 100,000 more PCR booking slots available per day since mid-December and we are continuing to rapidly expand capacity, with over half a million tests carried out on 23 December alone,"" they say. Those with symptoms should stay at home while they wait for a home test kit or a test site appointment. âIf you need to leave your home to get to a test site, wear a face covering, stay at least two metres apart from other people who you do not live with, and return home immediately afterwards,"" the spokesperson says. After test slots were unavailable in either England or Northern Ireland this morning, appointments did become available again around midday - but many of those have been snapped up, with sites offering tests already very limited again. Three people have died after an explosion at a Ukrainian hospital, caused by a candle lit in memory of a patient who died of Covid. According to AFP news agency, local officials said an employee had lit the candle in the hospital's intensive care unit, causing five oxygen concentrators to explode. ""Ignorance of the elementary laws of physics and disregard for safety rules have led to irreparable losses,"" the emergency services said, describing the incident as a ""terrible mistake."" Two of those killed were patients at the hospital in Kosiv, in western Ukraine. Four others were treated for severe burns. The local prosecutor's office said it was investigating the incident. Deadly fires are common in the country due to ageing infrastructure and often poor compliance with safety rules. In February this year, four people died in the city of Zaporizhzhya after a fire broke out in an intensive care unit of a hospital treating coronavirus patients. More than800,000booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were recorded across the UK during the past five days, figures show. A total of33,091,891extra doses had been delivered as of 28 December - the first time a UK-wide figure has been available since 23 December, when the number stood at32,290,487. It means801,404booster and third doses have been recorded from Christmas Eve to 28 December. About62%of all adults in the UK have received a booster or third dose. The figures were published by the UK's four health agencies.

"Police officer sacked over murder scene selfiesPC Ryan Connolly was also found to have taken ""appalling homophobic, racist and offensive images"".Liverpool","PC Ryan Connolly was sacked after an investigation by Merseyside Police's anti-corruption unit A police officer who took selfies at a murder scene where a teenager was stabbed has been sacked. PC Ryan Connolly, who worked for Merseyside Police, also shared racist and homophobic pictures and took photos of mentally ill people being sectioned. Merseyside Police said the 37-year-old was sacked for gross misconduct after an anti-corruption investigation. Officers had found ""severely offensive"" photos taken between 2015 and 2018, the force said. The investigation found he had taken ""photographs of vulnerable people whilst on duty"" and his phone contained ""appalling homophobic, racist and offensive images"". The misconduct hearing was told he had taken a photo of the cordon at a murder scene where the teenager was stabbed in 2018 and shared a photo of a Ku Klux Klan member. PC Ryan Connolly's actions were described as ""deplorable"" Deputy Chief Constable Ian Critchley said: ""I am appalled by Connolly's actions, they are beyond comprehension and are not in keeping with the high standards and values that we expect here at Merseyside Police. ""Our officers carry out exceptionally brave selfless acts every single day, protecting the most vulnerable people in our communities, yet here we see the despicable acts of a very selfish individual who has no place in our police service. ""The behaviour of this officer is deplorable and serves to undermine the public's confidence and trust in the police. ""We are quite clear, if any officer is found to be behaving in a way that does not meet our high standards we will take swift and robust action."" Earlier this month, two Met Police officerswere jailed for taking photos of two murdered sistersand sharing the images on WhatsApp groups.

He later eased back slightly on that stance, saying: ""There's a lot of hard work gone into getting events like the World Championship on, so postponing probably isn't the best option - but an option I wouldn't disagree with."" The latest withdrawal is another blow for the integrity of the showpiece tournament, after three-time world championMichael Van Gerwen pulled out on Tuesday. Van Gerwen has told Dutch media AD Sportwereld he feels ""sour"" at his withdrawal and called on the PDC to do more. ""They actually have to check everyone at the door every day - they didn't do that,"" he says. ""The control has not been strong enough. It is just a big corona bomb now."" As concerns mount for another global wave of Covid, France has reported 208,000 new cases over the past 24 hours - another national and European record. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said that, at the current rate, two people were testing positive for Covid every second in France. ""We have never experienced such a situation,"" he has told politicians, warning France could see as many as 250,000 daily cases by the start of January. The French Hospital Federation has also said the ""most difficult weeks are yet to come"". Prime Minister Jean Castex announced new restrictions earlier this week, and the country's booster rollout has ramped up, with more than 23 million people having received a booster to date. The UK Health Security Agency says PCR test appointments are rapidly expanding after slots were temporarily unavailable in some nations this morning. A UKHSA spokesperson says PCR tests can be booked online but high demand can lead to temporary reduced availability in some areas. âWe have made 100,000 more PCR booking slots available per day since mid-December and we are continuing to rapidly expand capacity, with over half a million tests carried out on 23 December alone,"" they say. Those with symptoms should stay at home while they wait for a home test kit or a test site appointment. âIf you need to leave your home to get to a test site, wear a face covering, stay at least two metres apart from other people who you do not live with, and return home immediately afterwards,"" the spokesperson says. After test slots were unavailable in either England or Northern Ireland this morning, appointments did become available again around midday - but many of those have been snapped up, with sites offering tests already very limited again. Three people have died after an explosion at a Ukrainian hospital, caused by a candle lit in memory of a patient who died of Covid. According to AFP news agency, local officials said an employee had lit the candle in the hospital's intensive care unit, causing five oxygen concentrators to explode. ""Ignorance of the elementary laws of physics and disregard for safety rules have led to irreparable losses,"" the emergency services said, describing the incident as a ""terrible mistake."" Two of those killed were patients at the hospital in Kosiv, in western Ukraine. Four others were treated for severe burns. The local prosecutor's office said it was investigating the incident. Deadly fires are common in the country due to ageing infrastructure and often poor compliance with safety rules. In February this year, four people died in the city of Zaporizhzhya after a fire broke out in an intensive care unit of a hospital treating coronavirus patients. More than800,000booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were recorded across the UK during the past five days, figures show. A total of33,091,891extra doses had been delivered as of 28 December - the first time a UK-wide figure has been available since 23 December, when the number stood at32,290,487. It means801,404booster and third doses have been recorded from Christmas Eve to 28 December. About62%of all adults in the UK have received a booster or third dose.

We'll be back with more updates tomorrow. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus stories from the UK and around the world:  Seattle police are investigating after a bar patron attacked a bartender when they were asked for proof of vaccination. In a statement, police said the suspect slashed the worker's face with a sharpened broomstick, and is still at large. The bartender, Felicite Ogilvy, told local outlet KOMO the man said he'd received one vaccine dose, but didn't have his proof of vaccine card. After an argument, some of Ogilvy's coworkers tried to calm the situation, according to KOMO, but the man allegedly attacked her with the broomstick. In light of the incident, Ogilvy says she doesn't agree with having to enforce Covid restrictions. ""Why am I getting hurt?"" she asks. ""Why am I the one who has to control this?"" Scenes like this have been common recently... Pharmacists have been warning of patchy supplies of rapid Covid tests after an increase in demand. Jane, from Yeovil, said she had tried five pharmacies and none had any lateral flow tests available, while she was also unable to order any online from the government website. She told the BBC she needed the tests to visit family in Gloucestershire and had been forced to borrow testing kits from them and sit outside their house in the car waiting for a result. Jane also volunteers at her local hospital and needs to take a test to do so. We've got a little bit more detail on the figures we've brought you in the past hour showing there are more people in hospital in England with coronavirus than there have been at any time since March. A total of 10,462 people were in hospital with the virus as of 08:00 GMT this morning. During the second wave, the figure peaked at 34,336 on 18 January. In London, 3,310 people were in hospital with Covid-19 this morning, up 63% on the previous week and the highest number since 16 February. The second-wave peak for London was 7,917 on 18 January. While we're talking about coronavirus statistics, it's worth mentioning there's been a delay to today's UK-wide Covid data, which we usually bring you at about 16:00. But we'll have updates on today's reported cases and deaths if they are published before we go. And if not, you'll be able to see those details elsewhere on our site when they are available. More companies have cancelled in-person appearances at next month's CES technology industry trade show, amid concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant. The latest to withdraw are chip maker AMD and PC manufacturer MSI. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Intel and Microsoft have already said they will not attend in person. Organisers had hoped January's event - one of the industry's most important showcases of new consumer gadgets - could return to close to normal. Attendees must be fully vaccinated, wear masks and have been asked to test themselves for Covid within the 24-hour period prior to entering one of the exhibition venues.

Fifty fire engines out of a total of 142 were affected during the day shift on 25 December, with 42 affected the previous day. Some 740 operational firefighters in the capital had tested positive or were self-isolating on 27 December, meaning 15% were unable to work, according to the latest figures. The figure is up from 10% on 16 December. The Fire Brigades Union London regional secretary Jon Lambe says: âOmicron is directly affecting the level of fire and rescue cover Londoners receive: over a third of fire engines being unavailable is a huge shortage that could have serious impacts."" London was the first area of the UK to be hit by Omicron and the high number of cases has also led to staff shortages in other sectors, such as the NHS. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of people with Covid in hospital has risen above
10,000 in England for the first time in nearly 10 months. There are currently 10,462 patients with the virus in
hospital. That is the highest level since the start of March â and
means the numbers have risen by 2,000 in just two days. Admissions for Covid are rising, the weekly average is
more than 50% higher than it was a week ago. But other factors are likely to have contributed to the
increase, including a drop in the numbers being discharged. Last Christmas the numbers leaving hospital more than halved, as it is more difficult to discharge patients over the festive period. It means there are likely to be
hundreds of patients in hospital who have recovered from Covid but just have
not left yet. The proportion of hospitalisations
for what is known as an incidental admission is also growing and contributing
to the increase. These are people being treated for something else, but who just
happen to have Covid. Last week these cases accounted
for around three in 10 patients in hospital, but the expectation is this will
have increased by now. But the numbers who are acutely
unwell with Covid are still going up and it could be the end of January before
they peak. Hospital cases are
though rising more slowly than cases, once again showing the Omicron variant is
leading to milder illness. Not reducing Covid controls, including self-isolation periods, is ""advisable"", a World Health Organization (WHO) chief says. Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, warns governments needed to be ""careful"" about reducing restrictions, despite early suggestions Omicron may be less severe. He tells a WHO press conference: ""Even with the previous variants most people will incubate and show symptoms or be positive within that first six days or so, and the chances then of being positive or transmitting the disease after that are lower, but it is then for governments to make that judgement call of when to allow people out of a quarantine situation with extra tests. ""The most important thing at this moment is we need to be careful about changing tactics and strategies immediately on the basis of what we're seeing in early Omicron data. ""I think it will be advisable at this point if we don't see huge shifts, huge moves in reducing control measures for Covid-19 purely on the basis of initial and preliminary studies,"" he added. England has reduced the isolation period for positive cases to seven days, if individuals get a negative lateral flow result on days six and seven. The UShas halved isolation time to five daysto alleviate disruption caused by staff shortages. Parkrun events bring together people of all ages and abilities to exercise Banning mass outdoor group exercise in Wales is unjustified and disproportionate, the UK's health secretary says. The popular 5km (3.1 mile) run event Parkrun decided to cancel events in Wales after the Welsh government restricted outdoor events to 50 people. Sajid Javid says Parkrun has ""helped so many people improve their health"" across the UK. A Welsh government spokesperson says it understands the importance of exercise for health and wellbeing but Wales is facing ""a very serious situation"" with Omicron. Read more. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said it is investigating or observing 89 cruise ships with Covid outbreaks onboard. In an update on Tuesday, the public health body said it had begun investigating an additional 38 ships, and 48 others were ""under observation"". Those under investigation include ships from Carnival, Disney, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line. Three more ships are being monitored by the CDC due to reports of Covid infections, but case numbers are below the agency's threshold to begin an investigation. In a statement the Cruise Lines International Association, an industry body, says its members ""[continue] to have very productive dialogue and are working together with the CDC in the interest of public health and safety"". Emma Burrows, from Oundle near Peterborough, has been struggling to get hold of lateral flow tests for her family of five. She's been checking pharmacists for the past few days but none were unavailable. Emma finally managed to order some online but they haven't arrived yet. âI am in a household of five, and so each time we test we use most of a box,"" she says. âMy biggest concern now is availability when the children go back to school and when I go back to work. âMy partner and I are electricians and are going into homes where often our customers are elderly or vulnerable. âWe want to be testing regularly and keeping ourselves, our families and our customers safe."" More than 90% of all community Covid cases in England are the Omicron variant, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Some 32,923 new confirmed Omicron cases have been reported - although the true figure is believed to be much higher as not all tests can identify the variant and not everyone will come forward for testing. Long queues have formed at some testing centres in Australia Australia is trying to make urgent changes to its Covid testing rules to ease pressure on test sites as cases there rise. Hours-long queues have formed outside some testing centres as national daily infections have reached almost 20,000, a new record. Some people who have Covid symptoms have reportedly been refused PCR.tests But Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the country needs ""a gear change"" to manage the testing demand and redefine who counts as a close contact of a positive case.

Two of those killed were patients at the hospital in Kosiv, in western Ukraine. Four others were treated for severe burns. The local prosecutor's office said it was investigating the incident. Deadly fires are common in the country due to ageing infrastructure and often poor compliance with safety rules. In February this year, four people died in the city of Zaporizhzhya after a fire broke out in an intensive care unit of a hospital treating coronavirus patients. More than800,000booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were recorded across the UK during the past five days, figures show. A total of33,091,891extra doses had been delivered as of 28 December - the first time a UK-wide figure has been available since 23 December, when the number stood at32,290,487. It means801,404booster and third doses have been recorded from Christmas Eve to 28 December. About62%of all adults in the UK have received a booster or third dose. The figures were published by the UK's four health agencies.

Willie Rennie of the Lib Dems asks Ms Sturgeon to address the ""anxious families"" of people in care homes who may be worried about visiting being stopped. Ms Sturgeon agrees that safe visiting is ""vitally important"" both to the mental health of residents and to their loved ones. She gives an assurance that visiting in care homes is a priority and she wants to continue to support its safe practice. The SNP's Rona Mackay asks the first minister to highlight support services available for young people given a recent rise in domestic abuse. Ms Sturgeon says the current conditions people are living under increases the risk to children, young people and those vulnerable to domestic abuse. She highlights the number for Childline which is 0800 1111 and says anyone else with concerns for a child should contact Police Scotland on 999. For concerns about children who are not in immediate danger, Ms Sturgeon says these should be shared with the local authority's social work department. Labour's Jackie Baillie asks about the anti-viral medication which reduces people getting seriously ill
with Covid. She asks whether the FM will review the criteria for the medication as it leaves out some people who are shielding. She also asks whether the PCR test system will be streamlined in order to improve access to medication. The first minister says although she wants to see access to anti-viral treatment to expand, she thinks it is right for clinicians to continue to advise on eligibility issues. She adds that work is ongoing to improve PCT testing and prioritisation will be made for essential workers, for the clinically vulnerable and those who are eligible for anti-viral treatments Susie ForrestHealth producer, BBC Scotland There are now 679 people with confirmed coronavirus being treated in hospital in
Scotland - an increase of 80 (13%) on yesterday's figure and the
highest total since 1 December, when it stood at 702. Back in September that figure was more than 1,000, and
at the peak last January it was over 2,000. The
greatest rises in the last week have been seen in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde
(76) and Lanarkshire (26) health board areas, but Fife (13), Ayrshire (15),
Tayside (11) and Dumfries and Galloway (seven) all saw numbers increase. There's
no up-to-date information on daily hospital admissions or whether most people
are being treated for Covid or testing positive incidentally, while being
treated for other things. There
are currently 36 recently-diagnosed Covid patients in intensive care, as well as 15 who were diagnosed more than 28 days ago. That figure has been steady for a few weeks. A total of 3,316
NHS staff were absent in the last week for Covid-related reasons. That's
the highest since March and compares to 1,771 at the end of November, when
Omicron arrived. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane highlights the ""inconsistencies"" in decision-making as shopping streets are ""heaving"" in comparison to football stadiums. He adds the sport plays a valuable role in mental health and asks if additional support will be provided to protect the mental health of fans. The first minister says she doesn't take the decisions that have been made lightly but they are designed to protect against the higher transmissibility of the variant. Ms Sturgeon adds major events also put a strain on emergency services. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says he met with hospitality representatives who say the financial support on offer will only last them three days. He asks what further support will be available if the Scottish government extends restrictions beyond 17 January. Ms Sturgeon says the money on offer is proportionately larger than in England, but she believes it is not enough and says there needs to be a response from the UK government. She adds that she does not think it would be helpful to ""speculate"" beyond 17 January. Mr Sarwar also asks about business support and highlights the plight of the taxi sector. The first minister says the taxi sector is ""very much in the minds"" of ministers as they reach decisions on how the remainder of funding will be allocated. The Scottish Labour leader follows up by highlighting problems with accessing testing. He asks what action is being taken to increase testing capacity, availability of tests and the speed of results. Mr Sarwar adds: ""Testing is the way to get us through this crisis"". The first minister says there will be ""fluctuations in availability"" but urges people to keep checking as new slots are added throughout the day. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says staff absences are spiking now and having a knock-on effect on public services. He asks the first minister if she can share the scientific advice behind the current 10-day isolation period. Ms Sturgeon says she has already recognised the burden the rules are placing on businesses and many services across the country. She adds she will make them more proportionate when they can be. Ms Sturgeon says the science is all to do with the incubation period and adds that people can still test positive after seven days. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent The
data is jumping around a bit just now - in part because of reporting delays
over Christmas, but also due to strains in the system as more people come forward for
tests. Almost
16,000 daily positive cases is probably in tune with the central estimates of
modellers, but we could still see a sharp rise over the next few days as the
data starts to catch up. It
may be that the worst-case scenario has been avoided because people have
adapted their behaviour even before restrictions were brought in. For
the first time in five days there is information on the numbers of people in
hospital with Covid. It shows a small rise, but not a huge spike. Good
news - but remember the early Omicron cases would largely be in young people who
are less likely to become severely ill. We
are still to see the impact of mixing across generations over Christmas. Early data from London shows hospital admissions with Omicron are lower, even in older age groups, and that the number of people needing intensive care is even less. It also appears that many cases are incidental, with patients admitted for something else and then testing positive. But the experts continue to warn that even if Omicron is milder, a small proportion of a large number has the potential to cause major disruption for the NHS. We still donât know when the peak of this wave will hit, and how good boosters will be at protecting the most vulnerable. Scientists will say it is still too early to draw any firm conclusions from the data. Mr Ross asks why businesses are still waiting for financial support to come through. He also points out reports of PCR testing taking up to four days to return results and asks what is being done to ensure people get access to tests and get results quickly. The FM says that money will flow to businesses ""as quickly as possible"" and that money was being signed off as she spoke. On the testing issue, she says an administrative error restricted slots at physical sites across the UK and this had been rectified. However, she adds the testing system will also be suffering from staff absences because of Covid, which she says highlights the need to take ""careful decisions"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says his party has been calling for a change to rules on self-isolation. He wants the isolation period to be reduced from 10 days to seven if people can produce a negative test and asks the FM what it will take before she makes this decision. Ms Sturgeon says it is important not to get ""carried away"" by the initial studies on hospitalisation rates. She says if people are released from isolation while they are still infectious, this could relieve pressure on the economy in the short term but increase it for longer in the medium to long term. Because of the ""fluctuation"" in cases over the Christmas period, she says she needs to see those figures settle. This situation we face now is not what any of us want. And the period immediately ahead will not be easy. That said, I hope the clearer picture we will have in the next couple of weeks will also prove to be a much more positive picture."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister  The first minister says 75% of those
eligible for a booster or a third dose have now received one. She adds: ""That represents
excellent progress, but to deliver maximum benefits, we need maximum numbers to
get boosted as quickly as possible. ""We want to get
to - or as close as possible to - the target of having 80% of eligible adults
boosted by the bells."" Covid testing slots will be prioritised for essential
workers â such as NHS and transport staff â as well as for those who are
clinically vulnerable or eligible for new Covid treatments, the FM says. She adds: ""This ensures that essential workers get the test
results they need to qualify for an exemption promptly."" Ms Sturgeon emphasises that testing remains available for anyone who needs it. Current restrictions on hospitality and large gatherings will be in place until 17 January, Ms Sturgeon confirms. For indoor standing events, the limit is 100 and for
indoor seated events, 200. For outdoor events, it is 500 seated or standing. She says this is partly because of the opportunity for the virus to spread and because such events place ""significant demands"" on emergency services. The FM urges people to stay at home more than they normally would over Hogmanay and New Yearâs Day, and for at
least the first week in January. She urges people to limit the size of any indoor social gatherings to no more than three households. And she encourages people to continue taking lateral flow tests before mixing with others. Ms Sturgeon adds decisions have been reached on the
allocation of Â£207m of the Â£375m being made available for
business support. She says: ""Councils are now working to get that money into bank
accounts as fast as possible."" The first minister also confirms decisions on the allocation of the remaining funds
will be confirmed following consultation with affected sectors. The first minister gives details about how the first Â£100m of additional support for businesses - which was announced before Christmas - will be allocated. She confirms: Ms Sturgeon also confirms she is ""working closely"" with the sports sector to make sure any support is ""effectively targeted"". Ms Sturgeon says the impact of Omicron on hospital admissions will be a figure the government watches ""closely"" - and it will inform its response in the weeks ahead. She says studies have suggested the rate of hospitalisation from the variant is ""possibly significantly lower"" than others, which is ""grounds for optimism"". However, she highlights the lag time between infection and hospitalisations, as well as the reported increase in hospital occupancy here - which she says is
the ""biggest in some time"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Welsh hospitality hit 'far worse' than in England,"Welsh businesses fear they could miss out to England if people travel over the border to celebrate New Year due to Covid rules. Nightclubs have closed and limits on who can meet have been introduced in Wales, butin England there are no plans to tighten restrictions. UK Hospitality said Welsh business had been hit significantly worse than those in England. The Welsh government said the rules were in place to keep people safe. Thousands of journeys are made across the 160-mile border between Wales and England every day, but through large parts of the pandemic the rules on either side have been very different. Now some pubs and cafes close to the border have told BBC Wales they fear they will miss out on trade to rivals less than a mile away in England. Jess Hope-Jones says the differing rules in Wales and England are an ""ongoing problem"" ""The difference in rules between countries is an ongoing problem,"" said Jess Hope-Jones, who owns an ice cream parlour in Hay-on-Wye, which sits on the Powys side of the border. ""We struggle because we are so close to the border, that it's confusing. One thing that's happened to us all the way through the pandemic is having to explain, ""You're in Wales now"".' While she can keep the parlour open, she said restrictions on numbers had created bottlenecks, while leaving doors and windows open made trading during the winter difficult. Vaccine booster key to avoiding lockdowns in Wales Steep rise in Covid cases around Christmas What are the new Covid rules for Wales? ""People are fed up of the restrictions and the fact you don't have to wear masks and all of these things two miles away,"" she added. Wales moved to alert level two on26 December following a rapid rise in Covid case numbers, with the first minister saying early action was needed to control the spread of Omicron. Groups of no more than six people are allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, and nightclubs have been forced to close. Under the rules licensed premises have to offer table service only, face masks have to be worn when customers are not seated, and contact tracing details collected. In contrast, pub, bar and club owners in England have said they have been offered a ""lifeline"" after UK Environment Secretary George Eustice saidevidence on Covid cases and admissions did not support more interventionsat the moment. The Wales director of UK Hospitality, David Chapman, said businesses needed grants and loans to keep them going. Many businesses that have been ticking over but not making profits for such a long time will not be able to continue as extra costs come in the spring, he added. In April, hospitality businesses will have to start paying half of their business rates again, VAT for their sector will rise from 12.5% to 20% and National Insurance rates will increase, as well as energy bills. ""I fear that we will lose businesses in weeks not months and that will impact communities across Wales in terms of jobs, suppliers and social networks,"" said Mr Chapman. Mark Finlay, operations manager for the Fat Boar Group, which owns pubs and restaurants in Wrexham and Flintshire, said he wanted to see the evidence behind the Welsh government's latest restrictions. The Welsh government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) regularly publishes guidance,but it has not been publicly updated since 10 December. Mr Finlay said he knew some regular customers would be heading to nearby Chester - in England - to celebrate New Year's Eve. ""Customers are coming in but don't really know what they can and can't do,"" he said. ""At least we are open now as opposed to last year and we are still quite busy [but] we are getting a lot of cancellations. ""New Years will be the real test. There's been a couple of comments from customers who say they will come here for a meal and then make their way to Chester to celebrate properly - in their words. So the new year countdown will be more sedate."" Chris Evans, chairman of Saith Seren pub in Wrexham, said  it was ""bizarre"" that Wrexham football supporterscould not support their team at home games- but could at away games. ""People naturally will hop on a bus from Wrexham and be in Chester in half an hour, so that's what they are going to do New Year's Eve,"" he said. Grants will only scratch the surface of the lost takings before Christmas, says Debbie Evans It is a similar story in mid-Wales where the owner of the Kerry Lamb Pub in Kerry, near Newtown, said people were heading across the border to spend. Debbie Evans said: ""Boxing Day was really, really quiet - I think we were 50-70 percent down from 2019 but there are so many cases in this area now and it's worrying people. ""I just think people are aware of the environment as a whole and those who aren't can pop on the train and go to Shrewsbury."" 'It should be the same rules in every country' Golfers at border club 'can leave or enter Wales' People on the border in a 'difficult situation' In terms of the business she said the Â£2,000 grant available would ""not scratch the surface"" of the losses she had already suffered. ""I've almost got a sense of apathy about the whole thing now. We're so tired of constantly trying to change the business, think about its viability, all those things it's exhausting really,"" she said. UK Hospitality said businesses in Wales had lost between 60-70 percent of their normal trade levels during December - compared to between 40-60 percent in England. Traders have said fewer people are going out due to the new alert level two restrictions The trade body said Welsh hospitality had experienced the longest and toughest restrictions during the pandemic out of any part of the UK. ""We are seeing a much more significant hit to trading and revenue levels for businesses in Wales than we are in England,"" chief executive Kate Nicholls said. ""It's not just restrictions, but the discussion within the different devolved administrations about the perception of risk and the message that people are being given in Wales is very different to what we're seeing to other parts of the UK."" The Welsh government said the new restrictions had been put in place to help businesses continue to trade while guidance had been strengthened to keep people stay safe. A spokesperson added: ""We all need to do everything we can to protect ourselves and keep Wales safe."" The Welsh government has said a total of Â£120m will be made available to support nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses impacted by the pandemic.

"Scots urged not to travel to England for HogmanayJohn Swinney says travelling to England, where nightclubs are still open, would be ""the wrong course of action"".","Scots have been urged not to travel to England for new year celebrations to get around the more stringent Covid-19 restrictions north of the border. There is no travel ban currently in place to stop people going to England, where nightclubs are still open. But Deputy First Minister John Swinney said doing so would go against the ""spirit"" of Scottish Covid-19 measures. He said travelling would be ""the wrong course of action"" due to the ""serious situation"" with the Omicron variant. Case numbers in Scotland hit ""alarming"" record highs over Christmas and Boxing Day, with the faster-spreading strain now accounting for the majority of all infections. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - who is to update MSPs in a virtual sitting of the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday afternoon - said she expected the figures to rise even more in the days ahead. Nicola Sturgeon warns Covid case numbers will rise Enjoy new year but be cautious, care minister says Scots have been encouraged to stay at home as much as possible, and to limit any social gatherings to no more than three households. Large events such as Edinburgh's traditional Hogmanay street party have been cancelled, withextra curbs in hospitality settingsand nightclubs shut down entirely. Clubs remain open south of the border, whereno new restrictions are being imposed, but Mr Swinney told BBC Breakfast that he would ""discourage"" anyone from travelling to England to see in the new year. He said: ""People are free to make their own judgments. But what we have got recognise is that Omicron is a serious threat to absolutely everybody within our society and we have all got to take measures to protect ourselves by limiting our social contacts and connections and by complying with the restrictions we have in place. ""I think it is the wrong course of action for people to take because we have a serious situation we have got to manage and we encourage everybody to play their part in addressing that."" People in England have been urged to be ""cautious"" while socialising, by taking lateral flow tests and sticking to well-ventilated areas. John Swinney said the Omicron variant was a ""serious threat"" Ms Sturgeon is to update MSPs on the latest data and plans when Holyrood is recalled from recess for a virtual sitting at 14:00. Mr Swinney said the current set of restrictions would be reviewed on 11 January, but warned that ""people can see with their own eyes the galloping pace at which Omicron is moving through Scotland"". He said ministers did not want to have curbs in place ""a minute longer than is necessary"", and praised people for a ""very significant level of public compliance and participation with the rules we have put in place"". The deputy first minister was also questioned about easing Scotland's self-isolation rules amid concerns that key services are running short of staff. People who test positive in Scotland have to isolate for 10 days, along with members of their immediate household, regardless of vaccination status. However in England, Covid patients can leave quarantine after seven days if they record two negative tests - and fully vaccinated household contacts are not legally required to isolate, but are ""strongly advised"" to test daily. What are the Covid self-isolation rules now? Opposition parties haveaccused Ms Sturgeon of being ""too cautious"" with the rules, calling for Scotland to move into line with England to allow more people out to work. Mr Swinney told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that ""active consideration"" was being given to reducing the quarantine period in Scotland  - but that this would need to be done based on health grounds, not economic ones. He said: ""The key question is whether or not the period required for self-isolation is necessary to ensure that we interrupt the circulation of the virus. That is the judgement that we will form based on the clinical advice and evidence presented to us. ""We serve nobody's interests well if we enable people to return to the labour market, to return to circulation in society, if they are still shedding the virus.

Care system puts vulnerable teens at risk - report,"Teenagers taken into care in England to safeguard them from exploitation are being put at more serious risk in the care system itself, a report warns. TheCommission on Young Lives report,externalsays children are moved from their local areas to live in unregulated accommodation targeted by criminals. It says the system is ""unfit for purpose"" and is letting down the rising number of over 16s in care. Ministers say they are ""urgently reforming the system"". The review - chaired by former children's commissioner for England Anne Longfield - describes the experience of exploited teenagers as ""bleak"" and the protections in place to support them as ""infuriatingly inadequate"". It paints a picture of a shortage of suitable residential places, a failure to identify those at risk of exploitation, and cuts to funding for early intervention programmes. It calls for a package of government measures aimed at teenagers at risk, including a ministerial taskforce and a ban on the use of unregulated accommodation for under-18s in care. According to the report, the care population is getting older and 16 and 17-year-olds with acute needs now make up 23% of children in care. The system, initially designed to support young children, is now struggling to adapt to the needs of these older children, it says. Some vulnerable teenagers are being moved away from the area they live in and to places with high levels of crime, according to the report, while criminal gangs have even been known to be tipped off from within local authorities when vulnerable teenagers are moved into unregulated accommodation. Ms Longfield said the social care system was frequently putting young people ""in even greater danger"". ""Often, we may as well be handing over children directly to ruthless gangs and criminals,"" she added. Ms Longfield said resetting children's social care would require ""determined action and some funding"". She added: ""We know the number of vulnerable teenagers at risk of exploitation entering the care system is becoming older, with more complex and expensive needs, and growing. We also know this is putting an enormous strain on the whole children's social care system."" In March 2021, there were 80,850 children in care in England, a 1% rise on the year before. Black children are more likely to be in care, the report noted, adding that it was particularly concerned by ""racial biases in the system which put black boys at risk of harm"". The Department for Education said it was ""urgently reforming the system to address growing pressures"". It highlighted the introduction of national standards and new oversight from watchdog Ofsted for supported accommodation, as well as investment of Â£259m to increase places in the homes. The government is also providing Â£45m for programmes to help vulnerable children at risk of being targeted by gangs. In a statement, a DfE spokesperson said: ""We recognise many vulnerable young people face new and growing risks, which is why we are providing targeted support... to keep these young people engaged in their education and to prevent them becoming involved in criminal activity."" Michelle Lee-Izu, of children's charity Barnardo's, said: ""Barnardo's has long warned about the growing threat of child criminal exploitation, so although this report from the Commission on Young Lives is alarming, it is sadly not surprising. ""Agencies are still too often failing to identify victims, even when there are clear signs of harm. We know children who have already had a tough start in life are particularly vulnerable, including those in foster care and residential care, and this report is right to say that there needs to be widespread changes to help keep children safe.""

"UK cost of living squeeze in 2022, says think tankThe Resolution Foundation says households face a Â£1,200 hit due to higher taxes and energy bills.Business","Millions of families are facing a ""year of the squeeze"" in 2022, a think tank has warned. The Resolution Foundation predicts higher energy bills, stagnant wages and tax rises could leave households with a Â£1,200 a year hit to their incomes. Itsreport,externalhighlights the rise in the energy price cap and National Insurance contributions in April. The government says it has put Â£4.2bn in place to support families. According to the Resolution Foundation, millions of families are facing a ""cost-of-living catastrophe"" next year. It says a 1.25% increase in National Insurance contributions will cost the average household Â£600 a year while the higher energy bills cap is expected to add an additional Â£500 to spending. Both will come into force in April. The impact of the failure of many firms in the energy sector would see another Â£100 added to gas and electricity bills. Customers of collapsed energy companies have been shifted to new suppliers but it means they could pay a different - and potentially more expensive - tariff than their previous energy deal. UK prices rise at fastest rate in 10 years National Insurance: Whatâs the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? Urgent action needed on energy prices - Ovo boss In recent months, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. Last week, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about Â£2,000 next year. Earlier this week, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng met bosses from the UK's energy companies and the industry's regulator Ofgem ""to discuss the ongoing effects of record high global gas prices on the sector"". Labour has suggested the government immediately remove VAT from household energy bills over winter to help households. Stephen Fitzpatrick, chief executive of Ovo Energy, who attended the virtual meeting on Monday, also suggested the government should remove ""some of the environmental social policy costs that we have seen increase over the years"". Meanwhile, the cost of living in the UK surged by 5.1% in the 12 months to November - the highest increase in 10 years - Office for National Statistics data showed. Inflation is set to peak at 6% in the spring, according to the Bank of England, and the Resolution Foundation warned that real wage growth, which was flat in October, ""almost certainly started falling last month and is unlikely to start growing again until the final quarter of 2022"". Resolution Foundation chief executive Torsten Bell, said: ""The overall picture is likely to be one of prices surging and pay packets stagnating."" He told the BBC that the UK employment market had shown signs of resilience during the pandemic following the end of the government's furlough scheme on 30 September, with the unemployment rate close to pre-Covid levels at 4.2%. He also highlighted that the national living wage will rise in April, by 6.6%, which he said means ""the lowest earners will be protected from some of these price rises we are seeing"". However, Mr Bell said that while some areas of the workforce have seen sharp wage rises - such as in-demand HGV drivers - ""overall the story is prices going up for everybody while wages go up for some"". Mr Bell said Chancellor Rishi Sunak could face increased pressure to take action to alleviatehis economic plan set out in the Autumn Budget. The report by the foundation says that poorer families are going to be the worse hit by the ""year of the squeeze"", as they spend a higher proportion of their income on energy. A government spokesman said its help included reducing the Universal Credit taper, as well as measures to assist with bills, including cold weather payments and a freeze in alcohol and fuel duty.

"Vinyl sales soared again in 2021, thanks to Abba","Abba's Voyage became the fastest-selling vinyl release of the 2000s Albums by Adele, Abba and Ed Sheeran helped vinyl sales in the UK top five million for the first time since 1991. Almost a quarter of the albums bought this year (23%) were on vinyl, with Abba's Voyage the biggest-seller. It marks the format's 14th consecutive year of growth, with sales up by 8% on 2020. Sales of CDs continued to fall. Just 14 million discs were bought - the lowest figure since 1988, six years after the format was introduced in the UK. Abba top charts with first album for 40 years How vinyl records are trying to go green 'I've got through lockdown by playing 300 vinyl records' However, the drop-off in CD sales was smaller than in recent years, with sales decreasing by 12%, compared to nearly a third in 2020. That's partly because artists like Abba and Adele appeal to older listeners, who still prefer the format. Music industry body the BPI said it hoped that the reduced demand for CDs was ""bottoming out"" after years of decline. The vinyl resurgence continued in 2021 despite serious delays in manufacturing, caused by a combination of Covid, supply-chain issues and labour shortages, as well as a scarcity of raw materials like PVC and paper products. One reportblamed Adele,externalfor further clogging up the world's vinyl plants with pre-orders for her new album, 30 - but her order of 500,000 records only accounted for 0.3% of the LPs pressed this year. (A bigger problem is that demand for vinyl outstrips manufacturing capacity by a factor of 2:1). Adele's 30 has achieved the majority of its sales on physical formats, bucking industry trends In the end, Adele's return was eclipsed by that of Abba, who took the world by surprise in September by announcing their first album of new material in more than 40 years. Titled Voyage, it shifted 29,891 copies in its first week on sale, following an extensive pre-order campaign that gave fans early access to tickets for the Swedes' virtual concerts next year. Voyage duly became the fastest seller on vinyl this century, according to the Official Charts Company. Cassette sales, while representing a tiny fraction of the music market, also increased for a ninth consecutive year. Final figures for 2021 are likely to show that around 190,000 tapes were purchased in the past 12 months, up by around 20% year on year. It's the format's most successful year since 2003, when Now 54 was the year's biggest seller on cassette. The revival arguably has more to do with marketing than any real appetite for the format, however. Most artists now offer signed cassettes on their official website, frequently in bundles with CD or vinyl copies of the same album. Fans often have no choice but to accept the cassette as part of the bundle; and each copy of the record handily counts as a separate sale on the official chart. Sales of physical formats are dwarfed by the popularity of streaming, which accounted for 80.6% of music consumption in 2020. Even so, having an album available on CD and vinyl plays a pivotal role in artists reaching number one. Adele's 30, for example, has seen 75% of its chart sales attributable to physical format purchases during its five-week reign at the top of the charts. Despite that, streaming's share of the market is thought to have increased further this year. The BPI will report that data, along with the year's final music consumption figures, on 4 January, Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Welsh hospitality hit 'far worse' than in EnglandPubs and bars fear tougher Covid rules in Wales will see New Year's Eve custom cross the border.Wales,"Welsh businesses fear they could miss out to England if people travel over the border to celebrate New Year due to Covid rules. Nightclubs have closed and limits on who can meet have been introduced in Wales, butin England there are no plans to tighten restrictions. UK Hospitality said Welsh business had been hit significantly worse than those in England. The Welsh government said the rules were in place to keep people safe. Thousands of journeys are made across the 160-mile border between Wales and England every day, but through large parts of the pandemic the rules on either side have been very different. Now some pubs and cafes close to the border have told BBC Wales they fear they will miss out on trade to rivals less than a mile away in England. Jess Hope-Jones says the differing rules in Wales and England are an ""ongoing problem"" ""The difference in rules between countries is an ongoing problem,"" said Jess Hope-Jones, who owns an ice cream parlour in Hay-on-Wye, which sits on the Powys side of the border. ""We struggle because we are so close to the border, that it's confusing. One thing that's happened to us all the way through the pandemic is having to explain, ""You're in Wales now"".' While she can keep the parlour open, she said restrictions on numbers had created bottlenecks, while leaving doors and windows open made trading during the winter difficult. Vaccine booster key to avoiding lockdowns in Wales Steep rise in Covid cases around Christmas What are the new Covid rules for Wales? ""People are fed up of the restrictions and the fact you don't have to wear masks and all of these things two miles away,"" she added. Wales moved to alert level two on26 December following a rapid rise in Covid case numbers, with the first minister saying early action was needed to control the spread of Omicron. Groups of no more than six people are allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, and nightclubs have been forced to close. Under the rules licensed premises have to offer table service only, face masks have to be worn when customers are not seated, and contact tracing details collected. In contrast, pub, bar and club owners in England have said they have been offered a ""lifeline"" after UK Environment Secretary George Eustice saidevidence on Covid cases and admissions did not support more interventionsat the moment. The Wales director of UK Hospitality, David Chapman, said businesses needed grants and loans to keep them going. Many businesses that have been ticking over but not making profits for such a long time will not be able to continue as extra costs come in the spring, he added. In April, hospitality businesses will have to start paying half of their business rates again, VAT for their sector will rise from 12.5% to 20% and National Insurance rates will increase, as well as energy bills. ""I fear that we will lose businesses in weeks not months and that will impact communities across Wales in terms of jobs, suppliers and social networks,"" said Mr Chapman. Mark Finlay, operations manager for the Fat Boar Group, which owns pubs and restaurants in Wrexham and Flintshire, said he wanted to see the evidence behind the Welsh government's latest restrictions. The Welsh government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) regularly publishes guidance,but it has not been publicly updated since 10 December. Mr Finlay said he knew some regular customers would be heading to nearby Chester - in England - to celebrate New Year's Eve. ""Customers are coming in but don't really know what they can and can't do,"" he said. ""At least we are open now as opposed to last year and we are still quite busy [but] we are getting a lot of cancellations. ""New Years will be the real test. There's been a couple of comments from customers who say they will come here for a meal and then make their way to Chester to celebrate properly - in their words. So the new year countdown will be more sedate."" Chris Evans, chairman of Saith Seren pub in Wrexham, said  it was ""bizarre"" that Wrexham football supporterscould not support their team at home games- but could at away games. ""People naturally will hop on a bus from Wrexham and be in Chester in half an hour, so that's what they are going to do New Year's Eve,"" he said. Grants will only scratch the surface of the lost takings before Christmas, says Debbie Evans It is a similar story in mid-Wales where the owner of the Kerry Lamb Pub in Kerry, near Newtown, said people were heading across the border to spend. Debbie Evans said: ""Boxing Day was really, really quiet - I think we were 50-70 percent down from 2019 but there are so many cases in this area now and it's worrying people. ""I just think people are aware of the environment as a whole and those who aren't can pop on the train and go to Shrewsbury."" 'It should be the same rules in every country' Golfers at border club 'can leave or enter Wales' People on the border in a 'difficult situation' In terms of the business she said the Â£2,000 grant available would ""not scratch the surface"" of the losses she had already suffered. ""I've almost got a sense of apathy about the whole thing now. We're so tired of constantly trying to change the business, think about its viability, all those things it's exhausting really,"" she said. UK Hospitality said businesses in Wales had lost between 60-70 percent of their normal trade levels during December - compared to between 40-60 percent in England. Traders have said fewer people are going out due to the new alert level two restrictions The trade body said Welsh hospitality had experienced the longest and toughest restrictions during the pandemic out of any part of the UK. ""We are seeing a much more significant hit to trading and revenue levels for businesses in Wales than we are in England,"" chief executive Kate Nicholls said. ""It's not just restrictions, but the discussion within the different devolved administrations about the perception of risk and the message that people are being given in Wales is very different to what we're seeing to other parts of the UK."" The Welsh government said the new restrictions had been put in place to help businesses continue to trade while guidance had been strengthened to keep people stay safe. A spokesperson added: ""We all need to do everything we can to protect ourselves and keep Wales safe."" The Welsh government has said a total of Â£120m will be made available to support nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses impacted by the pandemic.

Theatres in NI cancel shows due to Covid-19,"Close contacts who are fully-vaccinated are no longer required to isolate until receiving a PCR result New Covid-19 testing measures have been put in place to cope with the rise in demand for PCR tests due to the Omicron variant. The Public Health Agency (PHA) has urged members of the public to only book PCR tests when necessary. Fully-vaccinated people identified as close contacts are now advised to take daily lateral flow tests for 10 days following their exposure to the virus. They should only book a PCR if a lateral flow is positive. Unvaccinated people will have to continue to self-isolate for 10 days. However, the PHA has stressed that those displaying symptoms should book a PCR test as soon as possible. Previously, close contacts of a confirmed case of Covid-19 were told to self-isolate and get a PCR test, even if fully vaccinated. PCR tests have been taken by record numbers of people in Northern Ireland this week, according to the PHA. The agency said more than 21,000 tests were carried out on 27 December alone. Recently people have been finding it difficult to secure an in-person PCR slot using the UK's official booking website. Demand for lateral flow tests has quadrupled in some cases, according to Community Pharmacy NI The PHA's deputy director of public health said the testing model was being adapted to make sure ""people with symptoms can get tested in a timely way for the next fortnight"". ""As Omicron continues to spread in Northern Ireland, we are seeing the expected rapid increase in the number of people going for PCR testing,"" said Dr BrÃ­d Farrell. ""While this shows that people are taking the issue seriously, and we thank them for that, it is also important that we protect the testing system so that those who need to be tested by PCR can get it."" Children under five years of age are no longer required to take a PCR test - even if they have symptoms like a cough or temperature - unless advised to by a doctor. The PHA has encouraged parents to instead carry out a lateral flow test on children, and to only seek a PCR test if the lateral flow returns a positive result. Lateral flow tests show results in 20 to 30 minutes, while PCR test swabs must be sent to a lab for analysis. Omicron and Delta driving case tsunami - WHO What are the rules in Northern Ireland? Warning over patchy lateral flow Covid test supply The changes in the testing system, which came into effect at midday, come as14 more Covid-19-related deaths were recorded in Northern Irelandby the Department of Health on Wednesday. The deaths occurred in the period between midnight on 23 December and midnight on 28 December. During that time, the department reported there had been 22,972 positive cases of coronavirus. This was more than double the 11,348 cases reported during the comparable five-day period the previous week. Earlier, the chief executive of Community Pharmacy NI called on the Department of Health to help ramp up the supply of Covid-19 tests to pharmacies. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Gerard Greene said demand for lateral flow tests had outstripped supply but pharmacies in Northern Ireland would be replenished with stock in the coming days. The Department of Health recommends people take regular rapid lateral flow tests twice-weekly He said that in some cases demand for tests had quadrupled in line with the current public health messaging around self-isolation and testing. The Department of Healthrecommends people take regular rapid lateral flow tests twice-weekly,external, particularly if they are planning to mix with others outside of their household. People who test positive in Northern Ireland are required to self-isolate for at least 10 days from when their symptoms started. Northern Ireland's vaccination centres, for first, second and booster jabs,have remained open during the Christmas period,external. The Western Health Trust has announced it is temporarily suspending visiting on all its sites and facilities, which include Altnagelvin Area Hospital and the South West Acute Hospital. The suspension will apply from midnight and is to be reviewed on Friday. The trust said it had taken the decision due to continued pressures on its hospitals and care facilities, and the general increase in Covid transmission in the community. Some theatres have chosen to cancel performances due to Covid-19 Meanwhile, some theatres in Northern Ireland cancelled their remaining Christmas performances due to Covid-19. Theatre companies said more financial support is needed from the executive to pay staff wages after cancellations. The MAC theatre in Belfast said it took the decision not go ahead with its remaining shows of The Untold Truth of Captain Hook. The theatre said it would be closed until 5 January due to the impact of Covid-19. The Waterfront Hall pulled all remaining performances of its pantomime Cinderella and adult pantomime Cinder on Tinder. Producer Liam McMullan, from GBL Productions, said he has had to cancel 30 performances with about 350 people booked in per show. The cast performed 37 shows before the cancellation and Mr McMullan said it cost between Â£50,000 and Â£70,000 to put on a production. How do you socially distance as a panto horse? Meanwhile, a hotel in County Fermanagh has chosen to implement ""a short-term circuit breaker closure due to the increasing levels of Covid-19 within the region"".

As ever, you can follow any major developments on the news site - just go to thefront page. And for more in-depth coverage, you can go to our dedicated coronavirus sectionhere. We'll be back with more updates tomorrow. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus stories from the UK and around the world:  Seattle police are investigating after a bar patron attacked a bartender when they were asked for proof of vaccination. In a statement, police said the suspect slashed the worker's face with a sharpened broomstick, and is still at large. The bartender, Felicite Ogilvy, told local outlet KOMO the man said he'd received one vaccine dose, but didn't have his proof of vaccine card. After an argument, some of Ogilvy's coworkers tried to calm the situation, according to KOMO, but the man allegedly attacked her with the broomstick. In light of the incident, Ogilvy says she doesn't agree with having to enforce Covid restrictions. ""Why am I getting hurt?"" she asks. ""Why am I the one who has to control this?"" Scenes like this have been common recently... Pharmacists have been warning of patchy supplies of rapid Covid tests after an increase in demand. Jane, from Yeovil, said she had tried five pharmacies and none had any lateral flow tests available, while she was also unable to order any online from the government website. She told the BBC she needed the tests to visit family in Gloucestershire and had been forced to borrow testing kits from them and sit outside their house in the car waiting for a result. Jane also volunteers at her local hospital and needs to take a test to do so. We've got a little bit more detail on the figures we've brought you in the past hour showing there are more people in hospital in England with coronavirus than there have been at any time since March. A total of 10,462 people were in hospital with the virus as of 08:00 GMT this morning. During the second wave, the figure peaked at 34,336 on 18 January. In London, 3,310 people were in hospital with Covid-19 this morning, up 63% on the previous week and the highest number since 16 February. The second-wave peak for London was 7,917 on 18 January. While we're talking about coronavirus statistics, it's worth mentioning there's been a delay to today's UK-wide Covid data, which we usually bring you at about 16:00. But we'll have updates on today's reported cases and deaths if they are published before we go. And if not, you'll be able to see those details elsewhere on our site when they are available. More companies have cancelled in-person appearances at next month's CES technology industry trade show, amid concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant. The latest to withdraw are chip maker AMD and PC manufacturer MSI. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Intel and Microsoft have already said they will not attend in person. Organisers had hoped January's event - one of the industry's most important showcases of new consumer gadgets - could return to close to normal. Attendees must be fully vaccinated, wear masks and have been asked to test themselves for Covid within the 24-hour period prior to entering one of the exhibition venues. Social-distancing measures will also be in place. Read more.

They were carrying placards displaying their names and photos. Some people could be seen watching the event unfold. China's borders are largely closed due to the pandemic, as it attempts to tackle a new Covid wave. State-run Guangxi Daily said the disciplinary action against the men helped to deterr border-related crimes andencouraged compliance with epidemic prevention and control.,external The shaming drew mixed reactions online, including in state-owned media.

Fifty fire engines out of a total of 142 were affected during the day shift on 25 December, with 42 affected the previous day. Some 740 operational firefighters in the capital had tested positive or were self-isolating on 27 December, meaning 15% were unable to work, according to the latest figures. The figure is up from 10% on 16 December. The Fire Brigades Union London regional secretary Jon Lambe says: âOmicron is directly affecting the level of fire and rescue cover Londoners receive: over a third of fire engines being unavailable is a huge shortage that could have serious impacts."" London was the first area of the UK to be hit by Omicron and the high number of cases has also led to staff shortages in other sectors, such as the NHS. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of people with Covid in hospital has risen above
10,000 in England for the first time in nearly 10 months. There are currently 10,462 patients with the virus in
hospital. That is the highest level since the start of March â and
means the numbers have risen by 2,000 in just two days. Admissions for Covid are rising, the weekly average is
more than 50% higher than it was a week ago. But other factors are likely to have contributed to the
increase, including a drop in the numbers being discharged. Last Christmas the numbers leaving hospital more than halved, as it is more difficult to discharge patients over the festive period. It means there are likely to be
hundreds of patients in hospital who have recovered from Covid but just have
not left yet. The proportion of hospitalisations
for what is known as an incidental admission is also growing and contributing
to the increase. These are people being treated for something else, but who just
happen to have Covid. Last week these cases accounted
for around three in 10 patients in hospital, but the expectation is this will
have increased by now. But the numbers who are acutely
unwell with Covid are still going up and it could be the end of January before
they peak. Hospital cases are
though rising more slowly than cases, once again showing the Omicron variant is
leading to milder illness. Not reducing Covid controls, including self-isolation periods, is ""advisable"", a World Health Organization (WHO) chief says. Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, warns governments needed to be ""careful"" about reducing restrictions, despite early suggestions Omicron may be less severe. He tells a WHO press conference: ""Even with the previous variants most people will incubate and show symptoms or be positive within that first six days or so, and the chances then of being positive or transmitting the disease after that are lower, but it is then for governments to make that judgement call of when to allow people out of a quarantine situation with extra tests. ""The most important thing at this moment is we need to be careful about changing tactics and strategies immediately on the basis of what we're seeing in early Omicron data. ""I think it will be advisable at this point if we don't see huge shifts, huge moves in reducing control measures for Covid-19 purely on the basis of initial and preliminary studies,"" he added. England has reduced the isolation period for positive cases to seven days, if individuals get a negative lateral flow result on days six and seven. The UShas halved isolation time to five daysto alleviate disruption caused by staff shortages. Parkrun events bring together people of all ages and abilities to exercise Banning mass outdoor group exercise in Wales is unjustified and disproportionate, the UK's health secretary says. The popular 5km (3.1 mile) run event Parkrun decided to cancel events in Wales after the Welsh government restricted outdoor events to 50 people. Sajid Javid says Parkrun has ""helped so many people improve their health"" across the UK. A Welsh government spokesperson says it understands the importance of exercise for health and wellbeing but Wales is facing ""a very serious situation"" with Omicron. Read more. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said it is investigating or observing 89 cruise ships with Covid outbreaks onboard. In an update on Tuesday, the public health body said it had begun investigating an additional 38 ships, and 48 others were ""under observation"". Those under investigation include ships from Carnival, Disney, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line. Three more ships are being monitored by the CDC due to reports of Covid infections, but case numbers are below the agency's threshold to begin an investigation. In a statement the Cruise Lines International Association, an industry body, says its members ""[continue] to have very productive dialogue and are working together with the CDC in the interest of public health and safety"". Emma Burrows, from Oundle near Peterborough, has been struggling to get hold of lateral flow tests for her family of five. She's been checking pharmacists for the past few days but none were unavailable. Emma finally managed to order some online but they haven't arrived yet. âI am in a household of five, and so each time we test we use most of a box,"" she says. âMy biggest concern now is availability when the children go back to school and when I go back to work. âMy partner and I are electricians and are going into homes where often our customers are elderly or vulnerable. âWe want to be testing regularly and keeping ourselves, our families and our customers safe."" More than 90% of all community Covid cases in England are the Omicron variant, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Some 32,923 new confirmed Omicron cases have been reported - although the true figure is believed to be much higher as not all tests can identify the variant and not everyone will come forward for testing. Long queues have formed at some testing centres in Australia Australia is trying to make urgent changes to its Covid testing rules to ease pressure on test sites as cases there rise. Hours-long queues have formed outside some testing centres as national daily infections have reached almost 20,000, a new record. Some people who have Covid symptoms have reportedly been refused PCR.tests But Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the country needs ""a gear change"" to manage the testing demand and redefine who counts as a close contact of a positive case. That would mean most people would not have to get a PCR test or isolate themselves if they are identified as a close contact. Dave Chisnall has withdrawn from the tournament The defending world darts champion says the competition could be postponed after a third player pulled out after testing positive for coronavirus. Gerwyn Price tweeted that the William Hill World Darts Championship should be postponed after Dave Chisnall withdrewfrom the tournament earlier with Covid. He later eased back slightly on that stance, saying: ""There's a lot of hard work gone into getting events like the World Championship on, so postponing probably isn't the best option - but an option I wouldn't disagree with."" The latest withdrawal is another blow for the integrity of the showpiece tournament, after three-time world championMichael Van Gerwen pulled out on Tuesday. Van Gerwen has told Dutch media AD Sportwereld he feels ""sour"" at his withdrawal and called on the PDC to do more. ""They actually have to check everyone at the door every day - they didn't do that,"" he says. ""The control has not been strong enough. It is just a big corona bomb now."" As concerns mount for another global wave of Covid, France has reported 208,000 new cases over the past 24 hours - another national and European record. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said that, at the current rate, two people were testing positive for Covid every second in France. ""We have never experienced such a situation,"" he has told politicians, warning France could see as many as 250,000 daily cases by the start of January. The French Hospital Federation has also said the ""most difficult weeks are yet to come"". Prime Minister Jean Castex announced new restrictions earlier this week, and the country's booster rollout has ramped up, with more than 23 million people having received a booster to date. The UK Health Security Agency says PCR test appointments are rapidly expanding after slots were temporarily unavailable in some nations this morning. A UKHSA spokesperson says PCR tests can be booked online but high demand can lead to temporary reduced availability in some areas. âWe have made 100,000 more PCR booking slots available per day since mid-December and we are continuing to rapidly expand capacity, with over half a million tests carried out on 23 December alone,"" they say. Those with symptoms should stay at home while they wait for a home test kit or a test site appointment. âIf you need to leave your home to get to a test site, wear a face covering, stay at least two metres apart from other people who you do not live with, and return home immediately afterwards,"" the spokesperson says. After test slots were unavailable in either England or Northern Ireland this morning, appointments did become available again around midday - but many of those have been snapped up, with sites offering tests already very limited again. Three people have died after an explosion at a Ukrainian hospital, caused by a candle lit in memory of a patient who died of Covid. According to AFP news agency, local officials said an employee had lit the candle in the hospital's intensive care unit, causing five oxygen concentrators to explode. ""Ignorance of the elementary laws of physics and disregard for safety rules have led to irreparable losses,"" the emergency services said, describing the incident as a ""terrible mistake."" Two of those killed were patients at the hospital in Kosiv, in western Ukraine. Four others were treated for severe burns. The local prosecutor's office said it was investigating the incident. Deadly fires are common in the country due to ageing infrastructure and often poor compliance with safety rules. In February this year, four people died in the city of Zaporizhzhya after a fire broke out in an intensive care unit of a hospital treating coronavirus patients. More than800,000booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were recorded across the UK during the past five days, figures show. A total of33,091,891extra doses had been delivered as of 28 December - the first time a UK-wide figure has been available since 23 December, when the number stood at32,290,487. It means801,404booster and third doses have been recorded from Christmas Eve to 28 December. About62%of all adults in the UK have received a booster or third dose.

"England reports record 117,000 Covid daily casesCases continue to rise, but the surge in infections has so far not led to a spike in hospital admissions.","Pharmacists are warning of patchy supplies of rapid Covid tests following changes to self-isolation rules. They said demand for lateral flow tests increased after changes allowed people with Covid in England to end isolation after seven days if they test negative. The Association Of Independent Multiple Pharmacies said staff and customers were stressed over the lack of supply. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said test availability is refreshed throughout the day. ""During periods of exceptional demand there may be temporary pauses in ordering or receiving tests, to ensure we manage distribution across the system"", it added. Labour said the situation was a ""total shambles"" and the government should help people ""trying to do the right thing"" by ordering tests. What are the rules for new year? How many cases are in my area Live updates: No plans to cut self-isolation further Omicron cases now constitute more than 90% of all community Covid cases in England, the UKHSA said on Wednesday. A total of 10,462 people were in hospital with Covid in England as of Wednesday morning, according to figures from NHS England. This is up 48% from a week ago and is the highest number of admissions since 1 March. Not all the patients in hospital will have been admitted for Covid - latest data suggests about three in 10 have the virus but were admitted to hospital for something else. The number of people with Covid in hospital has risen above 10,000 in England for the first time in nearly 10 months. There are currently 10, 462 patients with the virus in hospital. That is the highest level since the start of March - and means the numbers have risen by 2,000 in just two days. Admissions for Covid are rising, the weekly average is more than 50% higher than it was a week ago. But other factors are likely to have contributed to the increase, including a drop in the numbers being discharged. Last Christmas the numbers leaving hospital more than halved as it is more difficult to discharge patients over the festive period. It means there are likely to be hundreds of patients in hospital who have recovered from Covid but just have not left yet. The proportion of hospitalisations for what is known as an incidental admission is also growing and contributing to the increase. These are people being treated for something else, but happen to have Covid. Last week, these cases accounted for around three in 10 patients in hospital, but the expectation is this will have increased by now. But the numbers who are acutely unwell with Covid are still going up and it could be the end of January before they peak. Hospital cases are though rising more slowly than cases, once again showing the Omicron variant is leading to milder illness. The latest daily Covid case number stands at a record 117,093. Partial data from the UK nations means a full national picture will only be available again in the first week of January. The warnings about the supply of rapid lateral flow Covid tests come after several changes to self-isolation rules. Those who test positive for Covid can now leave home after seven days - as long as they test negative via lateral flow devices on day six and seven - in England. And fully-vaccinated close contacts of positive cases, including those in the same household, can go about their daily lives as normal with a daily negative lateral flow test in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Association Of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a very high demand for lateral flow tests since the changes. ""Every five minutes, approximately, somebody comes into the pharmacy and asks for tests,"" she said. ""But unfortunately because of the issues around supply being patchy and inconsistent it means that those who come forward for the test don't always get it, which is very stressful not just for the pharmacy but also for the patients."" Thorrun Govind, chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in England, said having an online collection code for lateral flow tests does not guarantee they will be in stock at a chemists. She also urged the public not to become angry with pharmacy staff and pleaded for patience amid the increased demand.

Lateral flow tests are alsoavailable to order online,externalfor delivery through Royal Mail - but many people have reported problems placing orders, with the website often saying ""sorry, there are no home delivery slots left for rapid lateral flow tests right now"". The UKHSA said ""exceptionally high demand"" for Covid PCR appointments - tests used to confirm a positive lateral flow result - could lead to temporary reduced availability in some areas but currently there are tests available to book online. ""We have made 100,000 more PCR booking slots available per day since mid-December and we are continuing to rapidly expand capacity, with over half a million tests carried out on 23 December alone."" The agency also said Christmas post schedules could be impact deliveries - but work and pensions minister Chloe Smith said people should ""persevere"" in their efforts to secure Covid tests. Separately, record demand for Covid PCR testshas left some people waiting up to five daysfor results in Scotland. In other developments: Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people who have not been fully vaccinated were ""eight times more likely"" to get seriously ill with Covid Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, said staff absence ""is a huge issue for the NHS right now"" Health Secretary Sajid Javidcriticised restrictions in Wales after group run organisers Parkruncancelled meets following the introduction of fresh Covid curbs there People in Scotland have been urged not to travel to England for new year celebrationsas doing so would go against the ""spirit"" of restrictions, the Scottish government says. Free-to-order rapid tests are seen as a crucial way to keep safe as Covid cases surge. Countries like the US have scrambled to follow the UK's lead in providing mass lateral flow tests free of charge. They are useful in showing whether a person is infectious - providing trustworthy results in just 30 minutes. They are used: To allow people with Covid to leave isolation after seven days - by testing negative on day six and seven - in England By those in close contact with Covid cases to avoid isolation through daily rapid testing in England, Wales and Northern Ireland To reassure people without symptoms they are not infectious before seeing vulnerable relatives or attending new year gatherings In secondary schools, which require regular rapid testing, as well as some workplaces There have been calls by some scientists and business leaders for the government to follow theexample of US health officialsand reduce the isolation period in England for people with asymptomatic Covid, to five days. But a government spokesperson said the current isolation period - which was recently lowered from 10 to seven days - remained ""critical for limiting the spread of the virus"". They said: ""There are no further changes to the isolation period planned at this time, but we keep all rules under review based on the latest health data"". Unlike Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the government has decided against introducing new Covid measures in England ahead of the new year.

How to avoid being scammed onlineWhat's your Lord or Lady name? Who was your first pet? These are questions that could cost you.Wales,"We are too used to giving away information freely on social media, says one psychologist What is your rock star name? Can you remember your first pet? What's the first gig you went to? If questions like this pop up when you're scrolling through social media online, you should think twice before answering, a consumer group has warned. TheUK's fraud reporting service,externalsaid Â£2.5bn has been stolen in more than 480,000 cyber crimes in the past year. And Which? estimates online crime in the UK increased 33% since the start of the Covid pandemic. Adam French, senior consumer editor at Which?, warned cyber crime would only increase over Christmas and the new year period as more people shop and socialising online. Police pressure as Covid 'changes crime landscape' Fraud warning for young: 'I had Â£700 stolen' Student hacker jailed for selling exam answers Of Action Fraud's almost half a million reported crimes, more than 90,000 were online shopping or auction scams, and in Wales,fraud reports rose by a quarterduring the first year of the pandemic. Senior consumer rights editor Mr French said although people have some idea how they can be scammed online, there were many new ways in which they may be caught out. ""Unfortunately, online scams can happen, a number of different ways, but at the heart of it is usually fake content, whether that's search engine adverts which crops up, when you're looking for the next best investment opportunity, an ad targeting you on social media or sites selling you really lovely clothes at a bargain price. ""There are so many different ways that scammers can come at you, one of the worst is where you think you're talking to a real person."" He said criminals were building much more realistic sites to scam people, particularly after ""a real explosion of online shopping"" in the last couple of years. Asking for personal information to scam people online is called phishing. Mr French said the types of questions may seem irrelevant at first, but could help someone trying to guess your security questions. Adam French, senior consumer editor at Which?, says there are so many different ways people can be caught out online ""Those kind of quizzes and those personality type tests may seem a little bit of fun, but actually the information out there in the public domain can ultimately be used against you and it's something we do recommend people avoid participating in, even if it does seem like just a bit of fun,"" he said. He explained what made the problem worse was so many cyber crimes went unreported due to many not knowing how to report it, or feeling embarrassed they fell for a scam. ""You wouldn't be embarrassed if you've been the victim of doorstep crime or you had been robbed,"" he said. ""People report it straight to the police to get it dealt with and that's exactly the same mentality we need, ""They are very intelligent criminals and they are good at what they do."" Mr French said big tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, ""have a responsibility to ensure that the advertising they're being paid to promote to you isn't fraudulent"". ""I don't think that's a big ask and that will go big long way to protecting us from fraudulent messaging reaching our eyes in the first place."" According to a psychologist Martin Graff, it is all down to our relationship with being online. ""The very innocuous questions are the kind of quizzes we would see on Facebook anyway, so people just dive into these things without giving them a lot of thought,"" said Mr Graff, of the University of South Wales. ""It is what we might call low level disclosure and is almost sort of chit-chat stuff. ""You would happily tell someone you just met in a pub what your favourite ice cream is and it's no big deal really is just to say those kind of things."" Psychologist Martin Graff said people know they should not give out their information online but are used to it with social media He explained there was a ""privacy paradox"", with people who give away information like this, in that people know they should not give away information online but ""there is a bit of a mismatch between what we actually believe and what we do"". Often people forget there is a ""real person on the other side of the computer"" and the willingness to give away information like this online is mirrored in our approach to social media. ""You wouldn't go outside and shout the same information you write on Facebook down the road with a megaphone which is essentially what you're doing when making an announcement on social media isn't it.""

"Cost of living squeeze in 2022, predicts think tank","Millions of families are facing a ""year of the squeeze"" in 2022, a think tank has warned. The Resolution Foundation predicts higher energy bills, stagnant wages and tax rises could leave households with a Â£1,200 a year hit to their incomes. Itsreport,externalhighlights the rise in the energy price cap and National Insurance contributions in April. The government says it has put Â£4.2bn in place to support families. According to the Resolution Foundation, millions of families are facing a ""cost-of-living catastrophe"" next year. It says a 1.25% increase in National Insurance contributions will cost the average household Â£600 a year while the higher energy bills cap is expected to add an additional Â£500 to spending. Both will come into force in April. The impact of the failure of many firms in the energy sector would see another Â£100 added to gas and electricity bills. Customers of collapsed energy companies have been shifted to new suppliers but it means they could pay a different - and potentially more expensive - tariff than their previous energy deal. UK prices rise at fastest rate in 10 years National Insurance: Whatâs the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? Urgent action needed on energy prices - Ovo boss In recent months, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. Last week, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about Â£2,000 next year. Earlier this week, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng met bosses from the UK's energy companies and the industry's regulator Ofgem ""to discuss the ongoing effects of record high global gas prices on the sector"". Labour has suggested the government immediately remove VAT from household energy bills over winter to help households. Stephen Fitzpatrick, chief executive of Ovo Energy, who attended the virtual meeting on Monday, also suggested the government should remove ""some of the environmental social policy costs that we have seen increase over the years"". Meanwhile, the cost of living in the UK surged by 5.1% in the 12 months to November - the highest increase in 10 years - Office for National Statistics data showed. Inflation is set to peak at 6% in the spring, according to the Bank of England, and the Resolution Foundation warned that real wage growth, which was flat in October, ""almost certainly started falling last month and is unlikely to start growing again until the final quarter of 2022"". Resolution Foundation chief executive Torsten Bell, said: ""The overall picture is likely to be one of prices surging and pay packets stagnating."" He told the BBC that the UK employment market had shown signs of resilience during the pandemic following the end of the government's furlough scheme on 30 September, with the unemployment rate close to pre-Covid levels at 4.2%. He also highlighted that the national living wage will rise in April, by 6.6%, which he said means ""the lowest earners will be protected from some of these price rises we are seeing"". However, Mr Bell said that while some areas of the workforce have seen sharp wage rises - such as in-demand HGV drivers - ""overall the story is prices going up for everybody while wages go up for some"". Mr Bell said Chancellor Rishi Sunak could face increased pressure to take action to alleviatehis economic plan set out in the Autumn Budget. The report by the foundation says that poorer families are going to be the worse hit by the ""year of the squeeze"", as they spend a higher proportion of their income on energy. A government spokesman said its help included reducing the Universal Credit taper, as well as measures to assist with bills, including cold weather payments and a freeze in alcohol and fuel duty.
