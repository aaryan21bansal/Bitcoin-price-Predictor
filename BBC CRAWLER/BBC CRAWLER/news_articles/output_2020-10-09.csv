Paul Heaton praised for 'lovely' Q Magazine gesture,"The singer has recorded dozens of hits with the Housemartins, The Beautiful South and Jacqui Abbott Singer Paul Heaton has been praised for his generosity, after the final editor of Q Magazine revealed how he supported staff when the publication closed. Writing on Twitter, Ted Kessler explained how the star made a large donation to the magazine, which was shared amongst 40 staff. ""It really was the most amazingly kind, selfless, generous act,"" he said. ""For some, it meant a bill could be paid."" In thanks, the staff commissioned a Q Award to honour the star. Receiving it on Friday, Heaton thanked the magazine for its support and the ""kind words"" about his donation. ""It was just meant to make sure people weren't left on their arse,"" he said in a video posted to Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Kessler, who was at the helm of Q Magazine when it closed in July, shared the story on what would have been the date of the annual Q award ceremony. ""We had the Roundhouse booked for two nights for the Q Awards next week,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""We didn't have talent sorted when we had to Covid cancel in April, but Nadine Shah was presenting and the two gigs were Liam Gallagher one night, Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott the other. ""The only award we knew for sure was to Paul Heaton, as we'd heard he'd never won one. ""Think of all the brilliant songs he's written for The Housemartins, Beautiful South, etc. Millions of records sold. No Q award (or Brit) for his songwriting. So we knew he'd be Classic Songwriter. Q Magazine to close after 34 years Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott to play free NHS gig Life after The Beautiful South ""Then, a few days after Q closed, we got a message from him saying that to thank Q for all the support we'd given him over 35 years, he was going to donate a large sum to thank us in our turmoil. Obviously, I politely declined. ""He was insistent. I accepted the donation and shared it amongst over 40 staff and freelancers working for Q at the time, all of whose minds - like mine - were blown."" Posting a photo of Heaton's award, Kessler concluded: ""We got him that award in the end. Britain's greatest living pop star. A true legend."" Allow Twitter content?

Heaton, who was formerly a member of the Housemartins and The Beautiful South, is known for his generosity. In 2017, he revealed that he had offered all the royalties from his back catalogue to the government - meaning that every time a hit like Happy Hour, Rotterdam or Perfect 10 was played, the money would be used to fund schools and the NHS. ""I felt I'd made enough money from them, I didn't want to nationalise my savings, as such, I was just saying this was a gift to the British public,"" he told Channel 5's Matthew Wright programme. However, he said, the offer was turned down. The star was also due to play a free concert for NHS staff on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis next week, along with his current singing partner Jacqui Abbott.

Business owners 'in tears' over cafe status,"Business owners desperate to stay open have been reduced to tears over the definition of cafes by the Scottish government. New Covid restrictions went live at 18:00 on Friday, resulting in the closure of pubs and restaurants in the central belt until at least 25 October. The one exception is for cafes which can open during the day. A last-minute scramble for legal advice has seen businesses try to fit the definition. Restaurants 'cannot turn themselves into cafes' Shutters to come down on pubs and restaurants New alcohol rules 'will cost thousands of jobs' Stephen McGowan is a licensing solicitor at TLT in Glasgow. He told BBC Scotland his phone was ""red hot"" with clients on Friday afternoon asking how they fitted into the definition. He said: ""The definition Nicola Sturgeon gave puts us in a better place than before with something to work with but it is still open to interpretation. ""There has been disappointment for thousands of businesses who thought they had the opportunity to stay open."" He added: ""Some clients fit the definition or are close enough to it that I am comfortable with them opening and some I have had to say sorry, but I don't think you are near enough. ""I have had tears on the phone and it has been difficult listening to operators I have known for years."" He said the first minister specifically saying two key things is what shut down many of their hopes: anyone confused about whether they are a cafe or not should close while they seek clarification, and that the regulations are not intended to allow bars and restaurants to convert into cafes. The big question is which businesses can remain open as cafes? The Scottish government definition is this: ""An establishment whose primary business activity, in the ordinary course of its business, is the sale of non-alcoholic drinks, snacks or light meals."" But Nicola Sturgeon said more about what it was not than what it was. She said restaurants and bars could not convert themselves into cafes in a bid to stay open. She said the business may or may not have a licence to sell alcohol, but they must not sell it while they are open. And she said if there is any doubt about whether a business is a cafe or not, it should have closed at 18:00 on Friday and remain closed while seeking clarification from the local authority. Paul Waterson from the Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA) says the situation was no clearer than it was on Thursday. He said: ""There is one licence for all premises who sell alcohol and there is no differentiation between restaurants, pubs, bars and so on. This explanation has caused more questions than answers. ""When does a restaurant become a cafe? When does a pub become a restaurant? When does a bar become a pub? It's a ridiculous situation. "" And then to say the reason cafes can open is to allow social interaction between people when we are closed to stop social interaction beggars belief. People are asking us what a licensed cafe is."" Mr Waterson said he would not want to see owners breaking the rules, but said: ""It is very difficult when businesses are in real trouble to get them to conform to situations. ""If your business is under threat you will do everything you can to save it. ""What are we going to tell these people whose businesses are ready to close and they won't get through the next two weeks?"" James Withers of trade body Scotland Food & Drink, said: ""Many cafes, restaurants and eateries in central Scotland have spent Friday trying to work out if they have to close for 16 days. ""It has been a nightmare for them trying to interpret new regulations, coming out just hours before a potential closure, whilst they are trying to manage their staff rotas and the ordering or cancellation of supplies. I genuinely worry about the mental health impact of the last few days."" Tighter restrictions will also come into force in the rest of the country with licensed premises unable to serve alcohol indoors and operating limited opening hours.

'I altered my personality to fit in at work',"The BBC spoke to four diversity champions The lack of ethnic diversity at the top of UK companies is coming under increasing focus, with calls for change from big business groups and investors. Surveys continue to show that black, Asian, or minority ethnic (BAME) peopleare under-represented in senior positions.,external But some succeed, and then turn their drive and passion to helping others. The BBC has spoken to four of them. Pavita Cooper said she altered who she was to fit in Pavita Cooper runs More Difference, a recruitment and consultancy firm that promotes diversity. Working at blue-chip firms for more than 25 years she never felt discriminated against. But after she left, she realised she had been altering her personality to ""fit in"". ""I had adapted who I was to fit the environment,"" Pavita says. ""I presented a version of myself that would fit in with them."" ""I'm a Sikh, and faith is important to me,"" she adds. ""But I made an assumption I should be just like them."" Despite under-representation, she says people with an Asian background tend to have an easier time getting to the top of large firms than black people. ""If you're black, generally the experience is worse,"" she says. What's more, there's a ""hierarchy of race"", she says, with ""very black women"" having the toughest time of all. One way to solve this problem is to make ethnic minority pay gap reporting mandatory, to force executives to act, she says. Funke Abimbola says she missed out on job opportunities because of her African name One black woman who managed to get into high-flying jobs in the UK is lawyer, consultant, and campaigner Funke Abimbola. She experienced discrimination working in the legal profession, even though she had what she describes as a ""privileged"" upbringing. ""I had to put in a lot more effort to get my foot in the door,"" she says. She refused to change her African name, even though she says she missed out on job opportunities because of it. Company boards 'must have at least one BAME member' L&G demands diversity on FTSE boards Black History Month: Images of strength and beauty And she says she had to deal with micro-aggressions - everyday slights and indignities - on a daily basis. For example, a client once used a racial slur in a meeting. ""When he said it, he knew I was black,"" she says. As she climbed higher up the ladder, she was criticised as being ""too assertive"" by executives. ""White male leaders can't deal with it,"" she says. ""They say I am 'over-promoting' myself."" She says black people in business face ""systemic barriers"" such as low expectations about their potential, and that because there are so few in top businesses, black people get scrutinised more. You have to have ""real steel"" to progress, she says. Dawid Konotey-Ahulu was told he wouldn't be joining a barristers chamber Entrepreneur Dawid Konotey-Ahulu is involved in initiatives to try to improve workplace diversity. He started out as a lawyer before having a successful City career, but says he faced extra hurdles compared with white people. In the 1980s he was training to be a barrister and managed to get what's known as a ""pupillage"" - a kind of internship - at a Middle Temple chamber in London. It is usual for such interns to be offered a tenancy at the chamber - a job - after completing this training. But Dawid was told he wouldn't be in the running because there was already one black barrister there. ""The bar is shockingly unrepresentative,"" he says. Dawid, who is one of the co-founders of consultancy Redington, said his time working in investment banking was less discriminatory. However, black people are still under-represented in Britain's financial heart, he says. ""I spent a lot of time working with pension funds. You don't see a lot of people who look like me."" Company boards 'must have at least one BAME member' There are various obstacles to success for black people, which Dawid likens to ""kinks in a hose"". Once you sort those kinks out, the water can flow freely again, he says. Obstacles include few mentors and role models for black children and numerous reasons executives give for not hiring and promoting black people. ""You have to say to 11-year-olds: 'You see those tall, shiny buildings over there [in the City]? There's a seat for you there',"" he says. Senior executives say the black talent pool is too small for senior positions - a situation which has become self-fulfilling - and that skin colour shouldn't matter, as they just want to hire the best people. He says this argument only works if there is a level playing field to begin with - but there isn't. He also says some senior executives use the BAME acronym as a smokescreen. Firms can ""muddy the water"" by saying they are hiring BAME people, and yet can predominantly be hiring Asian people - who already have more representation in the City than black people. David Wallis says micro-aggressions knock people's confidence There are also people working inside companies to try to change the situation. David Wallis is a partner at accountancy firm Deloitte, and helped to launch the company's ""black action plan"", which aims to educate people within the company and to nurture black talent. He too has experienced micro-aggressions from clients. David's father is British and his mother is from Ghana, and his name comes from his father's side. When he meets some clients for the first time there is an ""audible gasp"" because ""I don't fit the stereotype of what a 'David Wallis' looks like"", he says. The problem with such reactions is the feeling of not being accepted, he says. ""As human beings we need to be part of a group,"" he says. ""Micro-aggressions show you're not part of the group, and that can have wide-ranging consequences."" They can dent confidence, he says, and even contribute to mental health issues.

Premier League introduces Â£15 pay-per-view,"Premier League football has been played behind closed doors since the competition resumed in June Premier League games not selected for broadcast in October will be available to fans on a pay-per-view basis. The five fixtures per round not already picked to be shown live, will be available on BT Sport Box Office or Sky Sports Box Office, priced at Â£14.95. Clubs have agreed this ""interim solution"" to allow fans to continue watching their teams live. Premier League clubs voted 19-1 in favour of the move, with Leicester City the only one to vote against it. The move has drawn criticism from football supporters, while the Premier League said it and its clubs ""remain committed to the safe return of fans as soon as possible"". Ex-Liverpool chief critical of Government over fan return Spectators have been unable to attend Premier League games since football was halted on 13 March because of the coronavirus pandemic. The top flight resumed on 17 June with the remaining 92 games of last season being played behind closed doors and the opening games of this season have followed suit. The Premier League and UK government had hoped to bring fans back into stadiums from 1 October but those plans were scrapped following an increase in coronavirus cases. Sky Sports managing director Rob Webster said: ""Our subscribers still get more than 140 of the very best matches, while supporters of individual clubs won't have to miss out on any games during this period."" BT Sport said fans without a subscription would still be able to access their Box Office service. Former Manchester United and England right-back Gary Neville, now a Sky pundit, said on social media it was a ""really bad move"" by the Premier League. In a statement, the Football Supporters' Association urged broadcasters to ""reconsider their pricing"". ""Today's announcement shows that fan power works,"" the FSA said. ""At the start of this season the Premier League and its broadcasters had planned to leave match-going fans entirely locked out of their side's matches; now thanks to the sustained pressure of our #LetUsWatch campaign all games will be available for fans. ""Many Premier League clubs have already taken money from fans for matches they can't attend, so we urge them to get refunds out to those supporters as soon as possible, particularly season ticket holders."" Alex Hurst, the chair of Newcastle United's Supporters Trustsaid:,external""The idea that Premier League clubs need to implement PPV because of economic needs would carry more weight if they hadn't just spent Â£1bn on players, furloughed staff, received government loans, weren't charging fans for games they aren't going to and hadn't just made thousands of staff redundant."" Supporters of EFL clubs can buy match passes to watch their teams for Â£10 using the iFollow service. BBC sports editor Dan Roan Ever since last season resumed, all Premier League matches have been available to watch live via the top flight's broadcast partners. This was partly to help the government encourage fans to stay at home while games stayed behind closed doors, rather than congregating outside grounds or in pubs. But having had their hopes of a partial return of fans inside grounds from 1 October dashed, despite the success of pilot events, the clubs have had enough of generating nothing from these matches. Their annoyance at being told turnstiles must remain shut when pressure is also building on them to come up with a bailout for the EFL, is likely to have hardened their stance. But after clubs spent more than Â£1bn in the summer transfer window, and at a time when many supporters will be struggling financially, there will be anger about having to pay Â£15 for matches fans had grown used to watching for no extra cost, on top of their subscriptions for Sky and BT. Those who have also bought season tickets will be particularly infuriated. I understand the Premier League's move has raised eyebrows within government, and clubs will now come under renewed pressure to refund season ticket holders, and perhaps reduce the pay-per-view cost going forward.

Two-thirds pay at firms told to shut over Covid,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: Expansion of Job Support Scheme is a ""safety net"" Employees who work for UK firms forced to shut by law because of coronavirus restrictions are to get two-thirds of their wages paid for by the government. The scheme, announced by Rishi Sunak, begins on 1 November for six months and a Treasury source said it could cost hundreds of millions of pounds a month. A restrictions update, which could see pubs and restaurants shut in the worst-affected areas, is expected on Monday. Leaders in areas now under restrictions said the scheme did not go far enough. In a statement, the mayors of Greater Manchester, North Tyne, Sheffield and Liverpool said: ""We are pleased that the government has listened and recognised that any new system of restrictions must come with a substantial package of financial support."" But they said it was only a ""start"" and more help was needed ""to prevent genuine hardship, job losses and business failure this winter"". The announcement comes just a fortnight after the governmentunveiled its Job Support Scheme- replacing the furlough scheme - to top up the wages of staff who have not been able to return to the workplace full time. Firms say fresh wage subsidy may 'cushion the blow' How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Will I still be paid if there is a lockdown? What are the Covid restrictions where I live? NI records more than 1,000 new Covid-19 cases The latest scheme will only apply to businesses told to close - rather than those who choose to shut because of the broader impact of Covid restrictions. The support will be reviewed in January. Until November businesses that are asked to close can continue to use the existing furlough scheme. The grants will be paid up to a maximum of Â£2,100 per employee a month and the Treasury said they would protect jobs and enable businesses to reopen quickly once restrictions are lifted. One pub manager in Otley, West Yorkshire, said the scheme ""doesn't even touch the sides"" in terms of its impact on pubs. ""Two-thirds of somebody's wage isn't going to cut it,"" said Mel Green, 41, of The Black Bull. ""We're in a trade where everyone's on national minimum wage pretty much. They're the ones that are losing out. A lot of them are living hand to mouth already and they've already had hours reduced."" The chancellor said thelatest measures,externalfor companies forced to shut would provide ""reassurance and a safety net for people and businesses in advance of what may be a difficult winter"". In addition, for businesses forced to close in England, Mr Sunak announced an increase in business grants - with up to Â£3,000 a month paid every fortnight. The Treasury says the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive increased funding allowing them to bring in similar measures if they choose to. It is a sign of how quickly the coronavirus situation has soured that the chancellor is having to return to a policy he thought he'd parked less than two weeks ago when he announced his Winter Economic Plan. The government insists this is not a retread of the furlough scheme, which is due to expire at the end of this month, but in all important aspects this is furlough mark two. The crucial bit is that small employers will not have to make any contribution to their workers' wages if they are legally forced to shut down. Larger businesses will have to contribute about 5% of employee costs in the form of National Insurance and pension contributions. That is much more generous than the expiring furlough scheme and way more generous than the Job Support Scheme Mr Sunak announced 10 days ago, which requires employers to pay 55% of active workers' salaries. The reason for that is simple - those measures applied to businesses that were allowed to be open. This new scheme only applies to businesses which are not. Other questions are not simple - who will be eligible? What about businesses that were never allowed to reopen since March? Will it be applied by postcode? Will you be able to walk 10 minutes down the road to go to the pub that is open but having to pay 55% of staff wages when it's less than half full? And perhaps most importantly for the expected ""beneficiaries"" of this scheme - the hospitality industry - how strong is the evidence on which this policy is based and can we see it in detail? Labour said the government's ""rather slow, incompetent, dithering response"" had caused ""unnecessary anxiety and job losses"". Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds welcomed the measures but called for further changes to the scheme to incentivise employers to keep more of their staff on. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The CBI business lobby group said the scheme ""should cushion the blow for the most affected and keep more people in work"". ""But many firms, including pubs and restaurants, will still be hugely disappointed if they have to close their doors again after doing so much to keep customers and staff safe,"" added CBI boss Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. Federation of Small Businesses boss Mike Cherry said the extra help for closed businesses would be ""welcomed by thousands of small businesses"". Shop workers' trade union Usdaw said it was concerned retailers facing reduced business in an area subject to the new restrictions would not benefit from the scheme. Meanwhile, the number of people in the UK to have tested positive for coronavirus rose by 13,864 - a decrease of 3,676 on Thursday's figures - with a further 87 deaths reported on thegovernment's dashboard.,external The chancellor described his announcement as ""a very different scheme to what we've had before, this is not a universal approach, this is an expansion of the job support scheme specifically for those people who are in businesses that will be formally or legally asked to close"". Asked whether the announcement suggested the government was going to ask businesses, such as those in hospitality, to shut, Mr Sunak said: ""The rise in cases and hospital admissions in certain parts of the country is a concern. ""It's right the government considers a range of options... but it's also right they engage with local leaders. ""That is what's happening this afternoon and over the weekend so those conversations can happen and collectively we can decide on the appropriate response."" This video can not be played The shadow chancellor welcomes a âU-turnâ by the government to pay workers made to stay at home in any new lockdowns. The Job Support Scheme, which will replace the furlough scheme from 1 November, will see eligible workers get three quarters of their normal salaries for six months. To qualify, employees must be in a ''viable job'' where they can work for at least one-third of their normal hours. For the hours not worked, the government and employer will each pay one-third of the remaining wages. This means the employee would get at least 77% of their pay. Pubs and restaurants could be closed in the worst-affected areas under new measures A tiered system of measures for England is expected to be announced by Monday, in an effort to stall rising infection rates, to replace the patchwork of existing rules across the country. Under the new system, different parts of the country would be placed in different categories - although ministers are still discussing the precise details. Pubs and restaurants could be closed in the worst-affected areas, including parts of northern England and the Midlands, while a ban on overnight stays is also being considered.

Paul Heaton praised for 'lovely' Q Magazine gestureThe Beautiful South star helped pay staff's wages after the magazine was shut down.Entertainment & Arts,"The singer has recorded dozens of hits with the Housemartins, The Beautiful South and Jacqui Abbott Singer Paul Heaton has been praised for his generosity, after the final editor of Q Magazine revealed how he supported staff when the publication closed. Writing on Twitter, Ted Kessler explained how the star made a large donation to the magazine, which was shared amongst 40 staff. ""It really was the most amazingly kind, selfless, generous act,"" he said. ""For some, it meant a bill could be paid."" In thanks, the staff commissioned a Q Award to honour the star. Receiving it on Friday, Heaton thanked the magazine for its support and the ""kind words"" about his donation. ""It was just meant to make sure people weren't left on their arse,"" he said in a video posted to Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Kessler, who was at the helm of Q Magazine when it closed in July, shared the story on what would have been the date of the annual Q award ceremony. ""We had the Roundhouse booked for two nights for the Q Awards next week,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""We didn't have talent sorted when we had to Covid cancel in April, but Nadine Shah was presenting and the two gigs were Liam Gallagher one night, Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott the other. ""The only award we knew for sure was to Paul Heaton, as we'd heard he'd never won one. ""Think of all the brilliant songs he's written for The Housemartins, Beautiful South, etc. Millions of records sold. No Q award (or Brit) for his songwriting. So we knew he'd be Classic Songwriter. Q Magazine to close after 34 years Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott to play free NHS gig Life after The Beautiful South ""Then, a few days after Q closed, we got a message from him saying that to thank Q for all the support we'd given him over 35 years, he was going to donate a large sum to thank us in our turmoil. Obviously, I politely declined. ""He was insistent. I accepted the donation and shared it amongst over 40 staff and freelancers working for Q at the time, all of whose minds - like mine - were blown."" Posting a photo of Heaton's award, Kessler concluded: ""We got him that award in the end. Britain's greatest living pop star. A true legend."" Allow Twitter content?

""I felt I'd made enough money from them, I didn't want to nationalise my savings, as such, I was just saying this was a gift to the British public,"" he told Channel 5's Matthew Wright programme. However, he said, the offer was turned down. The star was also due to play a free concert for NHS staff on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis next week, along with his current singing partner Jacqui Abbott.

New Asda owners honoured,"Zuber and Mohsin Issa Two billionaire brothers from Blackburn have been made CBEs a week after clinching a Â£6.8bn deal to buy the Asda supermarket chain from Walmart. Mohsin and Zuber Issa were among a number of business bosses on the Queen's Birthday Honours list. GlaxoSmithkline chief executive Emma Walmsley was made a dame for services to the pharmaceutical industry. The drugs firm is one of about 20 that is part of a global race to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The billionaire Issa brothers started their business 20 years ago with one rented petrol station and grew it into a network of nearly 6,000 forecourts across 10 countries. It was announced last week that the Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital wouldtake a majority stake in Asda. Walmart said that, under the new owners, Asda will invest Â£1bn in the supermarket over the next three years. A number of honours were awarded to people for their work during the coronavirus pandemic, including Ms Walmsley. She was given a damehood for services to the pharmaceutical industry and business after leading the UK's biggest drugs manufacturer for the past three years. Emma Walmsley has been chief executive of GlaxoSmithkline since 2017 GlaxoSmithkline (GSK) is part of the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine, and said last week it hadstarted clinical trialswith fellow drugs firm Sanofi. As chief executive, Ms Walmsley has been instrumental in the company's involvement in international efforts to develop a vaccine. Property tycoon Tony Gallagher was given a knighthood in relation to his service to ""land development and the property business"". The Gallagher Estates founder is a friend of former Prime Minister David Cameron and a major donor to the Conservative party. Andrew Mackenzie, the former chief executive officer of mining giant BHP Billiton, was made a Knight Bachelor for services to business, science, technology and to UK and Australia relations. Clare Woodman the chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley International was given a CBE for services to finance.

PM to detail stricter Covid restrictions on Monday,"Liverpool is expected to be placed under severe new restrictions next week The prime minister is to make a statement to MPs on Monday giving details of new restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus in England. A letter from Boris Johnson's adviser to MPs in the North West seen by the BBC says it is ""very likely"" some areas will face further restrictions. But some regional leaders warn the new plan for a three-tier local lockdown system will only create more confusion. It comes as a doctors' union calls for clearer and more stringent rules. Under the new restrictions, pubs and restaurants could be closed in parts of northern England and the Midlands - where some of the highest numbers of cases are occurring - while a ban on overnight stays is also being considered. It is understood that the most severe measures - imposed for areas in tier three - would be agreed with local leaders in advance. The details of each tier, including the level of infection at which an area would qualify for it and the nature of the restrictions, are being debated this weekend. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmersaid,externalit was grossly irresponsible for anonymous government sources to tell newspapers on Thursday about plans for further restrictions on millions of people, without any detail, consultation or statement from the prime minister. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? How many cases are there in my area? Covid cases increase rapidly as next steps planned The letter to the MPs from Downing Street's chief strategic adviser Sir Edward Lister says the government is hoping to ""finalise these details as soon as possible"" amid ""rising incidence in parts of the country"". It also cites the ""engagement that is taking place today and during the course of the weekend with local authority leaders in your region"". Sir Edward says the set of measures being discussed ""present difficult choices. We must seek to strike the right balance between driving down transmission, and safeguarding our economy and society from the worst impact"". In the face of pressure from MPs, elected mayors and council leaders, the prime minister has signalled he wants ""much closer engagement"" with local politicians. As a senior government source said, they will bring ""expertise on what will work in their regions"". The hope is for ""top tier"" restrictions in the new multi-level system to be agreed between the government and local leaders in advance. There is an acknowledgement from inside government that this marks a change in approach. It is a shift away from what Labour described as a ""Whitehall knows best"" attitude. It will allow local politicians, some of whom until now have complained of being frozen out, to have a greater input. But it will also mean they are accountable, alongside government ministers, for the success or failure of the measures introduced. They will have to share the responsibility, perhaps blame, if measures don't work or prove unpopular. And amid calls for clarity, it seems the new tiered system could vary region by region, making clear national messaging more difficult. Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England's national infection service, said the number of cases was rising all over the country, but more quickly in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber than the South. She said it was concerning that cases were rising ""quite fast"" in pockets of north-west England among the over-60s, the group most likely to need to be admitted to hospital. A number of areas in the North West, the North East and the Midlands are already subject to stricter restrictions. A tiered system of measures is designed to replace the patchwork of existing rules across the country. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions there needed to be ""greater freedom for local areas to design measures for themselves"". He said there was ""a merit to simplicity"", adding that in local areas ""local leaders will know best"". Liverpool's Labour Mayor Joe Anderson said he expected Liverpool - where there are currently 600 cases per 100,000 people - to be placed in tier three, under the highest set of restrictions. He told the BBC's Today programme he understood this would involve the lockdown of all the city's pubs from Wednesday. He said the government was wrong to allow Liverpool's bars and pubs to stay open this weekend, with infection rates so high. He accepted people in the city should take individual responsibility and said he was ""angry and frustrated"" at those flouting the rules, but added: ""I'm not convinced people trust the government's decisions."" Asked what his role would be in setting the restrictions, he said there had been conversation with Downing Street, but no consultation. It was clear the decisions had already been made, he said, but they were listening to his suggestions about how spikes in the city could best be dealt with. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Martin Gannon, Labour leader of Gateshead Council, said there had been ""warm words"" in a meeting with civil servants but ultimately the laws would be made by government. He said he would oppose any further restrictions placed on the North East, saying they could be ""counter-productive"" and lead to resistance from the public. Current measures were starting to bring down case numbers, he insisted, and the government needed to help local authorities win people's confidence. And Glen Sanderson, Conservative leader of Northumberland County Council, said he did not want blanket restrictions on Northumberland, which has large rural areas ""virtually unaffected"" by the virus as well as towns where case numbers were rising. ""I don't think the argument is there to bring in much tougher restrictions - we have to take people with us. If we can't get people to conform, we won't make any progress,"" he told BBC News. Meanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) said the government's measures to reduce the spread of the virus had not worked, given the uncontrolled escalation, and has made its own recommendations. It wants to see masks worn in all offices and outdoors where two-metre distancing is not possible; free medical grade masks for the over-60s and vulnerable groups; financial support for businesses to become Covid-secure; and the ""rule of six"" tweaked to allow only two households to meet in groups of no more than six. Chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""The infection has risen following rapid relaxation of measures and with the Westminster government letting down its guard - as recently as August, the government was encouraging people to travel, go to work and mix in restaurants and pubs."" Speaking at the Co-operative Party virtual conference, Labour leader Sir Keir accused the government of serial incompetence, saying a test, trace and isolate system was ""critical"". Without that, ""thousands and thousands of people are walking around today who should be in self-isolation"", he warned. On Friday the number of people in the UK to have tested positive for coronavirus rose by 13,864 - a decrease of 3,676 on Thursday's figure - with a further 87 deaths reported on thegovernment's dashboard.,external TEST AND TRACE EXPOSED:Panorama hears from whistleblowers working on the coronavirus tracking system LOVE LIFE:Fancy an escape?

Footballer Marcus Rashford and fitness coach Joe Wicks are also recognised for their efforts during the pandemic, becoming MBEs on the delayed list. TV chef Mary Berry and actress Maureen Lipman are made dames, while actor David Suchet and veteran entertainer Tommy Steele are both knighted.

Honours for Mary Berry and Dizzee Rascal Rashford becomes MBE in birthday honours Billionaire brothers honoured after Asda takeover Knighthood for Grange Hill creator Phil Redmond Lorraine Kelly and Eve Muirhead honoured Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the recipients of this year's honours were ""a testament to the sort of country we are - caring, compassionate and resolute in the face of a global pandemic"". ""The hard work and dedication of these local, often unsung heroes has helped carry us through,"" he added. England player Rashford, whose award came for services to vulnerable children in the UK during the coronavirus epidemic, said becoming an MBE sounded ""a little bit strange but obviously I feel honoured"". The 22-year-old Manchester United forward successfully campaignedto extend free school meals over the summerafter pressing the government into a U-turn on the issue. This video can not be played Marcus Rashford said he felt ""honoured"" to be given an MBE ""Hopefully it inspires more people to do good things,"" Rashford said. ""It's a nice moment for me personally but I feel like I'm still at the beginning of the journey that I set out to try to achieve."" But he said his main focus now was on having the scheme extended. ""What I'd like to do, now that I'm in this position, is just speak directly to the prime minister and really ask for the vouchers to be extended at least until October half term, because I think that's what the families need,"" he said. Wicks, also known as The Body Coach, became the UK's PE teacher during the national lockdown by running free online classes every weekday for children and parents to keep fit. ""If you met me as a little boy you'd have thought 'he's not going to go anywhere, he's not going to do anything great', he said. ""But I've turned it around and I really am proud I've become this person who's helping people."" Welsh coronavirus response recognised with honours Honours for 'Covid-critical' broadband engineers Former NI civil service chief awarded knighthood Twelve-time world snooker champ made MBE Lockdown pub quizmaster becomes MBE He received an MBE for his home workouts, along with Mr Motivator - real name Derrick Evans - who rose to fame in the 1990s on GMTV and returned to the nation's TVs with his exercise classes. However, it is the ""unsung heroes"" of the pandemic, such as NHS and social care staff, fundraisers, shop workers, and drivers - of public transport and deliveries, which make up the majority of the 414 names who have been awarded for their ""exceptional contributions"" during the outbreak. Felicia Kwaku, from Islington, north London, who has been a nurse for 30 years, is among the health and social care workers which make up 14% of the total 1,495 recipients on the list. The 52-year-old, who is associate director of nursing at Kings College NHS Foundation Trust, championed the cause of nurses from a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) background, who were being disproportionately affected by the virus. She said it was an ""absolute honour"" to be made an OBE for services to nursing, adding that it wasn't just for her but also the ""nurses I work with and the ones who lost their lives"". Felicia Kwaku was awarded an OBE for services to nursing Fundraisers are also celebrated after millions of pounds were raised for charity during the crisis. Dabirul Islam Choudhury, from Bow, east London, said he was ""proud"" after becoming an OBE for raising more than Â£420,000 for coronavirus relief and said he ""thanked everybody from the bottom of my heart"". Mr Choudhury, who turns 101 in January, said he was inspired by another 100-year-old, Captain Sir Tom Moore, to walk almost 1,000 laps of his garden while fasting for Ramadan. Dabirul Islam Choudhury, 100, was made an OBE for his fundraising efforts Jay Flynn, whose weekly online quizzes became a lockdown phenomenon, gets an MBE Online quizzes became a feature of lockdown for many but for Jay Flynn, 38, from Darwen, Lancashire, his virtual pub quiz has seen him awarded an MBE for charitable service. The former pub landlord's quiz went viral with more than 180,000 people playing along at its peak - from as far afield as New Zealand and the US - and he raised more than Â£750,000 through donations. The huge voluntary effort across the country has also been reflected, with 72% of recipients awarded for their work in the community, including those who supplied free meals to those who were shielding, volunteering to help those at risk, and delivering care packages to NHS frontline workers. This video can not be played Mary Berry on damehood: ""I'll still be the same person"" Glasgow restaurant owner David Maguire, 62, who gave out free meals to NHS workers and vulnerable people, said it was a team effort but he was ""really pleased"" to have been made an MBE. The Cabinet Office said this year's list was the first to have 11% of recipients under 30, with 16-year-old Theodore Wride the youngest. He is awarded the BEM for service to his community in Sunderland during the pandemic. Several experts working in the science, health and pharmaceutical field have also been recognised for their efforts during the pandemic, including Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, who leads the Covid Symptom Study app. He is made an OBE. Meanwhile, six of the UK government's scientific advisers - who sit on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - have also been recognised. Prof Julia Gog, Prof Graham Medley, Prof Cath Noakes, Prof Lucy Yardley, Prof Calum Semple and Dr James Rubin have been made OBEs for services to the Covid-19 response. Former Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry, who was made a CBE in 2012 and has written more than 70 cookbooks, said becoming a dame was ""really the icing on the cake"". She added: ""When I was first told that I was going to be a dame you don't really believe it - then it's so exciting, and you feel very proud. It's such a huge honour."" David Suchet and Maureen Lipman have been recognised for their careers in acting Meanwhile, another national treasure, Sir David Attenborough, who was knighted in 1985, has been given an upgrade - receiving a Knight Grand Cross in the diplomatic list announced by the Foreign Office. The award, for service in a foreign country, is awarded for the 94-year-old's contribution to broadcasting and conservation. Two actors whose careers have spanned more than 50 years are both recognised. Coronation Street star Maureen Lipman, 74, gets a damehood, while David Suchet, best known for playing Hercule Poirot in the long-running Agatha Christie detective series, has received a knighthood. Also among the new knights is veteran entertainer Tommy Steele, 83, dubbed Britain's ""first rock and roll star"", who earned his first number one in 1957 with Singing the Blues. Brendan Foster, Eve Muirhead and Warren Gatland have been recognised from the world of sport Former BBC athletics commentator and long-distance runner Brendan Foster, 72, who founded the Great North Run, has been knighted for services to international and national sport and culture in the north east of England. Three Wales rugby union legends are also among the sports figures to be celebrated, with former head coach Warren Gatland, who led his team to a World Cup semi-final last year, becoming a CBE. Getting the same honour is former player Gareth Thomas, while Wales' most capped player, Alun Wyn Jones, is made an OBE. Jones said: ""I was initially reluctant to receive such an award in these trying times when there are so many people doing so much good for the community and are more worthy, but I see this as an acknowledgement to all the people who have helped me throughout my career."" MBEs also go to former England cricketer Darren Gough, Great Britain's Olympic curler Eve Muirhead, who led her team to bronze in 2014, and snooker player Reanne Evans, who became the first woman to compete against the world's best men. The creator of Grange Hill, Brookside and Hollyoaks, Phil Redmond, has been knighted for services to broadcasting and arts in the regions, while writer and director Sally Wainwright, who has been behind some of biggest television dramas in recent years, including Gentleman Jack, is made OBE.

The honours list is being hailed as the most diverse ever. Of the 1,495 recipients, 13% are from a BAME background and 6% have a disability. The list includes 740 women, which represents 49% of the total - down from 51% in the New Years Honours list last year. There are MBEs for rapper Dizzee Rascal and singer Mica Paris, who has recently joined the cast of Eastenders, while singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading and actor Adrian Lester are made CBEs. From the world of fashion, British designer Sir Paul Smith, who was knighted in 2000, is getting an upgrade after being appointed to the prestigious Order of the Companions of Honour.

We must seek to strike the right balance between driving down transmission, and safeguarding our economy and society from the worst impact"". In the face of pressure from MPs, elected mayors and council leaders, the prime minister has signalled he wants ""much closer engagement"" with local politicians. As a senior government source said, they will bring ""expertise on what will work in their regions"". The hope is for ""top tier"" restrictions in the new multi-level system to be agreed between the government and local leaders in advance. There is an acknowledgement from inside government that this marks a change in approach. It is a shift away from what Labour described as a ""Whitehall knows best"" attitude. It will allow local politicians, some of whom until now have complained of being frozen out, to have a greater input. But it will also mean they are accountable, alongside government ministers, for the success or failure of the measures introduced. They will have to share the responsibility, perhaps blame, if measures don't work or prove unpopular. And amid calls for clarity, it seems the new tiered system could vary region by region, making clear national messaging more difficult. Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England's national infection service, said the number of cases was rising all over the country, but more quickly in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber than the South. She said it was concerning that cases were rising ""quite fast"" in pockets of north-west England among the over-60s, the group most likely to need to be admitted to hospital. A number of areas in the North West, the North East and the Midlands are already subject to stricter restrictions. A tiered system of measures is designed to replace the patchwork of existing rules across the country. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions there needed to be ""greater freedom for local areas to design measures for themselves"". He said there was ""a merit to simplicity"", adding that in local areas ""local leaders will know best"". Liverpool's Labour Mayor Joe Anderson said he expected Liverpool - where there are currently 600 cases per 100,000 people - to be placed in tier three, under the highest set of restrictions. He told the BBC's Today programme he understood this would involve the lockdown of all the city's pubs from Wednesday. He said the government was wrong to allow Liverpool's bars and pubs to stay open this weekend, with infection rates so high. He accepted people in the city should take individual responsibility and said he was ""angry and frustrated"" at those flouting the rules, but added: ""I'm not convinced people trust the government's decisions."" Asked what his role would be in setting the restrictions, he said there had been conversation with Downing Street, but no consultation. It was clear the decisions had already been made, he said, but they were listening to his suggestions about how spikes in the city could best be dealt with. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Martin Gannon, Labour leader of Gateshead Council, said there had been ""warm words"" in a meeting with civil servants but ultimately the laws would be made by government. He said he would oppose any further restrictions placed on the North East, saying they could be ""counter-productive"" and lead to resistance from the public. Current measures were starting to bring down case numbers, he insisted, and the government needed to help local authorities win people's confidence. And Glen Sanderson, Conservative leader of Northumberland County Council, said he did not want blanket restrictions on Northumberland, which has large rural areas ""virtually unaffected"" by the virus as well as towns where case numbers were rising. ""I don't think the argument is there to bring in much tougher restrictions - we have to take people with us. If we can't get people to conform, we won't make any progress,"" he told BBC News. Meanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) said the government's measures to reduce the spread of the virus had not worked, given the uncontrolled escalation, and has made its own recommendations. It wants to see masks worn in all offices and outdoors where two-metre distancing is not possible; free medical grade masks for the over-60s and vulnerable groups; financial support for businesses to become Covid-secure; and the ""rule of six"" tweaked to allow only two households to meet in groups of no more than six. Chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""The infection has risen following rapid relaxation of measures and with the Westminster government letting down its guard - as recently as August, the government was encouraging people to travel, go to work and mix in restaurants and pubs."" Speaking at the Co-operative Party virtual conference, Labour leader Sir Keir accused the government of serial incompetence, saying a test, trace and isolate system was ""critical"". Without that, ""thousands and thousands of people are walking around today who should be in self-isolation"", he warned. On Friday the number of people in the UK to have tested positive for coronavirus rose by 13,864 - a decrease of 3,676 on Thursday's figure - with a further 87 deaths reported on thegovernment's dashboard.,external TEST AND TRACE EXPOSED:Panorama hears from whistleblowers working on the coronavirus tracking system LOVE LIFE:Fancy an escape?

Footballer Marcus Rashford and fitness coach Joe Wicks are also recognised for their efforts during the pandemic, becoming MBEs on the delayed list. TV chef Mary Berry and actress Maureen Lipman are made dames, while actor David Suchet and veteran entertainer Tommy Steele are both knighted. TV presenter Lorraine Kelly and broadcaster Prof Brian Cox become CBEs. The list is usually published in June, when the Queen celebrates her official birthday, butit was postponed,externalso that individuals who played crucial roles in the first months of the coronavirus outbreak could be added. Honours for Mary Berry and Dizzee Rascal Rashford becomes MBE in birthday honours Billionaire brothers honoured after Asda takeover Knighthood for Grange Hill creator Phil Redmond Lorraine Kelly and Eve Muirhead honoured Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the recipients of this year's honours were ""a testament to the sort of country we are - caring, compassionate and resolute in the face of a global pandemic"". ""The hard work and dedication of these local, often unsung heroes has helped carry us through,"" he added. England player Rashford, whose award came for services to vulnerable children in the UK during the coronavirus epidemic, said becoming an MBE sounded ""a little bit strange but obviously I feel honoured"". The 22-year-old Manchester United forward successfully campaignedto extend free school meals over the summerafter pressing the government into a U-turn on the issue. This video can not be played Marcus Rashford said he felt ""honoured"" to be given an MBE ""Hopefully it inspires more people to do good things,"" Rashford said. ""It's a nice moment for me personally but I feel like I'm still at the beginning of the journey that I set out to try to achieve."" But he said his main focus now was on having the scheme extended. ""What I'd like to do, now that I'm in this position, is just speak directly to the prime minister and really ask for the vouchers to be extended at least until October half term, because I think that's what the families need,"" he said. Wicks, also known as The Body Coach, became the UK's PE teacher during the national lockdown by running free online classes every weekday for children and parents to keep fit. ""If you met me as a little boy you'd have thought 'he's not going to go anywhere, he's not going to do anything great', he said. ""But I've turned it around and I really am proud I've become this person who's helping people."" Welsh coronavirus response recognised with honours Honours for 'Covid-critical' broadband engineers Former NI civil service chief awarded knighthood Twelve-time world snooker champ made MBE Lockdown pub quizmaster becomes MBE He received an MBE for his home workouts, along with Mr Motivator - real name Derrick Evans - who rose to fame in the 1990s on GMTV and returned to the nation's TVs with his exercise classes. However, it is the ""unsung heroes"" of the pandemic, such as NHS and social care staff, fundraisers, shop workers, and drivers - of public transport and deliveries, which make up the majority of the 414 names who have been awarded for their ""exceptional contributions"" during the outbreak. Felicia Kwaku, from Islington, north London, who has been a nurse for 30 years, is among the health and social care workers which make up 14% of the total 1,495 recipients on the list. The 52-year-old, who is associate director of nursing at Kings College NHS Foundation Trust, championed the cause of nurses from a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) background, who were being disproportionately affected by the virus. She said it was an ""absolute honour"" to be made an OBE for services to nursing, adding that it wasn't just for her but also the ""nurses I work with and the ones who lost their lives"". Felicia Kwaku was awarded an OBE for services to nursing Fundraisers are also celebrated after millions of pounds were raised for charity during the crisis. Dabirul Islam Choudhury, from Bow, east London, said he was ""proud"" after becoming an OBE for raising more than Â£420,000 for coronavirus relief and said he ""thanked everybody from the bottom of my heart"". Mr Choudhury, who turns 101 in January, said he was inspired by another 100-year-old, Captain Sir Tom Moore, to walk almost 1,000 laps of his garden while fasting for Ramadan. Dabirul Islam Choudhury, 100, was made an OBE for his fundraising efforts Jay Flynn, whose weekly online quizzes became a lockdown phenomenon, gets an MBE Online quizzes became a feature of lockdown for many but for Jay Flynn, 38, from Darwen, Lancashire, his virtual pub quiz has seen him awarded an MBE for charitable service. The former pub landlord's quiz went viral with more than 180,000 people playing along at its peak - from as far afield as New Zealand and the US - and he raised more than Â£750,000 through donations. The huge voluntary effort across the country has also been reflected, with 72% of recipients awarded for their work in the community, including those who supplied free meals to those who were shielding, volunteering to help those at risk, and delivering care packages to NHS frontline workers. This video can not be played Mary Berry on damehood: ""I'll still be the same person"" Glasgow restaurant owner David Maguire, 62, who gave out free meals to NHS workers and vulnerable people, said it was a team effort but he was ""really pleased"" to have been made an MBE. The Cabinet Office said this year's list was the first to have 11% of recipients under 30, with 16-year-old Theodore Wride the youngest. He is awarded the BEM for service to his community in Sunderland during the pandemic. Several experts working in the science, health and pharmaceutical field have also been recognised for their efforts during the pandemic, including Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, who leads the Covid Symptom Study app. He is made an OBE. Meanwhile, six of the UK government's scientific advisers - who sit on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - have also been recognised. Prof Julia Gog, Prof Graham Medley, Prof Cath Noakes, Prof Lucy Yardley, Prof Calum Semple and Dr James Rubin have been made OBEs for services to the Covid-19 response. Former Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry, who was made a CBE in 2012 and has written more than 70 cookbooks, said becoming a dame was ""really the icing on the cake"". She added: ""When I was first told that I was going to be a dame you don't really believe it - then it's so exciting, and you feel very proud. It's such a huge honour."" David Suchet and Maureen Lipman have been recognised for their careers in acting Meanwhile, another national treasure, Sir David Attenborough, who was knighted in 1985, has been given an upgrade - receiving a Knight Grand Cross in the diplomatic list announced by the Foreign Office. The award, for service in a foreign country, is awarded for the 94-year-old's contribution to broadcasting and conservation. Two actors whose careers have spanned more than 50 years are both recognised. Coronation Street star Maureen Lipman, 74, gets a damehood, while David Suchet, best known for playing Hercule Poirot in the long-running Agatha Christie detective series, has received a knighthood. Also among the new knights is veteran entertainer Tommy Steele, 83, dubbed Britain's ""first rock and roll star"", who earned his first number one in 1957 with Singing the Blues. Brendan Foster, Eve Muirhead and Warren Gatland have been recognised from the world of sport Former BBC athletics commentator and long-distance runner Brendan Foster, 72, who founded the Great North Run, has been knighted for services to international and national sport and culture in the north east of England. Three Wales rugby union legends are also among the sports figures to be celebrated, with former head coach Warren Gatland, who led his team to a World Cup semi-final last year, becoming a CBE. Getting the same honour is former player Gareth Thomas, while Wales' most capped player, Alun Wyn Jones, is made an OBE. Jones said: ""I was initially reluctant to receive such an award in these trying times when there are so many people doing so much good for the community and are more worthy, but I see this as an acknowledgement to all the people who have helped me throughout my career."" MBEs also go to former England cricketer Darren Gough, Great Britain's Olympic curler Eve Muirhead, who led her team to bronze in 2014, and snooker player Reanne Evans, who became the first woman to compete against the world's best men. The creator of Grange Hill, Brookside and Hollyoaks, Phil Redmond, has been knighted for services to broadcasting and arts in the regions, while writer and director Sally Wainwright, who has been behind some of biggest television dramas in recent years, including Gentleman Jack, is made OBE. Other familiar faces from the small screen to get recognised include physicist Prof Brian Cox, who becomes a CBE, along with TV presenter Lorraine Kelly, 60, who has been working in broadcasting for more than 30 years. Author Bernadine Evaristo has been made an OBE and rapper Dizzee Rascal becomes an MBE Authors who have been honoured include Booker Prize winner Bernardine Evaristo with an OBE, and Susan Hill - best known for The Woman in Black - who is made a dame. The honours list is being hailed as the most diverse ever. Of the 1,495 recipients, 13% are from a BAME background and 6% have a disability. The list includes 740 women, which represents 49% of the total - down from 51% in the New Years Honours list last year. There are MBEs for rapper Dizzee Rascal and singer Mica Paris, who has recently joined the cast of Eastenders, while singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading and actor Adrian Lester are made CBEs. From the world of fashion, British designer Sir Paul Smith, who was knighted in 2000, is getting an upgrade after being appointed to the prestigious Order of the Companions of Honour.

Mary Berry and Dizzee Rascal honoured,"Celebrity cook Mary Berry and grime pioneer Dizzee Rascal have been honoured in the Queen's Birthday Honours list. Berry, who has earned the status of national treasure over a six-decade career, was ""overwhelmed"" at being made a dame for services to broadcasting, the culinary arts and charity. It is ""such a huge honour"", she said. Dizzee Rascal, real name Dylan Kwabena Mills, has been made an MBE for services to music. Reacting to the news,Dame Maryadded: ""When I was first told that I was going to be a dame you don't really believe it. And then it's so exciting, and you feel very proud.

""To be a dame is really the icing on the cake."" The former Great British Bake Off judge joked: ""I just wish my parents and brothers were here to share my joy, as my only achievement at school was just one O-Level - in cookery of course."" Dame Mary is no stranger to the Royal Family, having made meringue roulades with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last year, for her Berry Royal Christmas TV special. The much-loved broadcaster, baker and food writer is also a patron of Child Bereavement UK, after having lost her son William aged 19 in a car crash in 1989. In 2018, she told The Graham Norton Showshe was once arrestedat an airport after baking ingredients were mistaken for drugs. Dizzee Rascal has had five UK number one singles Dizzee Rascalis considered to have been one of the founding fathers of grime - a UK-based electronic rap genre which grew out of the English capital at the start of the century. In 2003, aged 19, the East London MC became the youngest artist to win the Mercury Prize, with his debut album Boy in da Corner. The elder statesman of the British rap game, who drops his seventh album E3 AF at the end of October,told the BBC in 2017that he deserved to be given top billing at Glastonbury Festival. ""I've toured this festival for years, never disappointed,"" he said. ""You can always count on me."" ""I'm basically at the stage where they need to make me headline this thing - because they ain't had no British rappers headline this festival."" His drive and success helped to pave the way for modern superstar Stormzy to eventually become the first black solo headliner in the history of the Worthy Farm event last year, bringing UK hip-hop and grime into the mainstream in the process. Dame Mary is joined by veteran actress and Coronation Street starMaureen Lipmanand The Woman in Black authorSusan Hill, in being made a dame commander. The former played the title character's mother in Roman Polanski's Oscar-winning 2002 drama The Pianist.

Shutters come down on pubs and restaurants,"This video can not be played âLast orders, folks!â - Pub-goers in Glasgow enjoy a final pint Pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland have closed for the last time in at least two weeks. After they shut their doors at 18:00, they will not reopen until 25 October at the earliest. It comes as the Scottish governmentpublishes details,externalof a Â£40m support package for businesses forced to close due to Covid restrictions. There will be a tightening of rules across the rest of the country but licensed premises can remain open. Police Scotland said additional officers would be deployed to ensure premises comply with restrictions. A protest against the measures took place in Glasgow on Friday evening, withbar workers dumping a large pile of iceoutside the City Chambers. Bar workers showed their contempt for the new rules A letter posted to the Glasgow Bartenders Club said venues in Edinburgh were also leaving the remaining contents of their ice machines outside the Scottish Parliament. The new rules come into force as six further Covid deaths were confirmed by the first minister in her daily briefing. What are the new lockdown rules in Scotland? Extra police patrols as pubs prepare to shut Restaurants 'cannot turn themselves into cafes' She said 1,246 positive tests had been recorded and the number of Covid patients in hospital was continuing to increase. ""The restrictions which come into force today are significant, but the case numbers we have seen in recent weeks - including, increasingly, the figures for people being hospitalised - show why they are necessary,"" Ms Sturgeon said. ""We have to stop the virus from spreading further. And having already restricted meetings between households in each other's homes, the most important additional step we can take is to restrict meetings in bars and restaurants."" The Scottish government plans to help businesses with a Â£40m package which includes support for employment, a cash grant for each business and a discretionary fund for local authorities. Ministers were waiting to hear details of the UK's plans to help affected employees before laying out the full details of their scheme. Economy secretary Fiona Hyslop outlined the details of the fund on Friday evening: One-off grants of up to Â£3,000 for businesses required to close by regulations Hardship fund with grants of up to Â£1,500 for businesses that remain open but are directly impacted, such as suppliers Â£9m to help employers pay 20% of the wages of furloughed workers Â£11m discretionary fund to help businesses that do not fall into the above categories, such as soft play centres Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said people who work forUK firms forced to shut by Covid restrictions will get two-thirds of their wages paid by the government. He also announced increased grants for business in England - a move the UK government says will lead to Â£700m additional funding for Scotland. Pubs across the central belt of Scotland closed their doors at 18:00 The scheme is due to start on 1 November - a week after the latest Scottish restrictions are due to end. But employers should be able to use the existing furlough scheme until the end of October. Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes welcomed the move but called for more clarity on ""what it covers in terms of health, transport and business support"". The measures were described as ""good news"" by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce. But its chief executive, Liz Cameron, warned they were not enough to offset the impending loss of trade and jobs. ""We need governments to focus on enabling business to continue to freely function, and manage our way through this situation,"" she said. ""This stop-start approach is damaging for business."" Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross described the funding increase as ""seismic"" while his colleague, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, said it provided a ""vital safety net"". About 3.4 million people in five health boards - Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lothian, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran - are subject to the strictest restrictions. Licensed premises will be closed for 16 days although they can still serve takeaways. Cafes with a licence have been told they can remain open as long as they do not serve alcohol butthere is confusion over what constitutes a cafe. Hospitality venues in the rest of Scotland will be allowed to open, but will only be permitted to serve non-alcoholic drinks and food indoors between 06:00 and 18:00. Licensed premises in these areas will still be able to serve alcohol in outdoor areas, such as beer gardens, up to the 22:00 curfew introduced in September. Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Ms Sturgeon said: ""These measures still allow for some social contact in cafes during the day. And they do not prevent people from taking half-term holidays which have already been booked, or from going ahead with weddings which have already been planned. ""But for a period of just over two weeks, they will remove some of the major opportunities the virus has to spread. That should have a significant impact on transmission rates."" Meanwhile, Police Scotland revealed that in the week up to 4 October officers broke up 271 illegal house parties, issued 106 fines and made 18 arrests.

Trump eyes rally as health questions remain,"President Trump wants to return to the campaign trail but questions remain about his health - and when he first became infected US President Donald Trump has completed his course of treatment for Covid-19 and can return to public engagements this weekend, his physician has said. Dr Sean Conley said the president had responded ""extremely well"" to medication and had ""remained stable"". Mr Trump later said he would probably take another Covid test on Friday and hoped to hold a rally over the weekend. Critics have accused the White House of avoiding questions about Mr Trump's health and testing in recent days. A White House spokeswoman said the president wanted to return to the campaign trail this weekend. But an administration official later said Trump was unlikely to travel so soon because the logistics of organising events at short notice was problematic. An appearance is more likely on Monday, they said. The president is also set to have a televised ""medical evaluation"" on Fox News on Friday evening. Dr Sean Conley: Who is Donald Trump's physician? Top Republican avoids White House over Covid-19 US election 2020: Your top questions answered Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, on Friday announced legislation to establish a commission to assess a president's fitness for office. Mrs Pelosi said it was not meant to rule on Mr Trump's condition, but any serious consideration of the measure before the election is unlikely. Democrats are focusing on a clause in the 25th Amendment that allows a president to be removed from office against their will because of a physical or mental incapacity. The amendment was introduced after the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy to clarify issues around the transfer of presidential powers. It can only be invoked if the vice-president and a majority of cabinet secretaries or Congress agree. Democrats are looking to set up mechanisms that would enable Congress to have more say on a president's fitness. Conservatives say this is a political move to attack Mr Trump's health ahead of the election. On Friday, Mrs Pelosi said the move was ""not about President Trump"", who ""will face the judgment of the voters"". ""This legislation applies to future presidents but we are reminded of the necessity of action by the health of the current president."" Previewing the legislation on Thursday, Mrs Pelosi told reporters that serious questions concerning Mr Trump's health were still unanswered, and described the president as being in an ""altered state"". Mr Trump called Ms Pelosi ""crazy"" and said she was ""the one who should be under observation"". Speaking on Fox News late on Thursday, Mr Trump said he was feeling ""really good"" and hoped to hold a campaign rally on Saturday evening, possibly in Florida. The president was also heard clearing his throat and coughing during the interview. At one point, he appeared to mute his mic after needing to clear his throat. Fox News has since said that Mr Trump will appear for a televised ""medical evaluation"" on Friday at 20:00ET (01:00BST). It will be his first on-camera interview since his diagnosis and he will undergo an evaluation by Dr Mark Siegel, a Fox contributor. Earlier this week, White House doctor Dr Conley had said that if the president's condition remained the same or improved throughout the weekend and into Monday, ""we will all take that final, deep sigh of relief"". The White House is still trying to cope with a Covid-19 outbreak Although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House. New Covid safety measures are in place there. One of the top Republicans, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, said on Thursday that he had not been to the White House since 6 August because its approach to handling Covid with social distancing and masks was ""different from mine and what I suggested we do in the Senate"". This video can not be played Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends self-isolating for 10 days after a positive test. The CDC also says isolation could end earlier after ""two negative test results in a row, from tests done at least 24 hours apart"". Questions remain about when the president first became infected and whether he could still be contagious. In a memo released by the White House on Thursday evening, Dr Conley said Mr Trump was displaying no signs ""to suggest progression of illness"". ""Saturday will be day 10 since [last] Thursday's diagnosis, and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the president's safe return to public engagements at that time,"" the memo added. Mr Trump avoided questions while speaking to Fox News on Thursday about whether he had been tested recently, but said he would probably be tested on Friday. We know Mr Trump tested positive for Covid-19 last Thursday night, according to his doctors. We do not know when his last negative test was, however. On Monday, Dr Conley also avoided questions about it. As a result, some have wondered whether the president was getting regularly tested at all. The questions come amid a row over the next presidential debates between Mr Trump and challenger Joe Biden. The Trump campaign has rejected the debate commission's plan of a virtual debate next week, saying there is no medical reason to avoid an in-person event. Who has Trump met and who's tested positive? US election 2020: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden? What did we learn from the VP debate? The US election will be held on 3 November. Latest opinion polls suggest that Mr Biden's lead has increased since the chaotic first debate and the president's coronavirus diagnosis. Six million ballots have already been cast in early voting.

"Peacocks owner on brink putting 21,000 jobs at risk","Edinburgh Woollen Mill, owner of the Peacocks and Jaeger clothing brands, says it plans to appoint administrators in an attempt to save the business. The move puts 21,000 jobs at risk amid what the company described as ""brutal"" trading conditions. ""Like every retailer, we have found the past seven months extremely difficult,"" said Edinburgh Woollen Mill chief executive Steve Simpson. The stores will continue to trade as a review of the firm is carried out. The company says it has had ""a number of expressions of interest for various parts of the group"" which it will consider. Edinburgh Woollen Mill (EWM), which is owned by billionaire businessman Philip Day, has 1,100 stores for its brands. The businesses attract older shoppers who are likely to be keeping away from the High Street to protect against coronavirus, says Catherine Shuttleworth, an independent retail expert. She said it was a ""devastating blow"" to small towns and tourist areas where they are based and that buyers for the businesses as a whole could be hard to come by. ""You might get piecemeal buyers, but I don't hold out much hope,"" she said. Businessman Philip Day owns Edinburgh Woollen Mill Mr Day has a Â£1.14bn fortune, according to the Sunday Times Rich List published in May 2020. He bought BonmarchÃ© out of administration in February. The deal ruffled some feathers, since Mr Day was its previous owner and landlords and suppliers were expected to forgive some of its debts. BonmarchÃ© is not part of the plans announced on Friday. Edinburgh Woollen Mill, including BonmarchÃ©, employs 24,000 people. EWM said it had filed a notice to appoint administrators, partly because of ""the harsh trading conditions caused by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and a recent reduction in its credit insurance"". Mr Simpson said: ""Through this process, I hope and believe we will be able to secure the best future for our businesses, but there will inevitably be significant cuts and closures as we work our way through this."" Edinburgh Woollen Mill also owns the Jaeger clothing brand He also blamed part of the company's troubles on ""a series of false rumours about our payments and trading which have impacted our credit insurance"". EWM has been accused by suppliers in Bangladesh of not paying for goods. The company denies this. EWM has appointed FRP to review the business. The firm was also hired for the BonmarchÃ© administration. A spokesperson for FRP said: ""Our team is working with the directors of a number of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group subsidiaries to explore all options for the future of its retail brands, including Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Jaeger, Ponden Mill and Peacocks."" The pandemic has accelerated a shift in the retail industry from physical stores to online shopping people have been stuck at home and stores have been temporarily closed. Last month, the boss of one of the UK's most successful and resilient High Street chains told the BBC that hundreds of thousands of traditional retail jobs may not survive in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Lord Wolfson, who runs clothing firm Next,said there was a clear threat to thousands of jobs,which are now ""unviable"" because the lockdown has triggered a permanent shift to online shopping.

PM to detail new Covid measures to MPs on Monday,"Liverpool is expected to be placed under severe new restrictions next week The prime minister is to make a statement to MPs on Monday giving details of new restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus in England. A letter from Boris Johnson's adviser to MPs in the North West seen by the BBC says it is ""very likely"" some areas will face further restrictions. But some regional leaders warn the new plan for a three-tier local lockdown system will only create more confusion. It comes as a doctors' union calls for clearer and more stringent rules. Under the new restrictions, pubs and restaurants could be closed in parts of northern England and the Midlands - where some of the highest numbers of cases are occurring - while a ban on overnight stays is also being considered. It is understood that the most severe measures - imposed for areas in tier three - would be agreed with local leaders in advance. The details of each tier, including the level of infection at which an area would qualify for it and the nature of the restrictions, are being debated this weekend. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmersaid,externalit was grossly irresponsible for anonymous government sources to tell newspapers on Thursday about plans for further restrictions on millions of people, without any detail, consultation or statement from the prime minister. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? How many cases are there in my area? Covid cases increase rapidly as next steps planned The letter to the MPs from Downing Street's chief strategic adviser Sir Edward Lister says the government is hoping to ""finalise these details as soon as possible"" amid ""rising incidence in parts of the country"". It also cites the ""engagement that is taking place today and during the course of the weekend with local authority leaders in your region"". Sir Edward says the set of measures being discussed ""present difficult choices. We must seek to strike the right balance between driving down transmission, and safeguarding our economy and society from the worst impact"". In the face of pressure from MPs, elected mayors and council leaders, the prime minister has signalled he wants ""much closer engagement"" with local politicians. As a senior government source said, they will bring ""expertise on what will work in their regions"". The hope is for ""top tier"" restrictions in the new multi-level system to be agreed between the government and local leaders in advance. There is an acknowledgement from inside government that this marks a change in approach. It is a shift away from what Labour described as a ""Whitehall knows best"" attitude. It will allow local politicians, some of whom until now have complained of being frozen out, to have a greater input. But it will also mean they are accountable, alongside government ministers, for the success or failure of the measures introduced. They will have to share the responsibility, perhaps blame, if measures don't work or prove unpopular. And amid calls for clarity, it seems the new tiered system could vary region by region, making clear national messaging more difficult. Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England's national infection service, said the number of cases was rising all over the country, but more quickly in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber than the South. She said it was concerning that cases were rising ""quite fast"" in pockets of north-west England among the over-60s, the group most likely to need to be admitted to hospital. A number of areas in the North West, the North East and the Midlands are already subject to stricter restrictions. A tiered system of measures is designed to replace the patchwork of existing rules across the country. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions there needed to be ""greater freedom for local areas to design measures for themselves"". He said there was ""a merit to simplicity"", adding that in local areas ""local leaders will know best"". Liverpool's Labour Mayor Joe Anderson said he expected Liverpool - where there are currently 600 cases per 100,000 people - to be placed in tier three, under the highest set of restrictions. He told the BBC's Today programme he understood this would involve the lockdown of all the city's pubs from Wednesday. He said the government was wrong to allow Liverpool's bars and pubs to stay open this weekend, with infection rates so high. He accepted people in the city should take individual responsibility and said he was ""angry and frustrated"" at those flouting the rules, but added: ""I'm not convinced people trust the government's decisions."" Asked what his role would be in setting the restrictions, he said there had been conversation with Downing Street, but no consultation. It was clear the decisions had already been made, he said, but they were listening to his suggestions about how spikes in the city could best be dealt with. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Martin Gannon, Labour leader of Gateshead Council, said there had been ""warm words"" in a meeting with civil servants but ultimately the laws would be made by government. He said he would oppose any further restrictions placed on the North East, saying they could be ""counter-productive"" and lead to resistance from the public. Current measures were starting to bring down case numbers, he insisted, and the government needed to help local authorities win people's confidence. And Glen Sanderson, Conservative leader of Northumberland County Council, said he did not want blanket restrictions on Northumberland, which has large rural areas ""virtually unaffected"" by the virus as well as towns where case numbers were rising. ""I don't think the argument is there to bring in much tougher restrictions - we have to take people with us. If we can't get people to conform, we won't make any progress,"" he told BBC News. Meanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) said the government's measures to reduce the spread of the virus had not worked, given the uncontrolled escalation, and has made its own recommendations. It wants to see masks worn in all offices and outdoors where two-metre distancing is not possible; free medical grade masks for the over-60s and vulnerable groups; financial support for businesses to become Covid-secure; and the ""rule of six"" tweaked to allow only two households to meet in groups of no more than six. Chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""The infection has risen following rapid relaxation of measures and with the Westminster government letting down its guard - as recently as August, the government was encouraging people to travel, go to work and mix in restaurants and pubs."" Speaking at the Co-operative Party virtual conference, Labour leader Sir Keir accused the government of serial incompetence, saying a test, trace and isolate system was ""critical"". Without that, ""thousands and thousands of people are walking around today who should be in self-isolation"", he warned. On Friday the number of people in the UK to have tested positive for coronavirus rose by 13,864 - a decrease of 3,676 on Thursday's figure - with a further 87 deaths reported on thegovernment's dashboard.,external TEST AND TRACE EXPOSED:Panorama hears from whistleblowers working on the coronavirus tracking system LOVE LIFE:Fancy an escape?

Subsidy may 'cushion blow',"Businesses groups have largely welcomed a new wage support for workers at firms forced to close by Covid restrictions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said the state will cover two-thirds of staff wages at closed workplaces, and firms in England can get grants of up to Â£3,000 per month. The subsidy is an extension to the Job Support Scheme announced last month. The CBI business lobby group said it ""should cushion the blow for the most affected and keep more people in work"". ""But many firms, including pubs and restaurants, will still be hugely disappointed if they have to close their doors again after doing so much to keep customers and staff safe,"" added CBI boss Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. The business group additionally called for a ""consistent and open strategy for living with Covid-19 through the autumn and winter"". An update on restrictions, which could see pubs and restaurants shut in the worst-affected areas, is expected on Monday. UK workers to get 67% of pay if firms told to shut UK economic growth slows despite restaurant boost UK Hospitality, an industry body representing pubs, restaurants and bars, also welcomed the government support for wage bills, but said more help was needed for companies still trading under restrictions. ""Support for nightclubs and other businesses left in limbo, still unable to reopen, is very welcome. It will help save jobs in a sector that would be sorely missed it were allowed to die,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""However, worryingly, it does nothing to address the issues faced by sector businesses operating well below capacity due to restrictions and consumers avoiding travel and struggling to keep their workforce employed"". The boss of London pub company Young's said pubs and restaurants should be congratulated by the government for creating safe environments for patrons, not seen as a problem whose activities should be restricted. Chief executive Patrick Dardis said: ""Since reopening, we have had 2.7 million people through our doors, but just nine confirmed Covid cases. That's an infection rate of just 0.00000328%. ""Our sector has spent hundreds of millions in ensuring it is Covid safe and secure for staff and customers alike."" The head chef at Newcastle field-to-fork restaurant Bistro forty six, Max Gott, said the restrictions already in place mean he can only sit 12 people per night instead of 30. If a local lockdown was imposed, Mr Gott said the company would have to decide whether it was worth taking the grants, shut up shop and furlough staff while ""trying not to haemorrhage too much money while we shut, or try and operate as a takeaway and try and make some money and break even, although that's unlikely"". He said it would be better for staff if his restaurant could access grants and the subsidy while operating as a take-away. ""Some of the staff won't be able to live on two-thirds wages, we've got mortgages to pay,"" Mr Gott added. See-sawing between opening and closing the restaurant, based on customer reactions to restrictions, came with added costs each time, he said. ""We've got bills coming in all the time - we've got stock that we'll lose - if we had to shut we've got Â£300 of stock that we'd put in the bin or try to give away or something so it all adds up and each time we get told to shut and then open it's a cost"". Many businesses could be forced to close if lockdown restrictions are tightened Federation of Small Businesses boss Mike Cherry said the extra help for closed businesses would be ""welcomed by thousands of small businesses"". ""Evolving the Job Support Scheme to provide two-thirds of total salary costs together with enhancing existing cash grants for those faced with this scenario are both game-changers, and it's welcome to see them adopted today. ""We will work with government on clarity on where and when any new restrictions will apply, and clear, accessible small-business-friendly guidance to make sure this help gets to those facing a lockdown of their business premises."" Although it said ""a lockdown with support for staff wages is better than a lockdown without any support,"" the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce warned that if businesses were forced to close it was not just staff who lost money. ""Companies who supply the food and drink we consume in bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants will feel the consequences too,"" said Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton. ""Similarly, sectors which aren't formally forced to close could well find that their custom drops because of wider lockdown restrictions, thus impacting on their viability too.""

Will I still be paid in a lockdown?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

UK economic growth slows despite restaurant boost,"The UK economy continued its recovery in August, growing by 2.1%, as the Eat Out to Help Out scheme boosted restaurants. But the figure was below expectations and the economy is still 9.2% smaller than before the pandemic struck. It marked the fourth consecutive month of expansion following the slump induced by the coronavirus lockdown. However, growth in August was slower than the expansion seen in both June and July. In June, the economy grew by 8.7% and in July, by 6.6%. Eat Out to Help Out drives UK inflation to five-year low Eat Out to Help Out, which ran from Monday to Wednesday during August, offered 50% off food up to the value of Â£10. Discounts for more than 100 million meals were claimed through the scheme. Analysts said the coming months were likely to see growth slackening further because of new Covid restrictions, the end of the furlough scheme in October and concern over a no-deal Brexit. ""We have been clear that we stand ready to do more as necessary,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. ""Some firms will be affected by coronavirus for longer than others, and we will continue to seek to support these firms appropriately."" The economy's bounce back from the pandemic shutdowns slowed in August, despite the boost from Eat Out to Help Out at a time when there were few social restrictions. The official technical recession - two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP - has certainly ended and that will be confirmed next month. But a lower than expected figure for growth in the economy in August raises fears about the recovery petering out and even going into reverse in the current final quarter of the year. The figures bolster the argument of those business groups campaigning for further support, particularly as social restrictions are strengthening rather than weakening. The first stage of thatcame from Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Friday afternoon. The Bank of England will also react at its policy-setting meeting next month. But the latest figures show that while the first bounce in the economy occurred relatively rapidly, a full recovery is going to take much longer and not yet assured. It's going to be a tough winter. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said important sectors of the economy, such as services and construction, were still considerably smaller than in February. The ONS also issued figures for the three months to August, showing growth of 8% over the period compared with the previous three months as lockdown measures eased further. ""The economy continued to recover in August but by less than in recent months,"" said Jonathan Athow, the ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics. ""There was strong growth in restaurants and accommodation due to the easing of lockdown rules, the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and people choosing summer 'staycations'. However, many other parts of the service sector recorded muted growth. ""Construction also continued its recovery, with a significant boost from housebuilding."" He added that there was ""limited growth"" in manufacturing, with car and aircraft production still much lower than the start of the year. No V-shaped recovery here,"" was the verdict of Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, referring to optimistic forecasts of a swift rebound in growth. ""GDP was still a hefty 9.2% below its pre-Covid February level in August - when no meaningful restrictions on economic activity were imposed."" Looking ahead, he predicted growth of only about 2% in September. He added: ""GDP also likely will struggle to improve on September's level over the next three months, as the second wave of Covid-19 instils more consumer caution and compels the government to shut hospitality businesses in Covid-19 hotspots once again."" Sarah Hewin, economist and head of research at Standard Chartered Bank, echoed that view. ""Despite the support from Eat Out to Help Out and staycations, there was virtually no growth in manufacturing,"" she told the BBC. ""And although we continue to see new housing being built, that also was a little bit weaker than expected, so the pace of recovery does seem to be slowing. ""To a certain extent, that's not surprising. We had very strong growth in June and July as lockdown restrictions eased, so August data continued to show the economy growing, but not at such a fast pace. ""The slowdown in that momentum, though, does give us some concern for what might be happening over the next few months."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Today's figures show our economy has grown for four consecutive months, but I know that many people are worried about the coming winter months. ""Throughout this crisis, my single focus has been jobs - protecting as many jobs as possible and providing support for people to find other opportunities where this isn't possible. This goal remains unchanged."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""It is deeply worrying that growth was weak in August despite the easing of restrictions, especially as we now face Covid-19 cases rising and more areas coming under local restrictions. ""The government must get a grip on test, trace and isolate, reform the sink-or-swim Job Support Scheme and urgently put in place consistent economic support for areas of localised restrictions.""

LiveLiveReaction as UK announces support for firms made to closeLess than a minute agoNow That's all from us...That's all from us...11 minutes ago Outbreak at ambulance service 999 call centreOutbreak at ambulance service 999 call centre18 minutes ago How is the virus spreading in different parts of the UK?How is the virus spreading in different parts of the UK?,"UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced further support for jobs and businesses Workers at UK firms forced to close will receive two-thirds of their wages, Sunak says Rapid increase in cases in England, ONS figures show, with one in 240 infected Several European countries register record spikes in new daily cases; bars are shut in four more French cities The Spanish government has ordered a 15-day state of emergency to bring down Covid-19 infection rates in Madrid China is joining the international Covax scheme to get vaccines to developing countries Nearly 37 million cases have been confirmed globally with more than 1.06 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hamish Mackay Thanks for joining us today. Before we wrap up, hereâs a look at some of the main stories: Nineteen ambulance staff are believed to have tested positive after an outbreak at a 999 emergency call handling centre in West Yorkshire. Yorkshire Ambulance Service confirmed the outbreak at its Emergency Operations Centre in Wakefield and said it had taken steps to ensure the 999 service would continue, with help from a facility in York and other ambulance services if needed. A source from the Unison union said that 19 staff had tested positive but it was not known how many others might be self-isolating. Today's estimate of the R number - which measures the average number of people each infected person spreads the virus to and can show how quickly the epidemic is growing - was between 1.2 and 1.5. That's slightly lower than last week's figure of 1.3 to 1.6, although scientists advising the government said the epidemic continues to grow exponentially. But the picture varies across the country, with former hotspots such as the north-west of England showing evidence of slower growth, while the highest estimates of between 1.3 and 1.6 were in Wales, Scotland, the east of England and the South West. North-west England remains the worst-affected region in terms of hospital admissions, however, followed by North East and Yorkshire. Hospital admissions are rising in almost every region. A travel writer has said he received ""such intense abuse"" when he suggested people visit Wales that he has ""no further plans"" to book a stay in the country. Speaking on ITV earlier this week, Simon Calder listed Gwynedd and Ceredigion, as well as Belfast and Edinburgh, as places people in the UK could go for a break during the pandemic. But he said he then received a torrent of abuse via email and social media. Visit Wales said it wastrying to welcome people back,external""in a way that is safe"". In an article for The Independent,external, Mr Calder said he had replied to many of the hundreds of people who messaged on social media and understood the deep concern about the spread of coronavirus, but did not now intend to book a holiday in Wales again. Mr Calder said he had never meant to upset anyone and had followed travel advice, but it was an ""interesting lesson"" on current sensitivities. He added: ""The hundreds of people I inadvertently angered may be glad to hear that I have no further plans to book a stay in Wales."" Read the full story here. Dr Fauci was a key figure in White House coronavirus taskforce briefings Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US researcher who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has told CBS - the BBC's US media partner - that President Trump's apparent recovery from the coronavirus may wrongly make people think it is not dangerous. He said that talk of a ""cure"", as Trump has labeled the medical treatments he received, creates ""confusion"" among the American public. There is no medicine that ""cures"" Covid-19, but experimental treatments such as the ones that Trump received in hospital have shown promise in helping patients to recover. Polls show around half of Americans say they would not get a coronavirus vaccine if one is found. Pedestrians walk through central Nottingham Nottingham has a weekly rate of 760 new cases per 100,000 people - the highest in the UK. It is the only city to have a rate above 700 per 100,000 in the seven days to 6 October. The second highest rate is in Northern Ireland's Derry City & Strabane, where the figure is currently 684 cases per 100,000. Glasgow has the highest rate in Scotland at 242, while Merthyr Tydfil has the highest rate in Wales with 213. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful US Democrat, has announced legislation to establish a congressional commission to assess the process for removing a president for health reasons. A statement on the move said the commission would be set up under the 25th Amendment, which outlines how a sitting president can be stripped of power if they are deemed unable to conduct the duties of the office. Any serious consideration of the measure is unlikely, but it will serve as a political tool to raise questions about Trump's health. Trump hit back, calling Pelosi ""crazy"" and said she was ""the one who should be under observation"". Read more about the 25th Amendmenthere Europe has seen more than 100,000 new cases in a day for the first time since the pandemic started. A World Health Organization official, Dr Michael Ryan, said it was sad to see a rapid rise in cases in many European countries. He called on governments to take decisive action. Spain's government has declared a two-week state of emergency in the Madrid region, imposing travel restrictions to try to contain an outbreak there. In the UK,estimates suggest between one-in-170 and one-in-240 people you meet in the street has the virus. Russia has reported its highest daily cases since May. The number of people testing positive for coronavirus each day continues to rise sharply, with 13,864 confirmed cases reported over the past 24 hours. That brings the 7-day average to 15,505. Reported daily deaths, which include people who died within 28 days of a positive test, are rising gradually, although today's figure of 87 was the largest for months. The average over seven days is now 59. Most Britons are staying away from bars and restaurants, a survey suggests Local restrictions and government warnings about the impact of pubs and restaurants on the spread of the virus appear to be having an impact on the habits of the public in Britain. Only a quarter of adults (25%) said they had eaten or drank at a restaurant, pub or bar during the previous week, when questioned by the Office of National Statistics between 30 September and 4 October. Three weeks earlier, the figure was 30%. The number of people leaving home to meet others in a public place or someone else's home has also dropped over the same period from 28% to 20%. More than a third of people (34%) in areas with additional local restrictions said they had not socialised with anyone outside their household, compared to 25% in other areas. But a small minority admitted to flouting the rules, with 7% of people in areas with local lockdowns saying they gathered in a group of more than six people, and 9% in other areas. ""Brutal"" trading conditions brought on by the pandemic have forced the Edinburgh Woollen Mill - which also owns the Peacocks and Jaeger clothing brands - toappoint administrators in an attempt to save its business. The move puts more than 20,000 jobs at risk, although the stores will continue to trade as a review of the firm is carried out. Chief executive Steve Simpson blamed the pandemic but said ""false rumours"" about the company's payments and trading had also affected its credit insurance. ""I hope and believe we will be able to secure the best future for our businesses, but there will inevitably be significant cuts and closures as we work our way through this,"" he said. Donald Trump will hold his first on-camera interview tonight since his coronavirus diagnosis. He will receive a ""medical evaluation"" during a Fox New appearance from Dr Marc Siegel, a Fox contributor, according to the network. Saturday will mark 10 days since Trump's diagnosis, according to White House Dr Sean Conley, who on Thursday cleared Trump to ""return to public engagements"" this weekend. The US president was treated in a military hospital for three days and received supplemental oxygen. The White House has refused to say when he last took a negative Covid-19 test. The president's coronavirus infection has thrown the campaign in disarray. After the next debate against Joe Biden was moved to a virtual format, Trump pulled out. Trump has said he is considering returning to the campaign trail with rallies as soon as this weekend. The number of Covid-19 cases at a Nottinghamshire prison has reached more than 200, thecounty's director of public health confirmed. A total of 172 prisoners and 43 staff at HMP Lowdham Grange have tested positive. It representsa significant increase on 84 recorded casesa week ago. Jonathan Gribbin said the prison outbreak represented a part of the increase in cases across the Newark and Sherwood district. The figures were revealed in a briefing on Friday to discuss Covid-19 infection rates in the county, withNottingham currently having the highest rates in the country. Migrant workers protesting in Dhaka, Bangladesh The United Nations' migration agency says that international cooperation is urgently needed to help more than 2.5 million migrants who have been left stranded by coronavirus restrictions around the world. Among others, they include seasonal workers, temporary residence holders, seafarers and international students. The Middle East and North Africa account for 1.27 million of the total of 2.75 million stranded, the report said. Asia has nearly a million. The International Organization for Migration says that, while stranded, some are at higher risk of abuse, exploitation and neglect - including cramped and unhygienic living conditions that put them at greater risk of catching Covid-19. âIt should be clear that migrants can be returned home in a safe and dignified manner despite the constraints imposed by Covid-19,â director general AntÃ³nio Vitorino said in a statement. Cities such as Manchester could face new restrictions that affect businesses, including a hospitality shutdown Mayors across the north of England - Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, North Tyne's Jamie Driscoll, Sheffield's Dan Jarvis and Liverpool's Steve Rotherham - have issued a joint statement saying Chancellor Rishi Sunak's new package of support does not go far enough. âWe are pleased that the government has listened and recognised that any new system of restrictions must come with a substantial package of financial support,"" they said. ""What has been announced by the chancellor today is a start but, on first look, it would not appear to have gone far enough to prevent genuine hardship, job losses and business failure this winter."" Reality Check President Trump is taking a drug which he has touted as a âcureâ for Covid-19, and says he will roll it out across the US. The drug uses a combination of antibodies, and is developed by US based company Regeneronusing human cells derived from an aborted foetus. But the Trump administration suspended funding for projects using human foetal tissue from abortions in 2019. There is no outright ban however on the use of foetal material in drug research. At the time of the funding suspension,the Department of Health and Human Services released a statement,externalsaying: âPromoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trumpâs administration.â This has raised questions about the presidentâs use and promotion of new coronavirus treatments which have been developed using the practice. Remdesivir, another drug used by the president, and some vaccine development projects with White House funding also rely on the same cell lines produced from foetal tissue. But the policy excluded cell lines made before June 2019. The cells used by most of the companies now trying to find a coronavirus treatment were derived from tissue of a foetus aborted in the 1970s. So the latest drugs being touted by Trump donât violate the current regulations as long as theyâre not being developed using cell lines from a recently aborted foetus. This video can not be played Covid-19: Labour's Dodds on Sunak plan to pay workers Responding to Rishi Sunak'sannouncement of new job support for the UK, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has said Labour welcomes ""the fact the government has realised there does need to be more wage support"" but there is still much more that could be done. Ms Dodds told the BBC the news ""does not match the schemes in operations in other countries"", where the aim is to ""incentivise employers to actually keep their staff on"". She added that one in four people in the UK was already living under additional local measures and the government had been ""incompetent, slow, dithering"" in its response. She went on to say she would not be arguing for tax rises to fund the additional spending at this time, as the UK has ""a very weak recovery now"". Not having economic support ready as parts of the country came under extra coronavirus measures meant ""thereâs been a huge amount of anxiety and thatâs hit confidence,"" she concluded. There is fresh confusion over when Donald Trump will return to the campaign trail following his hospital treatment for coronavirus. A White House spokeswoman said the president wanted to do so this weekend, adding that he would be tested for coronavirus beforehand and would not appear in public if he could still transmit the infection. Trump's physician Sean Conley also said the president can return to public engagements this weekend. But an administration official later said Trump was unlikely to travel so soon because the logistics of organising events at short notice was problematic. An appearance is more likely on Monday, they said. Congressional Democrats argue the president's recent behaviour suggests his judgement has been impaired - they want to set up a panel to examine whether he is fit for office. In the latest outbreak at a UK university,300 students in halls of residence at Bristol University are self-isolating. Students at The Courtrooms in the city centre will now have to remain in their flats and only socialise with those they live with after 40 students tested positive. The university says it is supporting those in isolation but may take disciplinary action against those who breach regulations. Georgiana Scott, a psychology student, said: ""What makes it difficult is that we are living in houses and halls of residencies with lots of people, so when just one person is exposed to the virus it has a huge rippling effect.""

"Trump eyes rally as health questions remainThe president is also scheduled to have a televised ""medical evaluation"" on Fox News this evening.US Election 2020","President Trump wants to return to the campaign trail but questions remain about his health - and when he first became infected US President Donald Trump has completed his course of treatment for Covid-19 and can return to public engagements this weekend, his physician has said. Dr Sean Conley said the president had responded ""extremely well"" to medication and had ""remained stable"". Mr Trump later said he would probably take another Covid test on Friday and hoped to hold a rally over the weekend. Critics have accused the White House of avoiding questions about Mr Trump's health and testing in recent days. A White House spokeswoman said the president wanted to return to the campaign trail this weekend. But an administration official later said Trump was unlikely to travel so soon because the logistics of organising events at short notice was problematic. An appearance is more likely on Monday, they said. The president is also set to have a televised ""medical evaluation"" on Fox News on Friday evening. Dr Sean Conley: Who is Donald Trump's physician? Top Republican avoids White House over Covid-19 US election 2020: Your top questions answered Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, on Friday announced legislation to establish a commission to assess a president's fitness for office. Mrs Pelosi said it was not meant to rule on Mr Trump's condition, but any serious consideration of the measure before the election is unlikely. Democrats are focusing on a clause in the 25th Amendment that allows a president to be removed from office against their will because of a physical or mental incapacity. The amendment was introduced after the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy to clarify issues around the transfer of presidential powers. It can only be invoked if the vice-president and a majority of cabinet secretaries or Congress agree. Democrats are looking to set up mechanisms that would enable Congress to have more say on a president's fitness. Conservatives say this is a political move to attack Mr Trump's health ahead of the election. On Friday, Mrs Pelosi said the move was ""not about President Trump"", who ""will face the judgment of the voters"". ""This legislation applies to future presidents but we are reminded of the necessity of action by the health of the current president."" Previewing the legislation on Thursday, Mrs Pelosi told reporters that serious questions concerning Mr Trump's health were still unanswered, and described the president as being in an ""altered state"". Mr Trump called Ms Pelosi ""crazy"" and said she was ""the one who should be under observation"". Speaking on Fox News late on Thursday, Mr Trump said he was feeling ""really good"" and hoped to hold a campaign rally on Saturday evening, possibly in Florida. The president was also heard clearing his throat and coughing during the interview. At one point, he appeared to mute his mic after needing to clear his throat. Fox News has since said that Mr Trump will appear for a televised ""medical evaluation"" on Friday at 20:00ET (01:00BST). It will be his first on-camera interview since his diagnosis and he will undergo an evaluation by Dr Mark Siegel, a Fox contributor. Earlier this week, White House doctor Dr Conley had said that if the president's condition remained the same or improved throughout the weekend and into Monday, ""we will all take that final, deep sigh of relief"". The White House is still trying to cope with a Covid-19 outbreak Although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House. New Covid safety measures are in place there. One of the top Republicans, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, said on Thursday that he had not been to the White House since 6 August because its approach to handling Covid with social distancing and masks was ""different from mine and what I suggested we do in the Senate"". This video can not be played Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends self-isolating for 10 days after a positive test. The CDC also says isolation could end earlier after ""two negative test results in a row, from tests done at least 24 hours apart"". Questions remain about when the president first became infected and whether he could still be contagious. In a memo released by the White House on Thursday evening, Dr Conley said Mr Trump was displaying no signs ""to suggest progression of illness"". ""Saturday will be day 10 since [last] Thursday's diagnosis, and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the president's safe return to public engagements at that time,"" the memo added. Mr Trump avoided questions while speaking to Fox News on Thursday about whether he had been tested recently, but said he would probably be tested on Friday. We know Mr Trump tested positive for Covid-19 last Thursday night, according to his doctors. We do not know when his last negative test was, however. On Monday, Dr Conley also avoided questions about it. As a result, some have wondered whether the president was getting regularly tested at all. The questions come amid a row over the next presidential debates between Mr Trump and challenger Joe Biden. The Trump campaign has rejected the debate commission's plan of a virtual debate next week, saying there is no medical reason to avoid an in-person event. Who has Trump met and who's tested positive?

"Premier League introduces Â£15 pay-per-viewAll Premier League fixtures will be available to watch live until the end of October, with some costing Â£14.95 per game on pay-per-view basis.","Premier League football has been played behind closed doors since the competition resumed in June Premier League games not selected for broadcast in October will be available to fans on a pay-per-view basis. The five fixtures per round not already picked to be shown live, will be available on BT Sport Box Office or Sky Sports Box Office, priced at Â£14.95. Clubs have agreed this ""interim solution"" to allow fans to continue watching their teams live. Premier League clubs voted 19-1 in favour of the move, with Leicester City the only one to vote against it. The move has drawn criticism from football supporters, while the Premier League said it and its clubs ""remain committed to the safe return of fans as soon as possible"". Ex-Liverpool chief critical of Government over fan return Spectators have been unable to attend Premier League games since football was halted on 13 March because of the coronavirus pandemic. The top flight resumed on 17 June with the remaining 92 games of last season being played behind closed doors and the opening games of this season have followed suit. The Premier League and UK government had hoped to bring fans back into stadiums from 1 October but those plans were scrapped following an increase in coronavirus cases. Sky Sports managing director Rob Webster said: ""Our subscribers still get more than 140 of the very best matches, while supporters of individual clubs won't have to miss out on any games during this period."" BT Sport said fans without a subscription would still be able to access their Box Office service. Former Manchester United and England right-back Gary Neville, now a Sky pundit, said on social media it was a ""really bad move"" by the Premier League. In a statement, the Football Supporters' Association urged broadcasters to ""reconsider their pricing"". ""Today's announcement shows that fan power works,"" the FSA said. ""At the start of this season the Premier League and its broadcasters had planned to leave match-going fans entirely locked out of their side's matches; now thanks to the sustained pressure of our #LetUsWatch campaign all games will be available for fans. ""Many Premier League clubs have already taken money from fans for matches they can't attend, so we urge them to get refunds out to those supporters as soon as possible, particularly season ticket holders."" Alex Hurst, the chair of Newcastle United's Supporters Trustsaid:,external""The idea that Premier League clubs need to implement PPV because of economic needs would carry more weight if they hadn't just spent Â£1bn on players, furloughed staff, received government loans, weren't charging fans for games they aren't going to and hadn't just made thousands of staff redundant."" Supporters of EFL clubs can buy match passes to watch their teams for Â£10 using the iFollow service. BBC sports editor Dan Roan Ever since last season resumed, all Premier League matches have been available to watch live via the top flight's broadcast partners. This was partly to help the government encourage fans to stay at home while games stayed behind closed doors, rather than congregating outside grounds or in pubs. But having had their hopes of a partial return of fans inside grounds from 1 October dashed, despite the success of pilot events, the clubs have had enough of generating nothing from these matches. Their annoyance at being told turnstiles must remain shut when pressure is also building on them to come up with a bailout for the EFL, is likely to have hardened their stance. But after clubs spent more than Â£1bn in the summer transfer window, and at a time when many supporters will be struggling financially, there will be anger about having to pay Â£15 for matches fans had grown used to watching for no extra cost, on top of their subscriptions for Sky and BT.

Extra police patrols as pubs prepare to shut,"Pubs and restaurants in the central belt will have to close for two weeks Additional police officers will be deployed in communities across Scotland to ensure pubs and restaurants close at 18:00, Police Scotland has said. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said patrols would be ""highly visible"" to explain and encourage compliance with new Covid restrictions. After premises close in the central belt, they will not reopen until at least 25 October. Tighter restrictions will also come into force in the rest of the country. Licensed premises will not be able to serve alcohol indoors  and opening hours will be limited. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the moves were ""essential"" to get the spread of the virus back under control. What are the new lockdown rules in Scotland? Pubs forced to close on island with 'no Covid' All cafes in Scotland to be allowed to stay open Restaurants 'cannot turn themselves into cafes' Mr Livingstone said most people had co-operated with the police and supported their work during the Covid crisis. But he said he was concerned about a ""small minority"" who continue to host house parties. In the week up to Sunday 4 October, police broke up 271 illegal house parties, issued 106 fines, and made 18 arrests. ""While restrictions have changed quickly and often, I do not believe anyone in Scotland can be in any doubt that house gatherings and house parties allow the virus to spread and are unlawful,"" Mr Livingstone said. Meanwhile business owners have warned thenew rules could cost thousands of jobsbut details of a Â£40m package of support for hospitality businesses are still to be set out. About 3.4 million people in five health boards - Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lothian, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran - are to be subject to the harshest restrictions. In these areas across the central belt, licensed premises will have to close for 16 days, although they can still serve takeaways. Cafes with a licence will not have to close, as long as they do not serve alcohol butthere is confusion over what constitutes a cafe. Nicola Sturgeon said the government was seeking to strike a ""difficult balance"" Hospitality venues in the rest of Scotland will be allowed to open, but will only be permitted to serve non-alcoholic drinks and food indoors between 06:00 and 18:00. Licensed premises in these areas will still be able to serve alcohol in outdoor areas, such as beer gardens, up to the 22:00 curfew introduced in September. At her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon said the government was waiting for anannouncement from the UK Chancellor on the furlough scheme,which could have an effect on their proposals for a business support package. She said the Scottish plan would include support for employment, a cash grant for each business and a discretionary fund for local authorities. The new restrictions are an attempt to arrest a sharp rise in coronavirus cases, with a further 1,246 positive tests recorded on Friday. There are 397 people in hospital being treated for the virus, with 33 in intensive care. Six confirmed Covid deaths were also recorded in the last 24 hours. Apaper,externalpublished by the government on Wednesday claimed that the rate of infections could hit a peak similar to that experienced in March before the end of October. Further measures will also come into force from midnight to bring back the 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule in shops and tighten the rules around the wearing of face coverings. Outdoor live events, adult contact sports, group exercise classes, snooker and pool halls, casinos and bingo halls will also have to close in the health board areas covering Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lothian, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran. People are also being asked to avoid public transport where possible and not to share a vehicle with another household. Scotland's national clinical director has insisted the new restrictions are not meant as a ""punishment"" from the Scottish government for people not complying with the regulations. Prof Jason Leitch told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme on Friday: ""The enemy here is not the clinical advice. The enemy here is a deadly virus that has killed a million people."" Prof Leitch also told the programme he was ""very hopeful"" that the combination of the recent limitations on household mixing and the new measures will enable progression to the ""next version of what the restrictions might look like"". But, highlighting the spiralling number of cases across Europe, he warned: ""There has to be a reverse gear.""

Shutters to come down on pubs and restaurants,"This video can not be played âLast orders, folks!â - Pub-goers in Glasgow enjoy a final pint Pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland have closed for the last time in at least two weeks. After they shut their doors at 18:00, they will not reopen until 25 October at the earliest. It comes as the Scottish governmentpublishes details,externalof a Â£40m support package for businesses forced to close due to Covid restrictions. There will be a tightening of rules across the rest of the country but licensed premises can remain open. Police Scotland said additional officers would be deployed to ensure premises comply with restrictions. A protest against the measures took place in Glasgow on Friday evening, withbar workers dumping a large pile of iceoutside the City Chambers. Bar workers showed their contempt for the new rules A letter posted to the Glasgow Bartenders Club said venues in Edinburgh were also leaving the remaining contents of their ice machines outside the Scottish Parliament. The new rules come into force as six further Covid deaths were confirmed by the first minister in her daily briefing. What are the new lockdown rules in Scotland? Extra police patrols as pubs prepare to shut Restaurants 'cannot turn themselves into cafes' She said 1,246 positive tests had been recorded and the number of Covid patients in hospital was continuing to increase. ""The restrictions which come into force today are significant, but the case numbers we have seen in recent weeks - including, increasingly, the figures for people being hospitalised - show why they are necessary,"" Ms Sturgeon said. ""We have to stop the virus from spreading further. And having already restricted meetings between households in each other's homes, the most important additional step we can take is to restrict meetings in bars and restaurants."" The Scottish government plans to help businesses with a Â£40m package which includes support for employment, a cash grant for each business and a discretionary fund for local authorities. Ministers were waiting to hear details of the UK's plans to help affected employees before laying out the full details of their scheme. Economy secretary Fiona Hyslop outlined the details of the fund on Friday evening: One-off grants of up to Â£3,000 for businesses required to close by regulations Hardship fund with grants of up to Â£1,500 for businesses that remain open but are directly impacted, such as suppliers Â£9m to help employers pay 20% of the wages of furloughed workers Â£11m discretionary fund to help businesses that do not fall into the above categories, such as soft play centres Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said people who work forUK firms forced to shut by Covid restrictions will get two-thirds of their wages paid by the government. He also announced increased grants for business in England - a move the UK government says will lead to Â£700m additional funding for Scotland. Pubs across the central belt of Scotland closed their doors at 18:00 The scheme is due to start on 1 November - a week after the latest Scottish restrictions are due to end. But employers should be able to use the existing furlough scheme until the end of October. Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes welcomed the move but called for more clarity on ""what it covers in terms of health, transport and business support"". The measures were described as ""good news"" by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce. But its chief executive, Liz Cameron, warned they were not enough to offset the impending loss of trade and jobs. ""We need governments to focus on enabling business to continue to freely function, and manage our way through this situation,"" she said. ""This stop-start approach is damaging for business."" Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross described the funding increase as ""seismic"" while his colleague, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, said it provided a ""vital safety net"". About 3.4 million people in five health boards - Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lothian, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran - are subject to the strictest restrictions. Licensed premises will be closed for 16 days although they can still serve takeaways. Cafes with a licence have been told they can remain open as long as they do not serve alcohol butthere is confusion over what constitutes a cafe. Hospitality venues in the rest of Scotland will be allowed to open, but will only be permitted to serve non-alcoholic drinks and food indoors between 06:00 and 18:00. Licensed premises in these areas will still be able to serve alcohol in outdoor areas, such as beer gardens, up to the 22:00 curfew introduced in September. Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Ms Sturgeon said: ""These measures still allow for some social contact in cafes during the day. And they do not prevent people from taking half-term holidays which have already been booked, or from going ahead with weddings which have already been planned. ""But for a period of just over two weeks, they will remove some of the major opportunities the virus has to spread. That should have a significant impact on transmission rates."" Meanwhile, Police Scotland revealed that in the week up to 4 October officers broke up 271 illegal house parties, issued 106 fines and made 18 arrests.

Teary video brings crowds to struggling food stall,"Indian actors, lawmakers and cricketers have urged people to visit the stall A viral tweet has changed the fortunes of a struggling food stall in India's capital Delhi, even earning it a spot on the food delivery app, Zomato. Customers have been flocking to the spot, touched by a video of the stall's 80-year-old owner crying over the lack of business during the pandemic. And owners Kanta Prasad and his wife, Badami Devi, are now local celebrities. Street food is hugely popular in India, but the pandemic has hit vendors hard, forcing many to shut shop. The couple have been running their shop, Baba ka dhaba, since 1990 in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar. They serve fresh, home-cooked meals - the menu typically includes parathas, a round, buttered bread popular northern India, a gravy of some kind, rice and dal, a thick soup of lentils. A meal sells for less than 50 rupees (about $0.70; Â£0.50). Mr Prasad says that his business had come to a standstill They managed to make ends meet all these years, but the pandemic was devastating, Mr Prasad told a food blogger in a  recent interview. He is seen crying in the video as he talks about his struggles. Mr Prasad shows the dishes they have prepared for the day. When he is asked how much he has earned so far, he shows a few 10-rupee notes and breaks down. The blogger, Gaurav Wasan, shared the clip on Instagram on Wednesday. It travelled quickly, soon making its way on to Twitter.A woman shared it,externalsaying it ""completely broke her heart"" and urged people in Delhi to visit Baba ka dhaba and help Mr Prasad and his wife. It was just a matter of time before the tweet was noticed by celebrities - from Bollywood stars to cricketers - and ordinary people alike. The video has been watched over four million times. By the end of Thursday,Zomato had tweeted,externalsaying Baba ka dhaba was now listed on their app - the service even urged people to let them know of any other struggling food stalls so they could help. Customers have thronged the stall since the video went viral In the video, Mr Prasad says he and his wife start preparing the menu at 6.30am every morning and finish by 9.30am. The first lot of customers are usually informal workers or office-goers looking for a hearty breakfast. But the pandemic, which cost people their jobs or forced them to stay at home, has shrunk business. Mrs Prasad says that at times they take the unsold food back home, and on some days, they don't have money to cook a meal for themselves. But ever since the video went viral, the stall has seen a steady flow of customers, some of whom are eager to squeeze in a selfie with the now-famous spot. TV crews have been showing up as the stall and its owners continue to grab headlines. Bollywood actress Sonam Kapoor and cricketer R Ashwin are among those who have offered to help. Mr Wasan told ANI that he had come across Baba ka dhaba by chance. ""They told me that were making losses every day. So I made a video at the spot and shared it with my followers."" He adds that he has collected around $2,700 in donations to repair the stall and the couple's house. The Prasads are both touched and elated. ""It is all because of Gaurav that the customers have lined up today,"" Mr Prasad told ANI news agency. ""Yesterday there was almost no sales. Today I feel that the whole country is with us.""

Nobel Peace Prize goes to UN World Food Programme,"The WFP says it provided assistance to almost 100 million people last year The 2020 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). The agency was given the prize for its efforts to combat hunger and improve conditions for peace. The WFP, the 101st winner of a prize now worth 10m Swedish krona ($1.1m; Â£875,000), said it was ""deeply humbled"" to have won. Some 107 organisations and 211 individuals were nominated for the award this year. WFP head David Beasley told the BBC's Newshour he was in shock following the announcement. ""I was literally for the first time in my life without words,"" he said. ""To receive this award is a recognition to the men and women at the World Food Programme who put their lives on the line every day for the struggling, suffering people around the world. So I hope this is a signal and a message that the World Food Programme is a role model and that we all have got to do more."" What you need to know about the latest Nobel winner Yemen's humanitarian crisis near breaking point In pictures: Locust swarms in East Africa German Chancellor Angela Merkel was among those to congratulate the group. ""If there is a deserving organisation then this is certainly one of them. The people there do incredible work helping others and therefore I am very pleased about the awarding of this Nobel Peace Prize,"" she said. The World Health Organization and climate activist Greta Thunberg were among the favourites to win this year. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, nomination shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years, and the organisation says any speculation ahead of the announcement is ""sheer guesswork"". The Norwegian Nobel Committee said the WFP was declared winner of the prestigious award ""for its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict"". Chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said that with this year's award the committee wanted to ""turn the eyes of the world to the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger"". ""The World Food Programme plays a key role in multilateral co-operation in making food security an instrument of peace,"" she told a news conference in Oslo. Berit Reiss-Andersen announced the winner in Oslo The committee said Covid-19 had further boosted the importance of the group. ""The coronavirus pandemic has contributed to a strong upsurge in the number of victims of hunger in the world,"" it wrote in a statement. ""In the face of the pandemic, the World Food Programme has demonstrated an impressive ability to intensify its efforts."" Earlier this year, the WFP warned that the world wasat risk of widespread famines ""of biblical proportions""as a result of the pandemic. The UN agency delivers food assistance to countries around the world. The group says it provided assistance to close to 100 million people in 88 countries last year who were victims of acute food insecurity and hunger. The agency was established in 1961, following calls from former US President Dwight D Eisenhower for ""a workable scheme"" to be devised for providing food aid through the UN system. Months after it was created, it responded to a major earthquake in northern Iran, delivering wheat, sugar and tea to survivors. Since then, it has gone on to respond to natural disasters and conflicts around the world, including: Yemen:The WFP says its emergency response in conflict-torn Yemen is its biggest anywhere. It aims to support about 13 million people but has faced a number of challenges. It has accused local leaders of diverting food away from vulnerable people. This year it has warned that it is facing a major funding shortfall, withsome donors stopping aidover concerns that deliveries were being obstructed Afghanistan:The WFP says its ""overarching goal"" is to support the country in tackling hunger in a way that contributes to peace. But it says that decades of ""complex and protracted conflicts"" have created difficulties. There have been instances of the group suspending food aid deliveries to certain areas because of attacks South Sudan:The agency has been supporting people through both conflict and famine. In addition to a years-long civil war, it says a collapsing economy, reduced crop production and dependence on imports means many are unable to access sufficient nutritious food. In 2014, one of its staff members was abducted at gunpoint. However, the organisation has not been free of controversy. In a WFP internal survey last year, at least 28 employees said they had experienced rape or sexual assault while working at the agency. More than 640 others said they were either victims of or had witnessed sexual harassment. Mr Beasley told the Associated Press news agency at the time he was ""making hard choices to bring change"". Last year itwent to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, whose peace deal with Eritrea ended a 20-year military stalemate following their 1998-2000 border war. Former US President Barack Obama won the prize in 2009, for ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"". Other notable winners include former US President Jimmy Carter (2002); child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the European Union (2012); the United Nations and its secretary-general at the time, Kofi Annan, (shared 2001); and Mother Teresa (1979). The Nobel Prize is one of the world's most important awards. It was started in accordance with the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, with the first awards handed out in 1901. Nobel Prizes are awarded in several categories to people ""who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind"" in the previous 12 months. The recipient of each Nobel Prize receives three things: A Nobel diploma, each of which is a unique work of art A Nobel medal A cash prize, which is split between winners when there is more than one. They have to deliver a lecture to receive the money There have been some years when the prize has not been awarded - mostly during the two world wars. Nobel Foundation rules state if nobody deserves the prize in a particular category, it is not awarded and its prize money is kept for the following year.

Firms say fresh wage subsidy may 'cushion the blow',"Businesses groups have largely welcomed a new wage support for workers at firms forced to close by Covid restrictions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said the state will cover two-thirds of staff wages at closed workplaces, and firms in England can get grants of up to Â£3,000 per month. The subsidy is an extension to the Job Support Scheme announced last month. The CBI business lobby group said it ""should cushion the blow for the most affected and keep more people in work"". ""But many firms, including pubs and restaurants, will still be hugely disappointed if they have to close their doors again after doing so much to keep customers and staff safe,"" added CBI boss Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. The business group additionally called for a ""consistent and open strategy for living with Covid-19 through the autumn and winter"". An update on restrictions, which could see pubs and restaurants shut in the worst-affected areas, is expected on Monday. UK workers to get 67% of pay if firms told to shut UK economic growth slows despite restaurant boost UK Hospitality, an industry body representing pubs, restaurants and bars, also welcomed the government support for wage bills, but said more help was needed for companies still trading under restrictions. ""Support for nightclubs and other businesses left in limbo, still unable to reopen, is very welcome. It will help save jobs in a sector that would be sorely missed it were allowed to die,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""However, worryingly, it does nothing to address the issues faced by sector businesses operating well below capacity due to restrictions and consumers avoiding travel and struggling to keep their workforce employed"". The boss of London pub company Young's said pubs and restaurants should be congratulated by the government for creating safe environments for patrons, not seen as a problem whose activities should be restricted. Chief executive Patrick Dardis said: ""Since reopening, we have had 2.7 million people through our doors, but just nine confirmed Covid cases. That's an infection rate of just 0.00000328%. ""Our sector has spent hundreds of millions in ensuring it is Covid safe and secure for staff and customers alike."" The head chef at Newcastle field-to-fork restaurant Bistro forty six, Max Gott, said the restrictions already in place mean he can only sit 12 people per night instead of 30. If a local lockdown was imposed, Mr Gott said the company would have to decide whether it was worth taking the grants, shut up shop and furlough staff while ""trying not to haemorrhage too much money while we shut, or try and operate as a takeaway and try and make some money and break even, although that's unlikely"". He said it would be better for staff if his restaurant could access grants and the subsidy while operating as a take-away. ""Some of the staff won't be able to live on two-thirds wages, we've got mortgages to pay,"" Mr Gott added. See-sawing between opening and closing the restaurant, based on customer reactions to restrictions, came with added costs each time, he said. ""We've got bills coming in all the time - we've got stock that we'll lose - if we had to shut we've got Â£300 of stock that we'd put in the bin or try to give away or something so it all adds up and each time we get told to shut and then open it's a cost"". Many businesses could be forced to close if lockdown restrictions are tightened Federation of Small Businesses boss Mike Cherry said the extra help for closed businesses would be ""welcomed by thousands of small businesses"". ""Evolving the Job Support Scheme to provide two-thirds of total salary costs together with enhancing existing cash grants for those faced with this scenario are both game-changers, and it's welcome to see them adopted today.

Will I still be paid if there is a lockdown?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

Northern leaders to raise Covid fears,"Political leaders from the North of England have warned the chancellor's latest Covid rescue package may ""not be enough"" to save jobs and businesses. Rishi Sunak earlier announced the state will pay two-thirds of the wages of staff whose employers are legally forced to close over the coming months. He said he wanted to work with regional chiefs to help them through the winter. But the mayors of Greater Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield said they still feared widespread ""hardship"". And a group of North-East council leaders are set to oppose any plans to close pubs or other hospitality venues in the worse-affected areas, which could be announced as early as next week. The government is poised to introduce a new three-tiered framework of restrictions for England after coming under pressure to simplify the patchwork of different restrictions in force across much of the North. Ahead of an expected announcement next week, Mr Sunak outlineda support packagefor firms which are no longer trade from their premises, including wage subsidies and increased cash grants from 1 November. Covid cases increase rapidly as next steps planned Sunak to announce help for shut down businesses Virus restrictions for England to be standardised Business groups welcomed the move but Labour said thousands of workers would be excluded while Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and his Liverpool counterpart Steve Rotheram - whose regions are expected to be subject to extra restrictions - also expressed caution. People queuing outside walk-in test centre in Liverpool ""We are pleased that the government has listened and recognised that any new system of restrictions must come with a substantial package of financial support,"" the two men said in a statement, also signed by Sheffield Mayor Dan Jarvis and Jamie Driscoll, Mayor of North Tyne. ""What has been announced by the Chancellor today is a start but, on first look, it would not appear to have gone far enough to prevent genuine hardship, job losses and business failure this winter."" And the leaders of Northumberland, Newcastle, South and North Tyneside, Gateshead, Sunderland and County Durham councils are set to oppose any further restrictions. Martin Gannon, the leader of Gateshead Council, told the BBC that existing measures in place were beginning to work and further restrictions risked ""confusing the message"" and ""undermining public confidence"". ""If you look at the underlying figures across the region, we are seeing the beginning of a decrease in the number of new cases,"" he said following a meeting with Cabinet Office representatives. ""So, our message to the government is that we don't want to see any further restrictions or closing of the economy."" During a briefing on Thursday led by England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty, 150 MPs from Northern constituencies wereshown research from Public Health England,externalsuggesting bars, pubs and restaurants accounted for 41% of cases in which two or more under-30s visited the same venue in the week before testing positive. They were reportedly told that the number of coronavirus patients in intensive care in the north of England would ultimately surpass the April peak if infections continued to increase at the current rate, Conservative Chief Whip Mark Spencer told BBC Radio Nottingham that ministers and scientific advisers were striving to come up with a ""very clear and easily understood system"". Ministers had been expected to announce the new system of tiered restrictions this week but there were reports this has been delayed due to disagreements within cabinet. Accordingto a memo seen by the BBC last week, restrictions would be rationalised into three tiers, depending on the level of infection in a particular area. Two weeks ago, Tory MPs unhappy with lack of Parliamentary scrutiny over local lockdowns forced the government to agree to give them a vote before any new nationwide curbs come into force. Mr Spencer, who is in charge of maintaining discipline on the Conservative benches, said the government would honour its promise to its MPs, with a vote expected next week. Asked about the reported delay in officially announcing the plan, which was briefed to selected newspapers on Wednesday, he said it was ""important to get this right rather than fast as it would be very easy to announce something that isn't going to work"". The new system, he suggested, would be similar to the current approach used by government based on infection rates but with greater flexibility built in. ""As we see the disease increase we will obviously go up those tiers but if we can all observe the social distancing and make sure we keep away from each other the disease will hopefully start to go down in number and then we can ease off that again.""

Could England follow Scotland?,"However you look at the blizzard of statistics about the Coronavirus, the disease is still spreading - despite town after town being placed under extra limits. Even beforeNicola Sturgeon's moves on Wednesdayto try to break the spread in Scotland, ministers in SW1 were looking at the next steps they would need to take to stop the acceleration of the virus. As we've reported, the government is likely to introduce a tiered approach to put different parts of the country with different spreads of the diseases into different categories. But the exact nature of the strictest form of restrictions are yet to be set in stone. Pubs and restaurants in central Scotland to close Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? Check the Covid rules where you live It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion. But Boris Johnson also knows that his own MPs and the opposition parties are more and more sceptical as each day passes about what the government proposes. It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the ""circuit breaker"" that we have talked about on here lots of times. But there are many questions still to be settled. Would that happen everywhere? Or just in the most affected parts of the country? Would closures be total or for a certain period of time only? Would they be temporary? Or put in place until an indeterminate time? A lot is unknown, but the discussions are serious. The Treasury is already looking at financial support for the different options, including not just closing pubs in the most affected areas, but potentially well beyond. There is a lot yet to settle, and the next formal announcement is likely (as things stand) not to come until Monday. But more action is clearly on the way.

Here are the headlines from today's daily coronavirus briefing:  That's all from the live page team today. Please take care and stay safe.   Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie says today's guidance highlights the confusion generated by the first minister's statement on Wednesday. He told BBC One Scotland's Coronavirus Update that there should be a ""proper package of financial support for those self isolating"". Mr Rennie says Scotland should be mass testing students and called for a timetable to detail when society can return to ""some form of normality.""  Mr Rennie adds it is incredibly important to get the route map right going forward. He says: ""This chopping and changing of the last week can't be repeated in future. ""We need to have clarity. We need to have debate. We need to have scrutiny. ""We can't have the parliament being bounced, which is what I warned was going to happen this week."" Asked about footage posted on social media which showed a group of people crowded together outside a pub watching football through the window, the first minister said they should not have been crowded together. ""Should that have happened?... No, it shouldn't. ""It's slightly less risky outside but you shouldn't be in crowded places,"" she said. ""We have to rely on people's personal responsibility."" Nicola Sturgeon added that she could not babysit the whole country to make sure everyone follows the rules. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie was  asked on BBC One Scotland's Coronavirus Update about the latest daily figures. He says there is ""no doubt"" action was required this week and he backed the first minister's call for people to stick with theFACTS,externalguidance. But Mr Rennie adds: ""I think it is unfortunate that this week has been a right guddle. ""I think the late nature of the introduction of the measures, with two days' notice, wasn't long enough for us to be able to scrutinise and pick out the flaws in the guidance. ""That's why we are in this right mess over cafes and restaurants"". But he adds that he hopes it can be cleared up as it is important people know what to do so they can keep safe.

The first minister is asked why the island of Arran is included in the new restrictions which apply to the central belt. She explained: ""If we are to exempt islands from restrictions, then... it would come with other trade offs."" That trade off would be that travel restrictions would have to be added, to prevent people from areas with stricter restricions travelling to places with lower restricitons and potentially carrying the virus with them. ""If you want to exempt islands, you have to have that associated with travel restrictions,"" she reiterated. Prof Stephen Reicher was asked about public compliance amid fears of an increase in house gatherings. He told BBC One Scotland's Coronavirus Update compliance requires a number of factors. Prof Reicher says these include ""clarity about what we are meant to do"" and ""practicality"".  He adds it is important that there are practical measures to help people in the hospitality sector. Thirdly he stresses the importance of motivation. Prof Reicher says: ""I think people do understand there is a risk. ""They do understand we have to deal with the pandemic ""They understand that the choice is between doing something now and being forced into a corner in the future and having to be forced to do far, far more."" But he adds that in the coming days the Scottish government must explain ""what will be different"" so that when the restrictions are lifted we won't simply see another rise in infections. Prof Reicher also calls for more testing, support for people who are self-isolating and better regulation to make sure public spaces are safe. ITV's Scotland correspondent, Peter Smith, asks the first minister if the cafes situation is ""a shambles with jobs on the line"". Nicola Sturgeon says any businesses who are confused should speak to local environmental health officers for clarity. She said she could not personally give guidance to all businesses, but if ""people want us to come down firmly on one side or the other, it will be on the side of closing"". This is because, she explained, that is the only way to minimise social interaction between people and therefore slow the spread of the coronavirus. Prof Stephen Reicher was asked on BBC One Scotland's Coronavirus Update for his assessment of the scale and spread of the virus. The social psychology expert says: ""It does seem pretty clear that we are having a rapid rise in infections. ""At the moment we are a bit above 10% of the rate that we had at the peak in March but at the doubling rate - which, as we heard, was once every nine days -  by the end of this month we will be at the same level as we were at the peak in March. ""And, if that were true, then there would be a danger of the NHS being overwhelmed and there would be a need for very stringent lockdown measures."" Prof Reicher, of St Andrews University, adds that the alternative to the measures that have been taken this week is to ""wait and waste the opportunity that we have to deal with the infections without a hard lockdown"". BBC Scotland's David Henderson puts it to the first minister that it is an unfair distinction to allow a cafÃ© serving light meals to remain open while licensed restaurants doing the same must close. Ms Sturgeon again stresses her objective is to ""reduce the volume of people"" who can come together, She says: ""It is not an option to exempt large groups of premises. ""It is not an option to say 'Ok, restaurants just stop selling alcohol and stay open' because that would leave too many premises where people can come together and defeat the purpose of what we are trying to do."" I would simply appeal to people, even if you fundamentally disagree and hate what I am doing right now, at least try and remember that I am not doing it because I want to harm you. I am doing it because I want to keep people safe and strike that balance as best I can. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prof Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, highlights some data to show the scale of the epidemic. The R number is somewhere between 1.3 and 1.7, he says. The doubling time is believed to be nine days. He said experts estimated there were 2,900 new infections every day. ""At this rate, with no further action, we will be at our March peak of new infections per day by the end of October,"" he warned. Prof Leitch added that the central belt was responsible for about 75% of new infections in Scotland. He said the closest international comparison was that we are four weeks behind France and six weeks behind Spain. The first minister accepts there has been a ""lack of clarity"" since the new restrictions were announced in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. But she adds that is the price for ""trying to be flexible"" Ms Sturgeon confirms the new definition of a cafÃ© and says it is based on what a cafÃ© already does. She adds: ""It doesnât allow a restaurant to now turn itself into a
cafÃ©. ""I think business owners will know
whether their establishment fits that definition or not."" She adds any doubts or
questions should be discussed with local environmental health authorities. Ms Sturgeon says: ""I know how tough this is and Iâm sorry
for that. ""But government - all governments - are
trying to strike almost impossible balances right now between lives and jobs.""

The first minister said the Scottish government is waiting for an announcement from the Chancellor later today on support for jobs as tighter rules are expected soon in England. Ms Sturgeon then highlighted the additional support the Scottish government was providing. It includes: The first minster explains the decision to order pubs and restaurants to close while cafes can stay open. She says the reason for the cafÃ© exemption is to give people who are living alone a place where they can meet someone for a chat. She says: ""We judge that as important to help reduce the loneliness and isolation that comes with some of these restrictions that are in place right now. ""But we are deliberately trying to
reduce the volume of places that people might come together so that we can stop
the virus spreading, so weâve got to draw any exemption really tightly."" Ms Sturgeon adds that to allow premises such as restaurants to stop serving alcohol, in effect becoming cafes
and therefore stay open, would ""undermine the purpose of these
restrictions"". Nicola Sturgeon then reiterates the other
central belt restrictions that will be in place for the next fortnight. Snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling
alleys, casinos and bingo halls will close in the five most affected health board areas. Contact sports for people aged 18 and
over will also be suspended - with an exception for professional sports. Indoor group exercise activities will
not be allowed, although the current rules will remain in place for under-18s. Outdoor live events will not be
permitted either.  Those living in the affected areas (Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and Arran, Lothian and Forth Valley) are advised not to travel outside the health board area that they live in. They are also advised not to use public transport ""unless it is absolutely necessary"". People from elsewhere are urged not to travel to those areas either although no-one is being asked to cancel an October break trip. Nicola Sturgeon recaps on the new restrictions and and explains why  stricter
measures will be in place  in five health board regions: Greater Glasgow and Clyde,
Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and Arran, Lothian and Forth Valley. She says: ""You only need to look at todayâs
figures to see why. ""I mentioned that
there are 440 new cases in Glasgow, 306 in Lanarkshire, 192 in Lothian. ""Numbers are lower in Forth Valley and
Ayrshire and Arran - at 53 new cases in Forth Valley and 84 in Ayrshire and
Arran â but they are still very high for the population of those areas."" Ms Sturgeon adds as people live and work across all five areas there can be a ""ripple effect between them"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Peacocks owner on brink putting 24,000 jobs at risk","Edinburgh Woollen Mill, owner of the Peacocks and Jaeger clothing brands, says it plans to appoint administrators in an attempt to save the business. The move puts 21,000 jobs at risk amid what the company described as ""brutal"" trading conditions. ""Like every retailer, we have found the past seven months extremely difficult,"" said Edinburgh Woollen Mill chief executive Steve Simpson. The stores will continue to trade as a review of the firm is carried out. The company says it has had ""a number of expressions of interest for various parts of the group"" which it will consider. Edinburgh Woollen Mill (EWM), which is owned by billionaire businessman Philip Day, has 1,100 stores for its brands. The businesses attract older shoppers who are likely to be keeping away from the High Street to protect against coronavirus, says Catherine Shuttleworth, an independent retail expert. She said it was a ""devastating blow"" to small towns and tourist areas where they are based and that buyers for the businesses as a whole could be hard to come by. ""You might get piecemeal buyers, but I don't hold out much hope,"" she said. Businessman Philip Day owns Edinburgh Woollen Mill Mr Day has a Â£1.14bn fortune, according to the Sunday Times Rich List published in May 2020. He bought BonmarchÃ© out of administration in February. The deal ruffled some feathers, since Mr Day was its previous owner and landlords and suppliers were expected to forgive some of its debts. BonmarchÃ© is not part of the plans announced on Friday. Edinburgh Woollen Mill, including BonmarchÃ©, employs 24,000 people. EWM said it had filed a notice to appoint administrators, partly because of ""the harsh trading conditions caused by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and a recent reduction in its credit insurance"". Mr Simpson said: ""Through this process, I hope and believe we will be able to secure the best future for our businesses, but there will inevitably be significant cuts and closures as we work our way through this."" Edinburgh Woollen Mill also owns the Jaeger clothing brand He also blamed part of the company's troubles on ""a series of false rumours about our payments and trading which have impacted our credit insurance"". EWM has been accused by suppliers in Bangladesh of not paying for goods. The company denies this. EWM has appointed FRP to review the business. The firm was also hired for the BonmarchÃ© administration. A spokesperson for FRP said: ""Our team is working with the directors of a number of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group subsidiaries to explore all options for the future of its retail brands, including Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Jaeger, Ponden Mill and Peacocks."" The pandemic has accelerated a shift in the retail industry from physical stores to online shopping people have been stuck at home and stores have been temporarily closed. Last month, the boss of one of the UK's most successful and resilient High Street chains told the BBC that hundreds of thousands of traditional retail jobs may not survive in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Lord Wolfson, who runs clothing firm Next,said there was a clear threat to thousands of jobs,which are now ""unviable"" because the lockdown has triggered a permanent shift to online shopping.

Teary video brings crowds to struggling food stallKanta Prasad's food stall in Delhi was making losses - until a viral tweet changed everything.,"Indian actors, lawmakers and cricketers have urged people to visit the stall A viral tweet has changed the fortunes of a struggling food stall in India's capital Delhi, even earning it a spot on the food delivery app, Zomato. Customers have been flocking to the spot, touched by a video of the stall's 80-year-old owner crying over the lack of business during the pandemic. And owners Kanta Prasad and his wife, Badami Devi, are now local celebrities. Street food is hugely popular in India, but the pandemic has hit vendors hard, forcing many to shut shop. The couple have been running their shop, Baba ka dhaba, since 1990 in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar. They serve fresh, home-cooked meals - the menu typically includes parathas, a round, buttered bread popular northern India, a gravy of some kind, rice and dal, a thick soup of lentils. A meal sells for less than 50 rupees (about $0.70; Â£0.50). Mr Prasad says that his business had come to a standstill They managed to make ends meet all these years, but the pandemic was devastating, Mr Prasad told a food blogger in a  recent interview. He is seen crying in the video as he talks about his struggles. Mr Prasad shows the dishes they have prepared for the day. When he is asked how much he has earned so far, he shows a few 10-rupee notes and breaks down. The blogger, Gaurav Wasan, shared the clip on Instagram on Wednesday. It travelled quickly, soon making its way on to Twitter.A woman shared it,externalsaying it ""completely broke her heart"" and urged people in Delhi to visit Baba ka dhaba and help Mr Prasad and his wife. It was just a matter of time before the tweet was noticed by celebrities - from Bollywood stars to cricketers - and ordinary people alike. The video has been watched over four million times. By the end of Thursday,Zomato had tweeted,externalsaying Baba ka dhaba was now listed on their app - the service even urged people to let them know of any other struggling food stalls so they could help. Customers have thronged the stall since the video went viral In the video, Mr Prasad says he and his wife start preparing the menu at 6.30am every morning and finish by 9.30am. The first lot of customers are usually informal workers or office-goers looking for a hearty breakfast. But the pandemic, which cost people their jobs or forced them to stay at home, has shrunk business. Mrs Prasad says that at times they take the unsold food back home, and on some days, they don't have money to cook a meal for themselves. But ever since the video went viral, the stall has seen a steady flow of customers, some of whom are eager to squeeze in a selfie with the now-famous spot. TV crews have been showing up as the stall and its owners continue to grab headlines. Bollywood actress Sonam Kapoor and cricketer R Ashwin are among those who have offered to help. Mr Wasan told ANI that he had come across Baba ka dhaba by chance. ""They told me that were making losses every day. So I made a video at the spot and shared it with my followers."" He adds that he has collected around $2,700 in donations to repair the stall and the couple's house. The Prasads are both touched and elated. ""It is all because of Gaurav that the customers have lined up today,"" Mr Prasad told ANI news agency. ""Yesterday there was almost no sales. Today I feel that the whole country is with us.""

"Peacocks-owner on brink putting 24,000 jobs at risk","Edinburgh Woollen Mill, owner of the Peacocks and Jaeger clothing brands, says it plans to appoint administrators in an attempt to save the business. The move puts 21,000 jobs at risk amid what the company described as ""brutal"" trading conditions. ""Like every retailer, we have found the past seven months extremely difficult,"" said Edinburgh Woollen Mill chief executive Steve Simpson. The stores will continue to trade as a review of the firm is carried out. The company says it has had ""a number of expressions of interest for various parts of the group"" which it will consider. Edinburgh Woollen Mill (EWM), which is owned by billionaire businessman Philip Day, has 1,100 stores for its brands. The businesses attract older shoppers who are likely to be keeping away from the High Street to protect against coronavirus, says Catherine Shuttleworth, an independent retail expert. She said it was a ""devastating blow"" to small towns and tourist areas where they are based and that buyers for the businesses as a whole could be hard to come by. ""You might get piecemeal buyers, but I don't hold out much hope,"" she said. Businessman Philip Day owns Edinburgh Woollen Mill Mr Day has a Â£1.14bn fortune, according to the Sunday Times Rich List published in May 2020. He bought BonmarchÃ© out of administration in February. The deal ruffled some feathers, since Mr Day was its previous owner and landlords and suppliers were expected to forgive some of its debts. BonmarchÃ© is not part of the plans announced on Friday. Edinburgh Woollen Mill, including BonmarchÃ©, employs 24,000 people. EWM said it had filed a notice to appoint administrators, partly because of ""the harsh trading conditions caused by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and a recent reduction in its credit insurance"". Mr Simpson said: ""Through this process, I hope and believe we will be able to secure the best future for our businesses, but there will inevitably be significant cuts and closures as we work our way through this."" Edinburgh Woollen Mill also owns the Jaeger clothing brand He also blamed part of the company's troubles on ""a series of false rumours about our payments and trading which have impacted our credit insurance"". EWM has been accused by suppliers in Bangladesh of not paying for goods. The company denies this. EWM has appointed FRP to review the business. The firm was also hired for the BonmarchÃ© administration. A spokesperson for FRP said: ""Our team is working with the directors of a number of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group subsidiaries to explore all options for the future of its retail brands, including Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Jaeger, Ponden Mill and Peacocks."" The pandemic has accelerated a shift in the retail industry from physical stores to online shopping people have been stuck at home and stores have been temporarily closed. Last month, the boss of one of the UK's most successful and resilient High Street chains told the BBC that hundreds of thousands of traditional retail jobs may not survive in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Lord Wolfson, who runs clothing firm Next,said there was a clear threat to thousands of jobs,which are now ""unviable"" because the lockdown has triggered a permanent shift to online shopping.

"Trump ready to return to public life, says doctor","President Trump wants to return to the campaign trail but questions remain about his health - and when he first became infected US President Donald Trump has completed his course of treatment for Covid-19 and can return to public engagements this weekend, his physician has said. Dr Sean Conley said the president had responded ""extremely well"" to medication and had ""remained stable"". Mr Trump later said he would probably take another Covid test on Friday and hoped to hold a rally over the weekend. Critics have accused the White House of avoiding questions about Mr Trump's health and testing in recent days. A White House spokeswoman said the president wanted to return to the campaign trail this weekend. But an administration official later said Trump was unlikely to travel so soon because the logistics of organising events at short notice was problematic. An appearance is more likely on Monday, they said. The president is also set to have a televised ""medical evaluation"" on Fox News on Friday evening. Dr Sean Conley: Who is Donald Trump's physician? Top Republican avoids White House over Covid-19 US election 2020: Your top questions answered Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, on Friday announced legislation to establish a commission to assess a president's fitness for office. Mrs Pelosi said it was not meant to rule on Mr Trump's condition, but any serious consideration of the measure before the election is unlikely. Democrats are focusing on a clause in the 25th Amendment that allows a president to be removed from office against their will because of a physical or mental incapacity. The amendment was introduced after the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy to clarify issues around the transfer of presidential powers. It can only be invoked if the vice-president and a majority of cabinet secretaries or Congress agree. Democrats are looking to set up mechanisms that would enable Congress to have more say on a president's fitness. Conservatives say this is a political move to attack Mr Trump's health ahead of the election. On Friday, Mrs Pelosi said the move was ""not about President Trump"", who ""will face the judgment of the voters"". ""This legislation applies to future presidents but we are reminded of the necessity of action by the health of the current president."" Previewing the legislation on Thursday, Mrs Pelosi told reporters that serious questions concerning Mr Trump's health were still unanswered, and described the president as being in an ""altered state"". Mr Trump called Ms Pelosi ""crazy"" and said she was ""the one who should be under observation"". Speaking on Fox News late on Thursday, Mr Trump said he was feeling ""really good"" and hoped to hold a campaign rally on Saturday evening, possibly in Florida. The president was also heard clearing his throat and coughing during the interview. At one point, he appeared to mute his mic after needing to clear his throat. Fox News has since said that Mr Trump will appear for a televised ""medical evaluation"" on Friday at 20:00ET (01:00BST). It will be his first on-camera interview since his diagnosis and he will undergo an evaluation by Dr Mark Siegel, a Fox contributor. Earlier this week, White House doctor Dr Conley had said that if the president's condition remained the same or improved throughout the weekend and into Monday, ""we will all take that final, deep sigh of relief"". The White House is still trying to cope with a Covid-19 outbreak Although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House. New Covid safety measures are in place there. One of the top Republicans, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, said on Thursday that he had not been to the White House since 6 August because its approach to handling Covid with social distancing and masks was ""different from mine and what I suggested we do in the Senate"". This video can not be played Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends self-isolating for 10 days after a positive test. The CDC also says isolation could end earlier after ""two negative test results in a row, from tests done at least 24 hours apart"". Questions remain about when the president first became infected and whether he could still be contagious. In a memo released by the White House on Thursday evening, Dr Conley said Mr Trump was displaying no signs ""to suggest progression of illness"". ""Saturday will be day 10 since [last] Thursday's diagnosis, and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the president's safe return to public engagements at that time,"" the memo added. Mr Trump avoided questions while speaking to Fox News on Thursday about whether he had been tested recently, but said he would probably be tested on Friday. We know Mr Trump tested positive for Covid-19 last Thursday night, according to his doctors. We do not know when his last negative test was, however. On Monday, Dr Conley also avoided questions about it. As a result, some have wondered whether the president was getting regularly tested at all. The questions come amid a row over the next presidential debates between Mr Trump and challenger Joe Biden. The Trump campaign has rejected the debate commission's plan of a virtual debate next week, saying there is no medical reason to avoid an in-person event. Who has Trump met and who's tested positive? US election 2020: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden? What did we learn from the VP debate? The US election will be held on 3 November. Latest opinion polls suggest that Mr Biden's lead has increased since the chaotic first debate and the president's coronavirus diagnosis. Six million ballots have already been cast in early voting.

'I thought I'd die' in homophobic attack,"This video can not be played ""I shouldn't be scared to walk down the street"" Two years ago, 50-year-old Tommy Barwick was attacked after London's Pride parade. He was left requiring the use of a wheelchair. ""I heard shouting behind me that was homophobic. Then I was hit. I felt my back crack and I fell to the floor. They stamped on my back,"" said Tommy - and they swore at him as he lay on the ground and told him he ""deserved it"". ""The pain - it was so awful. I was in and out of consciousness. I thought I was going to die, I really did. I thought I was never going to see my daughter again,"" he said, recalling the traumatic experience. This homophobic assault - an attack based on prejudice against LGBT people - was part of a surge in such cases over the past five years. LGBT people 'still suffering' during lockdown Homophobic hate crimes increase in London New figures obtained by the BBC from all 45 police forces in the UK reveal that the number of reported homophobic hate crime cases almost trebled - from 6,655 in 2014-15, the year same sex marriage became legal in England, to 18,465 in 2019-20. In the past year, there has been a 20% rise in reports to police of homophobic hate crime, according to the data which was obtained through Freedom of Information requests. Police forces said this increase could reflect a greater confidence in reporting such crimes. But LGBT charities said they had seen a rise in people experiencing such hate crimes and this could be just the ""tip of the iceberg"". Tommy Barwick's attackers were never found The attack has left Tommy in pain - and it meant losing his livelihood because he was no longer able to run the shop he owned. ""My life was taken from me. I can't play with my daughter like I used to. I don't sleep. I have flashbacks. I have nightmares. I'm financially ruined,"" he told the BBC. But his attackers were never found. The police force dealing with his case has apologised for the way that his case was handled, and the BBC has seen the letter. ""I wanted to reiterate my apology for the lack of face-to-face contact with any officer after your attack. It is clear that the service you received left you feeling let down, and this is not acceptable,"" he was told by the police. But Tommy doesn't think that's good enough. ""They've told me that they handled my case wrong, and that now they'll train their officers better. But that doesn't help me. I haven't got a lot of trust in them anymore."" A hate crime is a criminal offence that is motivated by ""hostility or prejudice"" towards someone because of factors such as their race or religion or their sexual orientation. It means prosecutors can apply to the court to increase the offender's sentence. Such cases of hate crimes based on sexual orientation seem to have been increasing in many areas. In West Yorkshire, such crimes rose from 161 in 2014-15 to 1,093 in 2019-20 Merseyside cases rose from 65 to 678 in the same years Essex from 97 to 533 London's Metropolitan Police saw reports rise from 1,549 to 3,013 Greater Manchester Police saw reports rise from 423 to 1,231 Hertfordshire police recorded 176 such crimes in 2018-19, which rose to 495 in 2019-2020 Northamptonshire police recorded 82 and 177 in same periods Charlie Graham, a 21-year-old from Sunderland, says homophobic hate crime is just a part of life. Charlie has been attacked several times over the past three years - and was left beaten and covered in blood after the most recent incident a few months ago. ""I did go downhill after the first two of three times. Like really downhill, to the point where I was in a hole and I didn't want to come out of it,"" Charlie said about the impacts of the attacks. ""Suicidal thoughts, drinking, not giving a care in the world."" As with Tommy's experience, Charlie's attackers were never found. The police looking into the case apologised. Even after going through such horrific experiences, Charlie refuses to change any way of life, and said nobody else should have to either. ""I could come up with lots of examples where we are getting it right,"" said Deputy Chief Constable Julie Cooke, the lead for LGBT at the National Police Chiefs' Council. ""But I absolutely take seriously where we don't. And we need to make sure that we improve and learn from those times when we've not done it right,"" she said. ""It is hugely underreported. And so please do come forward. And if you're not getting the right response that you would expect, please make sure that you tell us about that."" But Nancy Kelley, chief executive of Stonewall, the LGBT charity, doesn't think the rise is just down to better reporting. ""We are definitely seeing a real increase in people reaching out for help across all of the LGBT organisations,"" she said. ""So we are very concerned that this is a real rise in people who are being attacked because of who they are and who they love. ""We know that 80% of LGBT people don't report hate crimes. So this is really just the tip of the iceberg. ""One of the key steps to changing this is making it visible, and by standing up and saying that we shouldn't have to experience this kind of hate and abuse.""

Pubs 'could close' if Covid cases keep rising,"Pubs in Wales currently have to stop serving alcohol at 22:00 Pubs in Wales could close if coronavirus cases continue to rise, the health minister has warned. All bars and restaurants across central Scotland have been closedfollowing a surge in cases. Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government was considering the measure, but said it could mean ""significant unemployment"" unless there was financial support from Westminster. Currently, pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales stop serving alcohol at 22:00. Mr Gething told BBC Radio Wales ""we are not yet at a point"" where widespread closures of bars was needed, but the situation was ""rapidly evolving"". The man in charge of Public Health Wales' response to the pandemic, Dr Giri Shankar,has raised concerns over ongoing transmissions in pubs and bars Figures show there has been 33 cases linked to venues in the Garw Valley, Bridgend county, and cases have been linked to bars in Newport in recent weeks. Restrictions areto be further tightened in parts of Englandearly next week, with the closure of bars and restaurants a possibility, the BBC has been told. In Wales, the infection rate stands at 95.1 cases per 100,000 of the population, over the past seven days, with2,999 people testing positive in the last week,external. Health board facing extremely difficult winter Children's mental health 'collateral damage' of the virus On Friday, Mr Gething said the infection rate would need to drip below 50 cases per 100,000 in order to avoid ""larger measures"" regionally or nationally. He told BBC Radio Wales the situation was being reviewed every day, but the Welsh Government was ""considering"" closing pubs. New rules in Scotland have been described as a ""death sentence"" for many pubs and restaurants But, he said, the impact on people's livelihoods would be significant if the UK government did not give financial support. ""We also have to consider, if we are going to close a sector of the economy without support... then they are going to lose their jobs, they are going to lose their businesses, and there is a direct health impact that comes from significant unemployment,"" he said. ""We are not at the point where we need to have wholesale closures in the hospitality industry, but this is a rapidly evolving, highly infectious disease and the picture could be different on Sunday or Monday then the one we have today. ""I'm not itching to press a button, I'm looking to see what we can do to keep people alive, and to keep Wales safe."" Owner of the Boar's Head Hotel in Carmarthen, William Hunter, said he did not think his business would be viable if there were any further changes to the rules. ""It's so worrying at the moment.  We're more than 50% down - any more restrictions will push us that bit further which won't be viable,"" he said. ""We're at the stage where we're offering 50% off all food, four days a week - which is keeping us afloat."" At a daily coronavirus briefing, First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""When I was talking to the chief constable of Gwent and others yesterday, the evidence on the ground in that part of Wales was that the numbers that are rising are not being caused by hospitality businesses."" He said the approach was to ""match the action to the source of the problem"".

LiveLiveCovid in Scotland: Updates2 minutes ago2 minutes ago Police pledge extra officers to support new restrictionsPolice pledge extra officers to support new restrictions5 minutes ago Welcome to our live page coverageWelcome to our live page coverage13 minutes ago Confusion over cafes as hospitality awaits answersConfusion over cafes as hospitality awaits answersLive Covid in Scotland: Updates  2 minutes ago,"The first minister says six people have died in the past 24 hours after a recent positive Covid test A further 1,246 people have tested positive in the same period Police Scotland will have additional officers on duty to enforce new rules which begin this evening Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish government will support businesses affected A definition of what a cafe is, for the purposes of the restrictions, has been published BBC Scotland News The first minister draws the definition of cafes ""very tightly"" to reduce the number of places people can meet. Here are the headlines from today's daily coronavirus briefing:  That's all from the live page team today. Please take care and stay safe.   Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie says today's guidance highlights the confusion generated by the first minister's statement on Wednesday. He told BBC One Scotland's Coronavirus Update that there should be a ""proper package of financial support for those self isolating"". Mr Rennie says Scotland should be mass testing students and called for a timetable to detail when society can return to ""some form of normality.""  Mr Rennie adds it is incredibly important to get the route map right going forward. He says: ""This chopping and changing of the last week can't be repeated in future. ""We need to have clarity. We need to have debate. We need to have scrutiny. ""We can't have the parliament being bounced, which is what I warned was going to happen this week."" Asked about footage posted on social media which showed a group of people crowded together outside a pub watching football through the window, the first minister said they should not have been crowded together. ""Should that have happened?... No, it shouldn't. ""It's slightly less risky outside but you shouldn't be in crowded places,"" she said. ""We have to rely on people's personal responsibility."" Nicola Sturgeon added that she could not babysit the whole country to make sure everyone follows the rules. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie was  asked on BBC One Scotland's Coronavirus Update about the latest daily figures. He says there is ""no doubt"" action was required this week and he backed the first minister's call for people to stick with theFACTS,externalguidance. But Mr Rennie adds: ""I think it is unfortunate that this week has been a right guddle. ""I think the late nature of the introduction of the measures, with two days' notice, wasn't long enough for us to be able to scrutinise and pick out the flaws in the guidance. ""That's why we are in this right mess over cafes and restaurants"". But he adds that he hopes it can be cleared up as it is important people know what to do so they can keep safe.

The first minister is asked why the island of Arran is included in the new restrictions which apply to the central belt. She explained: ""If we are to exempt islands from restrictions, then... it would come with other trade offs."" That trade off would be that travel restrictions would have to be added, to prevent people from areas with stricter restricions travelling to places with lower restricitons and potentially carrying the virus with them. ""If you want to exempt islands, you have to have that associated with travel restrictions,"" she reiterated. Prof Stephen Reicher was asked about public compliance amid fears of an increase in house gatherings. He told BBC One Scotland's Coronavirus Update compliance requires a number of factors. Prof Reicher says these include ""clarity about what we are meant to do"" and ""practicality"".  He adds it is important that there are practical measures to help people in the hospitality sector. Thirdly he stresses the importance of motivation. Prof Reicher says: ""I think people do understand there is a risk. ""They do understand we have to deal with the pandemic ""They understand that the choice is between doing something now and being forced into a corner in the future and having to be forced to do far, far more."" But he adds that in the coming days the Scottish government must explain ""what will be different"" so that when the restrictions are lifted we won't simply see another rise in infections. Prof Reicher also calls for more testing, support for people who are self-isolating and better regulation to make sure public spaces are safe. ITV's Scotland correspondent, Peter Smith, asks the first minister if the cafes situation is ""a shambles with jobs on the line"". Nicola Sturgeon says any businesses who are confused should speak to local environmental health officers for clarity. She said she could not personally give guidance to all businesses, but if ""people want us to come down firmly on one side or the other, it will be on the side of closing"". This is because, she explained, that is the only way to minimise social interaction between people and therefore slow the spread of the coronavirus. Prof Stephen Reicher was asked on BBC One Scotland's Coronavirus Update for his assessment of the scale and spread of the virus. The social psychology expert says: ""It does seem pretty clear that we are having a rapid rise in infections. ""At the moment we are a bit above 10% of the rate that we had at the peak in March but at the doubling rate - which, as we heard, was once every nine days -  by the end of this month we will be at the same level as we were at the peak in March. ""And, if that were true, then there would be a danger of the NHS being overwhelmed and there would be a need for very stringent lockdown measures."" Prof Reicher, of St Andrews University, adds that the alternative to the measures that have been taken this week is to ""wait and waste the opportunity that we have to deal with the infections without a hard lockdown"". BBC Scotland's David Henderson puts it to the first minister that it is an unfair distinction to allow a cafÃ© serving light meals to remain open while licensed restaurants doing the same must close. Ms Sturgeon again stresses her objective is to ""reduce the volume of people"" who can come together, She says: ""It is not an option to exempt large groups of premises. ""It is not an option to say 'Ok, restaurants just stop selling alcohol and stay open' because that would leave too many premises where people can come together and defeat the purpose of what we are trying to do."" I would simply appeal to people, even if you fundamentally disagree and hate what I am doing right now, at least try and remember that I am not doing it because I want to harm you. I am doing it because I want to keep people safe and strike that balance as best I can. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prof Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, highlights some data to show the scale of the epidemic. The R number is somewhere between 1.3 and 1.7, he says. The doubling time is believed to be nine days. He said experts estimated there were 2,900 new infections every day. ""At this rate, with no further action, we will be at our March peak of new infections per day by the end of October,"" he warned. Prof Leitch added that the central belt was responsible for about 75% of new infections in Scotland. He said the closest international comparison was that we are four weeks behind France and six weeks behind Spain. The first minister accepts there has been a ""lack of clarity"" since the new restrictions were announced in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. But she adds that is the price for ""trying to be flexible"" Ms Sturgeon confirms the new definition of a cafÃ© and says it is based on what a cafÃ© already does. She adds: ""It doesnât allow a restaurant to now turn itself into a
cafÃ©. ""I think business owners will know
whether their establishment fits that definition or not."" She adds any doubts or
questions should be discussed with local environmental health authorities. Ms Sturgeon says: ""I know how tough this is and Iâm sorry
for that. ""But government - all governments - are
trying to strike almost impossible balances right now between lives and jobs."" An establishment whose primary business activity, in the ordinary course of its business, is the sale of non alcoholic drinks, snacks or light meals.

The first minister said the Scottish government is waiting for an announcement from the Chancellor later today on support for jobs as tighter rules are expected soon in England. Ms Sturgeon then highlighted the additional support the Scottish government was providing. It includes: The first minster explains the decision to order pubs and restaurants to close while cafes can stay open. She says the reason for the cafÃ© exemption is to give people who are living alone a place where they can meet someone for a chat. She says: ""We judge that as important to help reduce the loneliness and isolation that comes with some of these restrictions that are in place right now. ""But we are deliberately trying to
reduce the volume of places that people might come together so that we can stop
the virus spreading, so weâve got to draw any exemption really tightly."" Ms Sturgeon adds that to allow premises such as restaurants to stop serving alcohol, in effect becoming cafes
and therefore stay open, would ""undermine the purpose of these
restrictions"". Nicola Sturgeon then reiterates the other
central belt restrictions that will be in place for the next fortnight. Snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling
alleys, casinos and bingo halls will close in the five most affected health board areas. Contact sports for people aged 18 and
over will also be suspended - with an exception for professional sports. Indoor group exercise activities will
not be allowed, although the current rules will remain in place for under-18s. Outdoor live events will not be
permitted either.  Those living in the affected areas (Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and Arran, Lothian and Forth Valley) are advised not to travel outside the health board area that they live in. They are also advised not to use public transport ""unless it is absolutely necessary"". People from elsewhere are urged not to travel to those areas either although no-one is being asked to cancel an October break trip. Nicola Sturgeon recaps on the new restrictions and and explains why  stricter
measures will be in place  in five health board regions: Greater Glasgow and Clyde,
Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and Arran, Lothian and Forth Valley. She says: ""You only need to look at todayâs
figures to see why. ""I mentioned that
there are 440 new cases in Glasgow, 306 in Lanarkshire, 192 in Lothian. ""Numbers are lower in Forth Valley and
Ayrshire and Arran - at 53 new cases in Forth Valley and 84 in Ayrshire and
Arran â but they are still very high for the population of those areas."" Ms Sturgeon adds as people live and work across all five areas there can be a ""ripple effect between them"". Â© 2025 BBC.

'I thought I'd die' in homophobic attackNew figures reveal reported homophobic hate crimes have almost trebled in the past five years.UK,"This video can not be played ""I shouldn't be scared to walk down the street"" Two years ago, 50-year-old Tommy Barwick was attacked after London's Pride parade. He was left requiring the use of a wheelchair. ""I heard shouting behind me that was homophobic. Then I was hit. I felt my back crack and I fell to the floor. They stamped on my back,"" said Tommy - and they swore at him as he lay on the ground and told him he ""deserved it"". ""The pain - it was so awful. I was in and out of consciousness. I thought I was going to die, I really did. I thought I was never going to see my daughter again,"" he said, recalling the traumatic experience. This homophobic assault - an attack based on prejudice against LGBT people - was part of a surge in such cases over the past five years. LGBT people 'still suffering' during lockdown Homophobic hate crimes increase in London New figures obtained by the BBC from all 45 police forces in the UK reveal that the number of reported homophobic hate crime cases almost trebled - from 6,655 in 2014-15, the year same sex marriage became legal in England, to 18,465 in 2019-20. In the past year, there has been a 20% rise in reports to police of homophobic hate crime, according to the data which was obtained through Freedom of Information requests. Police forces said this increase could reflect a greater confidence in reporting such crimes. But LGBT charities said they had seen a rise in people experiencing such hate crimes and this could be just the ""tip of the iceberg"". Tommy Barwick's attackers were never found The attack has left Tommy in pain - and it meant losing his livelihood because he was no longer able to run the shop he owned. ""My life was taken from me. I can't play with my daughter like I used to. I don't sleep. I have flashbacks. I have nightmares. I'm financially ruined,"" he told the BBC. But his attackers were never found. The police force dealing with his case has apologised for the way that his case was handled, and the BBC has seen the letter. ""I wanted to reiterate my apology for the lack of face-to-face contact with any officer after your attack. It is clear that the service you received left you feeling let down, and this is not acceptable,"" he was told by the police. But Tommy doesn't think that's good enough. ""They've told me that they handled my case wrong, and that now they'll train their officers better. But that doesn't help me. I haven't got a lot of trust in them anymore."" A hate crime is a criminal offence that is motivated by ""hostility or prejudice"" towards someone because of factors such as their race or religion or their sexual orientation. It means prosecutors can apply to the court to increase the offender's sentence. Such cases of hate crimes based on sexual orientation seem to have been increasing in many areas. In West Yorkshire, such crimes rose from 161 in 2014-15 to 1,093 in 2019-20 Merseyside cases rose from 65 to 678 in the same years Essex from 97 to 533 London's Metropolitan Police saw reports rise from 1,549 to 3,013 Greater Manchester Police saw reports rise from 423 to 1,231 Hertfordshire police recorded 176 such crimes in 2018-19, which rose to 495 in 2019-2020 Northamptonshire police recorded 82 and 177 in same periods Charlie Graham, a 21-year-old from Sunderland, says homophobic hate crime is just a part of life. Charlie has been attacked several times over the past three years - and was left beaten and covered in blood after the most recent incident a few months ago. ""I did go downhill after the first two of three times. Like really downhill, to the point where I was in a hole and I didn't want to come out of it,"" Charlie said about the impacts of the attacks. ""Suicidal thoughts, drinking, not giving a care in the world."" As with Tommy's experience, Charlie's attackers were never found. The police looking into the case apologised. Even after going through such horrific experiences, Charlie refuses to change any way of life, and said nobody else should have to either. ""I could come up with lots of examples where we are getting it right,"" said Deputy Chief Constable Julie Cooke, the lead for LGBT at the National Police Chiefs' Council. ""But I absolutely take seriously where we don't. And we need to make sure that we improve and learn from those times when we've not done it right,"" she said. ""It is hugely underreported. And so please do come forward. And if you're not getting the right response that you would expect, please make sure that you tell us about that."" But Nancy Kelley, chief executive of Stonewall, the LGBT charity, doesn't think the rise is just down to better reporting. ""We are definitely seeing a real increase in people reaching out for help across all of the LGBT organisations,"" she said. ""So we are very concerned that this is a real rise in people who are being attacked because of who they are and who they love. ""We know that 80% of LGBT people don't report hate crimes. So this is really just the tip of the iceberg. ""One of the key steps to changing this is making it visible, and by standing up and saying that we shouldn't have to experience this kind of hate and abuse.""

MPs call for more clarity,"MPs from the Midlands and northern England are calling for more detail on possible plans to close restaurants and pubs in areas worst-hit by coronavirus. They met ministers earlier, with some venting frustration about potential restrictionsappearing in newspapersbefore being announced in Parliament. A tiered system of measures could be introduced next Wednesday, in an effort to stall rising infection rates. The government said it was trying to create ""greater consistency on rules"". There were 17,540 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Thursday, up from the 14,162 reported the day before, government data showed. A further 77 people died after testing positive for the virus within 28 days. MPs took part in a video call with health ministers Nadine Dorries and Edward Argar - and England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty - earlier on Thursday. New Covid rules for parts of England 'within days' Do local lockdowns stop the spread of covid? What are the Covid restrictions where I live? The chief medical officer presented evidence to the MPs that a ""significant proportion"" of exposure to coronavirus was happening in the hospitality sector - but nothing more was shown on the scope, severity, timing or precise location of any new restrictions. Yet again, ministers are wrestling with grim trade-offs where no decision is pain-free. But they're also wrestling with a communications challenge: what do you do when newspapers have been briefed that ""Restaurants and pubs in North forced to shut again"", as the Times front page headline reads today, but it hasn't yet been formally decided and announced? Well, a cabinet minister ends up doing a round of interviews where he or she can't answer any of the key questions directly: precisely which parts of the country will be affected by the new regulations, when, for how long, and how severe will they be? Cue noisy grumbles from local leaders in those cities with sky-high infection rates, who don't know what is going to happen. Yes, most of those leaders are Labour politicians not averse to complaining about a Conservative government, but ministers are left with an announcement that appears half-made: the prospect that various businesses may have to close or significantly scale back what they do, but without it being clear which ones, or where. Profound changes affecting millions of people hover as an imminent prospect. But ask a specific question, and the answer is we don't know. Shadow health minister Alex Norris, an MP for Nottingham North - now the city with the highest case numbers in England - told BBC News: ""It was not the most convincing call to be part of."" ""When pressed about Nottingham, the advice that came back was, 'We've not decided yet,' which is hard to understand when I have then talked to local journalists and they are getting better briefings than we are."" He said he understood new restrictions would be coming in next week, adding he believed they should come in immediately ""given we are top of the list now"". Ben Bradley, Conservative MP for Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, who took part in the call, said: ""There are some really challenging circumstances. ""We talked about the North West and North East in particular, where we were talking about - in three weeks' time - having hospitalisation levels higher than in the original peak."" He said ministers had told the MPs to expect new measures to be announced on Monday and implemented on Wednesday. The meeting came amid growing anger among politicians about the way the government has handled new restrictions in parts of the country with high infection rates. Labour's mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, told the BBC he had been ""having discussions with ministers this week. At no point did somebody say, 'We're closing all hospitality in the north of England on Monday.'"" Former minister Jake Berry, the Conservative MP for Rossendale and Darwen, has accused the prime minister of enjoying his emergency powers ""a little bit too much"" and of being ""London-centric"". The Conservative MP for Bishop Auckland, Dehenna Davidson, said in the Commons that the government was ""exactly right to take a localised approach"". But she said the public in some areas of her constituency did not understand why they faced local restrictions when case numbers were low. A slide shown at the meeting lists hospitality as the most frequent setting for coronavirus exposure. Liverpool's Labour Metro Mayor, Steve Rotheram, said the ""North should not be a petri dish for experimentation by central government"". MPs have also expressed unease about the ""rule of six"" and the 10pm curfew for pubs and restaurants, calling for the scientific rationale behind the measure to be made public. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said his partywill not be ""voting down"" the curfewnext week, instead saying the rule ""needs to be reformed"". Others on the left of the Labour Party, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell,want a more ""severe"" lockdown,external. One told the BBC they wanted a ""zero Covid approach - hard, fast and backed up by comprehensive testing and financial support"". This video can not be played Cllr David Mellen says a lack of coronavirus restrictions this weekend could mean a âlast chance to party' in Nottingham. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has not ruled out pubs being closed but said the response would be ""proportionate and localised"". He told the BBC the precise measures for different areas would be announced ""in the coming days"". Mr Jenrick added that the government was trying to give ""greater consistency on rules so they're easier to understand"" and was working on ""slightly broader canvases of regions or cities and counties to avoid differences in people's daily lives if they drive over the border"". The government is expected to introduce anew ""three-tier"" approach to coronavirus restrictions in local areas of Englandin an effort to simplify the system and avoid public confusion, the BBC understands. But details of how severe restrictions will be in each tier have yet to be confirmed. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthere were ""whispers in Whitehall of a 'firewall' approach"" to new restrictions,externalexpected next week. This could mean extra limits to be turned on and off again to allow for Christmas, with the possibility of more being introduced in January and February to help the NHS cope. But Laura Kuenssberg said the situation was ""still unclear with so many unknowns"" and final decisions have not been made. The Liberal Democrats have written a letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, calling for the furlough scheme to be extended before enforcing any shutdowns of industries, such as hospitality and retail.

Nobel Peace Prize goes to UN World Food ProgrammeThe Nobel Committee says the World Food Programme won the prize for its efforts to combat hunger.World,"The WFP says it provided assistance to almost 100 million people last year The 2020 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). The agency was given the prize for its efforts to combat hunger and improve conditions for peace. The WFP, the 101st winner of a prize now worth 10m Swedish krona ($1.1m; Â£875,000), said it was ""deeply humbled"" to have won. Some 107 organisations and 211 individuals were nominated for the award this year. WFP head David Beasley told the BBC's Newshour he was in shock following the announcement. ""I was literally for the first time in my life without words,"" he said. ""To receive this award is a recognition to the men and women at the World Food Programme who put their lives on the line every day for the struggling, suffering people around the world. So I hope this is a signal and a message that the World Food Programme is a role model and that we all have got to do more."" What you need to know about the latest Nobel winner Yemen's humanitarian crisis near breaking point In pictures: Locust swarms in East Africa German Chancellor Angela Merkel was among those to congratulate the group. ""If there is a deserving organisation then this is certainly one of them. The people there do incredible work helping others and therefore I am very pleased about the awarding of this Nobel Peace Prize,"" she said. The World Health Organization and climate activist Greta Thunberg were among the favourites to win this year. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, nomination shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years, and the organisation says any speculation ahead of the announcement is ""sheer guesswork"". The Norwegian Nobel Committee said the WFP was declared winner of the prestigious award ""for its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict"". Chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said that with this year's award the committee wanted to ""turn the eyes of the world to the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger"". ""The World Food Programme plays a key role in multilateral co-operation in making food security an instrument of peace,"" she told a news conference in Oslo. Berit Reiss-Andersen announced the winner in Oslo The committee said Covid-19 had further boosted the importance of the group. ""The coronavirus pandemic has contributed to a strong upsurge in the number of victims of hunger in the world,"" it wrote in a statement. ""In the face of the pandemic, the World Food Programme has demonstrated an impressive ability to intensify its efforts."" Earlier this year, the WFP warned that the world wasat risk of widespread famines ""of biblical proportions""as a result of the pandemic. The UN agency delivers food assistance to countries around the world. The group says it provided assistance to close to 100 million people in 88 countries last year who were victims of acute food insecurity and hunger. The agency was established in 1961, following calls from former US President Dwight D Eisenhower for ""a workable scheme"" to be devised for providing food aid through the UN system. Months after it was created, it responded to a major earthquake in northern Iran, delivering wheat, sugar and tea to survivors. Since then, it has gone on to respond to natural disasters and conflicts around the world, including: Yemen:The WFP says its emergency response in conflict-torn Yemen is its biggest anywhere. It aims to support about 13 million people but has faced a number of challenges. It has accused local leaders of diverting food away from vulnerable people. This year it has warned that it is facing a major funding shortfall, withsome donors stopping aidover concerns that deliveries were being obstructed Afghanistan:The WFP says its ""overarching goal"" is to support the country in tackling hunger in a way that contributes to peace. But it says that decades of ""complex and protracted conflicts"" have created difficulties. There have been instances of the group suspending food aid deliveries to certain areas because of attacks South Sudan:The agency has been supporting people through both conflict and famine. In addition to a years-long civil war, it says a collapsing economy, reduced crop production and dependence on imports means many are unable to access sufficient nutritious food. In 2014, one of its staff members was abducted at gunpoint. However, the organisation has not been free of controversy. In a WFP internal survey last year, at least 28 employees said they had experienced rape or sexual assault while working at the agency. More than 640 others said they were either victims of or had witnessed sexual harassment. Mr Beasley told the Associated Press news agency at the time he was ""making hard choices to bring change"". Last year itwent to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, whose peace deal with Eritrea ended a 20-year military stalemate following their 1998-2000 border war. Former US President Barack Obama won the prize in 2009, for ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"". Other notable winners include former US President Jimmy Carter (2002); child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the European Union (2012); the United Nations and its secretary-general at the time, Kofi Annan, (shared 2001); and Mother Teresa (1979). The Nobel Prize is one of the world's most important awards. It was started in accordance with the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, with the first awards handed out in 1901. Nobel Prizes are awarded in several categories to people ""who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind"" in the previous 12 months. The recipient of each Nobel Prize receives three things: A Nobel diploma, each of which is a unique work of art A Nobel medal A cash prize, which is split between winners when there is more than one. They have to deliver a lecture to receive the money There have been some years when the prize has not been awarded - mostly during the two world wars. Nobel Foundation rules state if nobody deserves the prize in a particular category, it is not awarded and its prize money is kept for the following year.

New Scots virus restrictions to come into force,"Pubs and restaurants in the central belt will have to close for two weeks Additional police officers will be deployed in communities across Scotland to ensure pubs and restaurants close at 18:00, Police Scotland has said. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said patrols would be ""highly visible"" to explain and encourage compliance with new Covid restrictions. After premises close in the central belt, they will not reopen until at least 25 October. Tighter restrictions will also come into force in the rest of the country. Licensed premises will not be able to serve alcohol indoors  and opening hours will be limited. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the moves were ""essential"" to get the spread of the virus back under control. What are the new lockdown rules in Scotland? Pubs forced to close on island with 'no Covid' All cafes in Scotland to be allowed to stay open Restaurants 'cannot turn themselves into cafes' Mr Livingstone said most people had co-operated with the police and supported their work during the Covid crisis. But he said he was concerned about a ""small minority"" who continue to host house parties. In the week up to Sunday 4 October, police broke up 271 illegal house parties, issued 106 fines, and made 18 arrests. ""While restrictions have changed quickly and often, I do not believe anyone in Scotland can be in any doubt that house gatherings and house parties allow the virus to spread and are unlawful,"" Mr Livingstone said. Meanwhile business owners have warned thenew rules could cost thousands of jobsbut details of a Â£40m package of support for hospitality businesses are still to be set out. About 3.4 million people in five health boards - Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lothian, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran - are to be subject to the harshest restrictions. In these areas across the central belt, licensed premises will have to close for 16 days, although they can still serve takeaways. Cafes with a licence will not have to close, as long as they do not serve alcohol butthere is confusion over what constitutes a cafe. Nicola Sturgeon said the government was seeking to strike a ""difficult balance"" Hospitality venues in the rest of Scotland will be allowed to open, but will only be permitted to serve non-alcoholic drinks and food indoors between 06:00 and 18:00. Licensed premises in these areas will still be able to serve alcohol in outdoor areas, such as beer gardens, up to the 22:00 curfew introduced in September. At her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon said the government was waiting for anannouncement from the UK Chancellor on the furlough scheme,which could have an effect on their proposals for a business support package. She said the Scottish plan would include support for employment, a cash grant for each business and a discretionary fund for local authorities. The new restrictions are an attempt to arrest a sharp rise in coronavirus cases, with a further 1,246 positive tests recorded on Friday. There are 397 people in hospital being treated for the virus, with 33 in intensive care. Six confirmed Covid deaths were also recorded in the last 24 hours. Apaper,externalpublished by the government on Wednesday claimed that the rate of infections could hit a peak similar to that experienced in March before the end of October. Further measures will also come into force from midnight to bring back the 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule in shops and tighten the rules around the wearing of face coverings. Outdoor live events, adult contact sports, group exercise classes, snooker and pool halls, casinos and bingo halls will also have to close in the health board areas covering Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lothian, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran. People are also being asked to avoid public transport where possible and not to share a vehicle with another household. Scotland's national clinical director has insisted the new restrictions are not meant as a ""punishment"" from the Scottish government for people not complying with the regulations. Prof Jason Leitch told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme on Friday: ""The enemy here is not the clinical advice. The enemy here is a deadly virus that has killed a million people."" Prof Leitch also told the programme he was ""very hopeful"" that the combination of the recent limitations on household mixing and the new measures will enable progression to the ""next version of what the restrictions might look like"". But, highlighting the spiralling number of cases across Europe, he warned: ""There has to be a reverse gear.""

Sunak to announce help for shut down businesses,"The chancellor will set out on Friday more support for businesses forced to close by law, with tighter virus rules expected in England next week. Rishi Sunak will outline the next stage of the Job Support Scheme to help firms that ""may have to close in the coming weeks or months"", the Treasury says. An update on restrictions, which could see pubs and restaurants shut in the worst-affected areas, is due on Monday. Regional leaders have called for more help for struggling firms. The chancellor is expected to announce the new financial support scheme will be a six-month plan, with a three-month review point. But Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Mr Sunak's Job Support Scheme was ""forcing businesses to flip a coin over who stays and who goes"" because it was cheaper to employ one worker than two to do the same hours. How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? LIVE: Welsh government update LIVE: Scotland's first minister briefing The Job Support Scheme, which will replace the furlough scheme from 1 November, will see eligible workers get three quarters of their normal salaries for six months. To be eligible, employees must be in a ''viable job'' where they can work for at least one-third of their normal hours. For the hours not worked, the government and employer will each pay one-third of the remaining wages. This means the employee would get at least 77% of their pay. Nearly three million workers - or 12% of the UK's workforce - are currently on partial or full furlough leave, according to official figures. The current furlough scheme ends on 31 October. But Labour's shadow chancellor Ms Dodds tweeted that the Job Support Scheme ""makes it more expensive to bring staff back than many other international schemes"". She said the cost to an employer of bringing back two workers in the arts sector for half of the week versus one for the whole week was Â£163 in the UK, compared with Â£98 in the Netherlands, Â£69 in France and nothing in Germany. ""Once again it seems like the chancellor has waited to the last possible minute to start listening to Labour and bring in targeted support for those parts of the country under local restrictions,"" she said. ""The chancellor's constant flip-flopping on furlough is putting 900,000 jobs at risk, leaving workers in limbo and creating chaos in the midst of a pandemic."" In other developments: New restrictions aimed at halting the rise in Covid infections in Scotland- including the closure of pubs and restaurants in the central belt - come into force later on Friday In Nottingham, local leadershave called for urgent action from the governmentafter it was announced the city has the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK Latest Office for National Statistics datasuggests coronavirus cases in England have ""increased rapidly""with one in 240 people infected UK economic growth has sloweddespite a boost for restaurants in August Edinburgh Woollen Mills, owner of the Peacocks and Jaeger clothing brands,says it plans to appoint administrators, putting 24,000 jobs at risk Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said local leaders should be ""in the room"" and included in local lockdown decisions A tiered system of measures for England is set to be announced by Monday, in an effort to stall rising infection rates, to replace the patchwork of existing rules across the country. Under the new system, different parts of the country would be placed in different categories - although ministers are still discussing the precise details. What's the evidence for 10pm pub closing time? How much will I get paid when furlough ends? UK economic growth slows despite restaurant boost Pubs and restaurants could be closed in the worst-affected areas, while a ban on overnight stays is also being considered. Conservative chief whip Mark Spencerhas said MPs will be given a vote on the proposed new framework, saying the tiered system was ""being worked on at the moment"". He told BBC Radio Nottingham that ministers and scientific advisers were striving to come up with a ""very clear and easily understood systemâ¦so we all know what the aim is"". On Thursday, England's chief medical officer Chris Whittypresented evidence to MPs in a video callthat a ""significant proportion"" of exposure to coronavirus was happening in the hospitality sector - but nothing more was shown on the scope, severity, timing or precise location of any new restrictions. But there has been growing anger among MPs and local leaders about the way the government has communicated the proposed changes with them. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham accused the government of treating the north of England with ""contempt"" after he learned ministers were considering shutting hospitality venues in the worst-affected areas in a newspaper report. Mr Burnham said he would challenge the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants if the measure did not come with financial support. He told BBC's Question Time: ""The message I've given to the government is a pretty clear one - there can be no restrictions without support. ""And if it's going to be the tier three restrictions - effectively a national lockdown - we have to go back to a full furlough scheme for those staff, support for those businesses, otherwise the north of England is going to be levelled down this winter and I won't accept it."" MPs call for more clarity on local lockdowns Do local lockdowns stop the spread of covid? Could English pubs follow in Scotland's steps? In response, junior minister Gillian Keegan said the government had to act to stem the rise in cases. ""This is serious - it is getting out of control, and we have to do something to bring it back under control,"" she said. But she acknowledged that communication with the worst-hit areas needed to improve. There were 17,540 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Thursday, up from the 14,162 reported the day before,government data showed,external. A further 77 people died after testing positive for the virus within 28 days. NHS England data published on Thursday showedthe number of people waiting more than a year to start hospital treatment is at its highest level since 2008- with some 111,026 people waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in August.

How could recession affect me?,"The UK is out of recession after the economy returned to growth in the first three months of the year, official figures show. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the economy was ""returning to full health"", but Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said this was no time for a ""victory lap"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures for the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is the value of all the goods and services the UK produces. When GDP rises, a country's economy grows and average incomes rise as a result. But sometimes the economy shrinks, GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly, which could hit people's pockets. What is GDP and how does it affect me? The UK is in recession if GDP falls for two successive three-month periods - known as quarters. The economy shrank 0.1% between July and September last year and then by a further 0.3% between October and December. This meantthe economy went into recession at the end of 2023. But the latest figures from the ONS show the UK economy grew by 0.6% between January and March 2024, marking the end of the recession. Is Rishi Sunak keeping his five key promises? Theprevious UK recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. It only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% fall in GDP recorded between April and June 2020 was the largest on record. In 2008 a recession started as a result of the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters, or 15 months. Economic growth can mean more jobs are available and companies can pay more to employees and shareholders. Higher wages and larger profits also generate money for the government through taxes. It can chooseto spend more on things like benefits and public services, or cut tax rates. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Some people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Others may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Benefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle, especially if the government decides to spend less on public services. In a recession,the Bank of England - which is independent of government - typically cuts interest rates. This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and economic growth. However,prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank put interest rates up to tackle that inflation. After 14 rate increases,the Bank hasheld interest rates at 5.25% six times in a row. When the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called ""stagflation"". This can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. However in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC thatthe UK economy had ""turned a corner"". With growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy inthe G7 group of industrialised nations. But until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7. The US economygrew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. That put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance of all other advanced economies. It is also expected to outperform the rest of the G7 in 2024. In October 2023,the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would grow by just 0.6% in 2024. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)expects the UK economy to grow by 0.7% in 2024, but that is less than half of its earlier prediction of 1.8% growth. How will the UK economy compare to others in 2024? 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Could English follow Scotland's?,"However you look at the blizzard of statistics about the Coronavirus, the disease is still spreading - despite town after town being placed under extra limits. Even beforeNicola Sturgeon's moves on Wednesdayto try to break the spread in Scotland, ministers in SW1 were looking at the next steps they would need to take to stop the acceleration of the virus. As we've reported, the government is likely to introduce a tiered approach to put different parts of the country with different spreads of the diseases into different categories. But the exact nature of the strictest form of restrictions are yet to be set in stone. Pubs and restaurants in central Scotland to close Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? Check the Covid rules where you live It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion. But Boris Johnson also knows that his own MPs and the opposition parties are more and more sceptical as each day passes about what the government proposes. It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the ""circuit breaker"" that we have talked about on here lots of times. But there are many questions still to be settled. Would that happen everywhere? Or just in the most affected parts of the country? Would closures be total or for a certain period of time only? Would they be temporary? Or put in place until an indeterminate time? A lot is unknown, but the discussions are serious. The Treasury is already looking at financial support for the different options, including not just closing pubs in the most affected areas, but potentially well beyond. There is a lot yet to settle, and the next formal announcement is likely (as things stand) not to come until Monday. But more action is clearly on the way.

"Covid cases 'getting out of control', minister says","Parts of England, including Sheffield, have seen big jumps in the rate of coronavirus Coronavirus is ""getting out of control"" in the north of England, a minister has said, as she defended government plans to bring in new restrictions. Gillian Keegan said the country was in an ""unbelievably serious situation"", but added that communication with areas facing new rules needed to be clearer. It comes as Labour's Sir Keir Starmer called for local leaders to be ""in the room"" and included in decisions. The chancellor will set out support linked to the new restrictions later. A Treasury spokesperson said Rishi Sunak's latest move as part of the Jobs Support Scheme would help to ""protect jobs and provide a safety net for those businesses that may have to close in the coming weeks and months"". It has already been announced that the scheme, which will replace the furlough scheme when it ends this month, will see workers get three quarters of their normal salaries for six months. How much will I get paid when furlough ends? These three symptoms identify 85% of Covid cases A tiered system of measures for England is set to be announced within days, in an effort to stall rising infection rates. Under the new system - which will replace the patchwork of existing rules - pubs and restaurants could be closed in the worst-affected areas, while a ban on overnight stays is also being considered. But there has been growing anger among MPs and local leaders about the way the government has communicated the proposed changes with them. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham accused the government of treating the north of England with ""contempt"" after he learned ministers were considering shutting hospitality venues in the worst-affected areas in a newspaper report. Mr Burnham said he would challenge the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants if the measure did not come with financial support. He told BBC's Question Time: ""The message I've given to the government is a pretty clear one - there can be no restrictions without support.

In response, Gillian Keegan, minister for skills and apprenticeships, said the government had to act to stem the rise in cases. ""This is serious - it is getting out of control, and we have to do something to bring it back under control,"" she said. But she acknowledged that communication with the worst-hit areas needed to improve. ""We definitely need to work locally and we definitely need to make sure that the communications are much clearer."" Ms Keegan also said she understood how ""very frustrating"" it must be for local leaders ""if leaks are made or there is speculation in the press"". ""But clearly we have to do something if we're going to bring those cases back under control."" Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""operating under the misguided, arrogant and counterproductive view that 'Whitehall knows best'"". He said the government had ""lost control of the virus"" and urged ministers to ""get a grip"". ""It was an act of gross irresponsibility for anonymous No 10 sources to tell a few newspapers on Thursday about plans to impose further restrictions on millions of people, without any detail, without any consultation and without any statement from the prime minister. ""This has significantly added to the sense of confusion, chaos and unfairness in the approach that is being taken."" In response, a government source said Sir Keir should ""be supporting measures to protect the NHS and save lives - instead of playing politics in the middle of a global pandemic"". Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned the country was facing a ""perilous moment"" in the pandemic, with cases continuing to rise. There were 17,540 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Thursday, up from the 14,162 reported the day before,government data showed,external. A further 77 people died after testing positive for the virus within 28 days. Mr Hancock said the situation was becoming ""very serious"", and that he was most concerned about parts of Yorkshire, the North West and North East of England, as well as areas of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Fears have been raised that NHS services could be overwhelmed if the virus gets out of control. NHS England data published on Thursday showedthe number of people waiting more than a year to start hospital treatment is at its highest level since 2008- with some 111,026 people waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in August. Prof John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the virus was ""holding a gun"" to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's head over the restrictions being introduced. The nation faces an anxious wait to see the full impact on the NHS, he said. ""In the north of England now, we are not that far away from the health service being stretched. ""Because even if we turn the epidemic around now, infections that occur today won't go to hospital for another week or two,"" he said. Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor in the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, said the increase in cases should ""serve as a warning to the government to take further action without delay"". ""It is clear that the consequences of not suppressing infections sufficiently over the summer may be severe if we cannot get on top of this increase,"" he said.

Breaking|Breaking newsNobel Peace Prize goes to UN World Food ProgrammeNobel Peace Prize for 2020 goes to the UN World Food Programme for its efforts in fighting hungerWorld,"The WFP says it provided assistance to almost 100 million people last year The 2020 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). The agency was given the prize for its efforts to combat hunger and improve conditions for peace. The WFP, the 101st winner of a prize now worth 10m Swedish krona ($1.1m; Â£875,000), said it was ""deeply humbled"" to have won. Some 107 organisations and 211 individuals were nominated for the award this year. WFP head David Beasley told the BBC's Newshour he was in shock following the announcement. ""I was literally for the first time in my life without words,"" he said. ""To receive this award is a recognition to the men and women at the World Food Programme who put their lives on the line every day for the struggling, suffering people around the world. So I hope this is a signal and a message that the World Food Programme is a role model and that we all have got to do more."" What you need to know about the latest Nobel winner Yemen's humanitarian crisis near breaking point In pictures: Locust swarms in East Africa German Chancellor Angela Merkel was among those to congratulate the group. ""If there is a deserving organisation then this is certainly one of them. The people there do incredible work helping others and therefore I am very pleased about the awarding of this Nobel Peace Prize,"" she said. The World Health Organization and climate activist Greta Thunberg were among the favourites to win this year. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, nomination shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years, and the organisation says any speculation ahead of the announcement is ""sheer guesswork"". The Norwegian Nobel Committee said the WFP was declared winner of the prestigious award ""for its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict"". Chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said that with this year's award the committee wanted to ""turn the eyes of the world to the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger"". ""The World Food Programme plays a key role in multilateral co-operation in making food security an instrument of peace,"" she told a news conference in Oslo. Berit Reiss-Andersen announced the winner in Oslo The committee said Covid-19 had further boosted the importance of the group. ""The coronavirus pandemic has contributed to a strong upsurge in the number of victims of hunger in the world,"" it wrote in a statement. ""In the face of the pandemic, the World Food Programme has demonstrated an impressive ability to intensify its efforts."" Earlier this year, the WFP warned that the world wasat risk of widespread famines ""of biblical proportions""as a result of the pandemic. The UN agency delivers food assistance to countries around the world. The group says it provided assistance to close to 100 million people in 88 countries last year who were victims of acute food insecurity and hunger. The agency was established in 1961, following calls from former US President Dwight D Eisenhower for ""a workable scheme"" to be devised for providing food aid through the UN system. Months after it was created, it responded to a major earthquake in northern Iran, delivering wheat, sugar and tea to survivors. Since then, it has gone on to respond to natural disasters and conflicts around the world, including: Yemen:The WFP says its emergency response in conflict-torn Yemen is its biggest anywhere. It aims to support about 13 million people but has faced a number of challenges. It has accused local leaders of diverting food away from vulnerable people. This year it has warned that it is facing a major funding shortfall, withsome donors stopping aidover concerns that deliveries were being obstructed Afghanistan:The WFP says its ""overarching goal"" is to support the country in tackling hunger in a way that contributes to peace. But it says that decades of ""complex and protracted conflicts"" have created difficulties. There have been instances of the group suspending food aid deliveries to certain areas because of attacks South Sudan:The agency has been supporting people through both conflict and famine. In addition to a years-long civil war, it says a collapsing economy, reduced crop production and dependence on imports means many are unable to access sufficient nutritious food. In 2014, one of its staff members was abducted at gunpoint. However, the organisation has not been free of controversy. In a WFP internal survey last year, at least 28 employees said they had experienced rape or sexual assault while working at the agency. More than 640 others said they were either victims of or had witnessed sexual harassment. Mr Beasley told the Associated Press news agency at the time he was ""making hard choices to bring change"". Last year itwent to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, whose peace deal with Eritrea ended a 20-year military stalemate following their 1998-2000 border war. Former US President Barack Obama won the prize in 2009, for ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"". Other notable winners include former US President Jimmy Carter (2002); child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the European Union (2012); the United Nations and its secretary-general at the time, Kofi Annan, (shared 2001); and Mother Teresa (1979). The Nobel Prize is one of the world's most important awards. It was started in accordance with the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, with the first awards handed out in 1901. Nobel Prizes are awarded in several categories to people ""who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind"" in the previous 12 months. The recipient of each Nobel Prize receives three things: A Nobel diploma, each of which is a unique work of art A Nobel medal A cash prize, which is split between winners when there is more than one. They have to deliver a lecture to receive the money There have been some years when the prize has not been awarded - mostly during the two world wars. Nobel Foundation rules state if nobody deserves the prize in a particular category, it is not awarded and its prize money is kept for the following year.

"Trump ready to return to public life, says doctorA White House physician anticipates the president's safe return to public engagements this Saturday.US Election 2020","President Trump wants to return to the campaign trail but questions remain about his health - and when he first became infected US President Donald Trump has completed his course of treatment for Covid-19 and can return to public engagements this weekend, his physician has said. Dr Sean Conley said the president had responded ""extremely well"" to medication and had ""remained stable"". Mr Trump later said he would probably take another Covid test on Friday and hoped to hold a rally over the weekend. Critics have accused the White House of avoiding questions about Mr Trump's health and testing in recent days. A White House spokeswoman said the president wanted to return to the campaign trail this weekend. But an administration official later said Trump was unlikely to travel so soon because the logistics of organising events at short notice was problematic. An appearance is more likely on Monday, they said. The president is also set to have a televised ""medical evaluation"" on Fox News on Friday evening. Dr Sean Conley: Who is Donald Trump's physician? Top Republican avoids White House over Covid-19 US election 2020: Your top questions answered Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, on Friday announced legislation to establish a commission to assess a president's fitness for office. Mrs Pelosi said it was not meant to rule on Mr Trump's condition, but any serious consideration of the measure before the election is unlikely. Democrats are focusing on a clause in the 25th Amendment that allows a president to be removed from office against their will because of a physical or mental incapacity. The amendment was introduced after the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy to clarify issues around the transfer of presidential powers. It can only be invoked if the vice-president and a majority of cabinet secretaries or Congress agree. Democrats are looking to set up mechanisms that would enable Congress to have more say on a president's fitness. Conservatives say this is a political move to attack Mr Trump's health ahead of the election. On Friday, Mrs Pelosi said the move was ""not about President Trump"", who ""will face the judgment of the voters"". ""This legislation applies to future presidents but we are reminded of the necessity of action by the health of the current president."" Previewing the legislation on Thursday, Mrs Pelosi told reporters that serious questions concerning Mr Trump's health were still unanswered, and described the president as being in an ""altered state"". Mr Trump called Ms Pelosi ""crazy"" and said she was ""the one who should be under observation"". Speaking on Fox News late on Thursday, Mr Trump said he was feeling ""really good"" and hoped to hold a campaign rally on Saturday evening, possibly in Florida. The president was also heard clearing his throat and coughing during the interview. At one point, he appeared to mute his mic after needing to clear his throat. Fox News has since said that Mr Trump will appear for a televised ""medical evaluation"" on Friday at 20:00ET (01:00BST). It will be his first on-camera interview since his diagnosis and he will undergo an evaluation by Dr Mark Siegel, a Fox contributor. Earlier this week, White House doctor Dr Conley had said that if the president's condition remained the same or improved throughout the weekend and into Monday, ""we will all take that final, deep sigh of relief"". The White House is still trying to cope with a Covid-19 outbreak Although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House. New Covid safety measures are in place there. One of the top Republicans, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, said on Thursday that he had not been to the White House since 6 August because its approach to handling Covid with social distancing and masks was ""different from mine and what I suggested we do in the Senate"". This video can not be played Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends self-isolating for 10 days after a positive test. The CDC also says isolation could end earlier after ""two negative test results in a row, from tests done at least 24 hours apart"". Questions remain about when the president first became infected and whether he could still be contagious. In a memo released by the White House on Thursday evening, Dr Conley said Mr Trump was displaying no signs ""to suggest progression of illness"". ""Saturday will be day 10 since [last] Thursday's diagnosis, and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the president's safe return to public engagements at that time,"" the memo added. Mr Trump avoided questions while speaking to Fox News on Thursday about whether he had been tested recently, but said he would probably be tested on Friday. We know Mr Trump tested positive for Covid-19 last Thursday night, according to his doctors. We do not know when his last negative test was, however. On Monday, Dr Conley also avoided questions about it. As a result, some have wondered whether the president was getting regularly tested at all. The questions come amid a row over the next presidential debates between Mr Trump and challenger Joe Biden. The Trump campaign has rejected the debate commission's plan of a virtual debate next week, saying there is no medical reason to avoid an in-person event. Who has Trump met and who's tested positive? US election 2020: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden? What did we learn from the VP debate? The US election will be held on 3 November. Latest opinion polls suggest that Mr Biden's lead has increased since the chaotic first debate and the president's coronavirus diagnosis. Six million ballots have already been cast in early voting.

New Scots virus restrictions to come into forcePubs and restaurants in the central belt of Scotland are to close for two weeks from 18:00.Scotland,"Pubs and restaurants in the central belt will have to close for two weeks Additional police officers will be deployed in communities across Scotland to ensure pubs and restaurants close at 18:00, Police Scotland has said. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said patrols would be ""highly visible"" to explain and encourage compliance with new Covid restrictions. After premises close in the central belt, they will not reopen until at least 25 October. Tighter restrictions will also come into force in the rest of the country. Licensed premises will not be able to serve alcohol indoors  and opening hours will be limited. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the moves were ""essential"" to get the spread of the virus back under control. What are the new lockdown rules in Scotland? Pubs forced to close on island with 'no Covid' All cafes in Scotland to be allowed to stay open Restaurants 'cannot turn themselves into cafes' Mr Livingstone said most people had co-operated with the police and supported their work during the Covid crisis. But he said he was concerned about a ""small minority"" who continue to host house parties. In the week up to Sunday 4 October, police broke up 271 illegal house parties, issued 106 fines, and made 18 arrests. ""While restrictions have changed quickly and often, I do not believe anyone in Scotland can be in any doubt that house gatherings and house parties allow the virus to spread and are unlawful,"" Mr Livingstone said. Meanwhile business owners have warned thenew rules could cost thousands of jobsbut details of a Â£40m package of support for hospitality businesses are still to be set out. About 3.4 million people in five health boards - Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lothian, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran - are to be subject to the harshest restrictions. In these areas across the central belt, licensed premises will have to close for 16 days, although they can still serve takeaways. Cafes with a licence will not have to close, as long as they do not serve alcohol butthere is confusion over what constitutes a cafe. Nicola Sturgeon said the government was seeking to strike a ""difficult balance"" Hospitality venues in the rest of Scotland will be allowed to open, but will only be permitted to serve non-alcoholic drinks and food indoors between 06:00 and 18:00. Licensed premises in these areas will still be able to serve alcohol in outdoor areas, such as beer gardens, up to the 22:00 curfew introduced in September. At her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon said the government was waiting for anannouncement from the UK Chancellor on the furlough scheme,which could have an effect on their proposals for a business support package. She said the Scottish plan would include support for employment, a cash grant for each business and a discretionary fund for local authorities. The new restrictions are an attempt to arrest a sharp rise in coronavirus cases, with a further 1,246 positive tests recorded on Friday. There are 397 people in hospital being treated for the virus, with 33 in intensive care. Six confirmed Covid deaths were also recorded in the last 24 hours. Apaper,externalpublished by the government on Wednesday claimed that the rate of infections could hit a peak similar to that experienced in March before the end of October. Further measures will also come into force from midnight to bring back the 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule in shops and tighten the rules around the wearing of face coverings. Outdoor live events, adult contact sports, group exercise classes, snooker and pool halls, casinos and bingo halls will also have to close in the health board areas covering Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lothian, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran. People are also being asked to avoid public transport where possible and not to share a vehicle with another household. Scotland's national clinical director has insisted the new restrictions are not meant as a ""punishment"" from the Scottish government for people not complying with the regulations. Prof Jason Leitch told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme on Friday: ""The enemy here is not the clinical advice. The enemy here is a deadly virus that has killed a million people."" Prof Leitch also told the programme he was ""very hopeful"" that the combination of the recent limitations on household mixing and the new measures will enable progression to the ""next version of what the restrictions might look like"". But, highlighting the spiralling number of cases across Europe, he warned: ""There has to be a reverse gear.""

LiveLiveEurope grapples with surge in virus cases16 minutes ago,"UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced further support for jobs and businesses Workers at UK firms forced to close will receive two-thirds of their wages, Sunak says Rapid increase in cases in England, ONS figures show, with one in 240 infected Several European countries register record spikes in new daily cases; bars are shut in four more French cities The Spanish government has ordered a 15-day state of emergency to bring down Covid-19 infection rates in Madrid China is joining the international Covax scheme to get vaccines to developing countries Nearly 37 million cases have been confirmed globally with more than 1.06 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hamish Mackay Thanks for joining us today. Before we wrap up, hereâs a look at some of the main stories: Nineteen ambulance staff are believed to have tested positive after an outbreak at a 999 emergency call handling centre in West Yorkshire. Yorkshire Ambulance Service confirmed the outbreak at its Emergency Operations Centre in Wakefield and said it had taken steps to ensure the 999 service would continue, with help from a facility in York and other ambulance services if needed. A source from the Unison union said that 19 staff had tested positive but it was not known how many others might be self-isolating. Today's estimate of the R number - which measures the average number of people each infected person spreads the virus to and can show how quickly the epidemic is growing - was between 1.2 and 1.5. That's slightly lower than last week's figure of 1.3 to 1.6, although scientists advising the government said the epidemic continues to grow exponentially. But the picture varies across the country, with former hotspots such as the north-west of England showing evidence of slower growth, while the highest estimates of between 1.3 and 1.6 were in Wales, Scotland, the east of England and the South West. North-west England remains the worst-affected region in terms of hospital admissions, however, followed by North East and Yorkshire. Hospital admissions are rising in almost every region. A travel writer has said he received ""such intense abuse"" when he suggested people visit Wales that he has ""no further plans"" to book a stay in the country. Speaking on ITV earlier this week, Simon Calder listed Gwynedd and Ceredigion, as well as Belfast and Edinburgh, as places people in the UK could go for a break during the pandemic. But he said he then received a torrent of abuse via email and social media. Visit Wales said it wastrying to welcome people back,external""in a way that is safe"". In an article for The Independent,external, Mr Calder said he had replied to many of the hundreds of people who messaged on social media and understood the deep concern about the spread of coronavirus, but did not now intend to book a holiday in Wales again. Mr Calder said he had never meant to upset anyone and had followed travel advice, but it was an ""interesting lesson"" on current sensitivities. He added: ""The hundreds of people I inadvertently angered may be glad to hear that I have no further plans to book a stay in Wales."" Read the full story here. Dr Fauci was a key figure in White House coronavirus taskforce briefings Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US researcher who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has told CBS - the BBC's US media partner - that President Trump's apparent recovery from the coronavirus may wrongly make people think it is not dangerous. He said that talk of a ""cure"", as Trump has labeled the medical treatments he received, creates ""confusion"" among the American public. There is no medicine that ""cures"" Covid-19, but experimental treatments such as the ones that Trump received in hospital have shown promise in helping patients to recover. Polls show around half of Americans say they would not get a coronavirus vaccine if one is found. Pedestrians walk through central Nottingham Nottingham has a weekly rate of 760 new cases per 100,000 people - the highest in the UK. It is the only city to have a rate above 700 per 100,000 in the seven days to 6 October. The second highest rate is in Northern Ireland's Derry City & Strabane, where the figure is currently 684 cases per 100,000. Glasgow has the highest rate in Scotland at 242, while Merthyr Tydfil has the highest rate in Wales with 213. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful US Democrat, has announced legislation to establish a congressional commission to assess the process for removing a president for health reasons. A statement on the move said the commission would be set up under the 25th Amendment, which outlines how a sitting president can be stripped of power if they are deemed unable to conduct the duties of the office. Any serious consideration of the measure is unlikely, but it will serve as a political tool to raise questions about Trump's health. Trump hit back, calling Pelosi ""crazy"" and said she was ""the one who should be under observation"". Read more about the 25th Amendmenthere Europe has seen more than 100,000 new cases in a day for the first time since the pandemic started. A World Health Organization official, Dr Michael Ryan, said it was sad to see a rapid rise in cases in many European countries. He called on governments to take decisive action. Spain's government has declared a two-week state of emergency in the Madrid region, imposing travel restrictions to try to contain an outbreak there. In the UK,estimates suggest between one-in-170 and one-in-240 people you meet in the street has the virus. Russia has reported its highest daily cases since May. The number of people testing positive for coronavirus each day continues to rise sharply, with 13,864 confirmed cases reported over the past 24 hours. That brings the 7-day average to 15,505. Reported daily deaths, which include people who died within 28 days of a positive test, are rising gradually, although today's figure of 87 was the largest for months. The average over seven days is now 59. Most Britons are staying away from bars and restaurants, a survey suggests Local restrictions and government warnings about the impact of pubs and restaurants on the spread of the virus appear to be having an impact on the habits of the public in Britain. Only a quarter of adults (25%) said they had eaten or drank at a restaurant, pub or bar during the previous week, when questioned by the Office of National Statistics between 30 September and 4 October. Three weeks earlier, the figure was 30%. The number of people leaving home to meet others in a public place or someone else's home has also dropped over the same period from 28% to 20%. More than a third of people (34%) in areas with additional local restrictions said they had not socialised with anyone outside their household, compared to 25% in other areas. But a small minority admitted to flouting the rules, with 7% of people in areas with local lockdowns saying they gathered in a group of more than six people, and 9% in other areas. ""Brutal"" trading conditions brought on by the pandemic have forced the Edinburgh Woollen Mill - which also owns the Peacocks and Jaeger clothing brands - toappoint administrators in an attempt to save its business. The move puts more than 20,000 jobs at risk, although the stores will continue to trade as a review of the firm is carried out. Chief executive Steve Simpson blamed the pandemic but said ""false rumours"" about the company's payments and trading had also affected its credit insurance. ""I hope and believe we will be able to secure the best future for our businesses, but there will inevitably be significant cuts and closures as we work our way through this,"" he said. Donald Trump will hold his first on-camera interview tonight since his coronavirus diagnosis. He will receive a ""medical evaluation"" during a Fox New appearance from Dr Marc Siegel, a Fox contributor, according to the network. Saturday will mark 10 days since Trump's diagnosis, according to White House Dr Sean Conley, who on Thursday cleared Trump to ""return to public engagements"" this weekend. The US president was treated in a military hospital for three days and received supplemental oxygen. The White House has refused to say when he last took a negative Covid-19 test. The president's coronavirus infection has thrown the campaign in disarray. After the next debate against Joe Biden was moved to a virtual format, Trump pulled out. Trump has said he is considering returning to the campaign trail with rallies as soon as this weekend. The number of Covid-19 cases at a Nottinghamshire prison has reached more than 200, thecounty's director of public health confirmed. A total of 172 prisoners and 43 staff at HMP Lowdham Grange have tested positive. It representsa significant increase on 84 recorded casesa week ago. Jonathan Gribbin said the prison outbreak represented a part of the increase in cases across the Newark and Sherwood district. The figures were revealed in a briefing on Friday to discuss Covid-19 infection rates in the county, withNottingham currently having the highest rates in the country. Migrant workers protesting in Dhaka, Bangladesh The United Nations' migration agency says that international cooperation is urgently needed to help more than 2.5 million migrants who have been left stranded by coronavirus restrictions around the world. Among others, they include seasonal workers, temporary residence holders, seafarers and international students. The Middle East and North Africa account for 1.27 million of the total of 2.75 million stranded, the report said. Asia has nearly a million. The International Organization for Migration says that, while stranded, some are at higher risk of abuse, exploitation and neglect - including cramped and unhygienic living conditions that put them at greater risk of catching Covid-19. âIt should be clear that migrants can be returned home in a safe and dignified manner despite the constraints imposed by Covid-19,â director general AntÃ³nio Vitorino said in a statement. Cities such as Manchester could face new restrictions that affect businesses, including a hospitality shutdown Mayors across the north of England - Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, North Tyne's Jamie Driscoll, Sheffield's Dan Jarvis and Liverpool's Steve Rotherham - have issued a joint statement saying Chancellor Rishi Sunak's new package of support does not go far enough. âWe are pleased that the government has listened and recognised that any new system of restrictions must come with a substantial package of financial support,"" they said. ""What has been announced by the chancellor today is a start but, on first look, it would not appear to have gone far enough to prevent genuine hardship, job losses and business failure this winter."" Reality Check President Trump is taking a drug which he has touted as a âcureâ for Covid-19, and says he will roll it out across the US. The drug uses a combination of antibodies, and is developed by US based company Regeneronusing human cells derived from an aborted foetus. But the Trump administration suspended funding for projects using human foetal tissue from abortions in 2019. There is no outright ban however on the use of foetal material in drug research. At the time of the funding suspension,the Department of Health and Human Services released a statement,externalsaying: âPromoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trumpâs administration.â This has raised questions about the presidentâs use and promotion of new coronavirus treatments which have been developed using the practice. Remdesivir, another drug used by the president, and some vaccine development projects with White House funding also rely on the same cell lines produced from foetal tissue. But the policy excluded cell lines made before June 2019. The cells used by most of the companies now trying to find a coronavirus treatment were derived from tissue of a foetus aborted in the 1970s. So the latest drugs being touted by Trump donât violate the current regulations as long as theyâre not being developed using cell lines from a recently aborted foetus. This video can not be played Covid-19: Labour's Dodds on Sunak plan to pay workers Responding to Rishi Sunak'sannouncement of new job support for the UK, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has said Labour welcomes ""the fact the government has realised there does need to be more wage support"" but there is still much more that could be done. Ms Dodds told the BBC the news ""does not match the schemes in operations in other countries"", where the aim is to ""incentivise employers to actually keep their staff on"". She added that one in four people in the UK was already living under additional local measures and the government had been ""incompetent, slow, dithering"" in its response. She went on to say she would not be arguing for tax rises to fund the additional spending at this time, as the UK has ""a very weak recovery now"". Not having economic support ready as parts of the country came under extra coronavirus measures meant ""thereâs been a huge amount of anxiety and thatâs hit confidence,"" she concluded. There is fresh confusion over when Donald Trump will return to the campaign trail following his hospital treatment for coronavirus. A White House spokeswoman said the president wanted to do so this weekend, adding that he would be tested for coronavirus beforehand and would not appear in public if he could still transmit the infection. Trump's physician Sean Conley also said the president can return to public engagements this weekend. But an administration official later said Trump was unlikely to travel so soon because the logistics of organising events at short notice was problematic. An appearance is more likely on Monday, they said. Congressional Democrats argue the president's recent behaviour suggests his judgement has been impaired - they want to set up a panel to examine whether he is fit for office. In the latest outbreak at a UK university,300 students in halls of residence at Bristol University are self-isolating. Students at The Courtrooms in the city centre will now have to remain in their flats and only socialise with those they live with after 40 students tested positive. The university says it is supporting those in isolation but may take disciplinary action against those who breach regulations. Georgiana Scott, a psychology student, said: ""What makes it difficult is that we are living in houses and halls of residencies with lots of people, so when just one person is exposed to the virus it has a huge rippling effect.""

U2's Joshua Tree voted the best album of the 1980sThe record beat Michael Jackson's Thriller and George Michael's Faith to top a Radio 2 poll.Entertainment & Arts,"The Joshua Tree earned U2 a Grammy Award for album of the year U2's The Joshua Tree has been named the best album of the 1980s. Released in 1987, it made U2 one of the world's biggest bands, thanks to anthems like With Or Without You and Where The Streets Have No Name. Now, listeners to BBC Radio 2's Sounds of the 80s have chosen it as the decade's best record,  in a poll marking National Album Day on Saturday. Dire Straits' Brothers In Arms came second, followed by The Stone Roses' eponymous debut. All but one of the top 20 are by male artists, with the exception being Kate Bush's Hounds Of Love - which lands at number 11. The Human League's Dare, which takes sixth place, also features prominent contributions from singers Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley; while albums by Madonna, Janet Jackson, Tracy Chapman and Grace Jones feature further down the list. The Joshua Tree was almost called The Two Americas. Later, Desert Songs was another contender, before the band settled on The Joshua Tree - a title that perfectly captured the sacred/secular tension of U2's landscaped songs and Biblical imagery. Written against the backdrop of the Cold War, the album reflected two sides of the American dream, with the Irish band seduced by its glamour but repelled by what bassist Adam Clayton called ""the bleakness and greed"" of the Reagan era. ""And it feels like we're right back there in a way,"" said guitarist The Edge, after hearing the results of Radio 2 poll. ""Politics are still so polarised.""

""We're just thrilled that people are still connecting with these songs, night after night, year after year."" Produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, The Joshua Tree won U2 a Grammy for album of the year, and songs like I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and Bullet The Blue Sky - a criticism of US activities in Central America - have remained staples of their live shows ever since. In the UK, it was the ninth best-selling album of the 1980s, beaten by several records - including Michael Jackson's Bad and Phil Collins' No Jacket Required - which came lower down Radio 2's list.

Breaking|Breaking newsUK economy grows 2.1% in August,"The UK economy continued its recovery in August, growing by 2.1%, as the Eat Out to Help Out scheme boosted restaurants. But the figure was below expectations and the economy is still 9.2% smaller than before the pandemic struck. It marked the fourth consecutive month of expansion following the slump induced by the coronavirus lockdown. However, growth in August was slower than the expansion seen in both June and July. In June, the economy grew by 8.7% and in July, by 6.6%. Eat Out to Help Out drives UK inflation to five-year low Eat Out to Help Out, which ran from Monday to Wednesday during August, offered 50% off food up to the value of Â£10. Discounts for more than 100 million meals were claimed through the scheme. Analysts said the coming months were likely to see growth slackening further because of new Covid restrictions, the end of the furlough scheme in October and concern over a no-deal Brexit. ""We have been clear that we stand ready to do more as necessary,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. ""Some firms will be affected by coronavirus for longer than others, and we will continue to seek to support these firms appropriately."" The economy's bounce back from the pandemic shutdowns slowed in August, despite the boost from Eat Out to Help Out at a time when there were few social restrictions. The official technical recession - two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP - has certainly ended and that will be confirmed next month. But a lower than expected figure for growth in the economy in August raises fears about the recovery petering out and even going into reverse in the current final quarter of the year. The figures bolster the argument of those business groups campaigning for further support, particularly as social restrictions are strengthening rather than weakening. The first stage of thatcame from Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Friday afternoon. The Bank of England will also react at its policy-setting meeting next month. But the latest figures show that while the first bounce in the economy occurred relatively rapidly, a full recovery is going to take much longer and not yet assured. It's going to be a tough winter. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said important sectors of the economy, such as services and construction, were still considerably smaller than in February. The ONS also issued figures for the three months to August, showing growth of 8% over the period compared with the previous three months as lockdown measures eased further. ""The economy continued to recover in August but by less than in recent months,"" said Jonathan Athow, the ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics. ""There was strong growth in restaurants and accommodation due to the easing of lockdown rules, the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and people choosing summer 'staycations'. However, many other parts of the service sector recorded muted growth. ""Construction also continued its recovery, with a significant boost from housebuilding."" He added that there was ""limited growth"" in manufacturing, with car and aircraft production still much lower than the start of the year. No V-shaped recovery here,"" was the verdict of Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, referring to optimistic forecasts of a swift rebound in growth. ""GDP was still a hefty 9.2% below its pre-Covid February level in August - when no meaningful restrictions on economic activity were imposed."" Looking ahead, he predicted growth of only about 2% in September. He added: ""GDP also likely will struggle to improve on September's level over the next three months, as the second wave of Covid-19 instils more consumer caution and compels the government to shut hospitality businesses in Covid-19 hotspots once again."" Sarah Hewin, economist and head of research at Standard Chartered Bank, echoed that view. ""Despite the support from Eat Out to Help Out and staycations, there was virtually no growth in manufacturing,"" she told the BBC. ""And although we continue to see new housing being built, that also was a little bit weaker than expected, so the pace of recovery does seem to be slowing. ""To a certain extent, that's not surprising. We had very strong growth in June and July as lockdown restrictions eased, so August data continued to show the economy growing, but not at such a fast pace. ""The slowdown in that momentum, though, does give us some concern for what might be happening over the next few months."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Today's figures show our economy has grown for four consecutive months, but I know that many people are worried about the coming winter months. ""Throughout this crisis, my single focus has been jobs - protecting as many jobs as possible and providing support for people to find other opportunities where this isn't possible. This goal remains unchanged."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""It is deeply worrying that growth was weak in August despite the easing of restrictions, especially as we now face Covid-19 cases rising and more areas coming under local restrictions. ""The government must get a grip on test, trace and isolate, reform the sink-or-swim Job Support Scheme and urgently put in place consistent economic support for areas of localised restrictions.""

No on-site counselling 'in half of schools',"Fewer than half of state schools in England offer counselling for pupils on site in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown, research says. The Institute of Public Policy Research study says fewer schools offer such services now than in 2010 and schools in more deprived areas were most likely to have lost out. It wants a national entitlement to mental health support in schools. The government says it is investing in mental health and children's wellbeing. But John Trickett, Labour MP for Hemsworth, who has been campaigning with counselling organisations on the issue, said he was very angry about the lack of access, despite government pledges. ""The fact that some schools in more deprived areas haven't been able to offer counselling and other pastoral services isn't surprising in this context, but it is wrong, unfair and should make people's blood boil,"" he said. ""This generation of school and college children have already experienced unprecedented upheaval in the last six months."" There has been a huge increase in young people struggling with mental health issues in recent years, and a further spike in cases related to lockdown is expected by many groups working with children. General secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers Paul Whiteman said mental health support teams were a vital aspect of improving access to mental health support, but progress to develop these had slowed. He added: ""It has never been more important for young people to get the support they need, but it still appears that it is a lottery. The government urgently needs to step in to correct this."" The IPPR based its findings on a survey of nearly 7,000 teachers in state and private schools, weighting the results to reflect the national picture. Some 48% of the teachers polled said their schools offered counselling on the school site. Allowing pupils to access counselling in school is important because it reduces the lesson time they will miss if they have to travel elsewhere for appointments. It also helps staff can understand whether the pupil is dealing with an ongoing issue. Also, teachers, parents and head teachers frequently say they find it difficult to access the support services they need for their children. Waiting lists for support through the NHS can be long, and young people often need to be severely impaired before they are approved for help. Harry Quilter Pinner, IPPR associate director and lead author of the report, said the pandemic had highlighted inequalities in society and the very real needs of children. ""Many schools are unable to provide the support young people need to thrive. ""Without urgent government action to ensure every school can provide vital services such as counselling and after-school clubs there is a profound risk that the legacy of the pandemic will be even bigger educational and health inequalities. ""The government has started to put in place some support for young people in the wake of the national lockdown. But it can and should go further - the pandemic should be seen as an opportunity to 'build back better'."" The Department for Education pointed to its Â£8m training programme for schools to access the knowledge and resources they need to support children and young people, teachers and parents. The Wellbeing for Education Return programme, which started in September, will support staff working in schools and colleges to respond to the additional pressures some children and young people may be feeling as a direct result of the pandemic. These include bereavement, stress, trauma or anxiety.
