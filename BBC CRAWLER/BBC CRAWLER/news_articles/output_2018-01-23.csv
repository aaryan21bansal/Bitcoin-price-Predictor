Boris Johnson rebuked over NHS cash plea,"This video can not be played Hammond: Boris Johnson is foreign secretary (not health secretary) Theresa May has called for discussions about future NHS funding to remain private after Boris Johnson publicly called for more money after Brexit. Before Tuesday's cabinet meeting, it was widely reported that the foreign secretary would pitch for a Â£100m a week ""Brexit dividend"" for the NHS. The BBC understands he did not end up mentioning ""specific figures"". No 10 said Mrs May chaired a discussion on post-Brexit funding options but made clear conversations should be private. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM's remarks on the need for confidentiality were ""pointed"". However, she said Mr Johnson was backed by some colleagues while the principle that the NHS would get some of the money which will become available after the UK leaves in March 2019 was agreed. Jeremy Hunt told the cabinet meeting the NHS was facing ""significant"" demand pressures In the run-up to Tuesday's cabinet meeting - in which Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt gave an update on the ""significant"" winter pressures"" facing the NHS - it was reported that Mr Johnson wanted to kick start a wider debate about NHS funding. In a highly unusual move, sources told the BBC Mr Johnson would not only call for a Â£5bn annual injection of funding after Brexit but warn his party against ""abandoning the territory"" to Labour, which vowed at last year's election to spend Â£37bn more over the next five years. If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. A source close to Mr Johnson said he was frustrated at what he perceived as Downing Street's lack of action on the issue given the levels of public anxiety about how the NHS is faring. During the referendum campaign, Vote Leave - of which Mr Johnson was a leading supporter - claimed Â£350m went to the EU each week and money could instead go to the NHS, a claim he has repeatedly defended since.

However, when it came to it, the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said neither Mr Johnson nor any other minister raised a specific figure during what No 10 said was a ""wide ranging"" hour-long discussion. Firmly, in one sense. A No 10 spokesman said the prime minister and ""a large number of Cabinet ministers"" had made clear that their discussions should take place in private. On the broader political point, Downing Street said the PM reminded ministers that the government has repeatedly said contributions to the EU budget which end after Brexit would be able to be spent on domestic priorities including the NHS.

Kuenssberg: Why is Johnson calling for more NHS cash? Hunt sorry as A&Es struggle to cope NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter In a further rebuff to Mr Johnson, Chancellor Philip Hammond said he had given the NHS an extra Â£6bn in November's Budget, including Â£2.8bn to be spent over the next two years, Mr Hammond, who was in Brussels for a meeting of EU finance ministers, told reporters Mr Johnson was ""the foreign secretary"" not health secretary and the right time to revisit the long-term issue of NHS spending was at the next departmental spending review expected early next year. This video can not be played BBC gains exclusive access to A&E at University Hospital of North Tees No, far from it. The BBC understands that Chris Grayling and Michael Gove were among other cabinet ministers to rally round Mr Johnson at Tuesday's meeting. Growing numbers of Tory MPs are openly expressing their frustration with what they say is No 10's unwillingness to confront the long-term financial challenges facing the health service. Conservative MP Mark Pritchard told the BBC News Channel the foreign secretary was right to speak out. ""I support Boris, he's right. But I think whether it's Boris or Theresa May or Jeremy Hunt, in the longer term there needs to be political leadership about how we fund the NHS going forward in the twenty-first century."" As for Jeremy Hunt, he said no health secretary would ""not support potential extra resources"" for the NHS. Asked how he felt about Mr Johnson being the one to make the case, he said there was ""a Brexit debate and an NHS debate and just occasionally these two debates come together"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said he welcomed calls for more funding but accused Mr Johnson of seeking to ""weaponise"" the NHS for his own ""tedious political games"". ""If the government was really serious about putting money into the NHS, they would have done it in the Budget last autumn,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show. ""We did not hear a peep from him then."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies - a think tank - has said the UK will almost certainly have to increase the share of income devoted to health funding to deal with demographic challenges. Its director Paul Johnson said ""that will mean higher taxes"" and ""governments will need to explain that honestly"". Lib Dem leader Vince Cable suggested Mr Johnson and his colleagues begin this process now. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

MPs block ex-expenses chief's new job,"Sir Ian Kennedy had been in line to become an electoral commissioner MPs have voted to prevent the former boss of the Commons expenses watchdog from getting a new job. Sir Ian Kennedy was set to be appointed to the Electoral Commission, and no objections were raised by the leaders of the Westminster parties. But MPs voted by 77 to 46 against the appointment, with one branding him an ""arch quangocrat"" and criticising his expenses reforms. Sir Ian's critics were accused of ""petty behaviour"" by one MP. Former expenses chief's parting shot at critics Sir Ian was chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority until 2016. The organisation was set up as a response to the expenses scandal, but the subsequent system has been criticised by some MPs, who say it is difficult to work with and treats them unfairly. Labour MP John Spellar said Sir Ian had ""largely created the dreadful, anti-elected member, vindictive attitude that has permeated so much of Ipsa"". The organisation has ""taken as its premise that they are there to make life difficult for members of Parliament,"" he added, questioning the process that led to the ""arch quangocrat"" being put forward.

Conservative former minister James Duddridge suggested the 76-year-old was too old for the job, adding: ""Whilst our expenses system desperately needed to be reformed, I don't think there's a single member of the House that thinks Ipsa is a system that is a system lacking in bureaucracy that couldn't be well reformed. ""I don't think he did a good job."" But Labour's Bridget Phillipson, who served on the appointments panel, said correct procedures had been followed with a ""comprehensive and lengthy interview process"". And the SNP's Kirsty Blackman said she was ""honestly quite baffled"" at the MPs criticising the planned appointment, and ""shocked"" at Sir Ian's age being raised as a factor. ""It's pretty clear that there's a significant personal element to how some members feel about this,"" she said. When he left his role with Ipsa in 2016, Sir Ian hit back at his critics, describing his task as having been ""part constitutional reform, part mud-wrestling, part pioneer frontiersman, and part voyager through Dante's Inferno"".

Bennell 'used Darth Vader grip' on witness,"Barry Bennell used a ""Darth Vader grip"" to pin a youth footballer to a wall after he interrupted the former coach abusing a boy, a court has heard. Martin Clarke said he had seen Mr Bennell with one of his alleged sex abuse victims in the changing rooms at Crewe Alexandra's Gresty Road ground. Liverpool Crown Court heard claims he threatened to ""finish"" Mr Clarke's football career if he told anyone. Mr Bennell, 64, denies sexually abusing 11 boys between 1979 and 1990. Mr Bennell, now known as Richard Jones, has admitted seven further charges of indecent assault. Giving evidence in court, Mr Clarke said he returned to the ground after forgetting his football boots following a game and had ""startled"" Mr Bennell. He said: ""He jumped up, stormed at me and pinned me to the wall. If you can imagine Star Wars and Darth Vader, it was like a Darth Vader grip."" Mr Clarke said the young boy ran out of the changing room and Mr Bennell then told him: ""You have not seen anything. If you say anything to anyone I will make sure I will finish your football career here and now."" He told the jury that Mr Bennell had a ""psychological hold"" over him after that incident. The court also heard from an alleged victim of Mr Bennell who claims he was abused up to 100 times by the former coach, including in Gresty Road's changing rooms. He also told the jury he was abused at Mr Bennell's home, a video shop which the coach owned and on a trip to Butlins. In cross-examination by Eleanor Laws QC, defending, the complainant denied having discussions about claiming compensation, saying: ""I don't think anything would compensate that anyway."" He did agree he wished to claim damages against Crewe and the Football Association. But the complainant described as ""ridiculous"" the lawyer's suggestion that he had made up his claims ""either for money or whatever reason"". The trial continues on Thursday.

Pound hits $1.40 in post-Brexit vote high,"Sterling has extended its rally against the dollar to rise above $1.40 for the first time since the Brexit vote. Analysts said the pound's recovery was helped by falls in the dollar and a rethink by some investors about the UK's economic prospects. Others said that despite little development in the Brexit talks this month, there was some optimism about the UK's chances of securing a deal. The pound rose by 0.3% to $1.4030 on Tuesday afternoon before easing back. Sterling fell below $1.20 to a 30-year low against the dollar in the months after the UK voted to leave the European Union, contributing to a spike in inflation as imports became more expensive. But the pound has seen a steady recovery in recent months, which benefits UK tourists visiting the US and could bring down the cost of imports. Analysts pointed to a range of factors for the pound's rise against the dollar, which saw it also briefly touch $1.40 on Monday night. ""There is definitely a feeling that Brexit is now far more likely to be 'soft', which underestimates the risk for more problems ahead in our view but for the time being is leading to demand for [the pound],"" said John Marley, head of FX strategy at currency advisers Infinity International. French President Emmanuel Macron told the BBC over the weekend that theUK could have a bespoke trade deal with the EU. Earlier this month, thepound surged after a news reportthat the Spanish and Dutch finance ministers had agreed to seek a Brexit deal that kept the UK as close to the EU as possible. UK growth upgrade could 'dwarf' Brexit hit Why are there no Brexit talks? But others said the recovery in sterling was overdue. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there was an element of investors ""returning to business as usual"" for the pound. ""There's some realisation that the steep falls in the pound were casting too negative a light on the prospects for the currency and the UK,"" he said. Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Management said the pound's strength was better explained by a weaker dollar. ""There's not been any radical change in Brexit talks,"" he said, adding that otherwise the pound would have gained more against the euro. The pound fell 0.2% against the euro on Tuesday to stay below â¬1.14.

Insurance firms deny 'racism' claim,"Admiral employs more than 8,000 staff worldwide The Admiral insurance group says it has taken the unprecedented step of contacting its customers to deny a newspaper report which suggests it is racist. The Sun,externalclaims motorists using Admiral brands and M&S are being asked to pay more to insure their cars if their name is Mohammed, compared to the name John. Both firms said they do not discriminate under any circumstances. A spokesman for The Sun said ""we stand by our story"". Â£700k Admiral grant from Welsh Government criticised Admiral chief's Â£1,000 retirement gift to workers 'Embarrassing' car insurance photo gaffe shared online The newspaper claimed it used ""identical details"" apart from names using 60 quotes from the price comparison website Go Compare, as well as quotes directly from the insurance companies and other comparison sites. But a spokesman for the Admiral group, which has offices in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, said: ""The insurance quotes in the news article were not like for like. ""We take these allegations very seriously and we are consulting our lawyers."" Admiral has its headquarters in Cardiff, as well as offices in Swansea and Newport In an email to customers, Admiral's chief executive for UK Car Insurance, Cristina Nestares, said: ""You may have seen a story in the news which claims we use customers' names to price our insurance based on race. ""This is 100% not the case and we do not, and have never, used this information to provide a price to our customers. I'm sorry if this story has caused you any concerns."" She added they used a ""complex rating structure"" to offer insurance prices using different variables and data sources. ""The journalists have misunderstood our pricing structure and the insurance quotes in the story are not like for like,"" she said. The Sun article named the Admiral Group brands Admiral, Bell, Elephant and Diamond as well as M&S car insurance. The newspaper alleged the companies ""always quoted more if the driver was called Mohammed"" and the difference was often hundreds of pounds. An M&S Bank spokesman said they do ""not discriminate under any circumstances"" and a customer's name or ethnicity has ""absolutely no impact on their insurance premium"". ""We provided identical quotes in all cases where the scenarios for the two customers were exactly the same. Where there were differences in the scenario, there was a variance in price, this wasn't a result of the customer's name,""  he added. A spokesman from GoCompare said they had ""no influence"" over how customer information was interpreted by insurers in order to calculate insurance premiums. ""We collect the information from the customer and then present the prices and cover levels from insurers who are willing to quote for that customer,"" he said.

Government announces anti-fake news unit,"The UK government is to establish a new unit to counter ""fake news"", Downing Street has said. Theresa May's spokesman said the ""dedicated national security communications unit"" would be charged with ""combating disinformation by state actors and others"". ""We are living in an era of fake news and competing narratives,"" he said. The phrase ""fake news"" has recently emerged and is frequently used by US President Donald Trump. Completely false information, photos or videos purposefully created and spread to confuse or misinform Information, photos or videos manipulated to deceive - or old photographs shared as new Satire or parody which means no harm but can fool people How fake news plagued 2017 Universities offer tips on spotting fake news A committee of MPs is currently carrying out an inquiry into the ""growing phenomenon"" and has demanded information from Facebook and Twitter including on Russian activity during the EU referendum. Downing Street told political reporters: ""The government will respond with more and better use of national security communications to tackle these interconnected complex challenges. ""We will build on existing capabilities by creating a dedicated national security communications unit. This will be tasked with combating disinformation by state actors and others. It will more systematically deter our adversaries and help us deliver on national security priorities."" Last month the BBC launched a new scheme to help young peopleidentify real newsand filter out fake or false information. The new fake news unit was agreed at a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC). The NSC had also commissioned a defence spending review ""to deliver better military capability and value for money in a sustainable and affordable way"", Downing Street said. There have been repeated warnings about cuts to the armed forces, with the Ministry of Defence looking for savings of Â£2bn. The latest review, called the Modernising Defence Programme, will be led by the MoD, rather than the NSC, which BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale described as a ""small but significant victory"" for Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. The NSC had been carrying out a ""capabilities review"" expected to push through more defence cuts, our correspondent said. And handing responsibility to the MoD would give it the chance to argue for more money from the Treasury and more control over the process.

Sessions questioned in Russia inquiryThe US attorney general appears to be the first member of the president's cabinet to be questioned.1ma minute agoUS & Canada,"Jeff Sessions was one of Mr Trump's earliest congressional supporters US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been questioned in an investigation into whether Russia colluded with the Trump campaign in the 2016 election. The Department of Justice (DoJ) confirmed to the BBC that America's top prosecutor was interviewed last week. Mr Sessions is thought to be the first member of President Donald Trump's cabinet to be questioned. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is leading the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Mr Mueller, who was appointed as special counsel, is also investigating whether Mr Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey in May last year was an effort to obstruct the agency's Russia probe. The interview with Mr Sessions, the nation's top lawman, lasted several hours, according to US media reports. Mr Trump said later on Tuesday he was not at all concerned about Mr Sessions' interview. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The US intelligence community has already concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump, though Russia denies this. Special Counsel Mueller is investigating the allegation of Russian meddling, and possible collusion, as are three different congressional committees. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Robert Mueller's investigation has now reached into Donald Trump's political cabinet. While this is a significant development, it shouldn't come as a major surprise given that Jeff Sessions sits at the intersection of multiple reported threads of the inquiry. The former senator had contact with Russians while he was senior adviser to the Trump campaign. Later he was less than forthcoming about their nature. Mr Sessions also may know details about why the president sacked FBI Director James Comey, which could be a key component of any obstruction of justice case Mr Mueller builds against the president or his staff. With the Sessions interview - and recent news that Steve Bannon will also speak with Mr Mueller - there are only a handful of top Trump advisers who served in both the administration and the campaign who have yet to receive a visit from the special counsel's office. Vice-President Mike Pence is one. Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump are two others. Then there's the president himself. Mr Mueller's investigation appears to be heading toward a face-off with the president. Then it will be time for the former top FBI man to put his cards on the table. Mr Sessions, who oversees the FBI at the DoJ, recused himself from the investigation in March 2017 after he acknowledged two previously undisclosed meetings with a Russian ambassador during the campaign. The president repeatedly criticised Mr Sessions for his recusal on Twitter. The former Alabama senator could be an important witness due to his ties to the firing of Mr Comey. The White House initially said that the FBI director's sacking was on the recommendation of the DoJ, citing a departmental memo faulting Mr Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? But Mr Trump later said he was thinking of ""this Russia thing"" when he fired Mr Comey. It is not publicly known exactly who has and has not been interviewed as part of Mr Mueller's probe. However, several names have been reported in US media. Mr Comey was interviewed by the office shortly after he was fired, US media reported on Tuesday. He was questioned about a series of memos he wrote regarding his interactions with Mr Trump, according to the newspaper. George Nader, a little-known Steve Bannon associate who boasts of his well-placed connections in the Middle East, was interviewed at least twice,according to Axios,external. Mr Trump's lawyers were reportedly in talks with investigators in December about a possible interview with the president. Mueller 'in talks to interview Trump' Four people have been criminally charged as part of Mr Mueller's investigation. Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about a meeting with a Russian ambassador. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort has been charged on 12 counts, including conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine, and conspiracy to launder money. Mr Manafort's business associate Rick Gates was also charged with conspiracy to launder money. A third adviser to the campaign - George Papadopoulos - pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The White House has repeatedly argued that FBI agents are biased against Mr Trump, who claimed last year the bureau was in turmoil. Republicans in Congress are claiming to have a secret memo which alleges that agents illegally spied on Mr Trump during Barack Obama's presidency. So far they have yet to release the four-page secret memo, which Republicans say includes allegations that may warrant criminal charges. Why attacks on Mueller are mounting The news of Mr Sessions interview comes a day afterAxios reported that FBI Director Christopher Wray threatened to resign,externalas he was allegedly pressured by Mr Sessions to fire his deputy, Andrew McCabe. Mr McCabe served as acting FBI director before the president tapped Mr Wray to replace Mr Comey. Shortly after firing Mr Comey, Mr Trump invited Mr McCabe to the Oval Office and asked him who he voted for in the 2016 election,reports the Washington Post,external. Mr Trump has criticised Mr McCabe for the FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server, pointing out that his wife ran for Virginia state office as a Democrat during the inquiry. FBI Director Wray reportedly threatened to quit over pressure to fire his deputy, Andrew McCabe (pictured) Former Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton ally, donated to the failed campaign of Mr McCabe's wife. But the FBI concluded earlier this month that Mr McCabe had no conflicts in the Clinton investigation. In response to the Axios report, White House spokesman Raj Shah said that Mr Trump ""believes politically-motivated senior leaders including former Director Comey and others he empowered have tainted the agency's reputation for unbiased pursuit of justice"". ""The President appointed Chris Wray because he is a man of true character and integrity, and the right choice to clean up the misconduct at the highest levels of the FBI,"" he added.

Jeremy Hunt told the cabinet meeting the NHS was facing ""significant"" demand pressures In the run-up to Tuesday's cabinet meeting - in which Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt gave an update on the ""significant"" winter pressures"" facing the NHS - it was reported that Mr Johnson wanted to kick start a wider debate about NHS funding. In a highly unusual move, sources told the BBC Mr Johnson would not only call for a Â£5bn annual injection of funding after Brexit but warn his party against ""abandoning the territory"" to Labour, which vowed at last year's election to spend Â£37bn more over the next five years.

A source close to Mr Johnson said he was frustrated at what he perceived as Downing Street's lack of action on the issue given the levels of public anxiety about how the NHS is faring. During the referendum campaign, Vote Leave - of which Mr Johnson was a leading supporter - claimed Â£350m went to the EU each week and money could instead go to the NHS, a claim he has repeatedly defended since.

However, when it came to it, the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said neither Mr Johnson nor any other minister raised a specific figure during what No 10 said was a ""wide ranging"" hour-long discussion. Firmly, in one sense. A No 10 spokesman said the prime minister and ""a large number of Cabinet ministers"" had made clear that their discussions should take place in private. On the broader political point, Downing Street said the PM reminded ministers that the government has repeatedly said contributions to the EU budget which end after Brexit would be able to be spent on domestic priorities including the NHS.

Kuenssberg: Why is Johnson calling for more NHS cash? Hunt sorry as A&Es struggle to cope NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter In a further rebuff to Mr Johnson, Chancellor Philip Hammond said he had given the NHS an extra Â£6bn in November's Budget, including Â£2.8bn to be spent over the next two years, Mr Hammond, who was in Brussels for a meeting of EU finance ministers, told reporters Mr Johnson was ""the foreign secretary"" not health secretary and the right time to revisit the long-term issue of NHS spending was at the next departmental spending review expected early next year.

The BBC understands that Chris Grayling and Michael Gove were among other cabinet ministers to rally round Mr Johnson at Tuesday's meeting. Growing numbers of Tory MPs are openly expressing their frustration with what they say is No 10's unwillingness to confront the long-term financial challenges facing the health service. Conservative MP Mark Pritchard told the BBC News Channel the foreign secretary was right to speak out. ""I support Boris, he's right. But I think whether it's Boris or Theresa May or Jeremy Hunt, in the longer term there needs to be political leadership about how we fund the NHS going forward in the twenty-first century."" As for Jeremy Hunt, he said no health secretary would ""not support potential extra resources"" for the NHS. Asked how he felt about Mr Johnson being the one to make the case, he said there was ""a Brexit debate and an NHS debate and just occasionally these two debates come together"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said he welcomed calls for more funding but accused Mr Johnson of seeking to ""weaponise"" the NHS for his own ""tedious political games"". ""If the government was really serious about putting money into the NHS, they would have done it in the Budget last autumn,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show. ""We did not hear a peep from him then."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies - a think tank - has said the UK will almost certainly have to increase the share of income devoted to health funding to deal with demographic challenges. Its director Paul Johnson said ""that will mean higher taxes"" and ""governments will need to explain that honestly"". Lib Dem leader Vince Cable suggested Mr Johnson and his colleagues begin this process now. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Van firm CCTV shown to Finsbury Park jury,"This video can not be played Jurors were shown footage which allegedly shows Darren Osborne writing at a pub table two days before the attack The jury in the trial of a man accused of driving a van into a crowd of people near a London mosque has been shown CCTV images of him hiring a vehicle. Woolwich Crown Court was shown footage of Darren Osborne, 48, allegedly hiring the van in Cardiff and then writing a letter saying Muslims were ""rapists"". Prosecutors say CCTV from a pub shows him writing the letter found in the van after the alleged attack, last June. Mr Osborne, from Cardiff, denies murder and attempted murder. He is accused of hitting worshippers in Finsbury Park at about 00:15 BST on 19 June 2017, killing 51-year-old Makram Ali and injuring nine others. Jurors were played a series of CCTV videos, including one of Mr Ali collapsing moments before a van drove into a crowd people treating him. They were also shown a video of Mr Osborne hiring a large Luton box van in Cardiff on 17 June, as well as around 10 minutes of footage from inside the Hollybush Pub in Pentwyn, Cardiff. This video can not be played CCTV shows the moments before a van hit a crowd near Finsbury Park mosque Jurors were told the footage - from two days before the attack - showed a bartender at the pub hand Mr Osborne an object and his change as he purchased a drink. He was then seen writing on paper at a table, the jury heard. Prosecutors say Mr Osborne was writing a note - complaining about terrorists on the streets and the Rotherham child exploitation scandal - found in the van used in the alleged attack. The letter referred to Muslim people as ""feral"" and said Muslim men were ""preying on our children"", the jury was told. Prosecutors say Mr Osborne wrote the note the day before he drove to London CCTV from a van hire firm in Cardiff was also played in court Soldier Callum Spence, who had been in the pub in Pentwyn, said he heard Mr Osborne talking aggressively about Muslims. Mr Spence told the court: ""He was pretty mumbling, but I heard him saying: 'All our families are going to be Muslim. They are all going to be terrorists.' Things like that."" He told the court: ""He just wasn't really all there. He wasn't looking at me. I tried to make eye contact with him but that did not work."" He said he told Mr Osborne to leave and when he helped to escort him out of the premises, the defendant said: ""I'm going to take it into my own hands"". In a statement read to the jury, the pub's assistant manager, Angelo Lamberti, said he had heard Mr Osborne ""tell the soldier that he was also a soldier. ""The soldier asked him what regiment he was in, to which he replied, 'you will find out tomorrow'."" He added: ""When he said to the soldier you will find out tomorrow, I wish I had called the police."" Earlier the jury heard Mr Osborne had contact with far-right groups before the alleged attack. Prosecutors said Mr Osborne received a Twitter message from Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen. They said he also had an email from an English Defence League-linked account. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC outlined Mr Osborne's activity on the internet before the alleged attack. He said the defendant made several searches on the internet for Britain First leader Paul Golding, his deputy Ms Fransen, and Tommy Robinson, one of the EDL's founders, after the London Bridge attack on 3 June. The alleged attack happened in Finsbury Park on 19 June last year Mr Osborne later received an invitation to a demonstration from an account using the name Tommy Robinson calling for participants to ""stand up and say no more"" to extremism. Mr Rees said: ""No-one is suggesting it's him [Mr Robinson] in person but obviously people who follow Tommy Robinson."" The invitation referred to the bombing by Salman Abedi at the Manchester Arena in May, saying the incident was ""not the beginning and it won't be the end"", the court heard. Opening the trial on Monday, Mr Rees said Mr Osborne had become ""obsessed"" with Muslims and the Rochdale grooming scandal after watching a BBC TV drama. He said it was believed Mr Osborne had been planning to target a march in central London, organised by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, on 18 June but was prevented by road closures that were put in place. The trial was adjourned until Wednesday.

"Government announces anti-fake news unitDowning Street says a new unit will counter ""disinformation by state actors and others"".2h2 hours agoUK PoliticsComments","The UK government is to establish a new unit to counter ""fake news"", Downing Street has said. Theresa May's spokesman said the ""dedicated national security communications unit"" would be charged with ""combating disinformation by state actors and others"". ""We are living in an era of fake news and competing narratives,"" he said. The phrase ""fake news"" has recently emerged and is frequently used by US President Donald Trump. Completely false information, photos or videos purposefully created and spread to confuse or misinform Information, photos or videos manipulated to deceive - or old photographs shared as new Satire or parody which means no harm but can fool people How fake news plagued 2017 Universities offer tips on spotting fake news A committee of MPs is currently carrying out an inquiry into the ""growing phenomenon"" and has demanded information from Facebook and Twitter including on Russian activity during the EU referendum. Downing Street told political reporters: ""The government will respond with more and better use of national security communications to tackle these interconnected complex challenges. ""We will build on existing capabilities by creating a dedicated national security communications unit. This will be tasked with combating disinformation by state actors and others. It will more systematically deter our adversaries and help us deliver on national security priorities."" Last month the BBC launched a new scheme to help young peopleidentify real newsand filter out fake or false information. The new fake news unit was agreed at a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC). The NSC had also commissioned a defence spending review ""to deliver better military capability and value for money in a sustainable and affordable way"", Downing Street said. There have been repeated warnings about cuts to the armed forces, with the Ministry of Defence looking for savings of Â£2bn. The latest review, called the Modernising Defence Programme, will be led by the MoD, rather than the NSC, which BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale described as a ""small but significant victory"" for Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. The NSC had been carrying out a ""capabilities review"" expected to push through more defence cuts, our correspondent said. And handing responsibility to the MoD would give it the chance to argue for more money from the Treasury and more control over the process.

Thousands of jobs at risk at Sainsbury's,"Thousands of shop floor jobs are at risk as part of a major shake-up at Sainsbury's. The supermarket chain is changing the way it manages its stores across the UK and scrapping some management posts. Sainsbury's would not confirm the number of employees affected by the move but said it was ""in the thousands"". On Monday, the UK's biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, announced it was cutting 1,700 shop floor management jobs. Like the other major grocers, Sainsbury's is trying to cut costs and simplify its plans to save Â£500m over the next three years. Earlier this month, it confirmed it was ""on track"" to achieve Â£185m of cost savings this year, putting it ahead of target. Sainsbury's, which jostles for position as the UK's second-biggest supermarket with Asda, has more than 1,400 stores in the UK. Tesco to cut 1,700 shop floor jobs Sainsbury's boss: 'UK through the worst' The posts will be replaced by fewer, but mostly better paid, new management roles in each store. Employees have the choice of either applying for these new roles or accepting a more junior position if unsuccessful. Otherwise they face redundancy. Simon Roberts, retail and operations director of Sainsbury's, said: ""We're proposing a store management structure that will deliver best in class leadership and, in many cases, will offer an improved reward package for new management roles. ""The proposals will introduce a more efficient and effective structure, designed to meet the challenges of today's retail environment. They will deliver cost savings to be invested in our customer offer and in our colleagues as they continue to provide the very best service for our customers. ""Our intention is not to reduce overall headcount as a result of these proposals. ""I appreciate this will be a difficult time for those affected and we will fully support our people through these changes."" Rival Tesco has said it intends to cut 1,700 jobs from its branches and warehouses as part of its turnaround strategy. However, it also plans to create 900 jobs and said it would try to move staff affected by the cuts into the new roles. Tesco's UK chief executive Matt Davies said the changes were ""necessary to ensure our business remains competitive and set up for the future"". Tesco is aiming to make Â£1.5bn in cost savings over the three years to 2020. Philip Dorrell, managing partner at Retail Remedy, said the ""ongoing stresses"" in the retail sector had been driven by a need to reduce costs in the face of shrinking profit margins. ""They are shrinking as the discounters have fuelled a need to be more competitive on price, at a time when the volumes that the retailers are selling reduce,"" he added. Discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl were picking up much of the business lost by the mainstream supermarkets, he added. As a result, grocers have had to cut costs - and labour is one of their biggest costs. ""Therefore, the stage is set and the decline of the grocers' workforce will continue,"" he said. The Unite union, which represents more than 12,000 members working for Sainsbury's, said the jobs to be scrapped included team leader/store supervisor roles in all branches. There would also be ""major changes"" to the department manager and deputy manager structure, it added. The union said it would seek ""guarantees"" that there would be no compulsory redundancies as a result of the restructuring. ""We appreciate that Sainsbury's has a good record of redeployment of staff in these situations and we will be exploring every avenue to ensure the continuing employment for our members,"" said Unite's Bev Clarkson.

Pakistan arrests child murder suspect,"This video can not be played The rape and murder of six-year-old Zainab sparked outrage in Pakistan Pakistani authorities say they have arrested the main suspect in the rape and killing of six-year-old Zainab Ansari. The chief minister of Punjab province accused Imran Ali, 24, of being a serial killer. Speaking at a news conference in Lahore, Shahbaz Sharif said the suspect had confessed and his DNA matched samples from the crime scene in Kasur. There has been no immediate comment either from the accused or his lawyers. Zainab's murder triggered outrage across the country, including riots against alleged police incompetence.Two protesters were killed in the clashes. The city haunted by a spate of child killings Murdered girl's father 'has no words' Social media calls for #JusticeForZainab The child's body was found in a garbage dump earlier this month, several days after she went missing. Police in Kasur, which is south of Lahore, say there have been several similar murders in the past two years. CCTV footage showed a man leading away a young girl, believed to be Zainab In February,a suspect in the killing of another childwas shot dead by police when he tried to escape. Pakistani officials are currently investigating whether that man, named only as Mudasir, was innocent. Following his death in February, another four young girls were attacked, including Zainab. Three of them died. Police have been under huge pressure to find who killed Zainab and the other children. Zainab's family say the police did not take action after they reported her missing and it was relatives who recovered CCTV footage of her last movements. The footage, which showed a girl being led away by a man, was circulated widely on social media. Mr Sharif said on Tuesday that they had looked at DNA samples from 1,150 people. The victim's father, Ameen Ansari, was also at the press conference. He said that after initial reservations, he was satisfied with how the case was proceeding. According to Geo News, the suspect is known to the family. Mr Ansari has denied rumours that he is a relative. #JusticeForZainab: Anger and anguish The girl paraded naked for 'honour' Fighting sexual harassment.

Sessions questioned in Russia inquiry,"Jeff Sessions was one of Mr Trump's earliest congressional supporters US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been questioned in an investigation into whether Russia colluded with the Trump campaign in the 2016 election. The Department of Justice (DoJ) confirmed to the BBC that America's top prosecutor was interviewed last week. Mr Sessions is thought to be the first member of President Donald Trump's cabinet to be questioned. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is leading the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Mr Mueller, who was appointed as special counsel, is also investigating whether Mr Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey in May last year was an effort to obstruct the agency's Russia probe. The interview with Mr Sessions, the nation's top lawman, lasted several hours, according to US media reports. Mr Trump said later on Tuesday he was not at all concerned about Mr Sessions' interview. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The US intelligence community has already concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump, though Russia denies this. Special Counsel Mueller is investigating the allegation of Russian meddling, and possible collusion, as are three different congressional committees. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Robert Mueller's investigation has now reached into Donald Trump's political cabinet. While this is a significant development, it shouldn't come as a major surprise given that Jeff Sessions sits at the intersection of multiple reported threads of the inquiry. The former senator had contact with Russians while he was senior adviser to the Trump campaign. Later he was less than forthcoming about their nature. Mr Sessions also may know details about why the president sacked FBI Director James Comey, which could be a key component of any obstruction of justice case Mr Mueller builds against the president or his staff. With the Sessions interview - and recent news that Steve Bannon will also speak with Mr Mueller - there are only a handful of top Trump advisers who served in both the administration and the campaign who have yet to receive a visit from the special counsel's office. Vice-President Mike Pence is one. Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump are two others. Then there's the president himself. Mr Mueller's investigation appears to be heading toward a face-off with the president. Then it will be time for the former top FBI man to put his cards on the table. Mr Sessions, who oversees the FBI at the DoJ, recused himself from the investigation in March 2017 after he acknowledged two previously undisclosed meetings with a Russian ambassador during the campaign. The president repeatedly criticised Mr Sessions for his recusal on Twitter. The former Alabama senator could be an important witness due to his ties to the firing of Mr Comey. The White House initially said that the FBI director's sacking was on the recommendation of the DoJ, citing a departmental memo faulting Mr Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? But Mr Trump later said he was thinking of ""this Russia thing"" when he fired Mr Comey. It is not publicly known exactly who has and has not been interviewed as part of Mr Mueller's probe. However, several names have been reported in US media. Mr Comey was interviewed by the office shortly after he was fired, US media reported on Tuesday. He was questioned about a series of memos he wrote regarding his interactions with Mr Trump, according to the newspaper. George Nader, a little-known Steve Bannon associate who boasts of his well-placed connections in the Middle East, was interviewed at least twice,according to Axios,external. Mr Trump's lawyers were reportedly in talks with investigators in December about a possible interview with the president. Mueller 'in talks to interview Trump' Four people have been criminally charged as part of Mr Mueller's investigation. Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about a meeting with a Russian ambassador. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort has been charged on 12 counts, including conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine, and conspiracy to launder money. Mr Manafort's business associate Rick Gates was also charged with conspiracy to launder money. A third adviser to the campaign - George Papadopoulos - pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The White House has repeatedly argued that FBI agents are biased against Mr Trump, who claimed last year the bureau was in turmoil. Republicans in Congress are claiming to have a secret memo which alleges that agents illegally spied on Mr Trump during Barack Obama's presidency. So far they have yet to release the four-page secret memo, which Republicans say includes allegations that may warrant criminal charges. Why attacks on Mueller are mounting The news of Mr Sessions interview comes a day afterAxios reported that FBI Director Christopher Wray threatened to resign,externalas he was allegedly pressured by Mr Sessions to fire his deputy, Andrew McCabe. Mr McCabe served as acting FBI director before the president tapped Mr Wray to replace Mr Comey. Shortly after firing Mr Comey, Mr Trump invited Mr McCabe to the Oval Office and asked him who he voted for in the 2016 election,reports the Washington Post,external. Mr Trump has criticised Mr McCabe for the FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server, pointing out that his wife ran for Virginia state office as a Democrat during the inquiry. FBI Director Wray reportedly threatened to quit over pressure to fire his deputy, Andrew McCabe (pictured) Former Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton ally, donated to the failed campaign of Mr McCabe's wife. But the FBI concluded earlier this month that Mr McCabe had no conflicts in the Clinton investigation. In response to the Axios report, White House spokesman Raj Shah said that Mr Trump ""believes politically-motivated senior leaders including former Director Comey and others he empowered have tainted the agency's reputation for unbiased pursuit of justice"". ""The President appointed Chris Wray because he is a man of true character and integrity, and the right choice to clean up the misconduct at the highest levels of the FBI,"" he added.

Russia bars The Death of Stalin,"Armando Iannucci's The Death of Stalin did not go down well with politicians and the cinema elite The Russian release of British comedy film The Death of Stalin has been shelved following a screening before senior figures on Monday night. The Russian attendees complained that the satire contained ""ideological warfare"" and ""extremism"". The film's distribution certificate was withdrawn, effectively cancelling its planned Thursday release. It is not clear if the film, starring Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor, will be shown in Russia at all. The culture ministry told Interfax news agency it had informed the film's Russian distributor, Volga, of the decision. ""A decision on whether it will be shown will be made later,"" the ministry was quoted as saying. The film, from director Armando Iannucci, is a satire of the power struggle in Moscow following Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's death in 1953. As a result, many of the main characters are real historical figures. Dining habits of the dictators Monday's screening of the film, which was released in the UK in October, was attended by members of parliament as well as representatives from Russian cinema. Many were unhappy with what they saw. Yelena Drapeko, deputy head of the lower house of parliament's culture committee, told RBK news she had ""never seen anything so disgusting in my life"". Yury Polyakov, a member of the culture ministry's advisory council, said it contained aspects of ""ideological warfare"". To add to the controversy, February is the anniversary of the Russian victory at the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 - one of the largest battles in military history and a decisive victory against Nazi Germany. It was led by Marshal Georgy Zhukov, who is played by Jason Isaacs in the comedy. Jason Isaacs as Marshal Zhukov Marshal Zhukov's daughter was one of 21 signatories on an open letter to the culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, complaining about the film. It criticised the movie for parodying the history of the country and denigrating the memory of Russian citizens who fought the Nazis. The film insults the Russian people, the signatories said, and even the Soviet Union's national anthem -heard in the trailer (which contains language some readers may find offensive),external- was used inappropriately. Minister Medinsky later responded to the controversy by saying: ""Many people of the older generation, and not only, will regard it as an insulting mockery of all the Soviet past, of the country that defeated fascism and of ordinary people, and what's even worse, even of the victims of Stalinism."" ""We don't have censorship,"" he added. ""We are not afraid of critical and unpleasant assessments of our history."" But Armando Iannucci said he was ""still confident"" his movie could be shown in Russia and that the reaction was not reflected by Russia's general populace.

'Far right contact' before van attack,"This video can not be played Jurors were shown footage which allegedly shows Darren Osborne writing at a pub table two days before the attack The jury in the trial of a man accused of driving a van into a crowd of people near a London mosque has been shown CCTV images of him hiring a vehicle. Woolwich Crown Court was shown footage of Darren Osborne, 48, allegedly hiring the van in Cardiff and then writing a letter saying Muslims were ""rapists"". Prosecutors say CCTV from a pub shows him writing the letter found in the van after the alleged attack, last June. Mr Osborne, from Cardiff, denies murder and attempted murder. He is accused of hitting worshippers in Finsbury Park at about 00:15 BST on 19 June 2017, killing 51-year-old Makram Ali and injuring nine others. Jurors were played a series of CCTV videos, including one of Mr Ali collapsing moments before a van drove into a crowd people treating him. They were also shown a video of Mr Osborne hiring a large Luton box van in Cardiff on 17 June, as well as around 10 minutes of footage from inside the Hollybush Pub in Pentwyn, Cardiff. This video can not be played CCTV shows the moments before a van hit a crowd near Finsbury Park mosque Jurors were told the footage - from two days before the attack - showed a bartender at the pub hand Mr Osborne an object and his change as he purchased a drink. He was then seen writing on paper at a table, the jury heard. Prosecutors say Mr Osborne was writing a note - complaining about terrorists on the streets and the Rotherham child exploitation scandal - found in the van used in the alleged attack. The letter referred to Muslim people as ""feral"" and said Muslim men were ""preying on our children"", the jury was told. Prosecutors say Mr Osborne wrote the note the day before he drove to London CCTV from a van hire firm in Cardiff was also played in court Soldier Callum Spence, who had been in the pub in Pentwyn, said he heard Mr Osborne talking aggressively about Muslims. Mr Spence told the court: ""He was pretty mumbling, but I heard him saying: 'All our families are going to be Muslim. They are all going to be terrorists.' Things like that."" He told the court: ""He just wasn't really all there. He wasn't looking at me. I tried to make eye contact with him but that did not work."" He said he told Mr Osborne to leave and when he helped to escort him out of the premises, the defendant said: ""I'm going to take it into my own hands"". In a statement read to the jury, the pub's assistant manager, Angelo Lamberti, said he had heard Mr Osborne ""tell the soldier that he was also a soldier. ""The soldier asked him what regiment he was in, to which he replied, 'you will find out tomorrow'."" He added: ""When he said to the soldier you will find out tomorrow, I wish I had called the police."" Earlier the jury heard Mr Osborne had contact with far-right groups before the alleged attack. Prosecutors said Mr Osborne received a Twitter message from Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen. They said he also had an email from an English Defence League-linked account. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC outlined Mr Osborne's activity on the internet before the alleged attack. He said the defendant made several searches on the internet for Britain First leader Paul Golding, his deputy Ms Fransen, and Tommy Robinson, one of the EDL's founders, after the London Bridge attack on 3 June. The alleged attack happened in Finsbury Park on 19 June last year Mr Osborne later received an invitation to a demonstration from an account using the name Tommy Robinson calling for participants to ""stand up and say no more"" to extremism. Mr Rees said: ""No-one is suggesting it's him [Mr Robinson] in person but obviously people who follow Tommy Robinson."" The invitation referred to the bombing by Salman Abedi at the Manchester Arena in May, saying the incident was ""not the beginning and it won't be the end"", the court heard. Opening the trial on Monday, Mr Rees said Mr Osborne had become ""obsessed"" with Muslims and the Rochdale grooming scandal after watching a BBC TV drama. He said it was believed Mr Osborne had been planning to target a march in central London, organised by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, on 18 June but was prevented by road closures that were put in place. The trial was adjourned until Wednesday.

Ministers won't challenge Worboys release,"This video can not be played Justice Secretary David Gauke says there will not be a judicial review The government will not challenge the decision to release rapist John Worboys, the justice secretary says. David Gauke said ""it would not be appropriate"" to seek a judicial review of the Parole Board's ruling to free Worboys after less than 10 years. Victims as well as the mayor of London are seeking a judicial review. The Parole Board has said it is ""confident correct procedures were followed"". Worboys, 60, was jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London. Mr Gauke said there would be a wider review of how the Parole Board deals with victims. The cabbie who preyed on young women The government had been considering the possibility of a legal challenge to Worboys's release, but the justice secretary said that, after consulting lawyers, it would not be appropriate for him to proceed. He said: ""I know this will disappoint the victims in this case and members of this House given the crimes for which he has been convicted. ""On a personal level, candidly I share those concerns."" He added his decision should not stop others from making their own legal challenge. ""Let me be absolutely clear, Worboys will not be released until his victims' representations have been properly considered and his licence conditions are in place."" Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them At his trial, the court heard how Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne, claiming he was celebrating a big lottery win. The former black cab driver was given an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment, with a minimum term of eight years, for public protection. Prosecutors believe Worboys - who changed his name by deed poll to John Radford - may have carried out more than 100 sexual assaults and rapes on women in London between 2002 and 2008. Victims' groups and representatives were outraged by the news of Worboys's imminent release earlier this month, saying many were not informed before it was made public. In response to the justice secretary, two women - a victim and a second woman who says Worboys attacked her in 2003 although her complaints never reached court - said theyintended to move forwardwith judicial review proceedings next week. They said, in a letter to the Parole Board on 16 January, he ""remains a danger to women and that everything should be done to stop his imminent release"". They are crowdfunding their action and have received more than Â£25,000. Lawyer Richard Scorer, from the firm Slater and Gordon which represented 11 victims in civil cases against Worboys, said his clients were ""disappointed"" at the government's decision, but would go forward with the victim judicial review. ""It is crucial that the decision to release this manipulative, calculating and dangerous man can be considered by the courts as soon as possible."" Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon called for an independent review of the case, saying it raised ""many serious questions"" and urging the government to ""restore public confidence in our justice system"". Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he would seek a separate judicial review, adding: ""I am deeply concerned and unhappy about the prospect of John Worboys's impending release. ""At the very least his victims and Londoners need the Parole Board's decision to be properly scrutinised by the courts. I will do all I can to ensure this happens."" Conservative MP and former mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmithpraised Mr Khan,externalfor ""taking the initiative"" against a ""perverse and appalling"" decision. But former prisons minister Crispin Blunt said Mr Gauke had ""rightly resisted the temptation to do a populist thing which would have been wasteful of taxpayers' money"", as a legal challenge from government would have had no reasonable prospect of success. The Parole Board said it welcomed the review into how it deals with victims. ""We think this is a sensible course of action to take to make sure that the public and especially victims have confidence in the Parole Board's work."" A judicial review is where a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision made by a public body - in this case, the Parole Board. It is less about whether the decision was right or wrong, and more about challenging whether proper procedures were followed to reach the decision. Hearings consider a number of different factors including whether prisoners have changed their behaviour, where they're going to live and what kind of support network they will have after release, Lucy Gampell, a Parole Board member,told Radio 4's The Briefing Room. In Worboys's hearing, the panel considered a dossier of 363 pages, questioned Worboys himself, heard evidence from four psychologists and prison and probations staff and were given a written statement from one of his victims. The final decision is based on future risk - not whether the original sentence was appropriate, Mr Hardwick said. In this case, Mr Gauke said he had two grounds open to him to order such a review: that a decision was one that no Board could reasonably have taken; or that there were significant procedural failings in the way that that decision was taken. His decision not to go ahead suggests he couldn't prove either, says QC and legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg. As Mr Gauke said in his statement, the bar for a review to succeed is ""very high"" and it is unprecedented for a secretary of state to bring a judicial review. As justice secretary, Mr Gauke can always advise Parliament to change the rules by which the Parole Board works. It's unusual for victims to challenge Parole Board decisions as - unsurprisingly - most disputes are about prisoners being denied release. A lawyer acting on behalf of two women who say they were sexually assaulted by Worboys has said they will bring their own review on two grounds: that the Parole Board rules are unlawful in that they prevent the publication of reasons for decisions; and the decision to release Worboys in light of facts surrounding his offence and reports of his progression in prison appears to be wholly irrational. On the first ground, David Gauke has called on a wider review of the Parole Board which is likely to cover this. The second ground will be difficult to prove without the publication of the details from the hearing. Mr Rozenberg said he struggles to see how the the victims would have a better chance of success than Mr Gauke. ""Judicial reviews are difficult and rightly so,"" he added. By BBC home affairs correspondent, Dominic Casciani We don't know why the justice secretary abandoned a proposed judicial review - but given the Parole Board is sponsored by his ministry, it's rather hard to see how he could challenge its workings if staff in prison supported the release decision. Judicial reviews are difficult to win. A claimant must prove that the public body acted illegally or took a decision that was so irrational or perverse that nobody else would come to the same conclusion. The potential judicial review from Worboys's victims is likely to argue that the Parole Board's rules are illegal because there is a clear public interest in revealing the secret reasons for the release decision - but also that whatever those reasons were, they must have been irrational given everything that is known about the serial attacker. While the Parole Board is a quasi court - arguments are put and judgements are made - its processes are entirely private. Victims and the public can't sit in and listen. In contrast, any of us can go to court and hear the detailed arguments presented to a judge deciding whether or not to jail a criminal.

'God should decide' when baby dies,"Isaiah, pictured with an aunt, suffered ""catastrophic"" brain damage, the court was told A woman fighting to stop doctors ending life support treatment for her sick 11-month-old son has told a judge that God should decide when he dies. Specialists at King's College Hospital said giving further treatment to Isaiah Haastrup is ""futile, burdensome and not in his best interests"". They said he is profoundly disabled, but can feel pain. Isaiah's mother, Takesha Thomas, and father Lanre Haastrup, both 36, want treatment to continue. Ms Thomas, a Pentecostal Christian, said: ""For me, I don't think it is right to say who should live or who should die. If God wants to take the person, He will."" She told the judge: ""When I speak to him he will respond, slowly, by opening one eye. ""I see a child who is injured. He needs love. He needs care. I have it. I can can give it."" Isaiah Haastrup's mother Takesha Thomas told the High Court ""If God wants to take the person, He will."" Ms Thomas told the judge that Isaiah responded to her. ""When I take him out for cuddles, when I sing to him, when I rock he feels sleepy in my arms,"" she said. A specialist treating Isaiah had told the judge that in his opinion the boy would not improve. He described Isaiah as ""profoundly disabled"", and said that he could not breathe independently. The judge has ruled that medics involved in Isaiah's case cannot be identified. Barrister Fiona Paterson, representing King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, told the judge that overwhelming medical evidence showed that stopping treatment was in Isaiah's best interests. The hearing is expected to end on Wednesday.

Tory pair quit in royal wedding row,"This video can not be played ""Medieval"": Find out what Windsor makes of the royal wedding row Two Tory councillors have quit the party in protest after a council leader called for rough sleepers to be cleared before the royal wedding in May. Simon Dudley, leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead, had said beggars could show Windsor in an ""unfavourable light"" when Prince Harry weds Meghan Markle. He won a no-confidence vote on Monday. Paul Brimacombe and Asghar Majeed immediately resigned from the council's Conservative group. The pair will continue as independents. They said in a joint statement: ""It was not considered appropriate... to wholeheartedly disagree with the will of the group on this fundamental issue and yet to remain within the group."" Asghar Majeed and Paul Brimacombe quit the Conservative party after Simon Dudley survives a no-confidence vote Mr Dudley made his initial remarks about tackling ""aggressive begging"" in aletter to the local Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC)but has since claimed his comments were misconstrued. The leader of the Conservative-controlled authority said he was referring to anti-social behaviour not homelessness. Mr Dudley survived a no-confidence vote held by the council's Conservative group. It is expected the opposition group within the council will attempt to oust him with a no-confidence vote on January 29. Simon Dudley said his initial comments have been misconstrued ""At no point have I said 'move on the homeless',"" Mr Dudley told the BBC, before apologising if he was not ""clear enough in my communication"".

Fresh Worboys sex assault claim,"John Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them A new sexual assault allegation made against rapist John Worboys is being investigated by Scotland Yard. The claim, which dates back to 1997, several years earlier than the date when it was thought Worboys' offending started, was reported to police this month. BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Worboys could remain in custody if the investigation progressed quickly and led to criminal charges. No arrests have been made. The cabbie who preyed on young women Parole Board's decision 'will not be challenged' Worboys, 60, was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009 for drugging and sexually assaulting women passengers. News that the Parole Board haddecided to free Worboys after a decade behind barswas met with a furore by Worboys' victims and in Parliament. Lawyers representing victims said their clients were ""extremely distressed"" and, along with the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, demanded the government launch a judicial review of the decision. Last week, Justice Secretary David Gauke told the Commons the government would not challenge the Parole Board's decision. Lawyers for two victims have said they intend to pursue the case in the courts. This is a potentially significant development which could delay or even prevent John Worboys' impending release from prison. Although the investigation is in its early stages, and Worboys has not been arrested or interviewed, I understand that detectives are taking the allegation extremely seriously. It was apparently not reported to police before and was not among the dozens of claims of sexual assault considered by police and prosecutors before and immediately after his trial in 2009. That means it would be possible for the 60-year-old to face charges over it, should there be sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. If Scotland Yard and the CPS moved quickly the prosecution could start while Worboys is still in prison. That would almost certainly mean he'd have to stay there at least until the trial - to the relief of his victims and the government. It is understood Worboys' release is not imminent, but the former London black-cab driver was transferred from high-security prison HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire to HMP Belmarsh in south-east London at the weekend - prompting fresh outrage that he may be allowed to return to the capital. During justice questions in the Commons earlier, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park, Zac Goldsmith, said the proposed release ""absolutely horrified and terrified [Worboys'] many, many victims"". ""And like me they are appalled to learn today that he has been moved to London's Category A Belmarsh Prison,"" he added. Labour's Neil Coyle, MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, said: ""[Worboys] hasn't served the sentence he was given and was not prosecuted for the vast majority of his crimes."" Mr Gauke said that while the ""precise conditions"" are decided at an ""operational level"", he had written to the authorities ""stressing the needs to ensure that the concerns of victims are put at the heart of this process"". Worboys was transferred from HMP Wakefield to HMP Belmarsh in south-east London Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer from Slater and Gordon which represented 11 of Worboys' victims, said his clients had not been informed about recent developments. ""It's an absolute disgrace that they are perpetually ignored by the authorities and are not consulted about his release. ""It is an insult that they have had to find out from the media of every new development in this case and it is crucial that they are kept updated."" After the Parole Board's decision was revealed, there were calls for him to be located away from Greater London to reassure terrified victims. A group of MPs called for an ""exclusion zone""to be imposed to ban the former taxi driver from the capital. When he is released, Worboys is expected to spend several months in a probation hostel.

Kuenssberg: Job done?,"A rebuke, a dressing down, a telling off. Boris Johnson felt the anger of his boss and his colleagues today, for making known his plan for Cabinet before the supposedly confidential meeting. His critics are frothing. One former minister even called for his sacking, others are publicly questioning his motivation. But if his ambition was to put the issue on the table, well, job done. The foreign secretary has tried to put himself on the side of the patient and the public when many are worried about the health service. In part, he is keen to preserve at least part of the promise he and others made during the referendum, and also to inject some vigour into a government that some on its own side see as moribund. With little spare public money and no majority, No 10 has little room for manoeuvre. But there was a consensus in Cabinet that when payments to the EU stop, that money should be spent on priorities like the NHS. The foreign secretary is not alone in worrying that if the government won't, or can't, control events, the risk is events control it. To use his phrase, perhaps Boris Johnson is trying to take back some control.

'Far right contact' before van attackProsecutors say a man who hit a crowd near a London mosque had a message from Britain First's deputy leader.1han hour agoUK,"This video can not be played Jurors were shown footage which allegedly shows Darren Osborne writing at a pub table two days before the attack The jury in the trial of a man accused of driving a van into a crowd of people near a London mosque has been shown CCTV images of him hiring a vehicle. Woolwich Crown Court was shown footage of Darren Osborne, 48, allegedly hiring the van in Cardiff and then writing a letter saying Muslims were ""rapists"". Prosecutors say CCTV from a pub shows him writing the letter found in the van after the alleged attack, last June. Mr Osborne, from Cardiff, denies murder and attempted murder. He is accused of hitting worshippers in Finsbury Park at about 00:15 BST on 19 June 2017, killing 51-year-old Makram Ali and injuring nine others. Jurors were played a series of CCTV videos, including one of Mr Ali collapsing moments before a van drove into a crowd people treating him. They were also shown a video of Mr Osborne hiring a large Luton box van in Cardiff on 17 June, as well as around 10 minutes of footage from inside the Hollybush Pub in Pentwyn, Cardiff. This video can not be played CCTV shows the moments before a van hit a crowd near Finsbury Park mosque Jurors were told the footage - from two days before the attack - showed a bartender at the pub hand Mr Osborne an object and his change as he purchased a drink. He was then seen writing on paper at a table, the jury heard. Prosecutors say Mr Osborne was writing a note - complaining about terrorists on the streets and the Rotherham child exploitation scandal - found in the van used in the alleged attack. The letter referred to Muslim people as ""feral"" and said Muslim men were ""preying on our children"", the jury was told. Prosecutors say Mr Osborne wrote the note the day before he drove to London CCTV from a van hire firm in Cardiff was also played in court Soldier Callum Spence, who had been in the pub in Pentwyn, said he heard Mr Osborne talking aggressively about Muslims. Mr Spence told the court: ""He was pretty mumbling, but I heard him saying: 'All our families are going to be Muslim. They are all going to be terrorists.' Things like that."" He told the court: ""He just wasn't really all there. He wasn't looking at me. I tried to make eye contact with him but that did not work."" He said he told Mr Osborne to leave and when he helped to escort him out of the premises, the defendant said: ""I'm going to take it into my own hands"". In a statement read to the jury, the pub's assistant manager, Angelo Lamberti, said he had heard Mr Osborne ""tell the soldier that he was also a soldier. ""The soldier asked him what regiment he was in, to which he replied, 'you will find out tomorrow'."" He added: ""When he said to the soldier you will find out tomorrow, I wish I had called the police."" Earlier the jury heard Mr Osborne had contact with far-right groups before the alleged attack. Prosecutors said Mr Osborne received a Twitter message from Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen. They said he also had an email from an English Defence League-linked account. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC outlined Mr Osborne's activity on the internet before the alleged attack. He said the defendant made several searches on the internet for Britain First leader Paul Golding, his deputy Ms Fransen, and Tommy Robinson, one of the EDL's founders, after the London Bridge attack on 3 June. The alleged attack happened in Finsbury Park on 19 June last year Mr Osborne later received an invitation to a demonstration from an account using the name Tommy Robinson calling for participants to ""stand up and say no more"" to extremism. Mr Rees said: ""No-one is suggesting it's him [Mr Robinson] in person but obviously people who follow Tommy Robinson."" The invitation referred to the bombing by Salman Abedi at the Manchester Arena in May, saying the incident was ""not the beginning and it won't be the end"", the court heard. Opening the trial on Monday, Mr Rees said Mr Osborne had become ""obsessed"" with Muslims and the Rochdale grooming scandal after watching a BBC TV drama. He said it was believed Mr Osborne had been planning to target a march in central London, organised by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, on 18 June but was prevented by road closures that were put in place. The trial was adjourned until Wednesday.

Accused 'blames murder on second woman',"Celine Dookhran was found dead in an empty house in Kingston, south London A man accused of raping and killing his niece claims that his other alleged victim is the murderer, a court has heard. Mujahid Arshid, 33, of no fixed address, denies raping and attempting to kill the second woman. The witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, rejected the defence case that she killed 20-year-old Celine Dookhran. Mr Arshid also denies the rape and murder of Ms Dookhran. Prosecutors allege that he kidnapped both woman - who were forcibly bound and gagged - in July last year. He is then accused of taking them to an empty house in Kingston, south London, where he raped them in turn, murdered Ms Dookhran and left her body in a large freezer, and tried to murder the second woman by cutting her throat. It is claimed he was assisted in the initial kidnap by 28-year-old Vincent Tappu, who denies the allegation. Jurors at the Old Bailey previously heard that the second woman escaped death by convincing Mr Arshid they could have a relationship. Mujahid Arshid (left) and Vincent Tappu are charged with kidnapping Ms Dookhran and the second woman During cross examination by Judy Khan QC, representing Mr Arshid, the woman rejected the defence case that there was no kidnap, no sexual assaults, and that the women were ""never tied or gagged"". Ms Khan suggested both women willingly travelled to the Kingston house and that, when there, the witness had consensual sex with Mr Arshid. The defence case is that Mr Arshid also had consensual sex with Ms Dookhran, and that the surviving woman subsequently became ""upset and jealous"" and ""started to shout abuse"". Ms Khan suggested Mr Arshid had gone outside for 15 minutes and that when he came back he found the second woman in the bathroom - ""knife in hand"" - standing over a bleeding Ms Dookrhan, who was lying dead in the bathtub. Addressing the witness, Ms Khan said her client's case is that ""you were responsible for Celine's injuries"" and that ""you suggested that Celine be put in the freezer"". The defence barrister further alleged that the woman's own injuries were sustained during a struggle as Mr Arshid sought to protect himself. The woman rejected the defence claims, saying ""I disagree"" and ""I disagree completely"" each time an allegation was put. Mr Arshid is further charged with sexual assault and assault by penetration against the surviving woman. Together with labourer Mr Tappu, of Acton, west London, he has also pleaded not guilty to the women's kidnap and false imprisonment, and possession of a firearm with intent, namely a Taser.

Kuenssberg: Johnson's motive?,"It won't be the first time that Boris Johnson has called for more cash for the NHS. Depending on the flavour of your own views, his promise during the referendum of an extra Â£350m  for the NHS was either an entirely sensible and publicly appealing promise of how we should spend the EU membership fees that may (eventually) come back to the country after we leave, or a classic piece of political sleight of hand. Frankly, we have all discussed that one enough for most people's liking. Labour is calling for an additional Â£5bn to be pumped into the NHS straight away. But this week, even though he was not in charge of the NHS when I last looked, Mr Johnson is expected to make the call at cabinet for an extra Â£100m a week for the NHS in England, and a more vigorous approach to the politics of the service. Sources close to him suggest the foreign secretary thinks ""Number 10 is abandoning the territory"". He is not the only government minister who is worried that Theresa May isn't paying enough political attention to the travails of the health service. Other Brexiteers, like Michael Gove, are understood to share some of his fears. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is not, sources say, working in concert with Mr Johnson, but is also known to be privately making the case for more cash. The health secretary is thought to share Mr Johnson's concerns Others may well agree, even if Mr Johnson's likely intervention at cabinet might ruffle a few feathers. A cabinet minister, not in the usual Brexit camp, told me ""everyone says privately that something has to change,"" adding: ""We have to offer a reason why we should run it (the NHS), not just be in a bidding war with the Labour Party."" Number 10 says the NHS was given ""top priority"" in the last Budget, with extra funding where other government departments' calls largely fell on deaf ears. With no majority, and their limits on public spending, the government has little room for manoeuvre. But growing numbers of Tory MPs are openly expressing their frustration with Number 10's handling of the NHS, particularly, the prime minister's response to calls for a cross party commission to tackle the long term challenges it faces. There are several factors stirring the pot. There is a desire among Brexiteers, not least Mr Johnson, to be seen to be at least trying to aim to keep the big promise they made during the referendum in 2016. There is the genuine concern felt by MPs from all political parties, and prominent Tories, like Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the health select committee, about the future of the health service. The NHS is always just about at the top of voters' list of priorities - and the perceived lack of action is heightening anxiety about Theresa May's leadership more generally. The NHS is always a top priority for voters One senior Tory MP told the BBC ""we all know the problem - it is at the centre there is no decision making"". A former minister said ""more and more people are saying, we can't have another year like this"". Even normally loyal MPs, like Nicholas Soames, are on somewhat itchy form. After the former minister Nick Boles criticised Mrs May's ""timidity"" -saying the government was full of ""boiled rabbits"",external(a phrase borrowed from George Orwell) - Mr Soames wrote on Twitter, 'where is the bold and brave, so far it is dull, dull, dull'. Another MP described Theresa May unflatteringly as a ""Soviet leader who goes up to the window to be seen but no one is quite sure if they are alive"". It doesn't seem likely that Mr Johnson's likely intervention at cabinet will suddenly provoke Number 10 to make a dramatic move on the NHS. Money, and political capital in the Tory Party are in very short supply. And just as there are cabinet ministers who may swing behind him in agreement, it is possible that his intervention may rankle others too. Who knows, it's possible that the foreign secretary may (unusually, you might say) decide to keep his counsel. Increasingly though it is harder for Theresa May to avoid this conversation. It's not just the NHS, but the prime minister and the Conservatives, that are under winter pressure.

Pupil 'killed by classmate' in German attack,"Police say they have arrested one pupil from the Kaethe Kollwitz comprehensive school over the killing A pupil at secondary school near the German city of Dortmund has been killed by a fellow classmate, according to police. Reports say a 15-year-old student stabbed a 14-year-old boy. The attack happened at around 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) at the KÃ¤the Kollwitz comprehensive school in the town of LÃ¼nen. One teenager has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Pastors are at the school to support pupils and parents. Police say they are investigating and have not released any further details. German media say both the victim and the suspect are German citizens, while the latter also has a Kazakh passport. Officials in North Rhine-Westphalia have recently vowed to tackle the problem of youth violence in Germany's most populous state.

Facebook invents new unit of time,"The flick is the next unit of time up from a nanosecond A Facebook engineer has invented a new unit of time called a flick. The flick has been designed to help developers keep video effects in sync,according to a description,externalon the code-sharing site GitHub. A flick, derived from ""frame-tick"", is 1/705,600,000 of a second - the next unit of time after a nanosecond. A researcher at Oxford University said the flick wouldn't have much general impact but may help create better virtual reality experiences. Flicks are defined in the programming language C++, which is used to generate visual effects for film, television and other media. Flicks give programmers a way to measure the time between media frames without using fractions. Matt Hammond, lead research engineer at BBC Research and Development, said this can reduce errors such as stutters in graphics. ""When the numbers used are not integers, errors can gradually creep into computer calculations. These errors can build up over time, eventually causing inaccuracies that become noticeable,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Flick's creator, Christopher Horvath, publicly shared his idea on Facebook in early 2017,according to the GitHub description,external.  He then made modifications to the new measurement based on feedback from comments. The Oxford University researcher, who asked not to be identified, said that flicks may help virtual reality developers deal with latency, or delay. ""Very often in academic literature, you have this notion of presence and immersion,"" he told the BBC. ""Immersion is the engagement you feel with a computer game. Presence is the notion of your brain feeling that you are there. ""Presence is very, very easy to break. I think perhaps a very fixed way of describing these time steps allows for developers to have a bit more flexibility in dealing with latency issues and making sure videos stay in sync."" A flick is not the first unit of time designed by a major corporation. Swatch introduced Internet Time in 1998, which divides the day into 1,000 "".beats"".

Alaska tsunami fears prompt evacuation,"Cars were seen moving to higher ground after the earthquake A tsunami warning was lifted hours after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska in the US. The quake hit 280km (173 miles) south-east of Kodiak, at a depth of 25km, at 00:31 local time (09:31 GMT), theUS Geological Survey,externalsaid. The US National Weather Service (NWS) said,externaltsunami waves of less than 1ft (0.3m) had been confirmed. A lower-level advisory briefly remained in effect for south Alaska and the peninsula, before being lifted. Waves between 0.4ft and 0.7ft had been recorded in Kodiak, Seward, Old Harbor, Sitka and Yakutat, the NWS said. It said that tsunami waves of less than 1ft were expected in the town of Homer. The latest advisory would be the last handed out, the service said - but still advised residents not to return to ""hazard zones until local emergency officials indicate it is safe to do so"". Residents had earlier been told to seek high ground as sirens in several towns blared at around 01:00 on Tuesday. Four hours later, the all-clear was given. Kodiak City Manager Mike Tvenge thanked residents for their orderly evacuations and told them to return home safely. Mayor Pat Branson said the warning centre had done an ""excellent job"". Kodiak school district cancelled all classes on Tuesday because of the warning, telling students to remain home. The weather service said an earlier tsunami warning had been cancelled ""for the coastal areas of British Columbia, south-east Alaska and south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula from The Wash./BC Border  to Hinchinbrook Entrance, Alaska"".

EU rebate helps to boost UK finances,"UK government borrowing nearly halved in December from a year earlier, helped by a rebate from the European Union. Public sector borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell to a lower-than-expected Â£2.6bn last month, a Â£2.5bn fall from December 2016. The UK received a Â£1.2bn rebate from the EU due to a reduction in the bloc's budget and changes to contributions. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also noted the collapse of Carillion could affect public finances. The ONS said that the government had stated it would provide funding required by the Official Receiver to maintain public services. ""Any impact of these financial interventions on public sector finances will be announced in due course,"" it said. The ONS said public borrowing for the financial year to date now totalled Â£50bn, down nearly 12% from the same period a year earlier and the lowest year-to-date total since 2007. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said low public borrowing in December reflected falling government spending, ""not a resurgent UK economy"". Central government tax receipts rose more slowly in December than they had in the previous eight months, while current expenditure fell by 0.8% compared with the previous December ""primarily because the UK received a Â£1.2bn credit from the EU"", he added. ""The credit reflects both a reduction of the size of the EU's budget and the underperformance of the UK economy this year; contributions are linked to the size of Britain's economy relative to the rest of the EU,"" said Mr Tombs. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We have made great progress in reducing the deficit by three quarters since 2010, but government debt is still far too high. ""Our balanced approach to government spending is getting debt falling, while investing in key public services and keeping taxes low."" Ruth Gregory, an economist with consultancy Capital Economics, said December's public finance figures provided ""some good news"" for the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond. ""However, we shouldn't get too carried away by these figures. We doubt that borrowing will come in too much below the OBR's current forecast,"" she added. The government is expected to borrow Â£49.9bn pounds in this financial year, which ends in March. So the news that it has already borrowed more than that might look like bad news. However, millions of people and businesses are, at this moment, frantically filling in their tax returns, calculating how much they owe HMRC and posting off millions of very large cheques. For the next two months the government will have more money coming in than it needs and so borrowing for the year as a whole will almost certainly be lower than Â£50bn. But the government's borrowing problems are not over. Growth and productivity for the next few years are now predicted to be worse than previously thought, meaning balancing the books is going to take longer.

'America First' tariffs spark Asia outcry,"China says its fast-paced growth in the solar sector makes it a ""target of protectionism"" US President Donald Trump has brushed off concerns that new tariffs the US has imposed on imported washing machines and solar panels will lead to a trade war. The announcement of the tariffs - of up to 50% - have prompted outcry from China and South Korea, the primary targets of the measure. Some US businesses that rely on the imported products are also concerned. Mr Trump dismissed the talk and said the tariffs would add jobs in the US. At a signing ceremony on Tuesday, he said they ""demonstrate to the world that the United States will not be taken advantage of any more."" ""There won't be a trade war,"" he later added. The action is part of US President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy, which aims to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. South Korea said it would complain to the World Trade Organization (WTO). China, the world's biggest solar panel producer, said the move was an ""overreaction"" and pledged to ""work with other WTO members to resolutely defend its legitimate interests"". India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke against tariffs at the World Economic Forum in Davos in an apparent reference to the US measures, although India's own finance ministry is planning a 70% tariff on Chinese solar panels. ""Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation. Their intention is not only to avoid globalisation themselves but they also want to reverse its natural flow,"" Mr Modi said. Will Trump's 'America First' policy work? Is Trump the WTO's biggest threat? What is the World Trade Organization? Samsung, a South Korean company, said consumers in the US would be negatively affected by the measures. ""Everyone will pay more with fewer choices,"" a company statement said. South Korea's LG Electronics also said the move would harm employment prospects at its new factory. Mexico said it was ""regrettable"" that it was not excluded from the tariffs, adding that it would ""use all available legal resources in response to the US decision"". In the US, the Solar Energy Industries Association, which campaigned against the decision, estimated that 23,000 American jobs would also be lost. It believes the US will not be able to keep up with demand for panels, meaning there will be less work for those producing complementary technology and fittings. The tougher policy was approved by President Trump after the US International Trade Commission (ITC) found local manufacturers were being hurt by cheaper imports. Manufacturing companies - Whirlpool, a US-based maker of washing machines, and the solar firms Suniva and Solar World Americas - had complained to the ITC and it found in their favour. The ITC said that China had been selling ""artificially low-priced"" solar components in the US, assisted by state subsidies. Mr Trump has talked about taking the action ever since coming to office. In his inauguration speech a year ago he promised to protect US borders from other countries ""making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs"". This video can not be played Donald Trump inauguration: 'America first, America first' The actions are being seen as the president's most significant trade moves since his decision to pull the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal (TPP) and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). However, some pointed out that the US has been moving increasingly towards protectionism in recent years. According to research by international law firm Gowling WLG,the US has made 1,085 more protectionist measures,externalthan liberalising ones since 2009. The first 1.2 million imported large residential washing machines in the first year will have a 20% tariff imposed on them, while there will be a 50% tariff on machines above that number. By the third year, these will drop to 16% and 40% respectively. In a report published last month,the ITC found that high numbers of imported washing machines were damaging domestic manufacturers,external, and that Chinese imports had overtaken those from South Korea. Meanwhile, the tariff increase on imported solar cells and modules in the first year will be 30%, falling to 15% by the fourth year, although 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of imported cells - enough for about 11.5 million panels - will be allowed in tariff-free annually. Cracks in the US solar industry Environmentalists argue that making solar panels more expensive risks holding back the development of renewable energy in the country. Taylor Kate Brown, BBC News, Washington The Trump administration has imposed these tariffs as part of a larger promise to protect American manufacturing - including the solar industry firms that brought the original complaint to the trade commission. But what the ""solar industry"" means in this context is complicated. The tariffs were opposed by America's largest solar industry group - the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).  SEIA said Suniva and Solarworld had used the complaint to cover for bad business practices - and pointed out the two companies are actually foreign-owned even though the produce panels in the US. SEIA's position was also driven by the fact the group represents thousands of solar installers - an industry that's seen explosive growth, driven in part because of the dropping cost of panels. Firms that specialise in larger solar ""farms"" that sell their energy to US utilities are particularly worried about the decision, as they compete directly with coal, natural gas and wind producers. Ironically, the decision could mean more competition for Suniva and Solarworld, asseveral foreign firms may be interested in moving production to the US,external. South Korea's trade minister, Kim Hyun-chong, said the tariffs ""put political considerations ahead of international standards"". ""This government will actively respond to the spread of protectionist measures to defend national interests,"" he said. South Korea said it would complain to the World Trade Organization (WTO), calling the tariffs ""excessive"" and ""regrettable"". Its manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, compete in the washing machine market with US firms such as Whirlpool. Samsung called the tariffs ""a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine"". This video can not be played How Sharon turned her life around Meanwhile Wang Hejun of China's commerce ministry said the decision to impose tariffs was ""an abuse of trade remedy measures, and China expresses strong dissatisfaction regarding this"". China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said the country's fast-paced growth in the solar sector had made it a ""target of protectionism"". However US appliance maker Whirlpool, which for years has sought protection against cheaper imports from South Korea and Mexico, welcomed the move. ""This announcement caps nearly a decade of litigation and will result in new manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee,external,"" chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement. Shares in Whirlpool rose 2.5% on the news, and it immediately announced it would employ 200 more people. Shares in US solar panel manufacturers also went up.

Family end three-month Bangkok airport stay,"The family said they faced persecution if they returned to Zimbabwe If you've ever complained about being forced to sleep in an airport after a delay, spare a thought for one Zimbabwean family who have finally left Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport where they've lived for the past three months. The family - four children under the age of 11 and four adults - first arrived in Bangkok in May. When they tried to leave in October for Spain,they didn't have the right visas. They couldn't legally re-enter Thailand as they'd overstayed their tourist visas and had to pay a fine. But they said they could not return to Zimbabwe because they faced persecution. The family had been living in Suvarnabhumi airport since May The family's situation came to light when an employee at Suvarnabhumi airport posted a photo of himself with one of the children in December saying they were living there ""because of the unsettled situation"" at home. Officials at that time explained that they'd tried to help the family make arrangements with Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) to fly via Kiev to Dubai instead - and then on to a third country - bypassing European immigration. But according to a UIA spokesperson, the family cancelled their tickets for the final leg of their journey, leading them to be sent back from Dubai to Bangkok. The family asked for assistance from the UN, saying they feared persecution in Zimbabwe after the November unrestwhich saw the removal of long-term leader Robert Mugabe. The UN said at the time that it was ""exploring options"". Thailand does not provide legal status to refugees and asylum seekers. Meanwhile, the family stayed inside the departure area, being looked after by airport staff. According to a Thai immigration bureau spokesman, they finally left Bangkok on Monday afternoon. Pol Col Cherngron Rimphadee told the BBC's Thai Service that the family had departed for the Philippines. A UNHCR refugee camp is located there, but it was not clear whether it was their final destination. A UNHCR spokeswoman told the Coconuts website that the agency would not comment on individual cases.

'America First' tariffs spark Asia outcryTariffs of up to 50% on imported goods will mostly hit South Korea and China.1han hour agoWorld,"China says its fast-paced growth in the solar sector makes it a ""target of protectionism"" US President Donald Trump has brushed off concerns that new tariffs the US has imposed on imported washing machines and solar panels will lead to a trade war. The announcement of the tariffs - of up to 50% - have prompted outcry from China and South Korea, the primary targets of the measure. Some US businesses that rely on the imported products are also concerned. Mr Trump dismissed the talk and said the tariffs would add jobs in the US. At a signing ceremony on Tuesday, he said they ""demonstrate to the world that the United States will not be taken advantage of any more."" ""There won't be a trade war,"" he later added. The action is part of US President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy, which aims to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. South Korea said it would complain to the World Trade Organization (WTO). China, the world's biggest solar panel producer, said the move was an ""overreaction"" and pledged to ""work with other WTO members to resolutely defend its legitimate interests"". India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke against tariffs at the World Economic Forum in Davos in an apparent reference to the US measures, although India's own finance ministry is planning a 70% tariff on Chinese solar panels. ""Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation. Their intention is not only to avoid globalisation themselves but they also want to reverse its natural flow,"" Mr Modi said. Will Trump's 'America First' policy work? Is Trump the WTO's biggest threat? What is the World Trade Organization? Samsung, a South Korean company, said consumers in the US would be negatively affected by the measures. ""Everyone will pay more with fewer choices,"" a company statement said. South Korea's LG Electronics also said the move would harm employment prospects at its new factory. Mexico said it was ""regrettable"" that it was not excluded from the tariffs, adding that it would ""use all available legal resources in response to the US decision"". In the US, the Solar Energy Industries Association, which campaigned against the decision, estimated that 23,000 American jobs would also be lost. It believes the US will not be able to keep up with demand for panels, meaning there will be less work for those producing complementary technology and fittings. The tougher policy was approved by President Trump after the US International Trade Commission (ITC) found local manufacturers were being hurt by cheaper imports. Manufacturing companies - Whirlpool, a US-based maker of washing machines, and the solar firms Suniva and Solar World Americas - had complained to the ITC and it found in their favour.

He said Ms O'Riordan had ""reached out to the world"" and had ""a unique respect for everyone"". ""It is our sincere prayer that our beloved Dolores is now re-united with her father, Terry, her baby brother, Gerard, grandparents, relatives and friends, in the presence of the Lord and Our Lady of Dolours in the heavenly kingdom, where there is no more pain or suffering or separations, but only joy and peace for all eternity,"" he said. ""If tears are shed in heaven - by necessity they are tears of joy. ""Yes, tears of joy, following an excellent performance by Dolores, in the most important and vital gig of all - the gig of life itself.""

"Oscars 2018: The Shape of Water leads fieldGuillermo del Toro's fantasy romance receives 13 nominations, including best picture.2m2 minutes agoEntertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Find out the key Oscar nominees for 2018 The nominations for the 90th Academy Awards have been announced, with The Shape of Water leading the field. Guillermo del Toro's fantasy romance received 13 nominations, including best picture. World War Two drama Dunkirk follows with eight nominations, while Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri received seven. British stars shortlisted include Gary Oldman, Sally Hawkins and a pair of Daniels - Day-Lewis and Kaluuya. What's up for best picture this year? How did #MeToo shape the Oscar nominations? 8 talking points from the nominations The Oscar nominations in full Greta Gerwig has landed a best director nomination for Lady Bird, one of nine films shortlisted for the best picture award. Woody Harrelson and Frances McDormand are both nominated in Three Billboards Others include Steven Spielberg's The Post, gay romance Call Me By Your Name and Winston Churchill drama Darkest Hour. Oldman's performance as Churchill has already won the British actor a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award. To win the Oscar, though, he will have to beat three-time best actor winner Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, nominated again for Phantom Thread. Gary Oldman among best actor nominees Another best actress nomination for Streep Meryl Streep's best actress nomination for newspaper drama The Post is her 17th for best actress and her 21st overall. The three-time Oscar winner said she was ""honoured beyond measure"" to be recognised for ""a film that stands in defence of press freedom and inclusion of women's voices in the movement of history"". Lady Bird's nominations included best director and best picture Frances McDormand is tipped to be this year's winner for her role as a grieving mother in Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. Two of McDormand's co-stars, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell, go head to head in the best supporting actor category. The Shape of Water has also fared well in the acting categories, with nominations for Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer alongside Hawkins' best actress nod. Del Toro's film narrowly missed out on tying with the previous nomination record of 14, obtained by the films All About Eve, Titanic and La La Land. Diversity continues to be a hot topic in Hollywood, which has been rocked this year by sexual harassment scandals, concerns over gender pay equality and the role of women both in front of and behind the camera. These topics appear to have had an impact on this year's nominations, which are largely free of embarrassing exclusions and the kind of all-white line-ups that led to the #OscarsSoWhite campaign on social media. Greta Gerwig's nomination in the best director category will placate those who expressed displeasure at the Golden Globes' all-male directing nominees, even if she is only the fifth woman in history to be afforded that honour. And while there are no non-white performers up for best actress or best supporting actor, there are two black males up for best actor - Denzel Washington and Britain's Daniel Kaluuya - and another two shortlisted for best supporting actress. Jordan Peele's best director nomination for Get Out is also significant, given he is only the fifth black film-maker to be considered for the award. ""Right now I'm just thinking about everyone who bought a ticket and told someone else to,""Peele tweeted,externalin response to his film's four nominations. ""You did this."" Christopher Plummer has been nominated for playing J Paul Getty in All the Money in the World Eight of this year's female acting contenders are aged over 40, while Christopher Plummer becomes the oldest man to be nominated for best supporting actor for All the Money in the World. Plummer, 88, took over the role of J Paul Getty in Sir Ridley Scott's filmafter the director decided to eraseKevin Spacey's performance as the US billionaire. At 89, meanwhile, Belgian director Agnes Varda - whose film Faces Places is up for best documentary feature - is believed to be the oldest Oscar nominee ever. Varda is a week older than fellow 89-year-old James Ivory, who has been nominated for writing Call Me By Your Name's screenplay. The Academy has recently strived to broaden the ethnic, age and gender make-up of its membership, which may have filtered through to this year's nominations. Yet the Academy still has a long way to go, as a comparison between male and female nominees in some of the key categories attests. Notable firsts include Rachel Morrison's best cinematography nomination for Mudbound, Netflix's drama about racial tension in Mississippi. Morrison, whose other credits include the forthcoming Black Panther, is the first woman ever to receive a nomination in this category. Mary J Blige is up for two awards for her contributions to Mudbound Mudbound's Mary J Blige also makes history by getting nominations for best supporting actress and best song in the same year. The nine-time Grammy winner co-wrote Mighty River for the film, which is also recognised for its adapted screenplay. Mary J Blige makes Oscars history Among those to miss out this year include James Franco, who had been tipped by some to get a best actor nod for The Disaster Artist. The US actor recently became the subject ofsexual harassment allegationswhich may have hurt his chances of an Oscar nomination. London-born Martin McDonagh, Three Billboards' writer-director, is also a surprise omission from the best director line-up. Surprise nominees include Britain's Lesley Manville, up for playing Day-Lewis's sister in fashion-based period piece Phantom Thread. Paul Thomas Anderson's film, also up for best picture, best director and two other awards, did much better than many had expected. The nominations were announced in Los Angeles by British actor Andy Serkis and Girls Trip actress Tiffany Haddish. Jimmy Kimmel will return to host this year's ceremony, to be held on 4 March at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.

Thousands of jobs at risk at Sainsbury'sThe supermarket chain is looking to save Â£500m over the next three years.1h32 minutes agoBusiness,"Thousands of shop floor jobs are at risk as part of a major shake-up at Sainsbury's. The supermarket chain is changing the way it manages its stores across the UK and scrapping some management posts. Sainsbury's would not confirm the number of employees affected by the move but said it was ""in the thousands"". On Monday, the UK's biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, announced it was cutting 1,700 shop floor management jobs. Like the other major grocers, Sainsbury's is trying to cut costs and simplify its plans to save Â£500m over the next three years. Earlier this month, it confirmed it was ""on track"" to achieve Â£185m of cost savings this year, putting it ahead of target. Sainsbury's, which jostles for position as the UK's second-biggest supermarket with Asda, has more than 1,400 stores in the UK. Tesco to cut 1,700 shop floor jobs Sainsbury's boss: 'UK through the worst' The posts will be replaced by fewer, but mostly better paid, new management roles in each store. Employees have the choice of either applying for these new roles or accepting a more junior position if unsuccessful. Otherwise they face redundancy. Simon Roberts, retail and operations director of Sainsbury's, said: ""We're proposing a store management structure that will deliver best in class leadership and, in many cases, will offer an improved reward package for new management roles. ""The proposals will introduce a more efficient and effective structure, designed to meet the challenges of today's retail environment. They will deliver cost savings to be invested in our customer offer and in our colleagues as they continue to provide the very best service for our customers. ""Our intention is not to reduce overall headcount as a result of these proposals. ""I appreciate this will be a difficult time for those affected and we will fully support our people through these changes."" Rival Tesco has said it intends to cut 1,700 jobs from its branches and warehouses as part of its turnaround strategy. However, it also plans to create 900 jobs and said it would try to move staff affected by the cuts into the new roles. Tesco's UK chief executive Matt Davies said the changes were ""necessary to ensure our business remains competitive and set up for the future"". Tesco is aiming to make Â£1.5bn in cost savings over the three years to 2020. Philip Dorrell, managing partner at Retail Remedy, said the ""ongoing stresses"" in the retail sector had been driven by a need to reduce costs in the face of shrinking profit margins. ""They are shrinking as the discounters have fuelled a need to be more competitive on price, at a time when the volumes that the retailers are selling reduce,"" he added. Discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl were picking up much of the business lost by the mainstream supermarkets, he added. As a result, grocers have had to cut costs - and labour is one of their biggest costs. ""Therefore, the stage is set and the decline of the grocers' workforce will continue,"" he said. The Unite union, which represents more than 12,000 members working for Sainsbury's, said the jobs to be scrapped included team leader/store supervisor roles in all branches. There would also be ""major changes"" to the department manager and deputy manager structure, it added. The union said it would seek ""guarantees"" that there would be no compulsory redundancies as a result of the restructuring. ""We appreciate that Sainsbury's has a good record of redeployment of staff in these situations and we will be exploring every avenue to ensure the continuing employment for our members,"" said Unite's Bev Clarkson.

Stations reopened after West End gas leakRoads and rail stations are reopened following a major gas leak just off the Strand.1han hour agoLondon,"Charing Cross Station closed and the Strand shut off due to high levels of natural gas coming from a ruptured main Disruption is continuing after a gas leak closed parts of London's West End. Charing Cross and Waterloo East stations have now reopened after being shut all morning and cordons surrounding the area have been lifted. About 1,450 people were evacuated from a nightclub and hotel after the leak was discovered on Craven Street, just off the Strand, just after 02:00 GMT. A ruptured gas main was responsible, London Fire Brigade said. Gas company Cadent said it had repaired the leak. The Strand and surrounding roads are now open, though rail disruption is likely to continue until 15:00, Network Rail said. Workers in surrounding offices were evacuated as gas levels were said to be ""extremely high"". Passengers were complaining other rail stations are much busier than usual, with one describing London Bridge on Twitter as being like ""a zombie apocalypse"". Southeastern said ""crowd control"" measures were in place at the station. Workers were evacuated from nearby buildings Richard Okyere, 60, works as security officer on the Strand. He told the BBC he was in the building when he was alerted to a smell. ""My colleagues led me to the back of the building. The whole area smelled of gas, and we called the site engineers who came to investigate."" Nearby residents and guests from the hotel were evacuated and sent to a respite centre at Royal Horseguards Hotel in Whitehall Court. Tube passengers affected by the cordon were directed by staff Guests at the Amba Hotel, in the Strand, woke up at 3:30 to an alarm. Some feared it was a terror attack, others looked out of the window to see a police cordon wrapped around the road. Another smelled gas as soon as he woke. Among the guests were a group of colleagues in London for a conference and a senior figure from Blackberry. The hotel was quickly evacuated - so quickly that one woman did not have time to reach for her contact lenses. Guests said it was well-organised, without panic and they followed like sheep to a nearby hotel in Whitehall Court - the Royal Horseguards Hotel. Staff there served tea, coffee and breakfast and found them space in conference rooms and corridors to rest and sleep. Early on there was joking and laughing but as the morning has worn on the 50-or-so tired guests are getting increasingly desperate to get back to their own hotel for a bath and some sleep. Thani Spacey, a personal assistant at an office in the Strand, had completed a 90-minute commute from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex to get to work early. ""I'm frustrated to say the least,"" she said. ""I've just had a text from work but why didn't we hear earlier?"" Valerie Brun, from Chiswick, usually starts work at 7am at a software company on the Strand. ""Surprise, surprise - my building is locked up,"" she said. Revellers at the Heaven nightclub described trying to leave ""as fast as possible"" after they were told to evacuate the building. One said: ""Lots of people trying to leave at the same time. As soon as the word evacuation was heard from security staff everyone was trying to get out as fast as possible.""

US imposes new 'America First' tariffs,"China and South Korea reacted angrily to the move The US has approved controversial tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels. The move is in line with President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy, which aims to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. A spokesman said the administration would ""always defend American workers, farmers, ranchers and businessmen"". But China and South Korea, whose manufacturers will be most heavily affected, criticised the move. US officials said more trade enforcement actions would follow. This video can not be played Donald Trump inauguration: 'America first, America first' Mr Trump has talked about taking the action ever since coming to office. In his inauguration speech a year ago he promised to protect US borders from other countries ""making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs"". The actions are being seen as the president's most significant trade moves since his decision to pull the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal (TPP) and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The tougher policy was approved by President Trump after the US International Trade Commission (ITC) found local manufacturers were being hurt by cheaper imports. Manufacturing companies - Whirlpool, a US-based maker of washing machines, and the solar firms Suniva and Solar World Americas - had complained to the ITC and it found in their favour. The tariffs set on solar panels were lower than domestic US producers had hoped for, butthe duties on washing machines and parts were steeper than expected - adding as much as 50% in some cases,external, according to US documents. Is Trump the WTO's biggest threat? World trade: What will Donald Trump do? What is the World Trade Organization? The first 1.2 million imported large residential washing machines in the first year will have a 20% tariff imposed on them, while there will be a 50% tariff on machines above that number. By the third year, these will drop to 16% and 40% respectively. Figures suggest that in 2010, 1.6 million washing machines were imported to the US,external. Meanwhile, the tariff increase on imported solar cells and modules in the first year will be 30%, falling to 15% by the fourth year, although 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of imported cells - enough for about 11.5 million panels - will be allowed in tariff-free annually. The ITC said that China had been selling ""artificially low-priced"" solar components in the US, assisted by state subsidies. Taylor Kate Brown, BBC News, Washington The Trump administration has imposed these tariffs as part of a larger promise to protect American manufacturing - including the solar industry firms that brought the original complaint to the trade commission. But what the ""solar industry"" means in this context is complicated. The tariffs were opposed by America's largest solar industry group - the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).  SEIA said Suniva and Solarworld had used the complaint to cover for bad business practices - and pointed out the two companies are actually foreign-owned even though the produce panels in the US. SEIA's position was also driven by the fact the group represents thousands of solar installers - an industry that's seen explosive growth, driven in part because of the dropping cost of panels. Firms that specialise in larger solar ""farms"" that sell their energy to US utilities are particularly worried about the decision, as they compete directly with coal, natural gas and wind producers. Ironically, the decision could mean more competition for Suniva and Solarworld, asseveral foreign firms may be interested in moving production to the US,external. US appliance maker Whirlpool, which for years has sought protection against cheaper imports from South Korea and Mexico, welcomed the move. This video can not be played How Sharon turned her life around ""This announcement caps nearly a decade of litigation and will result in new manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee,external,"" chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement. Shares in Whirlpool rose 2.5% on the news, and it immediately announced it would employ 200 more people. Shares in US solar panel manufacturers also went up. Environmentalists argue that making solar panels more expensive risks holding back the development of renewable energy in the country. China and South Korea have reacted angrily to the news. South Korea said it would complain to the World Trade Organization (WTO), calling the tariffs ""excessive"" and ""regrettable"". Its manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, compete in the washing machine market with US firms such as Whirlpool. Samsung called the tariffs ""a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine"". Meanwhile China, the world's biggest solar panel manufacturer, said the move would further damage the global trade environment. China is the US's biggest trading partner and government spokesman Wang Hejun said that Beijing expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with the plans. He warned that ""together with other WTO members, China will resolutely defend its legitimate interests"" adding that the plans ""not only aroused the concern of many trading partners but was also strongly opposed by many local governments and downstream enterprises in the US"".

Stations reopened after West End gas leak,"Charing Cross Station closed and the Strand shut off due to high levels of natural gas coming from a ruptured main Disruption is continuing after a gas leak closed parts of London's West End. Charing Cross and Waterloo East stations have now reopened after being shut all morning and cordons surrounding the area have been lifted. About 1,450 people were evacuated from a nightclub and hotel after the leak was discovered on Craven Street, just off the Strand, just after 02:00 GMT. A ruptured gas main was responsible, London Fire Brigade said. Gas company Cadent said it had repaired the leak. The Strand and surrounding roads are now open, though rail disruption is likely to continue until 15:00, Network Rail said. Workers in surrounding offices were evacuated as gas levels were said to be ""extremely high"". Passengers were complaining other rail stations are much busier than usual, with one describing London Bridge on Twitter as being like ""a zombie apocalypse"". Southeastern said ""crowd control"" measures were in place at the station. Workers were evacuated from nearby buildings Richard Okyere, 60, works as security officer on the Strand. He told the BBC he was in the building when he was alerted to a smell. ""My colleagues led me to the back of the building. The whole area smelled of gas, and we called the site engineers who came to investigate."" Nearby residents and guests from the hotel were evacuated and sent to a respite centre at Royal Horseguards Hotel in Whitehall Court. Tube passengers affected by the cordon were directed by staff Guests at the Amba Hotel, in the Strand, woke up at 3:30 to an alarm. Some feared it was a terror attack, others looked out of the window to see a police cordon wrapped around the road. Another smelled gas as soon as he woke. Among the guests were a group of colleagues in London for a conference and a senior figure from Blackberry. The hotel was quickly evacuated - so quickly that one woman did not have time to reach for her contact lenses. Guests said it was well-organised, without panic and they followed like sheep to a nearby hotel in Whitehall Court - the Royal Horseguards Hotel. Staff there served tea, coffee and breakfast and found them space in conference rooms and corridors to rest and sleep. Early on there was joking and laughing but as the morning has worn on the 50-or-so tired guests are getting increasingly desperate to get back to their own hotel for a bath and some sleep. Thani Spacey, a personal assistant at an office in the Strand, had completed a 90-minute commute from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex to get to work early. ""I'm frustrated to say the least,"" she said. ""I've just had a text from work but why didn't we hear earlier?"" Valerie Brun, from Chiswick, usually starts work at 7am at a software company on the Strand. ""Surprise, surprise - my building is locked up,"" she said. Revellers at the Heaven nightclub described trying to leave ""as fast as possible"" after they were told to evacuate the building. One said: ""Lots of people trying to leave at the same time. As soon as the word evacuation was heard from security staff everyone was trying to get out as fast as possible.""

Neil Diamond retires due to Parkinson's,"Neil Diamond's concert career spanned half a century Singer Neil Diamond has announced he will retire from touring, after a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Diamond, who turns 77 on Wednesday, cancelled his March tour dates for Australia and New Zealand on medical advice. The Solitary Man singer was midway through his 50th anniversary tour. In a statement he said he took the decision ""with great reluctance and disappointment"". ""I have been so honoured to bring my shows to the public for the past 50 years,"" he said. ""My sincerest apologies to everyone who purchased tickets and were planning to come to the upcoming shows."" Parkinson's is a progressive condition in which the brain becomes damaged. It can lead to tremors, difficulty moving, speech changes and eventually memory problems. Neil Diamond joins Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Diamond hopes to continue writing and recording for some time to come, a post on his website reads. As well as his own hits, Diamond wrote the famous Monkees track I'm a Believer ""My thanks goes out to my loyal and devoted audiences around the world,"" he said. ""You will always have my appreciation for your support and encouragement."" With a nod to his hit Sweet Caroline, he added: ""This ride has been 'so good, so good, so good' thanks to you."" Diamond, who has sold over 130 million albums worldwide, is set to receive a lifetime achievement award at Sunday's Grammy Awards. The singer last performed in the UK and Ireland in October as part of the 50th anniversary world tour, but the the onset of Parkinson's disease ""has made it difficult to travel and perform on a large scale basis,"" his official website said. Friends and fans sent their best wishes to the singer on social media as news of his retirement spread. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He recalled the first time he met Ms O'Riordan, telling the congregation that the memory was ""indelibly written on my mind"". ""There she is, sitting at the keyboard, playing and singing with the choir in this lovely Church of Saint Ailbe,"" he said. He said Ms O'Riordan had ""reached out to the world"" and had ""a unique respect for everyone"". ""It is our sincere prayer that our beloved Dolores is now re-united with her father, Terry, her baby brother, Gerard, grandparents, relatives and friends, in the presence of the Lord and Our Lady of Dolours in the heavenly kingdom, where there is no more pain or suffering or separations, but only joy and peace for all eternity,"" he said. ""If tears are shed in heaven - by necessity they are tears of joy. ""Yes, tears of joy, following an excellent performance by Dolores, in the most important and vital gig of all - the gig of life itself."" Canon McNamara offered sympathies to Ms O'Riordan's mother, father, her children and her Cranberries bandmates. Hundreds gathered to pay their respects in her home city of Limerickover the weekend.

In a statement, his family said he had ""passed peacefully"" in Johannesburg ""after a protracted and courageous battle with prostate cancer"".

Africa Live: Tributes paid to 'father of jazz' Obituary: Hugh Masekela This video can not be played Hugh Masekela on music and his relationship with South Africa Born in the South African town of Witbank in 1939, Masekela was inspired to learn the trumpet after seeing Kirk Douglas play Bix Beiderbecke in the 1950 film Young Man with a Horn. He persuaded one of his teachers - the anti-apartheid crusader Father Trevor Huddleston - to buy him an instrument, promising to stay out of trouble in return. He helped open the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with fellow musician Femi Kuti In 1960, aged 21, he left South Africa to begin what would be 30 years in exile from the land of his birth. Under the tutelage of Dizzy Gillespie and Louis Armstrong, he was encouraged to develop his own unique style. In 1967, he performed at the Monterey Pop Festival alongside Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, Ravi Shankar, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. The following year, his instrumental single Grazing in the Grass topped the charts in the US and became a worldwide hit. Listen to Hugh Masekela on Desert Island Discs Masekela returned to South Africa in 1990 following the release of Nelson Mandela, whose freedom he had called for in his 1986 anthem Bring Home Nelson Mandela. In June 2010, he performed at both the opening concert of the Fifa World Cup and the tournament's opening ceremony in Soweto's Soccer City.

The passing of Hugh Masekela is the end of an era and has saddened many across the country. Described as a legend, he was celebrated for his contribution to music, theatre and social and political activism. The jazz musician whose Soweto Blues served as one of the soundtracks to the anti-apartheid movement was never one to shy away from challenging the status quo. In a career spanning six decades, he gained international recognition with his distinctive sound, a constant reminder of his love for South Africa - a country whose political turmoil once forced him into exile. Diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008, the world-acclaimed musician - affectionately known as Bra Hugh - spent the last months of his life encouraging men to go for regular cancer check-ups.

'Two suicide attempts a week' at prison,"The category B prison, near Nottingham city centre, holds about 1,060 inmates A prison officer at a jail described as ""fundamentally unsafe"" claims his colleagues stop two suicides every week. Eight inmates are thought to have killed themselvesat HMP Nottingham in the past two years. Many more inmates attempt suicide, the officer said, but the public does not hear about the lives saved. Justice Secretary David Gauke said he will look at ""the issues faced by the prison"" and publish an action plan. The prison officer contacted the BBC after the chief inspector of prisons issued Mr Gauke with an""urgent notification letter"",external- sent on 17 January - demanding action within 28 days. He said news reports of this were a ""massive kick in the face"" for his colleagues and he wanted to raise awareness of the work they do to prevent the prison from ""turning into a massive riot"". Marc Maltby was found dead in his cell with ""ligature"" marks around his neck on 12 October 2017 The prison officer said there are two suicide attempts at the prison every week, on average. ""We've got a safety tool so we can safely cut the ligature from round people's necks without causing them any harm,"" he said. ""I've done one since I've been here in Nottingham and it's my second one I've done [in my career], and there's nothing scarier in the world, because someone has made an attempt to end their life."" ""It doesn't happen every day but it happens. A couple of times a week we will save somebody's life."" He said the media reports on deaths at Nottingham Prison but not the lives saved. ""They [the media] don't count how many people that we cut ligatures off their neck, how many lives we save, how many people we've saved when they've cut themselves open,"" he said. His claim is supported by the Prison Officers' Association which confirmed suicide attempts are not recorded in official figures. ""It's a local category B prison which is receiving from the courts so you've got people in there who have possibly been in court for the first time, they have the possibility of a big sentence and they are really struggling to cope,"" Jackie Marshall, from the POA, said. ""Beforethe cutting of staff, prison officers had time to sit down and talk to prisoners and quite often they would open up and we could help them, but now staff just don't have the time to talk to prisoners."" More than half of the staff at HMP Nottingham have less than one year's experience The prison officer believes that while HMP Nottingham is ""in a dire place"", it is comparable to other prisons. He previously worked at a prison in the North East and came to Nottingham on a temporary basis eight months ago to help with staffing shortages. Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke noted that more than half of the staff at HMP Nottingham had less than one year's experience and this ""clearly showed in their dealings with prisoners"". The prison officer said many people leave after six months to get jobs outside of the prison service. ""Why would you work in a prison for the money that we're on when you could go and get the same, if not more, in a supermarket?"" he said. He takes home about Â£1,600 a month after deductions. ""Sort the wage out and you will keep the staff. You wouldn't have members of staff with eight, nine or ten years' experience leaving to go and work in a holiday park as a security manager, or in Tesco as a forklift truck driver,"" he said. Prison suicides rise to record level in England and Wales What is going wrong with the prison system? WATCH: Working undercover in a crisis-hit prison Undercover Panorama report reveals prison chaos Jackie Marshall from the POA agrees. ""We've got issues throughout the country with recruiting and it's the same at Nottingham,"" she said. ""They [the government] brought in new pay scales in 2012 which lowered the starting pay for officers. Some of them come in and think it's not worth staying with what they see."" ""They let a lot of experienced staff go when they did the cuts,"" she said. ""They [the government] wanted the new staff in on the new pay scale. And we do have experienced staff leaving now because of what's going on."" As a result, she said, the prison has ""new staff teaching new staff"". About 100 staff were assaulted in six months The prison recorded about 200 assaults in the six months prior to being inspected, and about half of these were against staff. Over two-thirds of the men surveyed at HMP Nottingham said they had felt unsafe at some point during their stay at the prison. ""I can guarantee 100% of members of staff in there have felt unsafe at some point,"" said the prison officer. ""In the last six months I've been assaulted. A couple of weeks after that a prisoner assaulted two members of staff. One was off for a while with concussion, one had a dislocated jaw. ""Nobody knows if you are going toget dragged into a cell like the poor girl in a prisonelsewhere. ""Why would you want to risk your life every single day?"" Ms Marshall said: ""The level of violence faced by staff and prisoner-on-prisoner is horrendous, the self-harm that prisoners are causing themselves and the deaths in custody are horrendous, and staff have seen some terrible things."" Dealing with prisoners who have taken drugs is ""the scariest thing"" The prison officer said multiple staff on one of the wings were ""kicked in the back and punched in the head"" on Christmas Day by prisoners who were drunk on homemade alcohol or ""hooch"". Drugs previously known as legal highs, like Spice and Black Mamba, cause even more problems, he said. ""On a daily basis on my wing alone we are dealing with five, six or seven attacks, where they go into the zombie state, as it's been quoted, and it's the scariest thing in the world,"" he said. ""It's the scariest thing because when you are responding to it you don't know whether you are going to get punched in the face, whether they are going to be sick on you, whether they are going to die."" The prison officer said he is proud of where he works Following an inspection in February 2016,external, the Chief Inspector of Prisons said Nottingham had ""suffered from a lack of continuity and consistency in its leadership"" - having had five governors in four years. The current governor, Tom Wheatley, has been in post since June 2016. ""If they were to get rid of Mr Wheatley who is in charge now it will not get any better. It will only get worse,"" said the prison officer. ""If he was made to leave after this inspection it would be an absolute travesty. He is by far the best governor around. He needs to stay in Nottingham for it to improve."" Despite the problems at the prison, he ""loves"" the work he does. ""I'm very proud of where I work, I love Nottingham prison, I love my job - and no report will change that,"" he said. ""I think 80% of the staff will tell you the same thing, they are proud of Nottingham Prison, they are proud of Governor Wheatley, they are proud of the other members of staff."" Ms Marshall acknowledged Nottingham ""is among the worst"" prisons in the country but singled out Mr Wheatley for praise. ""I think if it wasn't for him they would be facing worse problems than they are now,"" she said. David Gauke MP said staff at HMP Nottingham need support Justice Secretary David Gauke said: ""We have been clear that we should be held to account for the state of our prisons and that is why we introduced this urgent notification process. ""The Chief Inspector has rightly identified the very difficult challenges and circumstances staff at HMP Nottingham are facing and it is clear they need support to help deliver a safer establishment for staff and offenders. ""We have already provided more experienced staff to the prison and boosted the number of prison officers by more than 100. I will be looking closely at the issues faced by the prison and will publish an action plan within 28 days which will urgently drive improvement required.""

Trump boasts of Democrat 'cave-in',"This video can not be played Donald Trump's answerphone message blamed Democrats for the shutdown over the weekend US President Donald Trump has hailed the end of the government shutdown as a ""big win"" for Republicans. The Democratic leadership agreed to back the bill after accepting promises from Republicans for a debate later on the future of young illegal immigrants. Mr Trump said the Democrats ""caved"" as he signed a bill to end the three-day shutdown. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The great deal-making president sat on the sidelines."" Thousands of federal employees who had been placed on temporary, unpaid leave since Saturday prepared to return to work. ""It was essentially a lunch break,"" Tom Chapel, a scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, told Reuters news agency. Winners and losers from the shutdown What does a government shutdown cost? A spending bill that ended the shutdown passed the Senate by a majority of 81-18 and the House of Representatives by 266-150 on Monday. Stocks rose as news of the agreement spread. But the deal is not a long-term solution. It is the fourth temporary measure since October because Capitol Hill cannot agree a longer-term budget. The so-called continuing resolution keeps the government funded until 8 February in the hope that Congress can reach a longer-term budget agreement in the meantime. ""I know there's great relief that this episode is coming to an end,"" said Speaker Paul Ryan. ""But this is not a moment to pat ourselves on the back. Not even close."" Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said his party had ""come to an arrangement"" to negotiate on the Democrats' calls for an immigration deal. Democrats want protections from deportation for so-called Dreamers, more than 700,000 young immigrants brought to the US as children. But Republicans had insisted no agreement was possible while federal government services were closed. Mr Trump, a Republican, said in a statement: ""I am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses. ""We will make a long-term deal on immigration if, and only if, it is good for our country."" He then tweeted that the Democrats had ""caved"", adding that he looked forward to future negotiations.

The White House answerphone message over the weekend blamed Democrats for the shutdown, saying: ""Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today, because Congressional Democrats are holding government funding - including funding for our troops and other national security priorities - hostage to an unrelated immigration debate."" This video can not be played White House and Chuck Schumer trade barbs over shutdown On Twitter, ""Democrats CAVED"" was trending on Monday evening. Democrats voiced scepticism of Mr McConnell's promise and some liberal groups are infuriated by the agreement to reopen the government. Possible Democratic 2020 presidential candidates in the Senate - Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris - all voted against Monday's bill. Senator Harris, of California, said it would be ""foolhardy"" to trust Mr McConnell's promise to take up an immigration bill in the coming weeks. Another California senator, Dianne Feinstein, told The Hill, a political news outlet, she was ""very disappointed"" in the deal because there's no guarantee that Republicans would help Dreamers. Democratic congressman Luis Gutierrez slammed his own party's senators after the vote saying: ""They caved. They blinked. That's what they do."" Stephanie Taylor, of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said: ""Today's cave by Senate Democrats - led by weak-kneed, right-of-centre Democrats - is why people don't believe the Democratic Party stands for anything."" This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown In parliamentary systems, a government that cannot pay the bills does not last long. In 2012, the Dutch government could not agree a budget. The prime minister resigned, elections were held, and a new government formed. Some countries do not even need a government to function. After its 2010 election, Belgium went more than 500 days without elected leadership, but still avoided a shutdown. Taxes were collected, workers were paid, and a caretaker government passed a budget. In France - a semi-presidential system - the constitution sets out what happens when a budget is not passed. The French government shall ""make available by decree the funds needed to meet commitments already voted for"",external, the constitution says. Really, the question is not why other countries do not shut down. It is why the USdoesshut down, even when there is money sloshing round the system. That stems from the early 1980s, whenUS Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti strictly interpreted the 1884 Antideficiency Act in 1980,external. He said, in the event of a funding gap, government agencies should suspend operations - until money was appropriated by Congress.

Hunt apology to patients,"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: I apologise for postponed operations Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has apologised to patients in England who have had their operations postponed. Non-urgent treatments had already been cancelled until mid-January, but NHS England said on Tuesday that would now be extended to the end of the month. It came after hospitals reported they were struggling to cope with the surge in patients being seen since Christmas. At least 17 hospital trusts - one in 10 - have declared a major incident in the last 24 hours, the BBC understands. Bosses said they had been forced into the move as patients were experiencing long waits in A&E and being left on trolleys in corridors because there were no beds available. Some ambulance services have even started asking 999 callers with less serious problems to make their own way to hospital so they can prioritise the most life-threatening calls. Of the decision to cancel operations, Mr Hunt said it was ""absolutely not what I want"". But he said the move was needed given the pressure hospitals were under. ""This is the busiest week of the year for the NHS."" And he also said the whole country was grateful for the work NHS staff were putting in working ""incredibly long hours through the night, beyond the call of duty in every possible way"". This video can not be played Theresa May: The NHS has been better prepared for this winter than ever before His thanks were echoed by Prime Minister Theresa May, who also denied the health service was in crisis.

Problems have also been reported in other parts of the UK. The Welsh government said the health service was facing ""significant pressure"". Meanwhile, in Scotlandthere has been a 20% jump in A&E attendances compared with the previous year, prompting an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, and in Northern Ireland the Antrim Area Hospital has been forced to bring in St John ambulance volunteers to help with a surge in demand. Winter pressure health campaign launched NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter People on beds 'as far as you could see' NHS England's Prof Keith Willett admitted the pressures were severe - the worst he had seen since the 1990s - but said plans were in place. As well as the cancelling of non-urgent treatments, such as knee and hip replacements, hospitals have been given the green light to put patients on mixed sex wards and to bring GPs into A&E to help deal with patients. ""A crisis is when you haven't got in place mitigations and you haven't got a plan to deal with it,"" Prof Willett said. ""We've gone into this winter in a way we've never prepared before."" This video can not be played NHS chief tells Today service is not in crisis but says they may need to cancel more operations in future But Prof Suzanne Mason, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the measures were ""too little too late"" as hospitals simply had no beds free and these treatments would have had to be cancelled anyway. She added: ""Patient safety is being compromised - there's no doubt about that.  When patients are in crowded emergency departments and staff cannot actually move between patients and provide the basic level of care that's required, then safety is compromised. ""Patients who spend many hours on a trolley - and these are often elderly patients - they are the sickest patients in our department. ""They are much more likely to have a poorer outcome and even die as a result of their experience in the emergency department. And that is a huge tragedy for us in our specialty and that's why we are so desperate to see things improve."" This video can not be played Dr Adrian Harrop: ""I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle"" Reports have emerged of serious problems in a number of places over the past 24 hours: Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre has asked patients to avoid its A&E after being deluged on Tuesday evening Southend Hospital said it was dealing with an ""internal critical incident"" with all its beds full, which has led them to call in extra staff A consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust apologised for ""third world conditions"" in his hospital department Milton Keynes University Hospital is telling people only to attend for emergency treatment Two ambulance trusts in the east and north-east of England are on the highest alert A concentration of major incidents declared at hospitals across the West Country and south-east Doctors and nurses have also been speaking about the problems. Dr Adrian Harrop, an A&E doctor at Scarborough Hospital, said he felt he was ""fighting a losing battle"" as he was not able to do his job properly and care for his patients in the way he wanted. Mark Nevison, a senior nurse in the north-east, tweeted he had worked in A&E for 10 years and had ""never been so ashamed of the sub-standard care"" now being offered. Esther Herbert said she couldn't leave her mother before 06:30 the following morning Meanwhile, patients have been talking about their experiences. Esther Herbert accompanied her 87-year-old mother to Worcestershire Royal Hospital before Christmas. ""The doors opened and it was just a sea of people,"" she said. ""There were people on beds all the way down the corridor, as far as you could see."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has blamed the pressures on ""Tory underfunding"".

"Children 'deserve better' healthcareEngland has not made the same strides as Wales and Scotland to improve care, a report says.8h8 hours agoHealth","The health of children in England is being harmed by deepening public sector cuts and ""disjointed"" government policies, a report has found. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the government had failed to improve care in a number of ""fundamental areas"", such as by banning junk food advertising. It said the government had not made the same strides as in Wales and Scotland. The government said ""world-leading plans"" for child health were in place. But the RCPCH called for more to be done, including a bigger focus on preventive measures, which had faced ""destructive"" reductions. Professor Neena Modi, president of the RCPCH, called for ""much bolder"" policies, adding: ""It is no good only throwing money at treating established problems. ""There must be far better investment in prevention, which will reap immeasurable long term benefits."" NHS 'haemorrhaging' nurses as 33,000 leave each year Patients 'dying in hospital corridors' One in eight patients hit by ambulance A&E delays NHS bail-outs 'could become new normal' The RCPCH tracked the progress made by governments in England, Wales and Scotland againstthe different recommendations it set the countries last year in its State of Child Health report,external. At the time, it found child health in the UK was falling behind that of many other European countries. In its follow-up report, the RCPCH said central government had made less progress on its recommendations compared with its counterparts in Wales and Scotland. It found that England had made progress in some areas - including the launch of a digital child health strategy, a new tobacco control plan and the implementation of the sugar tax. Sugar tax: How will it work? NHS plans 'sugar tax' in hospital cafes However, the organisation said the health and wellbeing of children in the country remained ""largely unchanged"" and no improvement had been made in a number of ""fundamental areas"", including on banning junk food advertising and investing in child health research. England was also the only country that had a worsened performance against one of its recommendations - to freeze public health cuts. The RCPCH said data (from a King's Fund think tank analysis) showed councils would spend only Â£2.52bn on public health services in 2017-18 compared with Â£2.60bn the previous year. The report highlighted Scotland passing its Child Poverty Act Prof Russell Viner, RCPCH officer for health promotion, said: ""Child health isn't being given the political attention it deserves in Westminster, which is disappointing given the real commitments from the Scottish and Welsh governments."" The RCPCH report points to Scotland passing its Child Poverty Act and Wales opening a centre for child health research, as examples of the progress the countries were making. Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association, said: ""Public health services play a vital role in improving the health of children, young people and adults, reducing the need for treatment later down the line and easing the pressure on the NHS. ""Unless this is properly funded, it will put services at risk  which are vital in supporting the health and development of babies, children and families."" Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: ""This report is a stark reminder that there are over two million children with health-related vulnerabilities being let down by an underfunded and overstretched health system."" A government official said: ""There is always more to do, but we have world-leading plans in place to safeguard child health by combating obesity, improving mental health and vaccinating against some of the world's deadliest diseases. ""In the past year, both teen pregnancy and child mortality have both fallen to all-time lows, and our soft drinks levy is already funding additional breakfast clubs and sports.""

Neil Diamond retires over Parkinson's,"Neil Diamond's concert career spanned half a century Singer Neil Diamond has announced he will retire from touring, after a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Diamond, who turns 77 on Wednesday, cancelled his March tour dates for Australia and New Zealand on medical advice. The Solitary Man singer was midway through his 50th anniversary tour. In a statement he said he took the decision ""with great reluctance and disappointment"". ""I have been so honoured to bring my shows to the public for the past 50 years,"" he said. ""My sincerest apologies to everyone who purchased tickets and were planning to come to the upcoming shows."" Parkinson's is a progressive condition in which the brain becomes damaged.

US shutdown ends as Congress passes bill,"This video can not be played White House and Chuck Schumer trade barbs over shutdown The US government partial shutdown is ending after Republicans and Democrats voted for a temporary funding bill. The Democratic leadership agreed to back the bill after accepting promises from Republicans for a debate later on the future of young illegal immigrants. President Donald Trump, who signed the bill on Monday evening, took a swipe at Democrats. It is the fourth temporary measure since October because Capitol Hill cannot agree a longer-term budget. The spending bill passed the Senate by 81-18 and the House of Representatives by 266-150 earlier on Monday. What does a government shutdown cost? White House voicemail blames Democrats The so-called continuing resolution keeps the government funded until 8 February in the hope that Congress can reach a longer-term budget agreement in the meantime. Thousands of federal employees who had been placed on temporary, unpaid leave since Saturday breathed a sigh of relief. ""It was essentially a lunch break,"" Tom Chapel, a scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, told Reuters news agency. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said his party had ""come to an arrangement"" to negotiate on the Democrats' calls for an immigration deal. Democrats want protections from deportation for so-called Dreamers, more than 700,000 young immigrants brought to the US as children. But Republicans had insisted no agreement was possible while federal government services were closed. President Trump, a Republican, said in a statement: ""I am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses. ""We will make a long-term deal on immigration if, and only if, it is good for our country."" Democrats voiced scepticism of Mr McConnell's promise and some liberal groups are infuriated by the agreement to reopen the government. Possible Democratic 2020 presidential candidates in the Senate - Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris - all voted against Monday's bill. Senator Harris, of California, said it would be ""foolhardy"" to trust Mr McConnell's promise to take up an immigration bill in the coming weeks. Another California senator, Dianne Feinstein, told The Hill, a political news outlet, she was ""very disappointed"" in the deal because there's no guarantee that Republicans would help Dreamers. Democratic congressman Luis Gutierrez slammed his own party's senators after the vote saying: ""They caved. They blinked. That's what they do."" On Twitter, ""Democrats CAVED"" was trending on Monday evening. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer accused President Trump of failing to help reach a deal. ""The great deal-making president sat on the sidelines,"" he said. But many have expressed dissatisfaction with Mr Schumer's handling of the shutdown, which began on midnight on Friday. ""It's Schumer's job to lead and keep his caucus together to fight for progressive values, and he didn't do it,"" said Ezra Levin, co-executive director of the activist group Indivisible. Stephanie Taylor, of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said: ""Today's cave by Senate Democrats - led by weak-kneed, right-of-centre Democrats - is why people don't believe the Democratic Party stands for anything."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The shutdown is over, but the immigration and budget battles rage on. Both sides will try to claim victory, with varying degrees of success. Republicans are thrilled that - unlike past shutdown fights - they emerged relatively unscathed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised an open debate and vote on protections for so-called Dreamers, but in reality that could go by the wayside if, three weeks hence, Democrats force another shutdown. Democrats, on the other hand, can claim that they took a confrontational stand - at least for a few days - on an issue dear to their base's heart. Whether that's enough to satisfy the progressive hard-liners and grassroots activists is in doubt, however. A key tell is that nearly every 2020 presidential hopeful among their number voted against re-opening. For them, Mr McConnell's guarantees are written in sand. Meanwhile, Donald Trump was largely sidelined through the process. Democrats, and even some Republicans, complained he was impossible to pin down and unclear about his priorities. Still, a few days out of the spotlight may not have been all bad. The American public will probably forget this long-weekend shutdown before too long. The next fight, looming only weeks away, might be different. Winners and losers from the shutdown This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown In parliamentary systems, a government that can't pay the bills doesn't last long. In 2012, for example, the Dutch governmentcouldn't agree a budget.The prime minister resigned, elections were held, and a new government formed. Some countries don't even need a government to function. After its 2010 election, Belgium went more than 500 days without elected leadership, but still avoided a shutdown. This video can not be played Donald Trump's shutdown voicemail Taxes were collected, workers were paid, and acaretaker government passed a budget. In France - a semi-presidential system - the constitution sets out what happens when a budget isn't passed. The government, it says, shall""make available by decree the funds needed to meet commitments already voted for"",external. Really, the question isn't why other countries don't shutdown. It's why the USdoesshutdown, even when there's money sloshing round the system. That stems from 1980 and 1981, whenUS Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti strictly interpreted,externalthe 1884 Antideficiency Act. He said, in the event of a funding gap, government agencies should suspend operations - until money was appropriated by Congress.

Netflix tunes into subscriber surgeThe streaming service adds more than 8 million members in the last three months of 2017.8h8 hours agoBusiness,"Claire Foy and Matt Smith star in Netflix drama The Crown Netflix membership surged past 117 million last year, a rise the company said showed its investment in original programming was paying off. The streaming juggernaut added a record 8.3 million streaming subscribers in the three months to December, with 6.36 million of those outside the US. Viewers were attracted by new seasons of shows including The Crown. However, it wrote off $39m for ""unreleased content"" understood to feature disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. Netflix cut ties with the star of House of Cards, one of its first big hits, after he was accused of sexual misconduct last year. The companytemporarily halted production of House of Cardsto write out Spacey's character and decided not to release the film Gore, which starred the actor as writer Gore Vidal. Revenue rose almost a third to about $3.3bn in the fourth quarter, while profits were $186m - almost three times the figure for the same period in 2016. Netflix called it a ""beautiful quarter"", adding: ""We believe our big investments in content are paying off."" The subscriber figures were the first since it raised prices in October. Althoughprevious increases have hurt growth, they appeared to have little effect this time. The rise and rise of Netflix Netflix to raise prices in UK and US Netflix has been pouring cash into original shows such as Glow and Black Mirror, and the action film Bright starring Will Smith. It plans to spend as much as $8bn on content this year, with more than a quarter devoted to original programming. Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda at the season four premiere of Netflix's Grace and Frankie last month Much of the new material is aimed at international subscribers, who outstripped US members for the first time last year and now account for about 53% of the total. Netflix, which is available in more than 190 countries, said it is planning more than 30 original international programmes this year, including projects from France, Poland, India, Korea and Japan. On Monday, it said the first episodes of Juventus, about the Italian football club, would be available in February. Netflix, which pioneered online streaming, said the average member spent 9% more time watching Netflix last year than in 2016. The growth is a sign of broader trends, as customers opt for online entertainment and switch away from more expensive pay-TV subscriptions. Netflix's original programmes are meant to counteract the threat as other production companies raise the prices they charge for their shows. Some, as inthe case of Disney, are preparing to pull programming from the platform and set up their own streaming service in a bid to stay competitive. Netflix says it thinks there is room in the market for multiple services. It has also been striking deals with internet and mobile phone companies to include Netflix as part of monthly packages.

US imposes new 'America First' tariffsProducers in China and South Korea will be hit hardest by President Trump's trade moves.5m6 minutes agoBusiness,"China and South Korea reacted angrily to the move The US has approved controversial tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels. The move is in line with President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy, which aims to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. A spokesman said the administration would ""always defend American workers, farmers, ranchers and businessmen"". But China and South Korea, whose manufacturers will be most heavily affected, criticised the move. US officials said more trade enforcement actions would follow. This video can not be played Donald Trump inauguration: 'America first, America first' Mr Trump has talked about taking the action ever since coming to office. In his inauguration speech a year ago he promised to protect US borders from other countries ""making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs"". The actions are being seen as the president's most significant trade moves since his decision to pull the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal (TPP) and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The tougher policy was approved by President Trump after the US International Trade Commission (ITC) found local manufacturers were being hurt by cheaper imports. Manufacturing companies - Whirlpool, a US-based maker of washing machines, and the solar firms Suniva and Solar World Americas - had complained to the ITC and it found in their favour. The tariffs set on solar panels were lower than domestic US producers had hoped for, butthe duties on washing machines and parts were steeper than expected - adding as much as 50% in some cases,external, according to US documents. Is Trump the WTO's biggest threat? World trade: What will Donald Trump do? What is the World Trade Organization? The first 1.2 million imported large residential washing machines in the first year will have a 20% tariff imposed on them, while there will be a 50% tariff on machines above that number. By the third year, these will drop to 16% and 40% respectively. Figures suggest that in 2010, 1.6 million washing machines were imported to the US,external. Meanwhile, the tariff increase on imported solar cells and modules in the first year will be 30%, falling to 15% by the fourth year, although 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of imported cells - enough for about 11.5 million panels - will be allowed in tariff-free annually. The ITC said that China had been selling ""artificially low-priced"" solar components in the US, assisted by state subsidies. Taylor Kate Brown, BBC News, Washington The Trump administration has imposed these tariffs as part of a larger promise to protect American manufacturing - including the solar industry firms that brought the original complaint to the trade commission. But what the ""solar industry"" means in this context is complicated. The tariffs were opposed by America's largest solar industry group - the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).  SEIA said Suniva and Solarworld had used the complaint to cover for bad business practices - and pointed out the two companies are actually foreign-owned even though the produce panels in the US. SEIA's position was also driven by the fact the group represents thousands of solar installers - an industry that's seen explosive growth, driven in part because of the dropping cost of panels. Firms that specialise in larger solar ""farms"" that sell their energy to US utilities are particularly worried about the decision, as they compete directly with coal, natural gas and wind producers. Ironically, the decision could mean more competition for Suniva and Solarworld, asseveral foreign firms may be interested in moving production to the US,external. US appliance maker Whirlpool, which for years has sought protection against cheaper imports from South Korea and Mexico, welcomed the move. This video can not be played How Sharon turned her life around ""This announcement caps nearly a decade of litigation and will result in new manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee,external,"" chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement. Shares in Whirlpool rose 2.5% on the news, and it immediately announced it would employ 200 more people. Shares in US solar panel manufacturers also went up. Environmentalists argue that making solar panels more expensive risks holding back the development of renewable energy in the country. China and South Korea have reacted angrily to the news. South Korea said it would complain to the World Trade Organization (WTO), calling the tariffs ""excessive"" and ""regrettable"". Its manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, compete in the washing machine market with US firms such as Whirlpool. Samsung called the tariffs ""a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine"". Meanwhile China, the world's biggest solar panel manufacturer, said the move would further damage the global trade environment. China is the US's biggest trading partner and government spokesman Wang Hejun said that Beijing expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with the plans. He warned that ""together with other WTO members, China will resolutely defend its legitimate interests"" adding that the plans ""not only aroused the concern of many trading partners but was also strongly opposed by many local governments and downstream enterprises in the US"".

US imposes new 'America First' tariffsProducers in China and South Korea will be hit hardest by President Trump's trade moves.3m3 minutes ago,"China and South Korea reacted angrily to the move The US has approved controversial tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels. The move is in line with President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy, which aims to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. A spokesman said the administration would ""always defend American workers, farmers, ranchers and businessmen"". But China and South Korea, whose manufacturers will be most heavily affected, criticised the move. US officials said more trade enforcement actions would follow. This video can not be played Donald Trump inauguration: 'America first, America first' Mr Trump has talked about taking the action ever since coming to office. In his inauguration speech a year ago he promised to protect US borders from other countries ""making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs"". The actions are being seen as the president's most significant trade moves since his decision to pull the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal (TPP) and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The tougher policy was approved by President Trump after the US International Trade Commission (ITC) found local manufacturers were being hurt by cheaper imports. Manufacturing companies - Whirlpool, a US-based maker of washing machines, and the solar firms Suniva and Solar World Americas - had complained to the ITC and it found in their favour. The tariffs set on solar panels were lower than domestic US producers had hoped for, butthe duties on washing machines and parts were steeper than expected - adding as much as 50% in some cases,external, according to US documents. Is Trump the WTO's biggest threat? World trade: What will Donald Trump do? What is the World Trade Organization? The first 1.2 million imported large residential washing machines in the first year will have a 20% tariff imposed on them, while there will be a 50% tariff on machines above that number. By the third year, these will drop to 16% and 40% respectively. Figures suggest that in 2010, 1.6 million washing machines were imported to the US,external. Meanwhile, the tariff increase on imported solar cells and modules in the first year will be 30%, falling to 15% by the fourth year, although 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of imported cells - enough for about 11.5 million panels - will be allowed in tariff-free annually. The ITC said that China had been selling ""artificially low-priced"" solar components in the US, assisted by state subsidies. Taylor Kate Brown, BBC News, Washington The Trump administration has imposed these tariffs as part of a larger promise to protect American manufacturing - including the solar industry firms that brought the original complaint to the trade commission. But what the ""solar industry"" means in this context is complicated. The tariffs were opposed by America's largest solar industry group - the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).  SEIA said Suniva and Solarworld had used the complaint to cover for bad business practices - and pointed out the two companies are actually foreign-owned even though the produce panels in the US. SEIA's position was also driven by the fact the group represents thousands of solar installers - an industry that's seen explosive growth, driven in part because of the dropping cost of panels. Firms that specialise in larger solar ""farms"" that sell their energy to US utilities are particularly worried about the decision, as they compete directly with coal, natural gas and wind producers. Ironically, the decision could mean more competition for Suniva and Solarworld, asseveral foreign firms may be interested in moving production to the US,external. US appliance maker Whirlpool, which for years has sought protection against cheaper imports from South Korea and Mexico, welcomed the move. This video can not be played How Sharon turned her life around ""This announcement caps nearly a decade of litigation and will result in new manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee,external,"" chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement. Shares in Whirlpool rose 2.5% on the news, and it immediately announced it would employ 200 more people. Shares in US solar panel manufacturers also went up. Environmentalists argue that making solar panels more expensive risks holding back the development of renewable energy in the country. China and South Korea have reacted angrily to the news. South Korea said it would complain to the World Trade Organization (WTO), calling the tariffs ""excessive"" and ""regrettable"". Its manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, compete in the washing machine market with US firms such as Whirlpool. Samsung called the tariffs ""a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine"". Meanwhile China, the world's biggest solar panel manufacturer, said the move would further damage the global trade environment. China is the US's biggest trading partner and government spokesman Wang Hejun said that Beijing expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with the plans. He warned that ""together with other WTO members, China will resolutely defend its legitimate interests"" adding that the plans ""not only aroused the concern of many trading partners but was also strongly opposed by many local governments and downstream enterprises in the US"".

Children 'deserve better' healthcare,"The health of children in England is being harmed by deepening public sector cuts and ""disjointed"" government policies, a report has found.

It said the government had not made the same strides as in Wales and Scotland. The government said ""world-leading plans"" for child health were in place. But the RCPCH called for more to be done, including a bigger focus on preventive measures, which had faced ""destructive"" reductions.

Sky-Fox deal 'not in public interest'The regulator says the deal would give the Murdoch family too much control over news providers in the UK.9m9 minutes agoBusiness,"Fox's proposed takeover of Sky is not in the public interest on grounds of media plurality, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said. The CMA has provisionally found,externalthat if the deal went ahead as planned, it would give the Murdoch family too much control over news providers in the UK. However, the CMA found the deal would not be against the public interest on the grounds of broadcasting standards. Disney has agreed to buy most of Fox's business, so may end up owning Sky. Disney's proposed takeover, which still has to be approved by US regulators,includes Fox's current 39% stake in Sky. And if the Sky-Fox deal does finally go through, the whole of Sky would be likely to transfer to Disney's ownership. Fox has been trying to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not currently own. But the CMA decided that if this happened, the Murdoch Family Trust (MFT)'s control across all media platforms in the UK would give it too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda. However, one of Sky's senior directors was still confident that the regulator's preliminary decision was not the end of the deal. Sir Martin Gilbert, Sky's senior independent director, told the BBC: ""It still seems likely that Sky can offer concessions that will see this deal go through."" BBC Business Editor Simon Jack said some investors might favour one of those options - closing the loss-making Sky News - as it might allow shareholders to ask for a higher price from Disney. What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal? The cunning Fox and the mighty Mouse Sky threatens to shut down Sky News to aid Fox takeover The Murdoch family's news outlets are currently consumed by nearly a third of the UK's population across TV, radio, online and newspapers. That is significantly greater than all other news providers, except the BBC and ITV. In a statement, Fox said,externalit was ""disappointed"" by the findings. It added: ""We will continue to engage with the CMA ahead of the publication of its final report in May. ""We welcome the CMA's provisional finding that the company has a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards and the transaction would not be against the public interest in this respect."" Sky said that it noted the CMA verdicts,externalon both sets of grounds and that it ""had set out possible remedies"" around plurality ""and is seeking submissions on these"". The CMA also concluded that Fox had a ""genuine commitment to broadcasting standards in the UK"" and was established in the country. It added that Sky also had a good record with ""comprehensive and effective policies and procedures"" to ensure the quality of its broadcasts. The CMA also considered recent allegations of sexual harassment against Fox News employees in the USA, but provisionally found these were not directly related to the attainment of broadcasting standards. Critics of Rupert Murdoch have never been shy to speak out against him, and the CMA has provided them with a killer quote they will be singing for years to come. In saying that full control of Sky would give the Murdoch Family Trust excessive ""influence over public opinion and the political agenda"", the regulator has delighted those who argued against an earlier bid by the Murdochs, nearly seven years ago, which was of course derailed by the phone-hacking inquiry. But this is a curious story, because the CMA findings could prove redundant. They want remedies, mainly around editorial independence for Sky News, which could be provided quite easily by Disney, who may well own Sky in a few months' time. Disney's bid for Fox - the parent to Sky - is currently mired in a US regulatory process. If US regulators approve it, many of the concerns the CMA have about this deal will fall away. So it all comes down to whether Disney is committed to Sky - and specifically Sky News which, though a world-class product, is loss-making. Ironically, the bigger threat to media plurality may come from Disney deciding Sky News is an expensive distraction to their focus on entertainment. For now, that seems unlikely: Bob Iger, the boss of Disney, said he was committed to Sky News. Staff there - and all those who care for a diversity of thought in British media - will hope to hear more from Mr Iger soon. Disney agreed to buy the majority of 21st Century Fox's business last month, including its 39% stake in Sky. At the time, the BBC understood that the deal would not alter the CMA investigation into Fox's proposed takeover of Sky. Disney and Fox hope their deal will be completed by the middle of 2019, after the Sky-Fox deal, although it still has to be approved by US regulators. The CMA said that as a result of the timings, it could not consider the Disney deal when assessing the Sky-Fox deal, but did suggest that its implications could be considered among possible remedies to the transaction. The CMA's three remedy approaches to address the plurality concerns are: stopping the deal going through spinning off or selling off Sky News insulating Sky News from the MFT's influence Anne Lambert, chairwoman of the CMA's independent investigation group, said: ""Media plurality goes to the heart of our democratic process. ""It is very important that no group or individual should have too much control of our news media or too much power to affect the political agenda."" The process now moves to a three-week public consultation where the CMA will receive responses to its provisional ruling, a spokesman told the BBC. After that, it will incorporate the responses into a final report, which will be sent to new Culture Secretary Matt Hancock by 1 May. He then has 30 working days to make the final decision as to whether or not the deal will go ahead. What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal?

West End gas leak causes travel chaos,"Charing Cross Station closed and the Strand shut off due to high levels of natural gas coming from a ruptured main Disruption is continuing after a gas leak closed parts of London's West End. Charing Cross and Waterloo East stations have now reopened after being shut all morning and cordons surrounding the area have been lifted. About 1,450 people were evacuated from a nightclub and hotel after the leak was discovered on Craven Street, just off the Strand, just after 02:00 GMT. A ruptured gas main was responsible, London Fire Brigade said. Gas company Cadent said it had repaired the leak. The Strand and surrounding roads are now open, though rail disruption is likely to continue until 15:00, Network Rail said. Workers in surrounding offices were evacuated as gas levels were said to be ""extremely high"". Passengers were complaining other rail stations are much busier than usual, with one describing London Bridge on Twitter as being like ""a zombie apocalypse"". Southeastern said ""crowd control"" measures were in place at the station. Workers were evacuated from nearby buildings Richard Okyere, 60, works as security officer on the Strand. He told the BBC he was in the building when he was alerted to a smell. ""My colleagues led me to the back of the building. The whole area smelled of gas, and we called the site engineers who came to investigate."" Nearby residents and guests from the hotel were evacuated and sent to a respite centre at Royal Horseguards Hotel in Whitehall Court. Tube passengers affected by the cordon were directed by staff Guests at the Amba Hotel, in the Strand, woke up at 3:30 to an alarm. Some feared it was a terror attack, others looked out of the window to see a police cordon wrapped around the road. Another smelled gas as soon as he woke. Among the guests were a group of colleagues in London for a conference and a senior figure from Blackberry. The hotel was quickly evacuated - so quickly that one woman did not have time to reach for her contact lenses. Guests said it was well-organised, without panic and they followed like sheep to a nearby hotel in Whitehall Court - the Royal Horseguards Hotel. Staff there served tea, coffee and breakfast and found them space in conference rooms and corridors to rest and sleep. Early on there was joking and laughing but as the morning has worn on the 50-or-so tired guests are getting increasingly desperate to get back to their own hotel for a bath and some sleep. Thani Spacey, a personal assistant at an office in the Strand, had completed a 90-minute commute from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex to get to work early. ""I'm frustrated to say the least,"" she said. ""I've just had a text from work but why didn't we hear earlier?"" Valerie Brun, from Chiswick, usually starts work at 7am at a software company on the Strand. ""Surprise, surprise - my building is locked up,"" she said. Revellers at the Heaven nightclub described trying to leave ""as fast as possible"" after they were told to evacuate the building. One said: ""Lots of people trying to leave at the same time. As soon as the word evacuation was heard from security staff everyone was trying to get out as fast as possible.""

Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: ""This report is a stark reminder that there are over two million children with health-related vulnerabilities being let down by an underfunded and overstretched health system."" A government official said: ""There is always more to do, but we have world-leading plans in place to safeguard child health by combating obesity, improving mental health and vaccinating against some of the world's deadliest diseases.

Netflix tunes into subscriber surge,"Claire Foy and Matt Smith star in Netflix drama The Crown Netflix membership surged past 117 million last year, a rise the company said showed its investment in original programming was paying off. The streaming juggernaut added a record 8.3 million streaming subscribers in the three months to December, with 6.36 million of those outside the US. Viewers were attracted by new seasons of shows including The Crown. However, it wrote off $39m for ""unreleased content"" understood to feature disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. Netflix cut ties with the star of House of Cards, one of its first big hits, after he was accused of sexual misconduct last year. The companytemporarily halted production of House of Cardsto write out Spacey's character and decided not to release the film Gore, which starred the actor as writer Gore Vidal. Revenue rose almost a third to about $3.3bn in the fourth quarter, while profits were $186m - almost three times the figure for the same period in 2016. Netflix called it a ""beautiful quarter"", adding: ""We believe our big investments in content are paying off."" The subscriber figures were the first since it raised prices in October. Althoughprevious increases have hurt growth, they appeared to have little effect this time. The rise and rise of Netflix Netflix to raise prices in UK and US Netflix has been pouring cash into original shows such as Glow and Black Mirror, and the action film Bright starring Will Smith. It plans to spend as much as $8bn on content this year, with more than a quarter devoted to original programming. Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda at the season four premiere of Netflix's Grace and Frankie last month Much of the new material is aimed at international subscribers, who outstripped US members for the first time last year and now account for about 53% of the total. Netflix, which is available in more than 190 countries, said it is planning more than 30 original international programmes this year, including projects from France, Poland, India, Korea and Japan. On Monday, it said the first episodes of Juventus, about the Italian football club, would be available in February. Netflix, which pioneered online streaming, said the average member spent 9% more time watching Netflix last year than in 2016. The growth is a sign of broader trends, as customers opt for online entertainment and switch away from more expensive pay-TV subscriptions. Netflix's original programmes are meant to counteract the threat as other production companies raise the prices they charge for their shows. Some, as inthe case of Disney, are preparing to pull programming from the platform and set up their own streaming service in a bid to stay competitive. Netflix says it thinks there is room in the market for multiple services. It has also been striking deals with internet and mobile phone companies to include Netflix as part of monthly packages.

Johnson to push for more cash for NHS,"This video can not be played Hammond: Boris Johnson is foreign secretary (not health secretary) Theresa May has called for discussions about future NHS funding to remain private after Boris Johnson publicly called for more money after Brexit. Before Tuesday's cabinet meeting, it was widely reported that the foreign secretary would pitch for a Â£100m a week ""Brexit dividend"" for the NHS. The BBC understands he did not end up mentioning ""specific figures"". No 10 said Mrs May chaired a discussion on post-Brexit funding options but made clear conversations should be private. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM's remarks on the need for confidentiality were ""pointed"". However, she said Mr Johnson was backed by some colleagues while the principle that the NHS would get some of the money which will become available after the UK leaves in March 2019 was agreed. Jeremy Hunt told the cabinet meeting the NHS was facing ""significant"" demand pressures In the run-up to Tuesday's cabinet meeting - in which Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt gave an update on the ""significant"" winter pressures"" facing the NHS - it was reported that Mr Johnson wanted to kick start a wider debate about NHS funding. In a highly unusual move, sources told the BBC Mr Johnson would not only call for a Â£5bn annual injection of funding after Brexit but warn his party against ""abandoning the territory"" to Labour, which vowed at last year's election to spend Â£37bn more over the next five years. If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. A source close to Mr Johnson said he was frustrated at what he perceived as Downing Street's lack of action on the issue given the levels of public anxiety about how the NHS is faring. During the referendum campaign, Vote Leave - of which Mr Johnson was a leading supporter - claimed Â£350m went to the EU each week and money could instead go to the NHS, a claim he has repeatedly defended since.

However, when it came to it, the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said neither Mr Johnson nor any other minister raised a specific figure during what No 10 said was a ""wide ranging"" hour-long discussion. Firmly, in one sense. A No 10 spokesman said the prime minister and ""a large number of Cabinet ministers"" had made clear that their discussions should take place in private. On the broader political point, Downing Street said the PM reminded ministers that the government has repeatedly said contributions to the EU budget which end after Brexit would be able to be spent on domestic priorities including the NHS.

Kuenssberg: Why is Johnson calling for more NHS cash? Hunt sorry as A&Es struggle to cope NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter In a further rebuff to Mr Johnson, Chancellor Philip Hammond said he had given the NHS an extra Â£6bn in November's Budget, including Â£2.8bn to be spent over the next two years, Mr Hammond, who was in Brussels for a meeting of EU finance ministers, told reporters Mr Johnson was ""the foreign secretary"" not health secretary and the right time to revisit the long-term issue of NHS spending was at the next departmental spending review expected early next year. This video can not be played BBC gains exclusive access to A&E at University Hospital of North Tees No, far from it. The BBC understands that Chris Grayling and Michael Gove were among other cabinet ministers to rally round Mr Johnson at Tuesday's meeting. Growing numbers of Tory MPs are openly expressing their frustration with what they say is No 10's unwillingness to confront the long-term financial challenges facing the health service. Conservative MP Mark Pritchard told the BBC News Channel the foreign secretary was right to speak out. ""I support Boris, he's right. But I think whether it's Boris or Theresa May or Jeremy Hunt, in the longer term there needs to be political leadership about how we fund the NHS going forward in the twenty-first century."" As for Jeremy Hunt, he said no health secretary would ""not support potential extra resources"" for the NHS. Asked how he felt about Mr Johnson being the one to make the case, he said there was ""a Brexit debate and an NHS debate and just occasionally these two debates come together"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said he welcomed calls for more funding but accused Mr Johnson of seeking to ""weaponise"" the NHS for his own ""tedious political games"". ""If the government was really serious about putting money into the NHS, they would have done it in the Budget last autumn,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show. ""We did not hear a peep from him then."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies - a think tank - has said the UK will almost certainly have to increase the share of income devoted to health funding to deal with demographic challenges. Its director Paul Johnson said ""that will mean higher taxes"" and ""governments will need to explain that honestly"". Lib Dem leader Vince Cable suggested Mr Johnson and his colleagues begin this process now. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Kuenssberg: What is Johnson's motive?,"It won't be the first time that Boris Johnson has called for more cash for the NHS. Depending on the flavour of your own views, his promise during the referendum of an extra Â£350m  for the NHS was either an entirely sensible and publicly appealing promise of how we should spend the EU membership fees that may (eventually) come back to the country after we leave, or a classic piece of political sleight of hand. Frankly, we have all discussed that one enough for most people's liking. Labour is calling for an additional Â£5bn to be pumped into the NHS straight away. But this week, even though he was not in charge of the NHS when I last looked, Mr Johnson is expected to make the call at cabinet for an extra Â£100m a week for the NHS in England, and a more vigorous approach to the politics of the service. Sources close to him suggest the foreign secretary thinks ""Number 10 is abandoning the territory"". He is not the only government minister who is worried that Theresa May isn't paying enough political attention to the travails of the health service. Other Brexiteers, like Michael Gove, are understood to share some of his fears. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is not, sources say, working in concert with Mr Johnson, but is also known to be privately making the case for more cash. The health secretary is thought to share Mr Johnson's concerns Others may well agree, even if Mr Johnson's likely intervention at cabinet might ruffle a few feathers. A cabinet minister, not in the usual Brexit camp, told me ""everyone says privately that something has to change,"" adding: ""We have to offer a reason why we should run it (the NHS), not just be in a bidding war with the Labour Party."" Number 10 says the NHS was given ""top priority"" in the last Budget, with extra funding where other government departments' calls largely fell on deaf ears. With no majority, and their limits on public spending, the government has little room for manoeuvre. But growing numbers of Tory MPs are openly expressing their frustration with Number 10's handling of the NHS, particularly, the prime minister's response to calls for a cross party commission to tackle the long term challenges it faces. There are several factors stirring the pot. There is a desire among Brexiteers, not least Mr Johnson, to be seen to be at least trying to aim to keep the big promise they made during the referendum in 2016. There is the genuine concern felt by MPs from all political parties, and prominent Tories, like Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the health select committee, about the future of the health service. The NHS is always just about at the top of voters' list of priorities - and the perceived lack of action is heightening anxiety about Theresa May's leadership more generally. The NHS is always a top priority for voters One senior Tory MP told the BBC ""we all know the problem - it is at the centre there is no decision making"". A former minister said ""more and more people are saying, we can't have another year like this"". Even normally loyal MPs, like Nicholas Soames, are on somewhat itchy form. After the former minister Nick Boles criticised Mrs May's ""timidity"" -saying the government was full of ""boiled rabbits"",external(a phrase borrowed from George Orwell) - Mr Soames wrote on Twitter, 'where is the bold and brave, so far it is dull, dull, dull'. Another MP described Theresa May unflatteringly as a ""Soviet leader who goes up to the window to be seen but no one is quite sure if they are alive"". It doesn't seem likely that Mr Johnson's likely intervention at cabinet will suddenly provoke Number 10 to make a dramatic move on the NHS. Money, and political capital in the Tory Party are in very short supply. And just as there are cabinet ministers who may swing behind him in agreement, it is possible that his intervention may rankle others too. Who knows, it's possible that the foreign secretary may (unusually, you might say) decide to keep his counsel. Increasingly though it is harder for Theresa May to avoid this conversation. It's not just the NHS, but the prime minister and the Conservatives, that are under winter pressure.

"Thousands evacuated over West End gas leakApproximately 1,450 people were evacuated from a nightclub and hotel after the leak was discovered.6m7 minutes agoLondon","Charing Cross Station closed and the Strand shut off due to high levels of natural gas coming from a ruptured main Disruption is continuing after a gas leak closed parts of London's West End. Charing Cross and Waterloo East stations have now reopened after being shut all morning and cordons surrounding the area have been lifted. About 1,450 people were evacuated from a nightclub and hotel after the leak was discovered on Craven Street, just off the Strand, just after 02:00 GMT. A ruptured gas main was responsible, London Fire Brigade said. Gas company Cadent said it had repaired the leak. The Strand and surrounding roads are now open, though rail disruption is likely to continue until 15:00, Network Rail said. Workers in surrounding offices were evacuated as gas levels were said to be ""extremely high"". Passengers were complaining other rail stations are much busier than usual, with one describing London Bridge on Twitter as being like ""a zombie apocalypse"". Southeastern said ""crowd control"" measures were in place at the station. Workers were evacuated from nearby buildings Richard Okyere, 60, works as security officer on the Strand. He told the BBC he was in the building when he was alerted to a smell. ""My colleagues led me to the back of the building. The whole area smelled of gas, and we called the site engineers who came to investigate."" Nearby residents and guests from the hotel were evacuated and sent to a respite centre at Royal Horseguards Hotel in Whitehall Court. Tube passengers affected by the cordon were directed by staff Guests at the Amba Hotel, in the Strand, woke up at 3:30 to an alarm. Some feared it was a terror attack, others looked out of the window to see a police cordon wrapped around the road. Another smelled gas as soon as he woke. Among the guests were a group of colleagues in London for a conference and a senior figure from Blackberry. The hotel was quickly evacuated - so quickly that one woman did not have time to reach for her contact lenses. Guests said it was well-organised, without panic and they followed like sheep to a nearby hotel in Whitehall Court - the Royal Horseguards Hotel. Staff there served tea, coffee and breakfast and found them space in conference rooms and corridors to rest and sleep. Early on there was joking and laughing but as the morning has worn on the 50-or-so tired guests are getting increasingly desperate to get back to their own hotel for a bath and some sleep. Thani Spacey, a personal assistant at an office in the Strand, had completed a 90-minute commute from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex to get to work early. ""I'm frustrated to say the least,"" she said. ""I've just had a text from work but why didn't we hear earlier?"" Valerie Brun, from Chiswick, usually starts work at 7am at a software company on the Strand. ""Surprise, surprise - my building is locked up,"" she said. Revellers at the Heaven nightclub described trying to leave ""as fast as possible"" after they were told to evacuate the building. One said: ""Lots of people trying to leave at the same time. As soon as the word evacuation was heard from security staff everyone was trying to get out as fast as possible.""

Neglect claims rise in sheltered housing,"This video can not be played 'Mum got accommodation, not care' ""I've been left with a feeling that my mum's last months were in a place that nobody really cared about her."" Andrea Dunlop thought sheltered housing would allow her mother, Hazel Smith, to live an independent life safely. But the 65-year-old collapsed and died in her flat and her body lay undiscovered for up to a month. More than 30,000 allegations of abuse and neglect of sheltered housing residents were received by UK councils between April 2014 and November 2017. The data, which was obtained by BBC Radio 4'sFile on 4programme, also found the number of reports increased by 30% over the period. In March 2017 police were called to Mrs Smith's flat in Wokingham, Berkshire, to force open the door. Neighbours said they had repeatedly raised concerns about her welfare but were told she had a no-knock policy and was not checked upon. It is believed she may have lain dead for up to a month and her body was so decomposed an inquest was unable to determine her cause of death. Wokingham Borough Council has said Mrs Smith had opted out of the weekly warden call and had made it clear she didn't want to be checked up on, but it now asks tenants who opt out to contact the warden themselves once a week. Andrea Dunlop with mum Hazel Smith Andrea, from Shinfield, Berkshire, is haunted by the circumstances of her mother's death at the Wokingham Council-run scheme. ""They have a duty of care, they should have checked. ""The action was nothing to do with any of the residents raising alarm bells, it came because the postman couldn't get any more mail through the mailbox."" The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to every council or health and social care trust in the UK, seeking the numbers of safeguarding alerts they had received about residents of sheltered housing and supported living schemes. Just under half supplied data, which revealed that during the period covered, a total of 30,785 safeguarding alerts were received, of which the majority were in England. The biggest reported safeguarding category in the FOI figures was neglect, which accounted for more than 7,200 cases, followed by physical abuse with 6,200 alerts, while there were 4,200 reports of financial abuse. Prof Michael Preston-Shoot, of the University of Bedfordshire, said: ""There is a lot of abuse and neglect that is happening behind an individual's front door about which the agencies are unsighted."" Across Great Britain, more than 700,000 people live in sheltered housing, which provides independent living with additional safety checks, like warden services for the elderly, as well as tailored support for younger people with physical or learning difficulties. Prof Preston-Shoot, who chairs two adult boards in London, said action was needed to understand the scale of the problem. ""I hope government departments take a note in terms of whether they can do more to ensure we obtain an accurate indication of the prevalence of different types of abuse and neglect,"" he added. A Department for Communities and Local Government statement said: ""Abuse and neglect is unacceptable and must be prevented. ""We changed the law so local authorities must ensure that the services they commission are safe, effective and of high quality."" The Department of Health told File on 4 there were no plans to extend the remit of the Care Quality Commission to cover sheltered housing.

'Deacon of death' on trial in Belgium,"Ivo Poppe allegedly caused embolisms by deliberately injecting air into the bloodstream A Catholic deacon accused of killing at least 10 people - including his own mother - has gone on trial in Belgium. Former nurse Ivo Poppe is suspected of killing his victims by injecting air into their blood, causing a fatal embolism. The offences are alleged to have taken place at a clinic in Menen, where he worked as a nurse - and later, after being ordained, in a pastoral role. Belgian newspapers have nicknamed the 61-year-old man the ""deacon of death"". If found guilty of all the alleged murders, he would become one of the worst serial killers in Belgian history. Mr Poppe was arrested in 2014 after telling his psychiatrist that he had ""euthanised"" dozens of people. All of the alleged victims were elderly patients. He had, according to reports, initially made partial confessions during the investigation, saying he was acting compassionately for those who were terminally ill. However, he later retracted his statement and now denies the charges against him. The Facebook post that caught a killer German nurse 'killed at least 100' Belgium minor first 'helped to die' Among those he is formally accused of murdering are several relatives: two great-uncles, his father-in-law, and his mother - the most recent alleged victim, who died in 2011. His mother had reportedly been suffering from depression - but her doctors have denied that she would have chosen to be euthanised. Prosecutors have alleged that the deacon killed many more, pointing to a list of deaths at the hospital he noted in his diary. They say at least 50 deaths are suspicious. At Monday's hearing in a court in Bruges, his lawyers downplayed any such suggestion. Instead, they said he simply noted deaths that happened around him, according to Belgian broadcaster RTBF. The trial is expected to last more than a week and hear from dozens of witnesses, including relatives of the deceased.

'Let children play to learn work skills',"Children will lack the work skills they need in the future because they are not spending enough time playing, a Lego executive has warned. John Goodwin, head of Lego's charitable arm the Lego Foundation, says less time in the classroom and more time playing is the solution. The foundation has a 25% stake in the Danish toy maker, giving it a vested interest in encouraging play. Mr Goodwin admits there could be a perceived conflict of interest. However, he says the foundation's aim is much broader. Mr Goodwin is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, the annual gathering of top business and political leaders, in a bid to persuade them of the importance of play. He took over running the foundation last year after a spell as Lego's chief financial officer. He hopes the Davos elite will put pressure on governments to make education more play-based. If not, he believes companies will find it increasingly difficult to hire the type of staff they need: ""Critical thinking and problem solving starts in early childhood development. It's where the foundations are laid."" Mr Goodwin said technological advances, particularly the growth of the internet, meant that knowledge itself had become obsolete. Instead he said it was now more important to teach children how to learn, and work things out for themselves, with play being one way to achieve this goal. Yet in a warning that will be familiar to many parents, the Lego Foundation chief says the ""increasingly overscheduled world"" of children has resulted in less time for them to do so. This could have ""serious long term consequences"" for companies, he said. Lego Foundation chief John Goodwin has his contact details on a Lego figure rather than a conventional business card Mr Goodwin is not the first to warn about the issue: several studies have linked a drop in play with negative consequences. Dr Peter Gray, a US psychologist and professor at Boston College, has argued that the fact children play less has led to an increase in childhood mental disorders including anxiety and depression, as well as a decline in empathy. ""In play, children themselves must decide what to do and how, and they must solve their own problemsâ¦ and thereby develop competence and confidence,""he wrote recently,external. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright and artist Paul Klee were also strong advocates of ""block play"" for children, to help develop spacial awareness and imagination. They used Froedel Blocks as kids. Some firms are attempting to address the issue. Consumer goods giant Unilever and furniture retailer Ikea Group together with the Lego Foundation are launching The Real Play Coalition this week, aimed at raising awareness about the importance of play ""I'm very optimistic about what it can achieve,"" says Mr Goodwin as he hands me his business card: a Lego mini figure look-a-like that carry his contact details. It might be a gimmick, but it's still a lot more fun than the usual white card. He also admits to carrying a handful of Lego bricks in his pockets - it seems Mr Goodwin very much practises what he preaches.

"Neil Diamond retires over Parkinson'sSinger Neil Diamond stops touring ""with great reluctance"" after a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.17m17 minutes agoEntertainment & Arts","Neil Diamond's concert career spanned half a century Singer Neil Diamond has announced he will retire from touring, after a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Diamond, who turns 77 on Wednesday, cancelled his March tour dates for Australia and New Zealand on medical advice. The Solitary Man singer was midway through his 50th anniversary tour. In a statement he said he took the decision ""with great reluctance and disappointment"". ""I have been so honoured to bring my shows to the public for the past 50 years,"" he said. ""My sincerest apologies to everyone who purchased tickets and were planning to come to the upcoming shows."" Parkinson's is a progressive condition in which the brain becomes damaged. It can lead to tremors, difficulty moving, speech changes and eventually memory problems. Neil Diamond joins Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Diamond hopes to continue writing and recording for some time to come, a post on his website reads. As well as his own hits, Diamond wrote the famous Monkees track I'm a Believer ""My thanks goes out to my loyal and devoted audiences around the world,"" he said. ""You will always have my appreciation for your support and encouragement."" With a nod to his hit Sweet Caroline, he added: ""This ride has been 'so good, so good, so good' thanks to you."" Diamond, who has sold over 130 million albums worldwide, is set to receive a lifetime achievement award at Sunday's Grammy Awards. The singer last performed in the UK and Ireland in October as part of the 50th anniversary world tour, but the the onset of Parkinson's disease ""has made it difficult to travel and perform on a large scale basis,"" his official website said.

"Anger at Â£4k disabled parking chargeA council's charge of Â£3,800 for installing a disabled parking bay is branded ""completely unfair"".9h9 hours agoEngland","The cost of disabled parking bays varies across the country A woman with multiple sclerosis has criticised an ""extortionate"" Â£3,800 charge to create a disabled parking bay outside her home. Cornwall Council charges applicants for a disabled bay thousands of pounds but elsewhere people pay nothing. Councillor Richard Pears said the authority is ""effectively charging people for being disabled"" and the cost should be subsidised. The matter will be discussed at afull council meeting,externalon Tuesday. In comparison, Medway Council in Kentcharges Â£40,external(if successful), while Leicestershire County Councilcharges Â£100,external. Cornwall Council said the Â£3,800 cost is for a Traffic Regulation Order, advertising, public consultation and painting the new bay. However, once installed the space does not guarantee parking for an individual as it is available for any disabled person to use. More news from Cornwall Deb Race said the Â£3,800 charge for a disabled bay outside her home 'doesn't seem fair' Deb Race, from St Austell in Cornwall, decided against paying for a disabled bay. She said: ""Just carrying anything up the road from the car is really difficult and each step is painful. ""To find nearly Â£4,000 and then have a lottery still as to whether I could park outside my house was totally prohibitive. It didn't seem fair."" Disabled parking bays can be advisory - where no action can be taken if another person parks there - or mandatory - where action can be taken against anyone parking there without a blue badge. Richard Pears said the charge is 'extortionate' Conservative councillor Mr Pears said: ""It's completely extortionate. ""We're charging Â£3,800 down in Cornwall, one of the most deprived areas of the country. It's completely unfair.""

JLR cuts Land Rover production,"The Range Rover Evoque has been made at Halewood since 2011 Jaguar Land Rover will cut production of some vehicles amid uncertainty over Brexit and changes to taxes on diesel cars. The company will temporarily scale back output of the Discovery Sport and Range Rover Evoque models later this year. Last week, JLR said its global sales hit a record in 2017, but that the UK market was ""tough"". Vehicle makers have blamed Brexit confusion and a hike in diesel taxation for a general fall in UK car sales. The two Land Rover models are made at the company's Halewood plant on Merseyside. Output will be reduced in the second quarter of 2018. JLR said the car industry continued to face a ""range of challenges"" that were hitting consumer confidence. Diesel cars: Your questions answered What's gone wrong in the UK car market? ""Ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit is being felt by customers at home - with demand for new cars down 5.7% in 2017 - and in Europe where collectively, we sell approximately 45% of total UK production. ""Add to this, concern around the future of petrol and diesel engines, and general global economic and political uncertainty and it's clear to see why industry is seeing an impact on car sales."" It said it regularly reviewed production schedules to ensure market demand was ""balanced"". The Range Rover Evoque has been made at Halewood since 2011 and Discovery Sport since 2014. ""Volumes have remained at peak levels since that time, allowing us to maintain what was initially a three-shift pattern. These changes to operating patterns are temporary and sensible business practice,"" JLR added. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders for November showed the number of cars built in the UK fell 4.6%, driven lower by a fall in domestic demand, while exports grew. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said at the time: ""Brexit uncertainty, coupled with confusion over diesel taxation and air quality plans, continues to impact domestic demand for new cars and, with it, production output.""

Man 'wanted to kill Muslims in van attack',"A man accused of driving a van into a crowd of people near a London mosque wanted to kill as many Muslims as he could, Woolwich Crown Court has heard. Darren Osborne, 48, is accused of ploughing into a crowd of worshippers in Finsbury Park, killing Makram Ali, 51, and injuring nine others last year. The court heard he became ""obsessed"" with Muslims and the Rochdale grooming scandal after watching a BBC TV drama. Mr Osborne, from Cardiff, denies charges of murder and attempted murder. Opening the trial, prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC said Mr Osborne had driven a Luton box van from Cardiff to London on 18 June. He then deliberately targeted crowds in Finsbury Park at about 00:15 BST on 19 June, he added. The area was busy with worshippers attending Ramadan prayers at the time, Mr Rees told the court. Mr Osborne was seeking ""to kill someone merely because of their religion,"" he added. Mr Osborne's partner, Sarah Andrews, said he had become ""obsessed"" with Muslims in the weeks leading up to the incident, having watched the BBC drama Three Girls about the Rochdale grooming scandal. ""He seemed brainwashed and totally obsessed with the subject,"" she said in a statement, read out in court. Ms Andrews - who had been in a relationship with Mr Osborne for about 20 years and had four children with him - said he became a ""ticking time-bomb"" before the alleged attack, Mr Rees added. She described Mr Osborne as a ""loner and a functioning alcoholic"" with an ""unpredictable temperament"", he said. The alleged attack happened in Finsbury Park on 19 June last year During the weekend prior to the attack, the defendant was heard ""preaching racial hatred"" in a pub, Mr Rees said. He allegedly told a soldier in the pub: ""I'm going to kill all the Muslims, Muslims are all terrorists. Your families are all going to be Muslim. I'm going to take it into my own hands."" Devices seized from Mr Osborne's home showed internet searches for Britain First and the English Defence League, the court heard. Police also found a video - believed to be fake - showing Muslims celebrating following the Paris terror attack. Ms Andrews told police Mr Osborne had been reading posts by former EDL leader Tommy Robinson on Twitter. A handwritten note, found in the van used in the attack, complained about terrorists on the streets and the Rotherham child exploitation scandal, Mr Rees told the jury. The note allegedly referred to Muslim people as ""feral"" and called Muslim men ""rapists"" who were ""preying on our children"", the jury heard. One part read: ""Don't people get it, this is happening up and down our Green and pleasant land. ""Ferrel [feral] inbred raping muslim men hunting in packs preying on our children, this will be coming to a town near you soon, it most probably has, get back to the desert, you raping inbred bastards & climb back on ya camels."" The note ended: ""Well Folkes gotta go busy day today. Remember peaceful vigils only & please dont look back in anger, God Save the Queen."" It also branded Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn a ""terrorist sympathiser"" and attacked London Mayor Sadiq Khan and singer Lily Allen, the prosecutor added. Mr Rees said: ""The underlying theme seems to be that the defendant felt that insufficient was being said or done to counter terrorism and the grooming gangs comprising predominantly Muslim males. ""Against that background, the defendant decided to take matters into his own hands."" The court heard one person died in the attack and nine were injured Prosecutors believe Mr Osborne had been planning to target an Al Quds Day march in London, organised by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, on 18 June. Mr Osborne is believed to have asked a black cab driver for directions to Grosvenor Square, the destination of the marchers, the court heard. Mr Rees added: ""We are not able to say quite how close the defendant came to the marchers or Grosvenor Square, although it seems likely the defendant was prevented from carrying out an attack because of the road closures that were put in place."" Instead, he said Mr Osborne travelled to Forest Hill, south London, at around 20:00, and asked a man where the nearest mosque was. He was told there was none in the area and travelled north, stopping to ask a motorist the directions to Finsbury Park. The driver allowed the defendant to follow him and he arrived in the Finsbury Park area at just before 23:30, Mr Rees added. Mr Rees told the court the alleged attack was ""particularly horrific"" because the group had gathered in the street to help Mr Ali, who had collapsed minutes earlier. Several of those who went to help Mr Ali said he was ""definitely alive"" and conscious in the moments before being struck. Mr Osborne planned to make ""a public statement by killing Muslims"", knowing that his handwritten note would be recovered, Mr Rees added. Although Mr Osborne was not charged with a terrorist offence, Mr Rees said ""the note and the comments he made after his detention establish that this act of extreme violence was, indeed, an act of terrorism"".

Two men jailed for executive's murderGuy Hedger was shot dead by intruders in a botched burglary at his luxury home near Ringwood.10h10 hours agoDorset,"Guy Hedger was at home with his husband when he was killed Two men have been jailed for murdering an executive in a botched burglary at his luxury home. Guy Hedger, 61, was shot dead in the raid at Ashley, Dorset, in the early hours of 30 April 2017. Jason Baccus, from Bournemouth, and Kevin Downton, from Winterborne Stickland, were convicted unanimously after a two-month trial at Winchester Crown Court. The pair have been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 34 years. Police said a breakthrough in the case came from DNA found on cigarette butts near the murder scene. Baccus, 42, and Downton, 40, were also found guilty of aggravated burglary, possessing a firearm and one count of burglary. They previously pleaded guilty to another count of burglary. During sentencing, judge Mr Justice Jay described the burglary as ""amateurish and incompetent"". Jason Baccus (left) and Kevin Downton have been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 34 years In a victim impact statement, Mr Hedger's husband Simon-Pierre Hedger-Cooper, known as Si, said the final moments of Guy's life were ""full of terror, fear and pain"". He said the shooting had ""radically changed my life forever - an experience from which I will never recover"". ""My life feels empty and full of sadness and darkness,"" he said. ""Deep and searing pain of never being able to properly say goodbye."" A gun was among items recovered from the River Stour during the police investigation Scott Keeping, 44, from Bournemouth, was found not guilty of murder as well as the other above charges. His wife Helen Keeping, 40, also known as Helen Cooper, was found not guilty of two counts of assisting an offender. The trial heard how Mr Hedger and his husband were confronted in their bedroom by two men wearing balaclavas and armed with a sawn-off shotgun. Mr Hedger was shot when his husband hit a panic button, triggering alarms. Guy Hedger's house is in a cul-de-sac in Ashley, Dorset Police admitted for the first 24 hours after the shooting they had no idea who may have been involved. It was what they called a ""cold start"". But the major breakthrough came when they found discarded cigarette butts around the corner from Guy Hedger's home. They contained the DNA of Jason Baccus. Police were then able to identify his known associates and track their movements at the time of the shooting. This led them to Kevin Downton, and Scott and Helen Keeping. Without the discovery of this crucial forensic link officers said it may have taken them much longer to identify those responsible. In a video shown to the court, Mr Hedger-Cooper said: ""I heard an almighty boom, shot, and Guy said 'I have been hit, I have been hit'."" Mr Hedger, the brand and marketing director of insurance firm Liverpool Victoria, died two hours later in hospital from a gunshot wound to the chest. Diamond jewellery and watches were among items worth more than Â£120,000 which were stolen in the burglary, near Ringwood. The court heard the intruders also removed an iPhone and landline in a ""callous"" attempt to stop Mr Hedger-Cooper calling the emergency services. Watches stolen from Guy Hedger's home were among items found in undergrowth next to a public footpath in Bournemouth Baccus told the court he had committed domestic and commercial burglaries in the past to fund his drink and drug habits. In evidence, he also said he had ""spent most of my adult life in prison,"" having started shoplifting at the age of five. In recent periods out of prison he would stay with Mr and Mrs Keeping at their home in Bournemouth, the court heard. Police said some of the stolen valuables were found hidden in a chimney breast of their flat. Downton, who worked as a carpenter, claimed he had been shopping for a birthday present for his daughter at Toys R Us in Poole on the evening of the murder. He said he visited ""two or three friends"" on the way home but declined to name them. He met fellow inmate Baccus in prison more than a decade ago and would buy cocaine from him, the court heard. Downton told the court the pair committed commercial burglaries together but denied having ever burgled a home. Jewellery stolen during the burglary was found in undergrowth at the side of a public footpath in Bournemouth Sentencing the pair, the judge said: ""Guy Hedger died in his bedroom when he was shot by you, Kevin Downton. You were an enthusiastic participant. ""You removed two phones from the bedside table. You have a cold ruthless streak and have shown no remorse."" He described Baccus as a ""career criminal"" who ""recruited"" Downton as the gunman, and who had also shown no remorse.

"Neglect claims rise in sheltered housingUK councils receive more than 30,000 allegations of mistreatment concerning residents, the BBC learns.2m2 minutes agoUK","This video can not be played 'Mum got accommodation, not care' ""I've been left with a feeling that my mum's last months were in a place that nobody really cared about her."" Andrea Dunlop thought sheltered housing would allow her mother, Hazel Smith, to live an independent life safely. But the 65-year-old collapsed and died in her flat and her body lay undiscovered for up to a month. More than 30,000 allegations of abuse and neglect of sheltered housing residents were received by UK councils between April 2014 and November 2017. The data, which was obtained by BBC Radio 4'sFile on 4programme, also found the number of reports increased by 30% over the period. In March 2017 police were called to Mrs Smith's flat in Wokingham, Berkshire, to force open the door. Neighbours said they had repeatedly raised concerns about her welfare but were told she had a no-knock policy and was not checked upon. It is believed she may have lain dead for up to a month and her body was so decomposed an inquest was unable to determine her cause of death. Wokingham Borough Council has said Mrs Smith had opted out of the weekly warden call and had made it clear she didn't want to be checked up on, but it now asks tenants who opt out to contact the warden themselves once a week. Andrea Dunlop with mum Hazel Smith Andrea, from Shinfield, Berkshire, is haunted by the circumstances of her mother's death at the Wokingham Council-run scheme. ""They have a duty of care, they should have checked. ""The action was nothing to do with any of the residents raising alarm bells, it came because the postman couldn't get any more mail through the mailbox."" The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to every council or health and social care trust in the UK, seeking the numbers of safeguarding alerts they had received about residents of sheltered housing and supported living schemes. Just under half supplied data, which revealed that during the period covered, a total of 30,785 safeguarding alerts were received, of which the majority were in England. The biggest reported safeguarding category in the FOI figures was neglect, which accounted for more than 7,200 cases, followed by physical abuse with 6,200 alerts, while there were 4,200 reports of financial abuse. Prof Michael Preston-Shoot, of the University of Bedfordshire, said: ""There is a lot of abuse and neglect that is happening behind an individual's front door about which the agencies are unsighted."" Across Great Britain, more than 700,000 people live in sheltered housing, which provides independent living with additional safety checks, like warden services for the elderly, as well as tailored support for younger people with physical or learning difficulties. Prof Preston-Shoot, who chairs two adult boards in London, said action was needed to understand the scale of the problem. ""I hope government departments take a note in terms of whether they can do more to ensure we obtain an accurate indication of the prevalence of different types of abuse and neglect,"" he added. A Department for Communities and Local Government statement said: ""Abuse and neglect is unacceptable and must be prevented. ""We changed the law so local authorities must ensure that the services they commission are safe, effective and of high quality."" The Department of Health told File on 4 there were no plans to extend the remit of the Care Quality Commission to cover sheltered housing.

Brand in homeless plea for royal weddingRussell Brand wants a council to donate a building to homeless people as a gift to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.14h14 hours agoBerkshire,"Brand's wish is for the council to give a building to a homeless charity Russell Brand has called on a council to donate a building to house the homeless people of Windsor as a wedding gift to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. A petition launched by the comedian has gained more than 70,000 signatures. It comes after Windsor and Maidenhead Council leader Simon Dudley called on police to tackle ""aggressive begging"" in the town. Brand wants neighbouring Slough Borough Council to give a building to charity Shoc (Slough Homeless Our Concern). This video can not be played ""Medieval"": Find out what Windsor makes of the royal wedding row Shoc's current lease ceases in April. Shoc chief executive Steve Headley said if ""people forced to sleep rough in Windsor are forcibly removed"" the charity would be the ""obvious service that would assist them"". He added: ""If Shoc closes due to a lack of a building, this would not only overwhelm the other projects, but lives will be at risk."" In a video, Brand criticised Mr Dudley's comments, saying they were ""some terrifying sort of eugenics, genocide, burn the books, burn the people-type language"". Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry at St George's Chapel in Windsor on 19 May Brand added, ""of course it's not Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's fault"", but ""it is an interesting indication that in order to make this wedding spick and span and spotless, the most vulnerable people in society are being exposed to yet more persecution"". A Slough Borough Council spokeswoman said the authority was in contact and discussion with the homeless charity. Mr Dudley defended his comments about begging and said he was referring to anti-social behaviour, not homelessness. Theprime minister was among those who disagreed with Mr Dudley's views.

'Disjointed policies harm child health',"The health of children in England is being harmed by deepening public sector cuts and ""disjointed"" government policies, a report has found. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the government had failed to improve care in a number of ""fundamental areas"", such as by banning junk food advertising. It said the government had not made the same strides as in Wales and Scotland. The government said ""world-leading plans"" for child health were in place. But the RCPCH called for more to be done, including a bigger focus on preventive measures, which had faced ""destructive"" reductions. Professor Neena Modi, president of the RCPCH, called for ""much bolder"" policies, adding: ""It is no good only throwing money at treating established problems. ""There must be far better investment in prevention, which will reap immeasurable long term benefits."" NHS 'haemorrhaging' nurses as 33,000 leave each year Patients 'dying in hospital corridors' One in eight patients hit by ambulance A&E delays NHS bail-outs 'could become new normal' The RCPCH tracked the progress made by governments in England, Wales and Scotland againstthe different recommendations it set the countries last year in its State of Child Health report,external. At the time, it found child health in the UK was falling behind that of many other European countries. In its follow-up report, the RCPCH said central government had made less progress on its recommendations compared with its counterparts in Wales and Scotland. It found that England had made progress in some areas - including the launch of a digital child health strategy, a new tobacco control plan and the implementation of the sugar tax. Sugar tax: How will it work? NHS plans 'sugar tax' in hospital cafes However, the organisation said the health and wellbeing of children in the country remained ""largely unchanged"" and no improvement had been made in a number of ""fundamental areas"", including on banning junk food advertising and investing in child health research. England was also the only country that had a worsened performance against one of its recommendations - to freeze public health cuts. The RCPCH said data (from a King's Fund think tank analysis) showed councils would spend only Â£2.52bn on public health services in 2017-18 compared with Â£2.60bn the previous year. The report highlighted Scotland passing its Child Poverty Act Prof Russell Viner, RCPCH officer for health promotion, said: ""Child health isn't being given the political attention it deserves in Westminster, which is disappointing given the real commitments from the Scottish and Welsh governments."" The RCPCH report points to Scotland passing its Child Poverty Act and Wales opening a centre for child health research, as examples of the progress the countries were making. Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association, said: ""Public health services play a vital role in improving the health of children, young people and adults, reducing the need for treatment later down the line and easing the pressure on the NHS. ""Unless this is properly funded, it will put services at risk  which are vital in supporting the health and development of babies, children and families."" Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: ""This report is a stark reminder that there are over two million children with health-related vulnerabilities being let down by an underfunded and overstretched health system."" A government official said: ""There is always more to do, but we have world-leading plans in place to safeguard child health by combating obesity, improving mental health and vaccinating against some of the world's deadliest diseases. ""In the past year, both teen pregnancy and child mortality have both fallen to all-time lows, and our soft drinks levy is already funding additional breakfast clubs and sports.""

Winners and losers,"The government shutdown is officially over. Everyone involved is declaring victory. And everybody's right. And wrong. How right and how wrong they are will be revealed over time. For now, as the dust settles on the long-weekend shutdown of 2018, here's the case for - and against - each side's claims. Why they won:Given that the Republican Party's previous shutdown experiences - notably 2013 and 1995-96 - ended in near-total capitulation, anything short of that has to be seen as a unmitigated victory. Their caucus stayed reasonably united, losing only four senators in Friday's pre-shutdown vote, and mostly on-message. Their argument was simple - they would not negotiate an immigration deal with a shutdown gun held to their head. If that sounds familiar, it's because it was the same logic Democrats used, effectively, in 2013. What the Republicans conceded, a promise to vote on an immigration reform package in the Senate, was not a particularly heavy lift. There are plenty of Republicans who want to see so-called Dreamers, who entered the US as undocumented immigrant children and are now in danger of deportation, given some sort of permanent residency status. Nothing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed to will preclude Republicans from negotiating Democratic concessions on other immigration reforms, such as the border wall and ending the visa lottery and chain migration, in exchange for their support. Why they lost:Despite a rather clear, concise Republican message - Democrats were shutting down the government to win protections for ""illegal immigrants"" - the American public, according to snap polls, sided with the Democratic position. The partisan divides were clear, but the highly coveted political independents were breaking to the left. That might have changed if the shutdown dragged on longer, but it didn't. So if Republicans hoped that the fight would give them a boost and help avoid what could be a Democratic wave in the mid-term elections later this year, they will likely be disappointed. This is the first time a shutdown has occurred when one party has controlled both the White House and Congress. If voters focus their ire on the ones in power, Republicans will bear the brunt of the blame. In the meantime, while Mr McConnell's guarantee of an immigration vote is vague at best, it could be used against him in three weeks if there's no further action on the issue. And if a vote does take place, it is likely to exacerbate the clear rifts that have been exposed among Republicans on what to do about Dreamers. This video can not be played White House and Chuck Schumer trade barbs over shutdown Why theywon:Uh. Give me a minute. OK, the Democrats didn't have the strongest hand heading into this weekend's shutdown showdown. They played their cards as best they could. They were able to convince a few Republicans - Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina - to fight by their side. They are also more likely to win over other sympathetic senators, like Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, in future battles by backing down now. The Democratic caucus largely stuck together through the weekend. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was able to give at-risk Democrats, up for re-election this year in conservative states, a pass on a tough shutdown vote, and Republicans weren't able to pick off further support until the leadership was ready to accept Mr McConnell's offer. They have kept their powder dry for the next fight, in three weeks, without making any concessions and demonstrated that they are willing to take a more confrontational stance - at least for a few days - on an issue that's dear to the liberal base. The US public tends to have a short memory as far as shutdowns go, so any damage they did by risking being branded as obstructionists is almost certainly temporary. As part of the deal, the Children's Health Insurance Programme (Chip) was reauthorised for a full six years. While this was a measure that had broad bipartisan support, Republicans had held it out to win concessions from Democrats on other issues. Chip has now been taken off the table. Why theylost:Spin it however you like, it was the Democrats who (with a bit of Republican support) forced the shutdown, and it was the Democrats who eventually relented. The ""Schumer shutdown"" label stuck. While this was a Democratic play to show the base they were serious about protecting Dreamers, early indications are the base isn't convinced. ""Today's cave by Senate Democrats - led by weak-kneed, right-of-centre Democrats - is why people don't believe the Democratic Party stands for anything,"" writes Stephanie Taylor of Progressive Change Campaign Committee in a press statement. Not exactly hosannas for the good fight. Even more telling is that nearly every 2020 Democratic hopeful in the Senate - Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Ron Wyden - were against reopening the government. Their position is that Mr McConnell's guarantees of an intent to have an immigration vote - if no deal is reached in three weeks and the Democrats don't shut down the government again - are written in sand. You don't need a weatherman to tell that this particular wind is blowing from the left. Why he won:First and foremost, the president was able to make it through the first shutdown on his watch without doing anything to exacerbate the situation. Disruptions were kept to a minimum. Government services largely continued undisrupted. Even the national parks and museums, a key focus of past shutdowns, mostly stayed open. The president himself was kept out of the public view over the weekend and his Twitter feed - which often causes as many problems as it solves - was restrained and on message. He even fired off a tongue-in-cheek line sending his regards to the hundreds of thousands of women who marched in protest of his administration over the weekend. Now he can claim that he stood on the side of defending a functioning government and protecting the US military. His characterisations of Democrats as obstructionists will pack a bit more of a punch. It seems more likely at this point that if an immigration deal is eventually reached it will include funding for his Mexican border wall. The issue had been a non-starter for Democrats up until now, but Mr Schumer and his team showed a willingness to exchange the wall for Dreamer protections. The prospect that the president will someday pose proudly before a gleaming ""Trump wall"" - even if it will never stretch from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific or be paid for by Mexico - appears much more likely. That, by any accounts, is a win for the president. Why he lost:Mr Schumer groused over the weekend that trying to work with Mr Trump was like negotiating with Jell-o. Every time they thought they had an agreement with the president, whether it was to accept a bipartisan deal on immigration or establish terms for re-opening the government, he would later back away or come up with new conditions. Even Republicans - from Mr McConnell on down - expressed frustration that they were not receiving sufficient guidance from the president on what an acceptable deal might look like. The White House released a number of photographs of Mr Trump ""working"" over the weekend to solve the shutdown impasse. The president sitting at his desk, talking on the phone. The president meeting with smiling staffers. The president walking, stern-faced, down a corridor. By most accounts, however, the president was a non-factor in the congressional negotiations that led, ultimately, to a government reopening. Instead, according to press reports, he stewed in the White House, frustrated he couldn't head to his Mar-a-Lago resort for a gala celebration of the anniversary of his inauguration. ""A great deal-making president sat on the sidelines,"" Mr Schumer said as he announced Democrats would agree to Mr McConnell's deal. According to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the role of the president during the crisis was to ensure that things ""went smoothly"". If that's the bar, it's debatable the president met it.

What is the cost?,"A kiosk at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington explains what is going on A stand-off over the budget has led to a temporary shutdown of the US government. What will be the economic cost? The Senate has reached a compromise to reopen the government, as the impasse entered a third day. But while that brings a short-term spending deal closer - it must be approved by the House - some economists worry it could signal bigger problems to come. The temporary solution could help the US avoid one of the most direct consequences of the shutdown - lost hours by federal workers. In 2013, when the government shut down for 16 days, workers eventually received about $2bn for the furloughed time. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated,externalthat the lost hours - at national parks, permit offices, federal loan programmes and the like - lowered economic growth in the fourth quarter by 0.3%. US government shutdown: How did we get here? There were also indirect effects, as the shutdown limited tourist activities and delayed pay cheques squeezed consumer spending. And some government contractors - who number in the hundreds of thousands - never regained the pay lost during the period. In 2013, the combination of indirect and direct costs amounted to as much as 0.6% of quarterly GDP or $24bn,according to some analyses,external. This time around, the Trump administration worked to limit the effects, keeping some national parks open and deeming more employees to be ""essential"" workers. Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at S&P Global, says this will go down as a ""blip"" for the US economy. But the problem could repeat itself when the temporary spending bill runs out. A prolonged shutdown can hurt economic growth. Goldman Sachs estimates that each week of a shutdown could lead to roughly 0.2% reduction in quarterly GDP growth. As Congress headed towards a shutdown last week, US markets closed at record highs, again. Analysts say it is possible that the dysfunction could cause investor attitudes to swing, but the reaction during previous shutdowns suggests the effect will be modest. On the first day of shutdowns in prior years, markets fell an average of 0.9%, according to Goldman Sachs. And during three of the longest episodes (in the 1990s and in 2013), markets eventually gained 1.2% by the time the shutdowns ended. Previous shutdowns have forced the two sides to come together, helping to provide policy certainty. But unlike previous shutdowns, this one is happening when a single party controls both the White House and Congress. That has some economists worried that the gridlock over the budget is a preview of more battles to come - which would pose more problems than the short-term economic consequences would suggest. ""The direct economic costs of a government shutdown, either today or later this year, should be minimal, but it's easy to craft a scenario where the shutdown causes bigger problems down the road by boosting partisan conflict and policy uncertainty,"" Moody's Analytics writes. From 2013: US government shutdown isnât the worst of it US political dysfunction was a primary factor when S&P downgraded the US debt rating in 2011, a move that has the potential to raise the cost of borrowing. Questions over the debt level are expected to surface again this spring. Moody's also estimates that policy uncertainty could lead to about 2.1 million fewer new jobs over a two-year period. But the firm warned it may be overstating the effects. After all, as Ms Bovino says, when it comes to US government dysfunction, ""investors have gotten used to it"". ""We've been here so long now,"" she said. ""It weighs on business confidence. I don't know how much though.""
