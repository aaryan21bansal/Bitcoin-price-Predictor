'No risks' to be taken to free Thai boys,"This video can not be played Finding the Thai cave boys and getting them out Rescuers will take no risks in freeing the 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand, an official said. They have received their first food and medical treatment in 10 days. Seven divers, including a doctor and a nurse, joined the group inside the caves in the north of the country after they were discovered alive on Monday. Rescuers are now considering how best to bring the group to safety. ""We will not rush to take the lads out of the cave,"" the governor of Chiang Rai, Narongsak Osoththanakorn, told reporters, adding: ""Whoever has zero risk first can leave the cave first."" How will the boys cope underground? What are the rescue options? More heavy rain could see water levels rise and threaten the air pocket where the group has taken refuge. The boys were found nine days after they entered the caves in Chiang Rai province following a football training session and became trapped by rising waters from heavy rainfall. On Tuesday, Thai officials told reporters that rescuers were providing health checks and treatment, and keeping the boys entertained, adding that none of those trapped were in a serious condition. ""They have been fed with easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor,"" Rear Admiral Apagorn Youkonggaew, head of the Thai navy's special forces, told reporters. It is believed that most of the group cannot swim, complicating what would already be a difficult rescue. Thailand rejoices as boys found The Brits who found the group alive The hours after the boys were found Earlier, the Thai military said the boys would need to learn to dive - or wait up to four months for flooding to recede before they could get out of the caves, meaning food would need to be supplied for that time. Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda later stressed the urgency of the evacuation, adding that rain was forecast ""in the next few days"", the Bangkok Post reported. Attempts are being made to reduce the risk of further flooding of the caves by pumping water from the underground system, Mr Anupong said. A phone line is also being installed so the boys can talk to their families. The governor said that requests had been made to build ""infrastructure"" in the cave leading to the pocket where the teenagers and their coach are located. The Thai authorities have appealed for donations of full-face scuba diving masks small enough to fit the boys in order to reduce the risk of their breathing apparatus coming loose as they travel through flooded passageways. Two British rescuer divers who had flown over to join the search operation found the boys on Monday night. The video of that first contact was posted on Facebook,externalby Thai navy special forces. The boys are seen by torchlight sitting on a ledge above water, responding to the divers that all 13 were there and that they were very hungry. This video can not be played Bill Whitehouse of the British Cave Rescue Council has been in touch with the divers They ask how long they have been underground and whether they can leave now. The divers tell them they have to wait, but say people will come back for them. One boy replies: ""Oh. See you tomorrow."" The search for the group had gripped the nation as it was unclear where they were or whether they were even still alive. Families of the missing group were ecstatic at news of their discovery. Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said of the boys' discovery that ""everybody is a hero"". ""Thank you all Thais, thank you all foreigners,"" he said. The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June. It is believed they entered the cave when it was dry and sudden heavy rains blocked the exit. They were found on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave. It is thought the boys could move through parts of the cave in dry conditions but rushing waters clogged the narrow passages with mud and debris, blocking visibility and access. This video can not be played Families of the boys have been celebrating after finding out their loved ones are alive One of the toughest stretches for the divers came as they neared the so-called Pattaya Beach - an elevated mound in the cave complex - where it was hoped the boys had sought refuge. Divers had to navigate a series of sharp, narrow bends in near-darkness. They completed the difficult journey to find Pattaya Beach flooded, so swam on and found the boys about 400m away. Bringing the trapped boys to safety is an extremely dangerous task given the conditions inside. The Tham Luang cave complex is regularly flooded during the rainy season which lasts until September or October. A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the missing children Experts have cautioned that taking inexperienced divers through the dangerous corridors of muddy, zero-visibility waters would be very risky. How will rescuers free the Thai boys? What to do to survive underground Thai boys 'could be in cave for months' Nine days of hope - images from the search Diver Ben Reymenants, who is assisting with the rescue mission, told the BBC that two Thai navy doctors had volunteered to stay with the boys for ""up to four months"" until the water receded. Other teams are still scouring the mountainside in the hope of finding another way into the cave. This video can not be played Diver Ben Reymenants is assisting with the rescue mission and says none of the boys can swim The 12 boys are all members of a local football team and their coach is known to have taken them on occasional excursions and field trips. Tinnakorn Boonpiem, whose 12-year-old son Mongkol is among the 13, told Agence France-Presse she was ""so glad"" to hear they were safe. ""I want him to be physically and mentally fit,"" she said. ""I'm so happy I can't put it into words,"" another relative of one of the group told reporters as tears of joy streamed down his cheeks. How will the boys cope?

Vote Leave campaign 'broke electoral law',"This video can not be played Former Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott defended his group's actions The official Brexit campaign is expected to be found guilty of four charges of breaking electoral law, the BBC has been told. The draft of an investigation into Vote Leave concludes it broke spending limits and failed to comply with some of the rules. It also imposes fines as a result of its findings. But the group's former chief executive claimed the Electoral Commission had not followed due process. Matthew Elliott has submitted a 500-page dossier to the Electoral Commission rebutting the claims. The commission said Vote Leave had taken the ""unusual step"" of going public having seen the draft report. According to Vote Leave's dossier, the commission finds the campaign group: made an inaccurate return of campaign expenditure is missing invoices and receipts failed to comply with a statutory notice exceeded its spending limit Crucially, the draft report is said to claim there was coordination between Vote Leave and a smaller campaign, BeLeave, which received a donation of more than Â£600,000 in the closing weeks of the referendum, after advice from the Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings. For months there have been allegations that the two campaigns broke the rules by working together too closely. The electoral rules stipulate that different campaign groups can work loosely together but they must not have a ""common plan"". This has always been denied by the two groups and has been investigated twice already by the Electoral Commission. Vote Leave now admits there was email correspondence between a donor, Anthony Clake, and Mr Cummings about passing a donation on to BeLeave. It is understood that this third investigation concludes that there was a ""common plan"", and therefore the law was broken. A spokesperson for the Electoral Commission said: ""The commission has concluded its investigation and, having reached initial findings, provided Vote Leave with a 28-day period to make any further or new representations. That period ended on Tuesday 3 July. ""The unusual step taken by Vote Leave in sharing its views on the Electoral Commission's initial findings does not affect the process set out in law."" It said it would give ""due considerations"" to representations it had received and then publish a ""thorough and detailed closing report in order to provide a full and balanced account"". Speaking to the BBC, Mr Elliott said the commission had ""listened to one side of the story"". ""We offered to go in for interviews, both at board level and at staff level,"" he said. ""They haven't accepted any interviews from our side."" Mr Elliott said he thought Vote Leave had ""acted both within the letter of the law and also the spirit of the law"", and that it was perfectly legitimate that they would ""work alongside other groups and encourage them and encourage their activities"". Vote Leave was the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum He denied that he was simply trying to deflect the coming criticism of the campaign. ""We're saying 'can they look at our side of the story?''', he said, adding that they would take legal action to try to overturn the charges if they were not withdrawn. Tamsin Allen, the solicitor who represents the whistleblowers who went public with claims that Vote Leave broke the law, said: ""Vote Leave may not like this conclusion, but there is clearly a proper evidential basis for it. ""The commission should be permitted to complete its work and we await the release of its final report."" One of the whistleblowers, Christopher Wylie, called for the referendum to be rerun, saying: ""If sanctions are issued against Vote Leave or their affiliates, this means the law was broken."" Another whistleblower, former Vote Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, said: ""I'm waiting for the report, but just for clarity, I told you so."" During Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said she would not comment on ""a leaked report"" after the matter was raised by the SNP. She added that the government would consider the final report and any recommendations. A spokesman for Anthony Clake, whose donation was given to BeLeave at the suggestion of Mr Cummings, said: ""Mr Clake was told by Mr Cummings that Vote Leave was reaching its spending limits, so he suggested that he could give it to BeLeave instead, which he did. ""Any alleged collusion between the campaigns is a matter for them.""

Murder arrest over hospital baby deaths,"Police have been investigating neonatal deaths between March 2015 and July 2016 A healthcare professional has been arrested on suspicion of murdering eight babies and attempting to kill six others at a hospital. Cheshire Police said the woman's arrest was a significant step forward in an investigation into deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Officers have been investigating the deaths of 17 newborns at the neonatal unit between March 2015 and July 2016. A spokesman said the probe also covered 15 ""non-fatal collapses"". The cases being investigated involve families from the Cheshire and north Wales area. Police officers are searching a house and a car in Westbourne Road, Chester The Countess of Chester declined to comment on whether any staff had been suspended and Cheshire Police would not reveal the role of the healthcare professional within the hospital. Police have confirmed they are searching a property in Westbourne Road, Chester, about a mile from the hospital, in connection with the investigation. Neighbours said a woman lived at the house and had moved in about two years ago. Det Insp Paul Hughes said the investigation was highly complex and very sensitive and officers were doing ""everything we possibly can to try to establish in detail what has led to these baby deaths and collapses"". The hospital says the neonatal unit was ""safe to continue in its current form"" and remained open to women over 32 weeks in their pregnancy He said there were ""no set timescales for this coming to a conclusion but we remain committed to carrying out a thorough investigation as soon as possible"". ""Parents of all the babies are continuing to be kept fully updated and are being supported. ""This is an extremely difficult time and it is important to remember that there are bereaved families seeking answers as to what happened to their children."" Police were asked to investigate the deaths of eight babies in May 2017, a probe which has since widened to include nine more. In 2017 the Countess of Chester was among 21 hospitals called upon to investigate higher than average death rates. Authors of the MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK) report looked at stillbirths and neonatal deaths around the UK in 2015. They found the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust had a neonatal death rate of 1.91 for every 1,000 live births that year. This was the highest out of the 43 trusts of a similar size it was compared with, which had an average of 1.27 neonatal deaths for every 1,000 live births. There were also 5.42 extended perinatal deaths - deaths within four weeks - for every 1,000 births, including stillbirths. The average for similar sized maternity units was 4.73 deaths per 1,000 births. The rate declined in 2016 but was still among the highest in the group. Hospital medical director Ian Harvey said asking police to investigate the deaths had not been ""something we did lightly, but we need to do everything we can to understand what has happened"". He added the neonatal unit was ""safe to continue in its current form"" and remained open to women over 32 weeks in their pregnancy. The unit has 13 cots providing specialist care for about 400 newborn and premature babies born at 32 weeks and above each year. It stopped providing care for those born earlier than 32 weeks in July 2016 after the hospital reported ""a greater number of baby deaths and collapses than normally expected"". Hospital baby deaths probed by police Baby death hospital staffing 'inadequate' Areview by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Healththe following February said no ""definitive explanation"" had been found for the increase in mortality rates at the neonatal unit and there were no ""obvious factors"" linking the deaths. An inspection of the hospital by the Care Quality Commission in 2016found the unit's nursing staff levels,external""did not meet standards recommended by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine"" and it ""lacked storage space and resources"" for effective infection control.

Met Police investigate new Kevin Spacey claims,"The Met Police are investigating three more claims of sexual assault against Kevin Spacey, the BBC understands. Between February and April of this year, police received allegations that the American actor sexually assaulted men in London and Gloucester. This brings the number of claims against Spacey being investigated by London police to six - five complaints of sexual assault and one of assault. The police have not confirmed the name of the person being investigated. Two of the latest allegations are said to have occurred in London - Westminster (1996) and Lambeth (2008) - and the third in Gloucester (2013). In 2017 the police received one allegation of assault said to have taken place in Lambeth (2008) and two sexual assault claims - one in Lambeth and the other in Westminster, both in 2005. Actor Anthony Rapp accused Kevin Spacey of making sexual advances to him in 1986 Overall, the Oscar-winning actor, 58, has faced sexual assault accusations from more than 30 men. The first allegation came from the actor Anthony Rappin November 2017 who said Spacey had made sexual advances to him in 1986 when he was 14 and Spacey was 26. Mr Spacey claimed to have no memory of the events, but publicly apologised. He has since issued an ""absolute"" denial of the other allegations that later emerged. Spacey has won two Oscars for performances in American Beauty (2000) and the Usual Suspects (1996) and between 2004 and 2015 he was artistic director at The Old Vic Theatre in London.

Air pollution linked to child's death,"Ella wasn't born with asthma A nine-year-old girl's fatal asthma attack has been linked to illegally high levels of air pollution. Ella Kissi-Debrah lived 25m (80ft) from London's South Circular Road - a notorious pollution ""hotspot"". She experienced three years of seizures and hospital stays before her death in February 2013. During that time, local air pollution levels breached EU legal limits. No individual death has previously been directly linked to air pollution. According to a report by one of the UK's leading experts on asthma and air pollution, Prof Stephen Holgate, there was a ""striking association"" between Ella's emergency hospital admissions and recorded spikes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM10s, the most noxious pollutants. His report said there was a ""real prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died"". The evidence will be submitted in an appeal to the attorney general to re-open an inquest in to Ella's death. Ella often walked to school along the South Circular Road and Lewisham High Street, a journey that would take 30-40 minutes. Or she would be driven and have to sit for lengthy periods in traffic jams. Ella's lung collapsed in 2011 She was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit that followed a spike in air pollution levels. She was subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times over three years. Many of these coincided with recorded peaks in air pollution. Pollution linked to one in six deaths 'Asthma is a killer - it took away my miracle daughter' Asthma patients 'not receiving basic care' Her mother, Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, said she had resuscitated Ella between 20 and 30 times while waiting for an ambulance. She said that Ella had been treated in five separate hospitals but no medical professional had ever explained that air pollution could be making her asthma worse. ""I need to find out for myself why she died and what the causes are,"" Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said. ""I need this for my other children, in order to protect their health. ""I also believe there is a public interest in examining her death because if this direct link were made then the health of our children would have to be prioritised over other considerations including the convenience of drivers."" Human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn, from the firm Hodge Jones and Allen, is acting on behalf of the family. She said: ""It doesn't make sense that so much information is now available about the health impact of air pollution and the link to thousands of the deaths in the UK and yet there has been, as yet, no direct link made to an individual death. ""Ella's case illustrates the hard-hitting human impact of air pollution."" Thick mucus like this clogged Ella's lungs and eventually killed her Prof Holgate, from University Hospital Southampton, chaired the government's advisory committee on the effects of air pollution. In his report, he described exposure to air pollutants as a ""key driver"" of Ella's disease. ""Unlawful levels of air pollution contributed to the cause and seriousness of Ella's asthma in a way that greatly compromised her quality of life and was causative of her fatal asthma attack."" He examined records gathered by a government-monitored air pollution monitoring station in Catford, just one mile from Ella's house, and another three miles from her home. According to Prof Holgate, the fact the monitoring stations were so close to Ella's house meant the results, when combined with data from King's College London and correlated with Ella's hospital visits, were ""particularly insightful."" Spikes in air pollution coincided with all but one of Ella's hospital admissions. And she died after one of the ""worst air pollution episodes in her locality."" Prof Holgate examined other possible causes of Ella's condition but concluded the cause of death should be recorded as acute respiratory failure and severe asthma secondary to air pollution exposure. Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said she had noticed Ella's attacks could be worse when she had been near a busy road, that the fumes would affect her breathing. If she had been properly advised, she said, she would have looked at moving to a less polluted area and changing Ella's school. Ella with her twin brothers ""I would have made every effort to properly seal the house and close the windows when pollution levels were high,"" Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said. She has younger twins and her son has asthma, although not as seriously as Ella. She believes air pollution affects him. They now walk a different way to school, through a park instead of along the South Circular. According to a government report published in 2018, poor air quality has been classified as the largest environmental risk to public health in the UK. The EU limits on air pollution are set out in Article 13 of the European Directive of 2008. But World Health Organization guidelines indicate that adverse health effects occur at lower levels than the EU limits. Ms Cockburn said: ""The government has willingly presided over illegal EU air quality limits since 2010 and this ongoing failure is costing lives. ""There needs to be an immediate sea change in how air pollution is dealt with in our cities. ""I believe there are strong grounds for Ella's inquest to be quashed on the basis that her right to life (Article Two of the Human Rights Act) may have been breached by the government's failure to act in relation to unlawful air pollution levels."" The attorney general's office said: ""In considering whether to grant his consent to an application, the attorney general must be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of the application succeeding in the High Court.""

Medics reach boys trapped in Thai cave,"This video can not be played Finding the Thai cave boys and getting them out Rescuers will take no risks in freeing the 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand, an official said. They have received their first food and medical treatment in 10 days. Seven divers, including a doctor and a nurse, joined the group inside the caves in the north of the country after they were discovered alive on Monday. Rescuers are now considering how best to bring the group to safety. ""We will not rush to take the lads out of the cave,"" the governor of Chiang Rai, Narongsak Osoththanakorn, told reporters, adding: ""Whoever has zero risk first can leave the cave first."" How will the boys cope underground? What are the rescue options? More heavy rain could see water levels rise and threaten the air pocket where the group has taken refuge. The boys were found nine days after they entered the caves in Chiang Rai province following a football training session and became trapped by rising waters from heavy rainfall. On Tuesday, Thai officials told reporters that rescuers were providing health checks and treatment, and keeping the boys entertained, adding that none of those trapped were in a serious condition. ""They have been fed with easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor,"" Rear Admiral Apagorn Youkonggaew, head of the Thai navy's special forces, told reporters. It is believed that most of the group cannot swim, complicating what would already be a difficult rescue. Thailand rejoices as boys found The Brits who found the group alive The hours after the boys were found Earlier, the Thai military said the boys would need to learn to dive - or wait up to four months for flooding to recede before they could get out of the caves, meaning food would need to be supplied for that time. Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda later stressed the urgency of the evacuation, adding that rain was forecast ""in the next few days"", the Bangkok Post reported. Attempts are being made to reduce the risk of further flooding of the caves by pumping water from the underground system, Mr Anupong said. A phone line is also being installed so the boys can talk to their families. The governor said that requests had been made to build ""infrastructure"" in the cave leading to the pocket where the teenagers and their coach are located. The Thai authorities have appealed for donations of full-face scuba diving masks small enough to fit the boys in order to reduce the risk of their breathing apparatus coming loose as they travel through flooded passageways. Two British rescuer divers who had flown over to join the search operation found the boys on Monday night. The video of that first contact was posted on Facebook,externalby Thai navy special forces. The boys are seen by torchlight sitting on a ledge above water, responding to the divers that all 13 were there and that they were very hungry. This video can not be played Bill Whitehouse of the British Cave Rescue Council has been in touch with the divers They ask how long they have been underground and whether they can leave now. The divers tell them they have to wait, but say people will come back for them. One boy replies: ""Oh. See you tomorrow."" The search for the group had gripped the nation as it was unclear where they were or whether they were even still alive. Families of the missing group were ecstatic at news of their discovery. Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said of the boys' discovery that ""everybody is a hero"". ""Thank you all Thais, thank you all foreigners,"" he said. The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June. It is believed they entered the cave when it was dry and sudden heavy rains blocked the exit. They were found on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave. It is thought the boys could move through parts of the cave in dry conditions but rushing waters clogged the narrow passages with mud and debris, blocking visibility and access. This video can not be played Families of the boys have been celebrating after finding out their loved ones are alive One of the toughest stretches for the divers came as they neared the so-called Pattaya Beach - an elevated mound in the cave complex - where it was hoped the boys had sought refuge. Divers had to navigate a series of sharp, narrow bends in near-darkness. They completed the difficult journey to find Pattaya Beach flooded, so swam on and found the boys about 400m away. Bringing the trapped boys to safety is an extremely dangerous task given the conditions inside. The Tham Luang cave complex is regularly flooded during the rainy season which lasts until September or October. A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the missing children Experts have cautioned that taking inexperienced divers through the dangerous corridors of muddy, zero-visibility waters would be very risky. How will rescuers free the Thai boys? What to do to survive underground Thai boys 'could be in cave for months' Nine days of hope - images from the search Diver Ben Reymenants, who is assisting with the rescue mission, told the BBC that two Thai navy doctors had volunteered to stay with the boys for ""up to four months"" until the water receded. Other teams are still scouring the mountainside in the hope of finding another way into the cave. This video can not be played Diver Ben Reymenants is assisting with the rescue mission and says none of the boys can swim The 12 boys are all members of a local football team and their coach is known to have taken them on occasional excursions and field trips. Tinnakorn Boonpiem, whose 12-year-old son Mongkol is among the 13, told Agence France-Presse she was ""so glad"" to hear they were safe. ""I want him to be physically and mentally fit,"" she said. ""I'm so happy I can't put it into words,"" another relative of one of the group told reporters as tears of joy streamed down his cheeks. How will the boys cope?

He said: ""Like any other six-year-old, Alesha was looking forward to enjoying her holidays from primary school and was only a few days into a three-week summer break visiting relatives on the island. ""For such a young girl to have her life taken away is incomprehensible."" Police are now treating the death of Alesha MacPhail as murder Forensic teams have been carrying out investigations on the island Det Supt Houston said he was keen to speak to anyone who was involved in a search for Alesha that took place just before 06:00 on Monday. He said: ""I'm keen to find out who was there that has not engaged with the police yet, what areas they maybe searched and anything they may have seen or heard at the time.

Police want to speak to people involved in the search for Alesha before 06:00 on Monday Det Supt Houston said he wanted to hear from anyone who had seen or heard anything unusual at that time. He said police were exploring a number of lines of inquiry and were now trying to piece together the timeline between Alesha going missing and her body being discovered. He urged people to come forward with information, no matter how insignificant they may consider it to be. Referring to rumours that Alesha sleepwalked, Det Supt Houston said police were looking at all possibilities. He would not reveal the cause of death. A heavy police presence remains on the island Ch Supt Hazel Hendren, the local police commander for Argyll and Bute, said officers would be on patrol in the area all day and night.

Police forensic officers search a garden at a house on Ardbeg Road on the Isle of Bute She added: ""It's very important that people are vigilant. I would also ask the community and holidaymakers to look out for each other and please look out for your families and the security and safety of your homes."" ""Anything that is worrying or concerning please address the officers."" Bute is an island in the Firth of Clyde, easily accessible from the west of Scotland via a regular 35-minute ferry from Wemyss Bay in Inverclyde. The island has a population of about 6,500 people and the main town is Rothesay. It established a reputation as a popular tourist destination in the Victorian era. Generations of holidaymakers from the Glasgow area have made the trip ""doon the watter"" to Bute on a paddle-steamer. A policeman leaves balloons for a member of the public outside the house on Ardbeg Road Earlier, thehead teacher of the primary school attended by Alesha had described her as a ""happy, smiley"" girlwho would be ""greatly missed"". The primary school is in Airdrie where Alesha's mother, Georgina Lochrane, is understood to live. Reverend Owain Jones said people had been ""stunned"" by the death and subsequent murder investigation. He has opened his United Church of Bute in Rothesay to allow people to visit at any time. Rev Jones said: ""We're all absolutely staggered, we have no words for this and it's beyond any power of words to express. ""We're all just really sitting in a kind of shared stunned silence just trying to uphold each other. ""Bute is one of these places that is incredibly safe, you take all sorts of things for granted here and don't panic if you forget to lock the house or whatever."" Farmer David McVey told BBC Radio Scotland'sJohn Beattie programme: ""Everybody on the island is feeling it and it is so heart-breaking. Soft toys, flowers and dolls are among the items people have left near the police cordon ""It is tragic, absolutely tragic."" Mr McVey said the girls who help clean out his horses knew Alesha. And he said every conversation on the island inevitably turned to the murder. He added: ""I'm taking phone calls about other matters and the first thing people are talking about is what has happened. ""You genuinely feel like you want to start crying because it is so emotionally upsetting. ""It is just unbelievable.""

Westminster 'paedophile ring' accuser charged,"A man who alleged there was a paedophile ring at the heart of Westminster has been charged with perverting the course of justice. The man, known as Nick, whose real name is being withheld for legal reasons, is also accused of fraud. Nick's claims sparked an 18-month Scotland Yard inquiry into allegations public figures sexually assaulted children and three boys were murdered. The inquiry was dropped and Northumbria Police was asked to investigate Nick. Nick had claimed he was systematically abused and tortured by senior politicians and members of the armed forces during the 1970s and 1980s. Those he accused included former Conservative politicians Lord Brittan and Harvey Proctor, and Field Marshal Lord Bramall. Mr Proctor has welcomed the decision to prosecute Nick. After the Met launched Operation Midland in 2014 to investigate Nick's claims, they held a press conference where a senior detective described the allegations as ""credible and true"". In 2015, the Met carried out a series of high-profile dawn raids on the homes of those Nick had accused. All of them denied his allegations and the investigation was closed without anyone facing charges, having cost Â£2.5m. Last September, Northumbria Police passed a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to consider possible charges against Nick. On Tuesday, the CPS head of special crime said there was ""sufficient evidence"" to bring 12 charges of perverting the court of justice and one of fraud. Nick is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court ""in due course"". In a statement, Mr Proctor ""congratulated"" Northumbria Police for a ""thorough and robust"" investigation and said there must be no delays in arranging the trial. ""The torture that was and is Operation Midland should end as soon as is possible,"" he said, adding: ""Justice must now be allowed to take its course."" Daniel Janner, the son of the late peer Lord Janner, said in the light of the CPS charging decision he would no longer be attempting to bring a private prosecution against Nick over allegations he made against his father. The Met apologised for the way they had conducted Operation Midland and paid compensation to Lord Bramall and the family of Lord Brittan, who died in 2015. Mr Proctor is suing the Met for compensation. A report into Operation Midland, carried out by a retired High Court judge, said the force had made a series of errors in the investigation and made 25 recommendations on how police should handle similar allegations in the future.

BBC cuts gender pay gap to 7.6%,"BBC presenters including Mariella Frostrup (R), Kate Adie (C), Kate Silverton (C-L) and Naga Munchetty (L) in January ahead of MPs hearing evidence about BBC pay The BBC has reduced its median gender pay gap from 9.3% to 7.6%. The corporation has also reduced its mean pay gap from 10.7% to 8.4%. The improvements come ahead of the publication of the BBC's annual report next week, a year on from the first publication of the pay of on-air broadcasterspaid more than Â£150,000. Last year's salary disclosures prompted controversy over two separate issues - the gender pay gap and instances of unequal pay. The reduction over the past year, of around a fifth, marks a significant adjustment given it affects thousands of staff. However, the corporation has calculated that about a quarter of the improvement is owed to the merger between BBC Studios and BBC Worldwide. Of the remaining pay gap, the BBC calculates that 7.1% is accounted for by structural issues: too few women in leadership roles and more women than men in the lowest pay quartile. The BBC has marginally improved the representation of women in senior leadership positions, from 42.1% to 43.3%. Critics will argue that this last metric represents slow progress. The BBC has pledged to eradicate its gender pay gap by 2020. The national average is over 19%. Former China editor Carrie Gracie has won back pay from the BBC The gender pay gap at the BBC compares favourably with that at other media organisations. Senior figures at the BBC were frustrated by the fact that the corporation had to report its figures before others, leaving it relatively exposed. The reduction in the gender pay gap is the result of a range of measures. These include raising specific salaries in response to grievances over unequal pay, changing the framework and banding for some salaries, and simplifying several roles. The corporation endured months of adverse publicity after the salary disclosures last year, which were required of the BBC by the government in the most recent negotiation over renewal of its Royal Charter. The domination of men at the top of the list caused widespread concern over gender equality at the BBC. But it was the revelation that some women were paid significantly less than men for doing similar jobs - or the same jobs - that led to the largest outcry. Last week the BBC finally settled its grievance procedure withCarrie Gracie, the former China editor.

England fans dig deep for pricier pints,"England fans watching tonight's World Cup clash with Colombia in the pub may come home a little more out of pocket than expected. Pub chain Stonegate Pubs is charging up to 50p more for a pint during England's matches in some of its 690 pubs. The Sun said,externala Yates in Manchester was charging an extra 20p on drinks, while a Walkabout in Colchester added 25p and the Clock House in Harlow 50p. Stonegate said the price hike paid for door staff, plastic cups and cleaning so venues could meet a number of licensing requirements.

Firefighter wanted to drop stay-put advice,"Daniel Egan is the latest firefighter to give evidence to the inquiry Senior fire service officers wanted to abandon the policy of telling residents to 'stay put' as the deadly fire spread through Grenfell Tower, a public inquiry has heard. Daniel Egan, a senior fire safety officer, described the ""unbelievable"" screaming. He said as soon as he arrived at 01:58 on 14 June, his first thoughts were ""we needed to get everybody out"". The stay-put advice to residents was not abandoned until 02:47 that night. In his written statement, Mr Egan said he arrived at the tower to find firefighters lined up waiting to go inside ""like Roman centurions"". Mr Egan wrote: ""The reason LFB advice is to 'stay put' is because the building should have been compartmentalised. If this had worked, each flat should have been safe for at least an hour. ""However, the control room giving the advice couldn't see the fire."" Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal What happened at Grenfell Tower Visual guide to the fire Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast: Firefighter O'Beirne and Senior Fire Safety Officer Egan Mr Egan said he was not in a position to overrule the stay-put advice but he told a more senior officer, group manager Tom Goodall, that he thought they should tell people on the phone to get out if they could. ""I believe GM Tom Goodall agreed with me,"" he added. Mr Egan went on to say that he said the same thing to a station manager over the radio and spoke to an officer in the control room. ""One of these conversations was with an officer from Stratford. He wanted to know if the stay-put policy was in place,"" he said. ""I told him that I personally thought it should change but I said that I did not have the authority to change the advice."" Mr Egan said his advice to those on the ground talking to people on the phone who were still in the tower was to ""get out of the building"". ""I know that it was against what they should have been doing or what they were being told to do, but in that situation I told them to get out. ""I was doing what I felt was right.""

New generation of deodorant 'on the way'Scientists say they have found a new target for tackling body odour.,"Experts believe they have found a better way to tackle body odour (BO). The key, they say, is understanding how skin bacteria create the smell from virtually odourless armpit sweat. Two teams, at the Universities of York and Oxford, say they have now deciphered the first step in this molecular process. It could pave the way for a new generation of deodorants designed to block this unpleasant chain of events, the journaleLife,externalreports. Sweat is made by two types of glands on the skin: Eccrine glands, all over the body, produce sweat associated with exercise, which helps us keep cool and does not smell Apocrine glands, in the hairy armpits and genital areas, produce sweat containing a number of complex molecules - including proteins - that are odourless when secreted but can be turned into  BO by bacteria Even very small traces of the BO chemicals these bacteria produce can smell cheesy, sour, musky and onion-like. Deodorant uses perfume to mask the smell, plus ethanol or an antibacterial agent to kill the bacteria. Antiperspirants typically contain aluminium chloride, which reduces the amount of sweat released by temporarily plugging the skin pores that lead to the sweat glands. Co-author Dr Gavin Thomas, from the Department of Biology at the University of York, said: ""Modern deodorants act a bit like a nuclear bomb in our underarms, inhibiting or killing many of the bacteria present in order to prevent BO. ""Only a small number of the bacteria in our armpits are actually responsible for bad smells.""

Domestic abuse victim 'keeps hammer under bed',"Charlotte Rooks said she still lives in fear and worries Thomas will try to track her down A woman beaten with a hammer and forced to eat pictures of dead family members fears for her life after learning her ex-boyfriend is due to leave prison. Craig Thomas was jailed for 10 years in 2013 after holding Charlotte Rooks captive for four weeks, but is set to be released on licence. Miss Rooks said she was angry and upset after learning of Thomas's impending release via social media. The Ministry of Justice insisted it ""closely monitors"" abusers like Thomas. Miss Rooks said: ""I have made a will, I sleep with a hammer under my bed, we've got crowbars and an axe in the house. ""I've got CCTV cameras set-up in the house and alarms on the windows and doors as well as panic alarms, but I'm still petrified. ""If he doesn't kill me he'll kill someone else, and I believe that.

Domestic abuse 'tougher sentences needed' Abuse survivor was 'days from death' 'He hunted me down when I thought I was safe' Thomas pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm, wounding with intent and attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm. Thomas pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm in June 2013 and was jailed after subjecting Miss Rooks to several months of abuse in his flat in Llanishen, Cardiff. Among the catalogue of abuse she endured was being beaten on the stomach while pregnant, as Thomas yelled he would ""beat the baby out of her"". Miss Rooks added: ""He stabbed me on the back of my neck with a knife. He made me sleep standing up. ""I had family members who had died and he would rip up pictures of them and make me eat them.""

However, the IOPC said police did not attempt to speak to Miss Rooks in a separate room to her attacker, despite it being their policy to do so.

Man's boat 'seduction routine' went wrong,"Charlotte Brown texted friends during her date with Jack Shepherd A man's ""seduction routine"" went horribly wrong when his speedboat capsized on the Thames and his date was killed, a court has heard. Jack Shepherd, 30, of Paddington, is accused of Charlotte Brown's manslaughter after both fell from his boat on 8 December 2015. The pair went on the vessel after ordering two bottles of wine during dinner, the Old Bailey was told. Mr Shepherd denies manslaughter by gross negligence. Police were called to reports of someone in distress near Wandsworth Bridge at about 23:45 BST. Ms Brown, 24, from London, died later in hospital. The jury heard the pair had met hours earlier online and had been for a dinner at The Shard before going to Mr Shepherd's houseboat. They then allegedly took a bottle of champagne on board the web designer's speedboat for a ride towards Westminster and back. Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC told jurors ""the defendant's use of his speedboat to all intents and purposes as part of his seduction routine... went horribly wrong"". ""In pursuing that single-minded objective his attitude to safety and his responsibilities to all on board... was so significantly compromised that it resulted in the death of a young woman."" The Old Bailey heard before leaving the Shard, Ms Brown sent a message to her sister and her friend saying: ""He's taking me for a ride on his speedboat down the Thames. I'm sure it's safe and he's paying for my cab home."" More messages were exchanged as the night continued, with one saying they were on the boat with champagne, the jury heard. Jack Shepherd told police a reason for buying the boat was ""to pull women"", the court heard Mr Jafferjee said it had not been the first occasion Mr Shepherd had taken women on his speedboat. Mr Shepherd told police in an interview the day after the speedboat capsized that he bought it with the intention of ""trying to pull women"", the court heard. He allowed his date to take the wheel of the speedboat knowing she was affected by alcohol, Mr Jafferjee said, adding: ""It was cold, it was dark and it was, we submit, sheer madness. ""He did nothing to prevent her from speeding."" Jurors heard Mr Shepherd had been speeding at about twice the 12-knot limit that night. His boat also had a number of defects, with life jackets - although not a legal requirement - tucked away out of sight and their availability ""not made known to Charlotte"". The defendant had previously been stopped twice by police on the river who ""impressed upon him the importance of making sure life jackets were worn by those on board"", the court heard. The trial continues.

GoPro crumbling cliffs photo 'horrific',"The GoPro post has since been removed from its Facebook site A Facebook post by the action camera company GoPro showing a man dangling his legs over a cliff top has been condemned as ""horrific"" by the RNLI. The picture, which has since been removed from the social media site, was taken at Seven Sisters in East Sussex where signs warn of crumbling cliffs. Mark Sawyer of Eastbourne RNLI said: ""We see what's under the cliffs, at the bottom, how it's all underpinned."" GoPro has not commented despite requests from BBC South East. Dan Mikolics, who took the photograph, said he had assessed the risks and deemed it safe. Last summer a South Korean studentfell to her deathwhile posing for a photograph on the cliffs at Seven Sisters. An inquest heard how Hyewon Kim, 23, asked a stranger to take her picture, but as she jumped in the air for the shot she lost her footing and fell 200ft (60m). Three years earlier a large section of the coastline a short distance away at Birling Gap collapsed. It followed thewinter storms of 2013/14which were said to have caused seven years of erosion in just three months. On Monday, Newhaven Lifeboat said it had been ""diverted to two persons sat on the cliff edge"" at Seven Sisters the day before, warning the cliffs were ""constantly crumbling and extremely dangerous"".

Mr Sawyer said it was ""quite horrific"" to see the GoPro post, which was effectively encouraging others to do the same. ""That is not the sensible thing to do,"" he warned. Phil Boorman of Seaford Town Council added that GoPro's global reach could encourage copycat ""thrill-seekers"". ""Obviously we welcome people to come to our local coastlines - it's beautiful round here - but we want people to remain safe,"" he said.

Gmail messages 'read by third parties',"This video can not be played WATCH: How to hide your Gmails from prying eyes Google has confirmed that private emails sent and received by Gmail users can sometimes be read by third-party app developers, not just machines. People who have connected third-party apps to their accounts may have unwittingly given human staff permission to read their messages. One company told theWall Street Journal,externalthat the practice was ""common"" and  a ""dirty secret"". Google indicated that the practice was not against its policies. One security expert said it was ""surprising"" that Google allowed it. Gmail is the world's most popular email service with 1.4 billion users. Google lets people connect their account to third-party email management tools, or services such as travel planning and price comparisons. When linking an account to an external service, people are asked to grant certain permissions - which often include the ability to ""read, send, delete and manage your email"". Apps can request permission to read Gmail messages According to the Wall Street Journal, this permission sometimes allows employees of third-party apps to read users' emails. While messages are typically processed by computer algorithms, the newspaper spoke to several companies where employees had read ""thousands"" of email messages. Edison Software told the newspaper it had reviewed the emails of hundreds of users to build a new software feature. Another firm - eDataSource Inc - said engineers had previously reviewed emails to improve its algorithms. The companies said they had not asked users for specific permission to read their Gmail messages, because the practice was covered by their user agreements. ""You can spend weeks of your life reading terms and conditions,"" said Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey. ""It might well be mentioned in there, but it's not what you would think of as reasonable, for a human being in a third-party company to be able to read your emails."" Google said only companies that had been vetted could access messages, and only if users had ""explicitly granted permission to access email"". It pointed the BBC to its developer policies, which state: ""There should be no surprises for Google users: hidden features, services, or actions that are inconsistent with the marketed purpose of your application may lead Google to suspend your ability to access Google API Services."" It said Gmail users could visit theSecurity Check-up,externalpage to see which apps they had linked to their account, and revoke any they no longer wanted to share data with.

Labour reinstates suspended MP O'Mara,"Jared O'Mara was suspended by the Labour Party in October A Labour MP who was suspended over alleged misogynistic and homophobic comments has been reinstated. Jared O'Mara was suspended in October over a series of online posts and claims he verbally abused a woman. Following an investigation, the Labour Party has ruled Mr O'Mara should be issued with a formal warning and the party whip restored. The 36-year-old unseated the former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg as MP for Sheffield Hallam in June 2017. Yorkshire breaking news: Major fire at North Yorkshire school 'suspicious'; Murder investigation after woman's body found A Labour Party spokesman said: ""The disputes panel has ruled on the balance of the evidence that a formal warning should be issued and a mandatory requirement to attend training."" Mr O'Mara was suspended when a number of comments he posted online as a younger man were revealed by the Guido Fawkes website. In posts made on the Drowned in Sound music website in 2004, Mr O'Mara claimed singer Michelle McManus only won the television talent show Pop Idol ""because she was fat"". He also said it would be funny if jazz musician Jamie Cullum was ""sodomised with his own piano"" and joked about having an orgy with members of Girls Aloud. Allegations were also made against Mr O'Mara by Sophie Evans, who said she had met the MP on a dating app before he was elected, and that he had made comments to her that ""aren't broadcastable"". Mr O'Mara, who stood down from the Women and Equalities Committee after the remarks surfaced, has apologised for remarks in 2002 and 2004 but previously said he ""categorically denies"" Ms Evans' allegation. Penny Baker, the Liberal Democrat councillor for Stannington, said she was ""shocked"" to learn about Mr O'Mara's ""terrible"" comments, and accused Labour of not taking them seriously. Ms Baker said: ""With this hearing, Labour had the chance to set things straight, they didn't. ""This is allowing an MP who has offended countless people with his misogynistic and homophobic comments to continue to be a member of the Labour party."" She said people in the Sheffield Hallam ward ""deserve better"" than Mr O'Mara.

An Englishman's guide to penalty shootouts,"Now England are in the knockout stages of the World Cup, the team will face another potential hurdle during matches: extra time, and then - say it quietly - a penalty shootout. We all know England's shootout record at major tournaments is bad. In fact, it's theworst in the world. This is not a nice graphic if you're an England fan But that doesn't mean all English people are bad penalty takers. Step forward Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer. They've both been involved in England World Cup shootout defeats - Gary to West Germany in 1990 and Alan in the 1998 exit to Argentina. But they both scored their pens. We've got them to give us their top tips for penalty shootouts. The research works both ways, says Alan England number one Jordan Pickford will most likely be working closely with his coaches to work out where opponents like to put the ball. But, Shearer says, the team should make sure they are doing their homework the other way round too. ""Very much like the guy who's taking the penalty, the goalkeeper has a favourite side where he wants to dive as well,"" he says. ""He's done his homework on you. He knows where you've put your last few penalties. ""You should know the goalkeeper - his last five or 10 penalties, where he's dived"". Gary makes it sound so simple In such a high-pressured situation, how do you make sure you hit the ball where you want it to go? ""Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat,"" says Lineker. ""I always practised the penalty I was going to take in the game. ""I'd hit 30, 40 or 50 a day during the tournament, so I knew exactly what I was going to do."" Gary Lineker in 1990. He's not aged a day Lineker's repetition worked in the 1990 World Cup, when England's semi-final against West Germany ended in a shootout. He stepped up first. ""I'd practised a certain penalty low to the keeper's right, and so I said (to myself) 'Just hit exactly what you've prepared.' ""I hit it great, and scored."" This video can not be played Paul Gascoigne's tears in Italia '90 semi-final ""There's not an awful lot of chat"" in the build-up to the shootout, Shearer says. ""It's such a pressurised, nerve-wracking situation. ""You're aware that there's millions of people watching on TV and thousands of people in the stadium - but the most important people are your teammates and the coaches."" Bobby Robson - who maybe didn't have the wisest words before a shootout Lineker remembers the huddle in the centre circle before the shootout against West Germany. ""The manager Bobby Robson walked over to us and said 'Don't let me down, there are 30 million people watching this back home,' which is not really what you want to be reminded of. ""Peter Beardsley and myself burst out laughing, we thought it was hilarious. ""But it didn't work."" Lineker and Beardsley both scored, along with David Platt - but Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle missed, and England were knocked out. Chris Waddle in 1990: You don't want to look like this after taking a pen for England ""A shootout is totally different to a normal penalty - because you have to walk 50 yards to take it,"" says Lineker. ""You've got an eternity to think about what can go wrong or right. ""You don't know whether to break into a quick jog to get it over with, you don't know whether to walk. ""It seems to take forever. And all you really think is 'Please score. Please score.' ""Because anyone can miss a penalty. The important thing is to actually have the cojones to take one."" Alan Shearer in 1998: This is what you do want to look like post-penalty ""It's fatal to change your mind,"" says Shearer. In the 1998 World Cup last 16 match against Argentina which went to penalties, Shearer had already scored a penalty - in his favourite spot - during the match. So, come the shootout, England's number nine steps up again: ""And I'm thinking 'What do I do? The keeper knows that I've stuck it to his right on the first one. ""But I thought 'No, I'm going to stick to it. If I pick my spot, the goalkeeper should not get there.'"" This video can not be played Harry Kane picked the same spot for both of his penalties against Panama A few penalties down the line, and David Batty stepped up for England. ""I said 'If you're in any doubt whatsoever, put your head down, smash it straight down the middle as hard as you can,'"" says Shearer. ""He looked at me just before he set off to the penalty spot he said 'Yes that's what I'm going to do'."" But Batty didn't do that. He put it to the keeper's right and it was saved. ""I said to him afterwards 'What happened?' - and he said 'I don't know, I just changed my mind.'"" That decision was part of why England were knocked out of the World Cup. Let's hope we don't see the same outcome - again - this year. Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer were speaking to Newsbeat's Nick Rotherham. Words by Imran Rahman-Jones.

Hospital baby deaths probed by police,"Police will focus on eight unexplained deaths at the neonatal unit between June 2015 and July 2016 Baby deaths at a neonatal unit with a ""higher than usual"" mortality rate are to be investigated by police. Countess of Chester Hospitalreported""a greater number of baby deaths and collapses than normally expected"" between June 2015 and July 2016. The police probe will focus on eight deaths, but a further seven during the same period will also be reviewed. The hospital trust contacted police after a clinical review found no ""definitive explanation"" for the rise. Six non-fatal collapses - where a baby's breathing or heart rate drop to dangerous levels - will also be reviewed, Cheshire Constabulary said. A review by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health found ""no single cause"" to explain the increase in neonatal deaths on the unit, while it highlighted ""inadequate"" staffing levels. A hospital spokeswoman said: ""The trust and its doctors have continuing concerns about the unexplained deaths. ""As a hospital, we have taken the clinical review as far as we can. ""We have now asked for the input of Cheshire Police to seek assurances that enable us to rule out unnatural causes of death."" 2009 - 3 2010 - 1 2011 - 3 2012 - 3 2013 - 2 2014 - 3 2015 - 8 2016 - 5 The Countess of Chester, which looks after about 400 babies in its neonatal unit each year, stopped providing care for babies born earlier than 32 weeks in July last year. Any women expected to deliver earlier are transferred elsewhere. Since the change to admission arrangements there had been no deaths on the unit, the hospital spokeswoman added. Det Ch Supt Nigel Wenham said: ""We recognise that this investigation will have a significant impact on all of the families involved, staff and patients at the hospital and the public."" Parents of the babies are being updated on the investigation and will be supported throughout, he added. A solicitor for one family said: ""Clearly the death of any child is a tragedy, but this is exacerbated in circumstances where questions remain unanswered. ""However, we are reassured that all steps are now being taken to investigate these deaths in their entirety, and we are hopeful that the investigation can provide some answers for the families of these children.""

Baby death hospital staffing 'inadequate',"There were 13 unexplained deaths at the neonatal unit between January 2015 and July 2016 Staffing at a neonatal unit that reported a ""higher than usual"" number of baby deaths was ""inadequate"",a report said.,external A review by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said no ""definitive explanation"" was found for an increase in mortality rates at the Countess of Chester Hospital. There were 13 unexplained deaths between January 2015 and July 2016. The hospital said neonatal intensive care remained suspended. The review recommended increasing staffing and improving leadership. It found ""significant gaps"" in medical and nursing rotas, ""poor decision-making"" and ""insufficient senior cover"". Medical staffing was ""sufficient"" for a special care unit but ""inadequate"" for high dependency, the report said. Transport services in Cheshire and Merseyside were ""under-resourced"", it added. The Countess of Chester, which looks after about 400 babies a year, stopped providing care for babies born earlier than 32 weeks in July last year. Any women expected to deliver earlier were transferred to a neighbouring facility. The hospital said that while ""no single cause"" had been found to explain the increase in neonatal deaths on the unit, the change to admissions would remain in place ""until we are certain we have acted on all the recommendations in the review"". Hold external reviews of all 13 deaths Improve staffing levels Strengthen arrangements for investigating deaths Improve leadership Appoint two additional consultants Hold unit-wide debriefs for neonatal deaths Appoint a ""Children's Champion"" on the board Give ""early warning"" calls to transport team The review team said that there were no ""obvious factors"" linking the deaths. It recommended that all 13 be reviewed individually. Ian Harvey, medical director at the hospital, said it had ""acted swiftly"" and those reviews had now been completed. ""When we speak with parents we can now share full and accurate information, on an individual basis. We are desperately sorry for any distress or upset this review has caused. We know those families affected have been through so much already,"" he said. 2009 - 3 2010 - 1 2011 - 3 2012 - 3 2013 - 2 2014 - 3 2015 - 8 2016 - 5 The review said there was an ""enthusiastic"" group of paediatricians complemented by a ""well-led and supportive"" team of nurses. There was ""robust"" training and ""extremely positive"" relationships amongst various teams in the neonatal unit, it added. The Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said families left bereaved by the loss of their babies had always been its ""primary concern"", and it was already working to implement the Royal College's recommendations. Chief executive Tony Chambers said: ""It must have been devastating for them to lose their baby, and then face a period of not knowing.

Speedboat date woman was 'sure it's safe'Jack Shepherd denies the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown who fell into the River Thames in 2015.London,"Charlotte Brown texted friends during her date with Jack Shepherd A man's ""seduction routine"" went horribly wrong when his speedboat capsized on the Thames and his date was killed, a court has heard. Jack Shepherd, 30, of Paddington, is accused of Charlotte Brown's manslaughter after both fell from his boat on 8 December 2015. The pair went on the vessel after ordering two bottles of wine during dinner, the Old Bailey was told. Mr Shepherd denies manslaughter by gross negligence. Police were called to reports of someone in distress near Wandsworth Bridge at about 23:45 BST. Ms Brown, 24, from London, died later in hospital. The jury heard the pair had met hours earlier online and had been for a dinner at The Shard before going to Mr Shepherd's houseboat. They then allegedly took a bottle of champagne on board the web designer's speedboat for a ride towards Westminster and back. Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC told jurors ""the defendant's use of his speedboat to all intents and purposes as part of his seduction routine... went horribly wrong"". ""In pursuing that single-minded objective his attitude to safety and his responsibilities to all on board... was so significantly compromised that it resulted in the death of a young woman."" The Old Bailey heard before leaving the Shard, Ms Brown sent a message to her sister and her friend saying: ""He's taking me for a ride on his speedboat down the Thames. I'm sure it's safe and he's paying for my cab home."" More messages were exchanged as the night continued, with one saying they were on the boat with champagne, the jury heard. Jack Shepherd told police a reason for buying the boat was ""to pull women"", the court heard Mr Jafferjee said it had not been the first occasion Mr Shepherd had taken women on his speedboat. Mr Shepherd told police in an interview the day after the speedboat capsized that he bought it with the intention of ""trying to pull women"", the court heard. He allowed his date to take the wheel of the speedboat knowing she was affected by alcohol, Mr Jafferjee said, adding: ""It was cold, it was dark and it was, we submit, sheer madness. ""He did nothing to prevent her from speeding."" Jurors heard Mr Shepherd had been speeding at about twice the 12-knot limit that night. His boat also had a number of defects, with life jackets - although not a legal requirement - tucked away out of sight and their availability ""not made known to Charlotte"". The defendant had previously been stopped twice by police on the river who ""impressed upon him the importance of making sure life jackets were worn by those on board"", the court heard.

"Strictly's Horwood: Ballas should be paid lessPanellist says head judge Shirley Ballas should earn ""something lower"" based on her lack of TV experience.Entertainment & Arts","Revel Horwood earns between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 Strictly Come Dancing's Craig Revel Horwood says head judge, Shirley Ballas, should be paid ""something lower"" due to a lack of TV experience. The panellist has reignited the show's gender pay debate, after it was previously revealed Ballas was paid less than her predecessor, Len Goodman. Horwoodtold The Sun,externalthat Ballas's contribution to the show was not ""comparable"" to Goodman's. Former judge Arlene Phillips agreed, saying: ""I do think experience counts."" Ballas took on the role last year and her salary has not been revealed. Her agent told the BBC she would be making no comment. Goodman - who has now left the show - and fellow judge Bruno Tonioli were both in the Â£200,000-Â£250,000 bracketwhen the pay of BBC stars' earning more than Â£150,000 a year was revealed last year.

That's for sure. ""But what would you say to a woman coming in after you've been in the job for 15 years when they've done absolutely nothing to earn it? I don't think that's right."" Addressing Ballas' case directly, he said: ""You'd expect she would start on something lower because she's never been on TV before, the show's been going for 14 years. ""Len Goodman earned a major reputation and put the show on the map like we all did. We all created it from the beginning. And I don't think it's comparable. ""Sorry. It just isn't.""

Air pollution linked to child's deathAir pollution is linked to the asthma death of a nine-year-old girl who lived near to a busy London road.Science & EnvironmentWestminster 'paedophile ring' accuser chargedThe man had claimed he was abused and tortured by senior politicians and members of the armed forces.UK,"Ella wasn't born with asthma A nine-year-old girl's fatal asthma attack has been linked to illegally high levels of air pollution. Ella Kissi-Debrah lived 25m (80ft) from London's South Circular Road - a notorious pollution ""hotspot"". She experienced three years of seizures and hospital stays before her death in February 2013. During that time, local air pollution levels breached EU legal limits. No individual death has previously been directly linked to air pollution. According to a report by one of the UK's leading experts on asthma and air pollution, Prof Stephen Holgate, there was a ""striking association"" between Ella's emergency hospital admissions and recorded spikes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM10s, the most noxious pollutants. His report said there was a ""real prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died"". The evidence will be submitted in an appeal to the attorney general to re-open an inquest in to Ella's death. Ella often walked to school along the South Circular Road and Lewisham High Street, a journey that would take 30-40 minutes. Or she would be driven and have to sit for lengthy periods in traffic jams. Ella's lung collapsed in 2011 She was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit that followed a spike in air pollution levels. She was subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times over three years. Many of these coincided with recorded peaks in air pollution. Pollution linked to one in six deaths 'Asthma is a killer - it took away my miracle daughter' Asthma patients 'not receiving basic care' Her mother, Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, said she had resuscitated Ella between 20 and 30 times while waiting for an ambulance. She said that Ella had been treated in five separate hospitals but no medical professional had ever explained that air pollution could be making her asthma worse. ""I need to find out for myself why she died and what the causes are,"" Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said. ""I need this for my other children, in order to protect their health. ""I also believe there is a public interest in examining her death because if this direct link were made then the health of our children would have to be prioritised over other considerations including the convenience of drivers."" Human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn, from the firm Hodge Jones and Allen, is acting on behalf of the family. She said: ""It doesn't make sense that so much information is now available about the health impact of air pollution and the link to thousands of the deaths in the UK and yet there has been, as yet, no direct link made to an individual death. ""Ella's case illustrates the hard-hitting human impact of air pollution."" Thick mucus like this clogged Ella's lungs and eventually killed her Prof Holgate, from University Hospital Southampton, chaired the government's advisory committee on the effects of air pollution. In his report, he described exposure to air pollutants as a ""key driver"" of Ella's disease. ""Unlawful levels of air pollution contributed to the cause and seriousness of Ella's asthma in a way that greatly compromised her quality of life and was causative of her fatal asthma attack."" He examined records gathered by a government-monitored air pollution monitoring station in Catford, just one mile from Ella's house, and another three miles from her home. According to Prof Holgate, the fact the monitoring stations were so close to Ella's house meant the results, when combined with data from King's College London and correlated with Ella's hospital visits, were ""particularly insightful."" Spikes in air pollution coincided with all but one of Ella's hospital admissions. And she died after one of the ""worst air pollution episodes in her locality."" Prof Holgate examined other possible causes of Ella's condition but concluded the cause of death should be recorded as acute respiratory failure and severe asthma secondary to air pollution exposure. Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said she had noticed Ella's attacks could be worse when she had been near a busy road, that the fumes would affect her breathing. If she had been properly advised, she said, she would have looked at moving to a less polluted area and changing Ella's school. Ella with her twin brothers ""I would have made every effort to properly seal the house and close the windows when pollution levels were high,"" Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said. She has younger twins and her son has asthma, although not as seriously as Ella. She believes air pollution affects him. They now walk a different way to school, through a park instead of along the South Circular. According to a government report published in 2018, poor air quality has been classified as the largest environmental risk to public health in the UK. The EU limits on air pollution are set out in Article 13 of the European Directive of 2008. But World Health Organization guidelines indicate that adverse health effects occur at lower levels than the EU limits. Ms Cockburn said: ""The government has willingly presided over illegal EU air quality limits since 2010 and this ongoing failure is costing lives. ""There needs to be an immediate sea change in how air pollution is dealt with in our cities. ""I believe there are strong grounds for Ella's inquest to be quashed on the basis that her right to life (Article Two of the Human Rights Act) may have been breached by the government's failure to act in relation to unlawful air pollution levels."" The attorney general's office said: ""In considering whether to grant his consent to an application, the attorney general must be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of the application succeeding in the High Court.""

Westminster 'paedophile ring' accuser chargedThe man had claimed he was abused and tortured by senior politicians and members of the armed forces.UK,"A man who alleged there was a paedophile ring at the heart of Westminster has been charged with perverting the course of justice. The man, known as Nick, whose real name is being withheld for legal reasons, is also accused of fraud. Nick's claims sparked an 18-month Scotland Yard inquiry into allegations public figures sexually assaulted children and three boys were murdered. The inquiry was dropped and Northumbria Police was asked to investigate Nick. Nick had claimed he was systematically abused and tortured by senior politicians and members of the armed forces during the 1970s and 1980s. Those he accused included former Conservative politicians Lord Brittan and Harvey Proctor, and Field Marshal Lord Bramall. Mr Proctor has welcomed the decision to prosecute Nick. After the Met launched Operation Midland in 2014 to investigate Nick's claims, they held a press conference where a senior detective described the allegations as ""credible and true"". In 2015, the Met carried out a series of high-profile dawn raids on the homes of those Nick had accused. All of them denied his allegations and the investigation was closed without anyone facing charges, having cost Â£2.5m. Last September, Northumbria Police passed a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to consider possible charges against Nick. On Tuesday, the CPS head of special crime said there was ""sufficient evidence"" to bring 12 charges of perverting the court of justice and one of fraud. Nick is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court ""in due course"". In a statement, Mr Proctor ""congratulated"" Northumbria Police for a ""thorough and robust"" investigation and said there must be no delays in arranging the trial. ""The torture that was and is Operation Midland should end as soon as is possible,"" he said, adding: ""Justice must now be allowed to take its course."" Daniel Janner, the son of the late peer Lord Janner, said in the light of the CPS charging decision he would no longer be attempting to bring a private prosecution against Nick over allegations he made against his father. The Met apologised for the way they had conducted Operation Midland and paid compensation to Lord Bramall and the family of Lord Brittan, who died in 2015. Mr Proctor is suing the Met for compensation.

Strictly's Horwood: Ballas should be paid less,"Revel Horwood earns between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 Strictly Come Dancing's Craig Revel Horwood says head judge, Shirley Ballas, should be paid ""something lower"" due to a lack of TV experience. The panellist has reignited the show's gender pay debate, after it was previously revealed Ballas was paid less than her predecessor, Len Goodman. Horwoodtold The Sun,externalthat Ballas's contribution to the show was not ""comparable"" to Goodman's. Former judge Arlene Phillips agreed, saying: ""I do think experience counts."" Ballas took on the role last year and her salary has not been revealed. Her agent told the BBC she would be making no comment. Goodman - who has now left the show - and fellow judge Bruno Tonioli were both in the Â£200,000-Â£250,000 bracketwhen the pay of BBC stars' earning more than Â£150,000 a year was revealed last year.

That's for sure. ""But what would you say to a woman coming in after you've been in the job for 15 years when they've done absolutely nothing to earn it? I don't think that's right."" Addressing Ballas' case directly, he said: ""You'd expect she would start on something lower because she's never been on TV before, the show's been going for 14 years.

'Gay conversion therapy' to be banned,"Controversial ""gay conversion therapies"" are to be banned as part of a government plan to improve the lives of gay and transgender people. A national survey,externalof 108,000 members of the LGBT community suggested 2% have undergone the practice with another 5% having been offered it. It also found more than two-thirds of LGBT people avoid holding hands in public, for fear of negative reactions. The prime minister said nobody ""should ever have to hide who they are"". A 75-point plan to improve the lives of LGBT people, costing Â£4.5m, has been produced in response to the survey. It includes plans to introduce a national LGBT health adviser, tackle discrimination, improve the response to hate crime and to improve diversity in education institutions. Theresa May has also launched a 16-week public consultation in England and Wales about the process of gender reassignment after research showed that trans people find it ""overly bureaucratic and invasive"". The charity Stonewall said there were still ""pockets of society"" where the LGBT community was ""far from safe"". Instagram sorry for removing gay kiss photo Why LGBT people need alcohol-free safe spaces Surviving 'gay conversion therapy' This video can not be played Cumbria dairy farmer tells of struggle to come out As part of the plan, it said it would ""consider all legislative and non-legislative options to prohibit promoting, offering or conducting conversion therapy"". While the government did not offer a definition of ""conversion therapy"", its report said it ""can range from pseudo-psychological treatments to, in extreme cases, surgical interventions and 'corrective' rape"". Faith organisations were by far the most likely to have carried out the practice, according to the report. It is often either forced on people or they go voluntarily. The NHS does not refer people for it and disagrees with the practice. Equalities minister Penny Mordaunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme of the practice: ""This is very extreme so-called therapy that is there to try and 'cure' someone from being gay - of course you can't cure someone from being gay. In its most extreme form it can involve corrective rape. ""That's very different from psychological services and counselling. It's pretty unpleasant, some of the results we found, and it shows that there's more action to do."" She said the government is consulting on the best way to implement a ban, adding: ""It's absolutely right that that abhorrent practice has to go."" Journalist Patrick Strudwick, who went undercover to expose so-called conversion therapists, said he has ""seen, and felt, the damage it does"", writing: ""Conversion therapy does need to be banned. It is abuse."" He said it would be difficult to do so though, with the government recognising the scale of the issue. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jayne Ozanne, a member of the Church of England's general synod who went through the ""therapy"", told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""I went through this because I believed - as many do - that being gay was sinful."" This video can not be played âI had exorcisms to âcureâ me of being gayâ She added: ""The key problem is that it causes great harm. There are many, many young people suffering mental issues, self-harm, suicidal tendencies as a result of this, because they feel so guilty when it doesn't work."" Vicky Beeching sought therapy as a teenager, but the experience led to depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and physical health symptoms. ""This is devastating,"" she said of such practices. ""People's lives are literally in the balance."" Dr Louise Theodosiou of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which ""100% backs the ban"", told the programme: ""There's no evidence base to support this therapy. Your sexuality and your gender ID are inherent and there's no evidence base and no therapeutic treatment to change what is simply part of someone's nature."" By Michelle Roberts, BBC News online health editor Sometimes called ""reparative"" or ""gay cure"" therapy, conversion therapy is a term used for any form of so-called treatment which attempts to change sexual orientation or reduce attraction to others of the same sex. Experts say the word therapy is misleading because there is no scientific basis for it Allmajor therapy professional bodies,externalas well as the NHS in the UK disagree with it on logical, ethical and moral grounds. Stonewall says,externalthat ""no one should be told their identity is something that can be cured"". Those identifying as gay or lesbian made up 61% of respondents to the survey, carried out between July and October last year. Just over a quarter identified as bisexual and a small number identified as pansexual (4%) and asexual (2%). People identifying as transgender accounted for 13% of respondents. A quarter of those who took part in the survey said they were not open at all about being LGBT with family members they lived with. Of the trans men who took part in the survey, 56% said they had avoided expressing their gender identity for fear of a negative reaction from others. That figure rose to 59% for trans women and 76% for non-binary respondents. LGBT hate incidents had been experienced by 40% of people in the survey, with more than nine in 10 of the most serious offences going unreported. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We can be proud that the UK is a world leader in advancing LGBT rights, but the overwhelming response to our survey has shone a light on the many areas where we can improve the lives of LGBT people. ""I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction. ""No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love."" Ruth Hunt, chief executive of Stonewall, said she was pleased the government was listening to the LGBT community,. But she added there was ""still a long way to go until we reach full equality"". Campaigner Peter Tatchell welcomed the government trying to ban conversion therapy. But he said the 75 point-plan did not go far enough. ""The biggest fail is the lack of any pledge to end the detention and deportation of LGBT+ refugees fleeing persecution in violently homophobic countries like Uganda, Iran, Russia, Egypt and Jamaica,"" he said. ""Another big omission is the absence of any commitment to compensate gay and bisexual men who were convicted under past anti-gay laws.""

Court action to save young from climate bill,"Plan B during a preliminary court hearing An activist group hopes to sue the UK government over climate change, arguing that it is discriminating against the young by failing to cut emissions fast enough. The campaigners - known collectively as Plan B - argue that if the UK postpones emissions cuts, the next generation will be left to pick up the bill. It is seeking permission from a judge to launch formal legal action. The government has promised to review its climate commitments. A spokesperson said it was committed to tackling emissions. But Plan B believes ministers may breach the law if they don't cut emissions deeper - in line with an international agreement made in Paris at the end of 2015 to restrict global temperature rise to as close to 1.5C as possible. A hearing is set to be held on Wednesday at the High Court. Netherlands ordered to cut emissions Is the Dutch court ruling 'a game changer'? Call to 'sue ministers' over climate Young will pick up 'climate change bill' The UK is currently committed to cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change. The government has agreed to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050. Plan B says this target is too weak to comply with the global agreement made in Paris. It will argue that the UK is: Failing to make a fair contribution to the global challenge of climate change Acting irrationally given the severity of the threat Acting in a discriminatory fashion towards the young Breaching people's fundamental human rights to family life and to property Plan B is a tiny legal group funded by crowdsourcing. It says that Plan A - relying on governments to solve the climate challenge - is failing, so a Plan B, involving legal action, is needed. It's making the legal approach with 11 citizens aged from 9-79. One of them owns a home in the British Virgin Islands which was damaged by Hurricane Irma. Hurricanes may get stronger as the ocean heats. Plan B's founder Tim Crosland told BBC News: ""The government has got to take this issue more seriously. We're worried that the Treasury is trying to put a block on measures to protect the climate."" The UK has lost court cases recently for failing to meet EU air pollution limits. The Plan B case is much less clear-cut. But climate court cases are emerging round the world. In Holland, a group called Urgenda won a case in which the judge ordered the Dutch government to raise the ambition of its climate targets. The Dutch government has appealed the ruling, and a decision is pending. A UK government spokesperson said it would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing court case, but stated that the UK would seek advice on the UK's climate targets after a big international meeting to discuss the 1.5C ambition in the Paris agreement later in the year. ""We are a world leader on clean growth, and since 1990 have reduced carbon emissions by more than 40% - faster than any other G7 country,"" the spokesperson said. Ministers have previously said they'll review their targets in the light of the 1.5C goal. Plan B complains that the government hasn't actually commissioned a review. It says ministers haven't set any terms of reference, and they haven't set a time frame for it. Last week, the government was rebuked by its own climate advisers for failing to cut emissions in line with its current commitments, and for passing the buck to the next generation.

"Don't push May too far, Tory MPs warnedAccept a compromise customs plan or risk having a ""watered-down"" Brexit, Lord Hague warns MPs.UK PoliticsComments","Lord Hague said Brexit was coming and Tory MPs needed to compromise Tory MPs have been urged to accept a ""compromise"" customs plan proposed by No 10 or face having a ""watered-down"" Brexit forced on them by Parliament. Ex-leader Lord Hague said if Brexiteers pushed Theresa May too hard, it would increase the chance of the Commons voting to stay in the customs union. A No 10 source said the ""best of both worlds"" plan offered the opportunity for friction-free trade with the EU and the scope to strike deals elsewhere. Ministers will discuss it on Friday. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what the future relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. Pienaar: New trade plan explained Firms 'running out of patience' on Brexit Reality Check: The government's customs options Ministers have so far failed to agree what type of customs model to pursue. The decision is seen as being key to facilitating trade and to avoiding new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU. Friday's Cabinet meeting at Chequers will be followed by a White Paper setting out details of the UK's future relations with the EU, aimed at paving the way for an agreement in the autumn. This video can not be played May: Brexit means Brexit does mean Brexit No details have yet been announced about how the new proposed system will work although a No 10 source has promised it will be a ""significant step forward"". BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar said key to the proposal would be a single market trade deal on goods - although it would not be called a single market because that suggests close ties to the EU. It would also include the agriculture and food sector to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland - but not necessarily the financial services industry, he said. On customs, the UK would apply EU tariffs except where it can secure international trade deals, he added - with ""some concession"" in the area of free movement of people also expected. The prime minister's ""big gamble"" is whether her cabinet will buy her plan, our correspondent said. Leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that such an arrangement would be ""deeply unsatisfactory"". Mr Rees-Mogg - who has been accused of ""threatening"" Theresa May over Brexit - said he was simply ""supporting the prime minister in what she's previously said"". Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The Dutch prime minister has been pressing Theresa May for more clarity about her plans BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The immediate problem with the ""new plan"" is whether or not it really exists. Because while Number 10 says it does, ask other people in government and they are not quite so sure. Ministers who you might have thought would be aware of the detail like - oh, you might imagine - the Brexit secretary had not agreed the lines, before Number 10 made their intervention. And it's said that the reason he has not been involved in agreeing the ""new plan"" is because it does not actually exist yet. The customs decision expected in some parts of government therefore is what has been anticipated for some time as ""max fac plus"" - a souped up version of the proposal that originally won the day in the Brexit subcommittee what feels like a lifetime ago - with, you assume, a long lead-in time while the technology is made to work. Baffled? Quite possibly so. But it's perhaps only safe to say that four days before ministers are expected to actually make some final decisions, all is not precisely as you might have expected. Read the rest of Laura's blog But former foreign secretary Lord Hague, a life-long Eurosceptic who campaigned to remain in 2016, has said the Brexiteers should be careful what they wish for. In an article for the Daily Telegraph,external, he said they did not have the numbers in Parliament to force through a ""hard Brexit"" - leaving the UK without any deal over market access or long-term customs arrangements. ""If ardent Brexiteers push too hard, they will end up without their main objective,"" he wrote. ""If there is no agreement this week on a plan for customs arrangements, the Commons will be much more likely to vote in the near future to stay in the customs union in its entirety. ""The choice is either to back a compromise plan now or to end up with a more watered-down version of Brexit that would be forced on ministers anyhow."" This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? The government is committed to leaving the current customs union but the two alternatives it proposed last year, a so-called customs partnership and maximum facilitation system, are believed to now be regarded as practically or politically undeliverable. Brexit: All you need to know On Monday, amid signs of growing Tory divisions, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke up in defence of his ""principled"" colleague Mr Rees-Mogg who had been criticised by other government ministers for his Daily Telegraph article. Brexit minister Steve Baker said Mr Rees-Mogg was right to air his concerns. Lord Hague said the ""sensible middle"" in his party would not forgive anything which destabilised Mrs May's position at such a critical time in the negotiations or was seen as ""naked"" political manoeuvring. ""Everyone threatening Theresa May with chaos, revolt, resignations and a leadership election if she does not do as they wish needs to think carefully about what might be the consequences of their actions,"" he said. The prime minister visited Dutch leader Mark Rutte on Tuesday although No 10 has insisted that no foreign leader will be given sight of the UK's latest plans before they are discussed at Cabinet. Mr Rutte said: ""We urgently need clarity about every aspect of the future relationship between the EU and UK and we are working very hard to achieve it."" Mrs May said she wanted to secure ""a future relationship that reflects the close ties we have with the Netherlands"".

"Spotify users demand Drake refundsSpotify's promotion of the singer, even on ad-free accounts, prompted some fans to ask for money back.","Drake became the face of Spotify's playlists - even when his music didn't feature on them Drake's new album Scorpion has only been out since Friday, but it's already made history. The album broke streaming records on both Apple Music and Spotify, with more than 302m plays in a single day. But some users complained that Spotify put his photo on hundreds of playlists - including ones that didn't feature his music, such as ""Best of British"". Subscribers who'd paid for premium, ad-free accounts said it amounted to advertising and demanded refunds. One subscriber said he had been offered one month's free subscription as a result of his complaint. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Standout moments from Drake's Scorpion Drake fans are feeling all of the emotions Drake goes back to Degrassi in new video Other subscribers who attempted to submit a claim got mixed results: Some were given a month's free subscription, while others had their request denied. Spotify declined to comment on the situation; but the BBC understands no official refund policy has been put in place - and that the number of complaints has been relatively small. That does not rule out some customer service assistants offering refunds on a case-by-case basis; but it seems most people were relaxed about the takeover. In fact, they streamed his album more than any other in history.According to Billboard,external, Scorpion broke Spotify's one-week streaming record in just three days - racking up 431m streams over the weekend. In the UK, the album is set to reach number one  - beating new releases by Florence + The Machine and Gorillaz. All 25 of its tracks would appear in the top 40, if the chart rules hadn't been changed last year to prevent such a phenomenon. Meanwhile, Drake has quietly tweaked the record since its release; with an updated version of the record appearing on streaming services on Monday.

Lantern event is 'fire risk' to moorland,"Chinese, or sky, lanterns have been banned in some parts of the country There are calls for a sky lantern festival to be cancelled in the Peak District following major fires across moorland in England. The Lights Fest is due to be held at Buxton Raceway, close to the moors in Derbyshire, on 28 July. The Peak District National Park said moorland fires were ""lethal"" to wildlife and lanterns only increased the risk. The event organiser said the lanterns it uses do not pose a fire hazard. Live updates from the East Midlands Ruth George, the Labour MP for High Peak, said the festival should be cancelled due to the fire risk in the heart of the ""environmentally sensitive"" Peak District and has written to the organisers asking them to withdraw the event. Derbyshire Fire & Rescue also said it was trying to dissuade the organisers from going ahead following wildfires at Saddleworth Moor and Winter Hill. Derbyshire Fire & Rescue do not want fires to break out in the Peak District The Derbyshire Events Safety Advisory Group said it had also expressed its concerns to the organisers and is awaiting a ""definitive fire risk assessment"". The Peak District National Park said sky lanterns increased the risk of fire on dry moorland and were ""devastating to the landscape, lethal for wildlife and a threat to people and homes"". The Lights Fest, which is run by a US-based company, has not responded to questions asked by the BBC. However, on its website it claims its ""flame retardant"" lanterns are biodegradable with a ""limited burn time"" and are therefore not a fire hazard. The owner of the proposed venue, Buxton Raceway, has yet to comment. Mayor makes moor blaze 'air support' plea Saddleworth Moor fire crews 'pushed to limits' Worcester council agrees sky lantern ban An industry code of practice, introduced in 2014, requires sky lanterns to be manufactured so they are safe and biodegradable and also calls for them to be sold responsibly. Some retailers have stopped selling them altogether and a number of local authorities and event organisers have banned them. Despite the code, theNational Fire Chiefs Council,externalremains opposed to their use. A similar event at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, was cancelled following a petition which claimed the lanterns could hurt livestock and cause damage to plants and properties.

Firefighter wanted to drop stay put advice,"Daniel Egan is the latest firefighter to give evidence to the inquiry Senior fire service officers wanted to abandon the policy of telling residents to 'stay put' as the deadly fire spread through Grenfell Tower, a public inquiry has heard. Daniel Egan, a senior fire safety officer, described the ""unbelievable"" screaming. He said as soon as he arrived at 01:58 on 14 June, his first thoughts were ""we needed to get everybody out"". The stay-put advice to residents was not abandoned until 02:47 that night. In his written statement, Mr Egan said he arrived at the tower to find firefighters lined up waiting to go inside ""like Roman centurions"". Mr Egan wrote: ""The reason LFB advice is to 'stay put' is because the building should have been compartmentalised. If this had worked, each flat should have been safe for at least an hour. ""However, the control room giving the advice couldn't see the fire."" Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal What happened at Grenfell Tower Visual guide to the fire Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast: Firefighter O'Beirne and Senior Fire Safety Officer Egan Mr Egan said he was not in a position to overrule the stay-put advice but he told a more senior officer, group manager Tom Goodall, that he thought they should tell people on the phone to get out if they could. ""I believe GM Tom Goodall agreed with me,"" he added. Mr Egan went on to say that he said the same thing to a station manager over the radio and spoke to an officer in the control room. ""One of these conversations was with an officer from Stratford. He wanted to know if the stay-put policy was in place,"" he said. ""I told him that I personally thought it should change but I said that I did not have the authority to change the advice."" Mr Egan said his advice to those on the ground talking to people on the phone who were still in the tower was to ""get out of the building"". ""I know that it was against what they should have been doing or what they were being told to do, but in that situation I told them to get out. ""I was doing what I felt was right.""

Thousands 'falsely claim domestic abuse'Charity says thousands of parents are misusing domestic abuse orders to access legal aid.Family & Education,"Thousands of parents falsely claim domestic abuse in order to access legal aid and stop estranged partners from seeing their children, a shared parenting charity claims. Families Need Fathers says parents are being encouraged by some solicitors to file for non-molestation orders - injunctions used in urgent abuse cases. New figures show a 30% rise in orders made after legal aid was axed in everything but abuse cases in family courts in 2012. Some 25,700 were made in England and Wales in 2017, and 6,699 in the first quarter of 2018. The changes to legal aid qualification in England and Wales were designed to reduce the number of cases in family courts, with separating couples being encouraged to attend mediation sessions instead, and to cut the legal aid bill. But charity case workers say they are seeing ""thousands"" of parents, mainly fathers, who have been made subject to these orders for things that they do not consider to be domestic abuse. These could be angry comments thrown in the midst of the break-up or dealing with child access arrangements or unpleasant text messages, they say. The charity suspects that solicitors' firms are talking parents into seeking such orders because it enables them to qualify for legal aid, from which both the legal profession and the complainant could benefit. A spokesman for the charity said: ""We're getting a lot of people coming to us talking about false allegations, whether it's grossly exaggerating events or even completely fabricating them. ""And yet the impact of the order can take a parent down a path that can be very difficult to return from."" Jerry Karlin, chairman of Families Need Fathers, said the result of the government's ""well-intended but ill-conceived changes"" to the family courts system was a 30% increase in non-molestation orders (NMOs) to 25,000 a year. There had also a been 20% rise in private family court applications over the last two years, he added. ""These (NMOs) are used in allegations of abuse and they don't have to be true to obtain access to legal aid."" The orders can lead to parents not being allowed to collect their children from school ""Non-molestation orders have gone up by several hundred per cent since the legal aid changes in some districts,"" he added. NMOs work like injunctions and are designed to protect domestic abuse victims from further harm in emergency situations. The charity stresses that they are useful in genuine cases of abuse, but is concerned that the way they are administered leaves them open to exploitation. For example They are often granted in the absence of the person being accused of abuse (the respondent) and without accusations of domestic abuse being proven The making of an order then also enables the complainant to draw on thousands of pounds in legal aid which can also be used in any subsequent family law cases The respondent would not be automatically entitled to legal aid, however, and often has to represent themselves The level of evidence required is fairly low and can relate to claims about verbal abuse, unwanted text messages or emails In some regions of England and Wales the increase has been as much as 900%. In others there has been a 150% rise, according to information obtained by Families Need Fathers. Once an order is made, there is a brief ""return"" hearing two weeks later but the case is then usually adjourned for about six months. During this time every agency related to the the respondent and his family, such as the police, school and local council, is notified. This can lead not only to the parent being physically separated from their children but being ostracised by the agencies involved with them. After about six months, usually, a fact-finding hearing is held at which the evidence of the applicant's claim is meant to be heard. But quite often, just as the initial order is made in the absence of the respondent, the fact-finding hearing is held in their absence as well. A judgement is then made on whether the order should continue. At this point it can be used to restrict a parent from spending time with his or her child and to delay the process of arranging contact. 'He hunted me down when I thought I was safe' 'My baby helped me stop my domestic abuse' The appalling cost of domestic abuse The outgoing president of the High Court's family division, Sir James Munby, described false allegations as a ""vice in the system"". He also said that the judiciary had recently realised that ""a wrongly granted without notice order sets the tone of proceedings thereafter"". He tried to crack down on the use of such orders, reminding courts that it was for the applicant to prove their claims rather than for the respondent to disprove them. His successor, Sir Andrew McFarlane, who is taking over the role in July, appeared to back some of the charity's claims on the harmful effects of such orders in a recent speech. He called for the facts of a case to be established much more quickly than happens at present. Whether there are serious domestic abuse allegations or not, it does not help either parent or the children for the hearing of the contested factual issues to be adjourned again and again, he said. And Sir Andrew cited a case in which a father was subject to a continuing non-molestation injunction preventing him from having any contact with his children for a period of years. ""That injunction had been based upon the untested and contested factual allegations which were never tried,"" he said. ""Until the factual context is clarified and determined by the court, the arrangements for the children cannot move on and develop in a way which reflects the risk or lack of risk, arising from the facts as they are found to be,"" he added. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said there may be various reasons for an increase in the issuing of such orders - including greater awareness of domestic abuse and of how it can be addressed. He added: ""Non-molestation orders are an important means of protecting individuals in abusive situations. ""When deciding whether to grant a non-molestation order, the judge will consider all the circumstances, including the need to secure the health, safety and wellbeing of the applicant and any children."" The court has the power to discharge an order if the respondent makes an application and this is found to be justified. Domestic abuse charity Women's Aid said the rise in NMOs needed to be put in the context of statistics showing record numbers of domestic-abuse related incidents. The number rose from 796,935 in 2011-12 to 1.1 million in 2016-17 in England and Wales. Katie Ghose, chief executive ofWomen's Aid,externalsaid: ""We know from our work with survivors that non-molestation orders can be a vital tool to protect victims from experiencing further abuse or harassment from a former partner. ""Non-molestation orders are only granted by the courts in cases where a judge is satisfied an order is required to keep a victim of domestic abuse safe. ""We are not aware of any cases where mothers have falsely applied for non-molestation orders. ""We know from our work with survivors that non-molestation orders can be difficult to obtain and the court process itself can be distressing for victims. ""There has been a small increase in the number of non-molestation orders applied for and being granted since these orders first came into force in 2003. ""Given that the police are recording record numbers of domestic abuse-related incidents and offences, we would expect the number of non-molestation orders being applied for and granted to increase over this period as more victims have the courage to report to the police and seek protection through the justice system.""

Ex-football coach guilty of sex abuseFormer youth coach George Ormond is convicted of abusing boys between 1973 and 1998.Tyne & Wear,"George Ormond was convicted of 36 offences A youth football coach who went on to work for Newcastle United has been convicted of a string of sex abuse offences spanning 25 years. George Ormond ""used his position of power"" to abuse 18 boys and young men between 1973 and 1998, Newcastle Crown Court heard. The 62-year-old had denied all charges but was convicted of 35 charges of indecent assault and one of indecency. At the end of the six-week trial, he was cleared of two further charges. Ormond will be sentenced on Wednesday. He coached a grassroots football club in the 1970s and 80s before going on to work for Newcastle United's youth system in the 1990s as what was described in court as a ""kit man, gopher and dogsbody"". George Ormond was jailed in 2002 for sex offences The jury heard Ormond ""manipulated his position"" and held out ""glittering future"" to young players, but could block their progress if they stood up against him. The abuse took place at summer camps and in the back of his car. He would indecently touch boys while massaging them or treating them for injuries and insist on them not wearing anything under their shorts, then check they had followed the rule. During the trial, John Carver, who was Newcastle United's Centre of Excellence director in the 1990s, said he had respected and trusted Ormond and was ""extremely shocked"" when an allegation of abuse against him emerged. He said he used new FA regulations that coaches involved in youth teams needed to have qualifications as a ""way of getting George out of the football club"". The latest investigation into Ormond was sparked in 2016 by media reports of a sex abuse scandal in professional football. One of his accusers said he spoke out after seeing Andy Woodward discuss about being abused by another coach, Barry Bennell, on the Victoria Derbyshire programme in 2016. Derek Bell was abused by George Ormond but was ""too scared"" to speak out at the time Former Newcastle United player Derek Bell has waived anonymity to speak out about how he was abused by George Ormond between the ages of 12 and 16. He said: """"He used to say 'Listen, if you don't perform these acts on me then I'm not going to play you. I'm going to tell the scouts that your attitude is bad and I'll not play you for months'."" Years later, Mr Bell decided to confront his abuser and went to his house with a hidden tape recorder. He said: ""He never said sorry, but I actually caught him on tape saying 'Yes, I did do it'."" Mr Bell played that tape to his friends, who convinced him to take it to the police. Ormond was arrested and stood trial for the first time in 2002. Read more about Derek Bell's ordeal at the hands of Ormond here. Det Supt Mick Paterson, from Northumbria Police, said: ""These young men had had ambition, they had dreams of going on to glittering footballing careers. ""Ormond was able - because he is a predatory paedophile - to have those dreams in his hands."" Helen Westerman, from the NSPCC, described Ormond's abuses as ""absolutely shocking and sickening"". She said he ""systematically abused"" the boys and then ""silenced them through threats, through blackmail, and telling them that their football career could be jeopardised"". In 2002, Ormond was jailed for six years after being found guilty of abusing seven boys under 16 between 1975 and 1999. Newcastle United said it had fully co-operated with police and the FA, but declined to comment further. The FA said it ""welcomes"" the verdict and ""acknowledges the traumatic experience the victims and survivors have endured"". It advised victims to speak to Clive Sheldon QC whose team is conducting the independent enquiry into allegations of non-recent child sexual abuse in football.

Water companies 'have damaged trust',"High levels of payments to bosses and investors by water companies have damaged customer trust, the regulator Ofwat has said. It has published new rules that will force firms to explain how executive pay is linked to performance and to prioritise customers' interests. Companies paying dividends above 5% will have to explain why that benefits customers - and not just investors. And they will have to explain how their bosses' pay levels benefit customers. The new rules come as the bosses of several water firms prepare to be quizzed by MPs. The company chiefs will be facing the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee later. Ofwat chief executive Rachel Fletcher said: ""The decisions some water companies have made on dividends, financial structures and top executive pay have damaged customer trust."" She added the move was ""an important step in making sure water companies put customers' interests and those of future generations, at the heart of all the decisions they take"". The Consumer Council for Water welcomed Ofwat's move.  Its chief executive, Tony Smith, said: ""It is vital that water companies' financial behaviour is legitimate in the eyes of customers, and that shareholders and executives are not seen to be rewarded for poor or mediocre performance."" He called it a ""long-overdue effort"" to redress the balance and restore trust in the water industry"". Ofwat's new rules,externalwill govern the period 2020 to 2025. Water companies have to submit their business plans for that period to Ofwat by 3 September 2018. Ofwat will then scrutinise these, and step in to protect customers if necessary. Companies with a particularly high form of debt, known as gearing, will need to share financial gains from that gearing with customers. Ofwat said that, based on information from 2016-17, companies with more than 70% gearing in the water sector were Thames Water, Anglian Water, Southern Water, Yorkshire Water, Affinity Water, South East Water, and SES Water. There has been a growing outcry over the level of profits at water companies. Their performance was deemed inadequate during the recent cold snap caused by the ""Beast from the East"", with Ofwat saying the companies had failed their customers. It has also fined Thames Water Â£120m for failing customers through its management of water leaks in its area. The BBC's business editor, Simon Jack, saysThames Water has been the ""poster boy"" for an industrythat many feel has failed on the promised benefits of privatisation, such as efficiency, and has delivered only to shareholders and executives. For example, he points out, between 2006 and 2015, Thames paid out Â£1.1bn in dividends but zero in corporation tax as it offset interest payments on billions in borrowings against profits. However, the company is already planning to follow a number of the new rules laid down by Ofwat. Thames Water's chief executive has already given up a Â£3m bonus and future payouts will be related to hitting leakage targets and customer satisfaction, rather than financial returns.

Lantern event is 'fire risk' to moorlandOrganisers of the Peak District festival are being urged to cancel following the Lancashire fires.Derby,"Chinese, or sky, lanterns have been banned in some parts of the country There are calls for a sky lantern festival to be cancelled in the Peak District following major fires across moorland in England. The Lights Fest is due to be held at Buxton Raceway, close to the moors in Derbyshire, on 28 July. The Peak District National Park said moorland fires were ""lethal"" to wildlife and lanterns only increased the risk. The event organiser said the lanterns it uses do not pose a fire hazard. Live updates from the East Midlands Ruth George, the Labour MP for High Peak, said the festival should be cancelled due to the fire risk in the heart of the ""environmentally sensitive"" Peak District and has written to the organisers asking them to withdraw the event. Derbyshire Fire & Rescue also said it was trying to dissuade the organisers from going ahead following wildfires at Saddleworth Moor and Winter Hill. Derbyshire Fire & Rescue do not want fires to break out in the Peak District The Derbyshire Events Safety Advisory Group said it had also expressed its concerns to the organisers and is awaiting a ""definitive fire risk assessment"". The Peak District National Park said sky lanterns increased the risk of fire on dry moorland and were ""devastating to the landscape, lethal for wildlife and a threat to people and homes"". The Lights Fest, which is run by a US-based company, has not responded to questions asked by the BBC. However, on its website it claims its ""flame retardant"" lanterns are biodegradable with a ""limited burn time"" and are therefore not a fire hazard. The owner of the proposed venue, Buxton Raceway, has yet to comment. Mayor makes moor blaze 'air support' plea Saddleworth Moor fire crews 'pushed to limits' Worcester council agrees sky lantern ban An industry code of practice, introduced in 2014, requires sky lanterns to be manufactured so they are safe and biodegradable and also calls for them to be sold responsibly. Some retailers have stopped selling them altogether and a number of local authorities and event organisers have banned them. Despite the code, theNational Fire Chiefs Council,externalremains opposed to their use. A similar event at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, was cancelled following a petition which claimed the lanterns could hurt livestock and cause damage to plants and properties.

Spotify users demand Drake refunds,"Drake became the face of Spotify's playlists - even when his music didn't feature on them Drake's new album Scorpion has only been out since Friday, but it's already made history. The album broke streaming records on both Apple Music and Spotify, with more than 302m plays in a single day. But some users complained that Spotify put his photo on hundreds of playlists - including ones that didn't feature his music, such as ""Best of British"". Subscribers who'd paid for premium, ad-free accounts said it amounted to advertising and demanded refunds. One subscriber said he had been offered one month's free subscription as a result of his complaint. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Standout moments from Drake's Scorpion Drake fans are feeling all of the emotions Drake goes back to Degrassi in new video Other subscribers who attempted to submit a claim got mixed results: Some were given a month's free subscription, while others had their request denied. Spotify declined to comment on the situation; but the BBC understands no official refund policy has been put in place - and that the number of complaints has been relatively small. That does not rule out some customer service assistants offering refunds on a case-by-case basis; but it seems most people were relaxed about the takeover. In fact, they streamed his album more than any other in history.According to Billboard,external, Scorpion broke Spotify's one-week streaming record in just three days - racking up 431m streams over the weekend. In the UK, the album is set to reach number one  - beating new releases by Florence + The Machine and Gorillaz. All 25 of its tracks would appear in the top 40, if the chart rules hadn't been changed last year to prevent such a phenomenon. Meanwhile, Drake has quietly tweaked the record since its release; with an updated version of the record appearing on streaming services on Monday. Although most of the changes are minor, In My Feelings has gained new vocals from Lil Wayne, and Jay-Z's contribution to Talk Up has received a volume bump, after some fans complained he was mixed too quietly.

Swimmer on blow-up unicorn in sea rescue,"A total of 15 people were rescued from the sea on Monday evening People on an inflatable unicorn, flamingo and dinghy were among those who prompted air and sea searches from the Solent off the Hampshire coast. The coastguard said its rescue teams, RNLI lifeboats and the coastguard helicopter rescued 15 people on Monday evening. HM Coastguard's Piers Stanbury said: ""We can't stress enough - inflatables are not suitable for use in the sea."" He said the hotspot for the call-outs was Hayling Island. One person was blown more than 400m (1,312 ft) from Hayling Island beach into ""one of the busiest waterways in the world"" on an inflatable unicorn, the coastguard said. Rescue teams were called out more than 18 times when people using inflatables had got into difficulty on Monday evening Rescue teams were called out more than 18 times when people using inflatables had got into difficulty. Mr Stanbury said: ""The tide was going to low tide which was dragging people offshore - one person got dragged out to Portsmouth Harbour where they were getting in the way of ferries. ""Inflatables really should only be used in swimming pools, not at the coast where they can quickly go from being fun to being potentially deadly.""

Thousands 'falsely claim domestic abuse',"Thousands of parents falsely claim domestic abuse in order to access legal aid and stop estranged partners from seeing their children, a shared parenting charity claims. Families Need Fathers says parents are being encouraged by some solicitors to file for non-molestation orders - injunctions used in urgent abuse cases. New figures show a 30% rise in orders made after legal aid was axed in everything but abuse cases in family courts in 2012. Some 25,700 were made in England and Wales in 2017, and 6,699 in the first quarter of 2018. The changes to legal aid qualification in England and Wales were designed to reduce the number of cases in family courts, with separating couples being encouraged to attend mediation sessions instead, and to cut the legal aid bill. But charity case workers say they are seeing ""thousands"" of parents, mainly fathers, who have been made subject to these orders for things that they do not consider to be domestic abuse. These could be angry comments thrown in the midst of the break-up or dealing with child access arrangements or unpleasant text messages, they say. The charity suspects that solicitors' firms are talking parents into seeking such orders because it enables them to qualify for legal aid, from which both the legal profession and the complainant could benefit. A spokesman for the charity said: ""We're getting a lot of people coming to us talking about false allegations, whether it's grossly exaggerating events or even completely fabricating them. ""And yet the impact of the order can take a parent down a path that can be very difficult to return from."" Jerry Karlin, chairman of Families Need Fathers, said the result of the government's ""well-intended but ill-conceived changes"" to the family courts system was a 30% increase in non-molestation orders (NMOs) to 25,000 a year. There had also a been 20% rise in private family court applications over the last two years, he added. ""These (NMOs) are used in allegations of abuse and they don't have to be true to obtain access to legal aid."" The orders can lead to parents not being allowed to collect their children from school ""Non-molestation orders have gone up by several hundred per cent since the legal aid changes in some districts,"" he added. NMOs work like injunctions and are designed to protect domestic abuse victims from further harm in emergency situations. The charity stresses that they are useful in genuine cases of abuse, but is concerned that the way they are administered leaves them open to exploitation. For example They are often granted in the absence of the person being accused of abuse (the respondent) and without accusations of domestic abuse being proven The making of an order then also enables the complainant to draw on thousands of pounds in legal aid which can also be used in any subsequent family law cases The respondent would not be automatically entitled to legal aid, however, and often has to represent themselves The level of evidence required is fairly low and can relate to claims about verbal abuse, unwanted text messages or emails In some regions of England and Wales the increase has been as much as 900%. In others there has been a 150% rise, according to information obtained by Families Need Fathers. Once an order is made, there is a brief ""return"" hearing two weeks later but the case is then usually adjourned for about six months. During this time every agency related to the the respondent and his family, such as the police, school and local council, is notified. This can lead not only to the parent being physically separated from their children but being ostracised by the agencies involved with them. After about six months, usually, a fact-finding hearing is held at which the evidence of the applicant's claim is meant to be heard. But quite often, just as the initial order is made in the absence of the respondent, the fact-finding hearing is held in their absence as well. A judgement is then made on whether the order should continue. At this point it can be used to restrict a parent from spending time with his or her child and to delay the process of arranging contact. 'He hunted me down when I thought I was safe' 'My baby helped me stop my domestic abuse' The appalling cost of domestic abuse The outgoing president of the High Court's family division, Sir James Munby, described false allegations as a ""vice in the system"". He also said that the judiciary had recently realised that ""a wrongly granted without notice order sets the tone of proceedings thereafter"". He tried to crack down on the use of such orders, reminding courts that it was for the applicant to prove their claims rather than for the respondent to disprove them. His successor, Sir Andrew McFarlane, who is taking over the role in July, appeared to back some of the charity's claims on the harmful effects of such orders in a recent speech. He called for the facts of a case to be established much more quickly than happens at present. Whether there are serious domestic abuse allegations or not, it does not help either parent or the children for the hearing of the contested factual issues to be adjourned again and again, he said. And Sir Andrew cited a case in which a father was subject to a continuing non-molestation injunction preventing him from having any contact with his children for a period of years. ""That injunction had been based upon the untested and contested factual allegations which were never tried,"" he said. ""Until the factual context is clarified and determined by the court, the arrangements for the children cannot move on and develop in a way which reflects the risk or lack of risk, arising from the facts as they are found to be,"" he added. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said there may be various reasons for an increase in the issuing of such orders - including greater awareness of domestic abuse and of how it can be addressed. He added: ""Non-molestation orders are an important means of protecting individuals in abusive situations. ""When deciding whether to grant a non-molestation order, the judge will consider all the circumstances, including the need to secure the health, safety and wellbeing of the applicant and any children."" The court has the power to discharge an order if the respondent makes an application and this is found to be justified. Domestic abuse charity Women's Aid said the rise in NMOs needed to be put in the context of statistics showing record numbers of domestic-abuse related incidents. The number rose from 796,935 in 2011-12 to 1.1 million in 2016-17 in England and Wales. Katie Ghose, chief executive ofWomen's Aid,externalsaid: ""We know from our work with survivors that non-molestation orders can be a vital tool to protect victims from experiencing further abuse or harassment from a former partner. ""Non-molestation orders are only granted by the courts in cases where a judge is satisfied an order is required to keep a victim of domestic abuse safe. ""We are not aware of any cases where mothers have falsely applied for non-molestation orders. ""We know from our work with survivors that non-molestation orders can be difficult to obtain and the court process itself can be distressing for victims. ""There has been a small increase in the number of non-molestation orders applied for and being granted since these orders first came into force in 2003. ""Given that the police are recording record numbers of domestic abuse-related incidents and offences, we would expect the number of non-molestation orders being applied for and granted to increase over this period as more victims have the courage to report to the police and seek protection through the justice system.""

Thai boys 'could be in cave for months',"This video can not be played Finding the Thai cave boys and getting them out Rescuers will take no risks in freeing the 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand, an official said. They have received their first food and medical treatment in 10 days. Seven divers, including a doctor and a nurse, joined the group inside the caves in the north of the country after they were discovered alive on Monday. Rescuers are now considering how best to bring the group to safety. ""We will not rush to take the lads out of the cave,"" the governor of Chiang Rai, Narongsak Osoththanakorn, told reporters, adding: ""Whoever has zero risk first can leave the cave first."" How will the boys cope underground? What are the rescue options? More heavy rain could see water levels rise and threaten the air pocket where the group has taken refuge. The boys were found nine days after they entered the caves in Chiang Rai province following a football training session and became trapped by rising waters from heavy rainfall. On Tuesday, Thai officials told reporters that rescuers were providing health checks and treatment, and keeping the boys entertained, adding that none of those trapped were in a serious condition. ""They have been fed with easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor,"" Rear Admiral Apagorn Youkonggaew, head of the Thai navy's special forces, told reporters. It is believed that most of the group cannot swim, complicating what would already be a difficult rescue. Thailand rejoices as boys found The Brits who found the group alive The hours after the boys were found Earlier, the Thai military said the boys would need to learn to dive - or wait up to four months for flooding to recede before they could get out of the caves, meaning food would need to be supplied for that time. Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda later stressed the urgency of the evacuation, adding that rain was forecast ""in the next few days"", the Bangkok Post reported. Attempts are being made to reduce the risk of further flooding of the caves by pumping water from the underground system, Mr Anupong said. A phone line is also being installed so the boys can talk to their families. The governor said that requests had been made to build ""infrastructure"" in the cave leading to the pocket where the teenagers and their coach are located. The Thai authorities have appealed for donations of full-face scuba diving masks small enough to fit the boys in order to reduce the risk of their breathing apparatus coming loose as they travel through flooded passageways. Two British rescuer divers who had flown over to join the search operation found the boys on Monday night. The video of that first contact was posted on Facebook,externalby Thai navy special forces. The boys are seen by torchlight sitting on a ledge above water, responding to the divers that all 13 were there and that they were very hungry. This video can not be played Bill Whitehouse of the British Cave Rescue Council has been in touch with the divers They ask how long they have been underground and whether they can leave now. The divers tell them they have to wait, but say people will come back for them. One boy replies: ""Oh. See you tomorrow."" The search for the group had gripped the nation as it was unclear where they were or whether they were even still alive. Families of the missing group were ecstatic at news of their discovery. Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said of the boys' discovery that ""everybody is a hero"". ""Thank you all Thais, thank you all foreigners,"" he said. The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June. It is believed they entered the cave when it was dry and sudden heavy rains blocked the exit. They were found on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave. It is thought the boys could move through parts of the cave in dry conditions but rushing waters clogged the narrow passages with mud and debris, blocking visibility and access. This video can not be played Families of the boys have been celebrating after finding out their loved ones are alive One of the toughest stretches for the divers came as they neared the so-called Pattaya Beach - an elevated mound in the cave complex - where it was hoped the boys had sought refuge. Divers had to navigate a series of sharp, narrow bends in near-darkness. They completed the difficult journey to find Pattaya Beach flooded, so swam on and found the boys about 400m away. Bringing the trapped boys to safety is an extremely dangerous task given the conditions inside. The Tham Luang cave complex is regularly flooded during the rainy season which lasts until September or October. A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the missing children Experts have cautioned that taking inexperienced divers through the dangerous corridors of muddy, zero-visibility waters would be very risky. How will rescuers free the Thai boys? What to do to survive underground Thai boys 'could be in cave for months' Nine days of hope - images from the search Diver Ben Reymenants, who is assisting with the rescue mission, told the BBC that two Thai navy doctors had volunteered to stay with the boys for ""up to four months"" until the water receded. Other teams are still scouring the mountainside in the hope of finding another way into the cave. This video can not be played Diver Ben Reymenants is assisting with the rescue mission and says none of the boys can swim The 12 boys are all members of a local football team and their coach is known to have taken them on occasional excursions and field trips. Tinnakorn Boonpiem, whose 12-year-old son Mongkol is among the 13, told Agence France-Presse she was ""so glad"" to hear they were safe. ""I want him to be physically and mentally fit,"" she said. ""I'm so happy I can't put it into words,"" another relative of one of the group told reporters as tears of joy streamed down his cheeks. How will the boys cope?

""Everyone who helped the 13 people is a hero,"" said one user on Twitter. ""We are shedding tears of joy."" But though the boys, who are aged between 11 and 16, have been found - it might be a while before they are able to leave the cave. Thailand is currently in the midst of its rainy season, which lasts until September or October, so it could be months before floodwaters inside the cave recede. How can rescuers free the boys? If the children are to be brought out before then, they will have to learn basic diving skills. But experts have cautioned that taking inexperienced divers through the dangerous corridors of muddy, zero-visibility waters would be a very dangerous operation. If they are to wait until the water recedes by itself, it would mean the boys will have to stay in the cave for months and have to be continuously supplied with food and assistance. Rescuers are currently working to bring more supplies to them and they may need to have food sent in for at least the next four months, according to the military. How will rescuers free the Thai boys? 'No risks' to be taken to free Thai boys Finding the Thai cave boys and getting them out.

"Tribute to beach inflatable death girlThe family of Ava-May Littleboy says her smile ""could light up even the darkest of rooms"".Norfolk","Ava-May Littleboy, aged three, was thrown from an inflatable trampoline at Gorleston beach A three-year-old girl thrown from an inflatable trampoline on a beach died from a head injury, a post-mortem examination has found. Witnesses described how people tried to catch Ava-May Littleboy when the inflatable ""exploded"" on Gorleston beach, Norfolk on Sunday. Ava-May, who died in hospital, had been at the beach with members of her family. Her family, from Suffolk, said she could ""light up the darkest rooms"". In a statement, they added: ""She was not your ordinary little girl. Anyone that met her would not want to forget her."" Ava-May Littleboy was thrown from the blue trampoline, pictured to the right Norfolk Police said a Home Office post-mortem examination took place on Monday and found Ava-May had died of a head injury, but that further investigation would take place to confirm this. A police spokesman said the cordon in the area would remain in place while specialists examine the scene and the inflatable play equipment. Are children safe on bouncy inflatables? Reality Check: What are the rules on bouncy castles? Zoe Dye, who was on the beach at the time with her daughter, said: ""Literally, it was just screams from everyone on the beach. It was almost like slow motion. [The] poor little girl was in the air. ""No-one could do anything. People were trying their hardest to catch her and she just dropped."" Ava-May's family has set up a fundraising campaign to raise money for a bench to go on the playing field near their home in Somersham. Speaking to the BBC, her grandmother Angela Littleboy said she ""loved to be outside and play"". ""She was her own little character, she was cheeky, funny, the best leg-hugger ever,"" she said. ""She loved everything, loved everybody, everyone was her best friend. She was a beautiful and bright little girl."" Mrs Littleboy added that the family was still ""very numb"" after Ava-May's death but was ""absolutely overwhelmed"" by the love and support shown by others. The online appeal has raised more than Â£8,000. This video can not be played Witnesses said the inflatable exploded and threw the girl into the air Downing Street has described the incident as a ""terrible accident and a tragic loss of life"". The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""The HSE [Health and Safety Executive] are looking into it, they are the right people to do so. ""We need to wait for that investigation to be completed."" In 2016,a seven-year-old girl died when a bouncy castle broke free from its mooringsin high winds in Harlow. Following Ava-May's death,there have been calls for a temporary ban on bouncy castles and inflatables in public areas. Harlow MP Robert Halfon wants an ""urgent investigation"" into their regulation. He said: ""There should be a temporary ban on bouncy castles and inflatables in public areas until we can ensure they are safe. ""These are two tragic deaths of two beautiful little children in the space of a few years and there needs to be an urgent investigation in the regulation and inspection regimes. ""You cannot risk a tragedy like this happening again."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One message read: ""Taken too soon. Thinking of all your family. Such a sad loss. Sleep tight angel."" People have been leaving tributes on the beach Supt Roger Wiltshire, of Norfolk Police, said it was too early to speculate whether the hot weather was the cause of the explosion. ""We've got experts from all around the country coming to help us with all aspects of this investigation,"" he said. ""I'm a dad myself and you just can't imagine what they would be going through. ""You come to a seaside town like Great Yarmouth and Gorleston for a day out... and as a dad, we've spent many hours standing by a bouncy castle watching the kids jump up and down.""

"Woman arrested over hospital baby deathsA ""healthcare professional"" is being held over the deaths of eight babies at a Cheshire hospital.Liverpool","Police have been investigating neonatal deaths between March 2015 and July 2016 A healthcare professional has been arrested on suspicion of murdering eight babies and attempting to kill six others at a hospital. Cheshire Police said the woman's arrest was a significant step forward in an investigation into deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Officers have been investigating the deaths of 17 newborns at the neonatal unit between March 2015 and July 2016. A spokesman said the probe also covered 15 ""non-fatal collapses"". The cases being investigated involve families from the Cheshire and north Wales area. Police officers are searching a house and a car in Westbourne Road, Chester The Countess of Chester declined to comment on whether any staff had been suspended and Cheshire Police would not reveal the role of the healthcare professional within the hospital. Police have confirmed they are searching a property in Westbourne Road, Chester, about a mile from the hospital, in connection with the investigation. Neighbours said a woman lived at the house and had moved in about two years ago. Det Insp Paul Hughes said the investigation was highly complex and very sensitive and officers were doing ""everything we possibly can to try to establish in detail what has led to these baby deaths and collapses"". The hospital says the neonatal unit was ""safe to continue in its current form"" and remained open to women over 32 weeks in their pregnancy He said there were ""no set timescales for this coming to a conclusion but we remain committed to carrying out a thorough investigation as soon as possible"". ""Parents of all the babies are continuing to be kept fully updated and are being supported. ""This is an extremely difficult time and it is important to remember that there are bereaved families seeking answers as to what happened to their children."" Police were asked to investigate the deaths of eight babies in May 2017, a probe which has since widened to include nine more. In 2017 the Countess of Chester was among 21 hospitals called upon to investigate higher than average death rates. Authors of the MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK) report looked at stillbirths and neonatal deaths around the UK in 2015. They found the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust had a neonatal death rate of 1.91 for every 1,000 live births that year. This was the highest out of the 43 trusts of a similar size it was compared with, which had an average of 1.27 neonatal deaths for every 1,000 live births. There were also 5.42 extended perinatal deaths - deaths within four weeks - for every 1,000 births, including stillbirths. The average for similar sized maternity units was 4.73 deaths per 1,000 births. The rate declined in 2016 but was still among the highest in the group. Hospital medical director Ian Harvey said asking police to investigate the deaths had not been ""something we did lightly, but we need to do everything we can to understand what has happened"". He added the neonatal unit was ""safe to continue in its current form"" and remained open to women over 32 weeks in their pregnancy. The unit has 13 cots providing specialist care for about 400 newborn and premature babies born at 32 weeks and above each year. It stopped providing care for those born earlier than 32 weeks in July 2016 after the hospital reported ""a greater number of baby deaths and collapses than normally expected"". Hospital baby deaths probed by police Baby death hospital staffing 'inadequate' Areview by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Healththe following February said no ""definitive explanation"" had been found for the increase in mortality rates at the neonatal unit and there were no ""obvious factors"" linking the deaths. An inspection of the hospital by the Care Quality Commission in 2016found the unit's nursing staff levels,external""did not meet standards recommended by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine"" and it ""lacked storage space and resources"" for effective infection control.

"Don't push May too far, Tory MPs warned","Lord Hague said Brexit was coming and Tory MPs needed to compromise Tory MPs have been urged to accept a ""compromise"" customs plan proposed by No 10 or face having a ""watered-down"" Brexit forced on them by Parliament. Ex-leader Lord Hague said if Brexiteers pushed Theresa May too hard, it would increase the chance of the Commons voting to stay in the customs union. A No 10 source said the ""best of both worlds"" plan offered the opportunity for friction-free trade with the EU and the scope to strike deals elsewhere. Ministers will discuss it on Friday. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what the future relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. Pienaar: New trade plan explained Firms 'running out of patience' on Brexit Reality Check: The government's customs options Ministers have so far failed to agree what type of customs model to pursue. The decision is seen as being key to facilitating trade and to avoiding new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU. Friday's Cabinet meeting at Chequers will be followed by a White Paper setting out details of the UK's future relations with the EU, aimed at paving the way for an agreement in the autumn. This video can not be played May: Brexit means Brexit does mean Brexit No details have yet been announced about how the new proposed system will work although a No 10 source has promised it will be a ""significant step forward"". BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar said key to the proposal would be a single market trade deal on goods - although it would not be called a single market because that suggests close ties to the EU. It would also include the agriculture and food sector to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland - but not necessarily the financial services industry, he said. On customs, the UK would apply EU tariffs except where it can secure international trade deals, he added - with ""some concession"" in the area of free movement of people also expected. The prime minister's ""big gamble"" is whether her cabinet will buy her plan, our correspondent said. Leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that such an arrangement would be ""deeply unsatisfactory"". Mr Rees-Mogg - who has been accused of ""threatening"" Theresa May over Brexit - said he was simply ""supporting the prime minister in what she's previously said"". Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The Dutch prime minister has been pressing Theresa May for more clarity about her plans BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The immediate problem with the ""new plan"" is whether or not it really exists. Because while Number 10 says it does, ask other people in government and they are not quite so sure. Ministers who you might have thought would be aware of the detail like - oh, you might imagine - the Brexit secretary had not agreed the lines, before Number 10 made their intervention. And it's said that the reason he has not been involved in agreeing the ""new plan"" is because it does not actually exist yet. The customs decision expected in some parts of government therefore is what has been anticipated for some time as ""max fac plus"" - a souped up version of the proposal that originally won the day in the Brexit subcommittee what feels like a lifetime ago - with, you assume, a long lead-in time while the technology is made to work. Baffled? Quite possibly so. But it's perhaps only safe to say that four days before ministers are expected to actually make some final decisions, all is not precisely as you might have expected. Read the rest of Laura's blog But former foreign secretary Lord Hague, a life-long Eurosceptic who campaigned to remain in 2016, has said the Brexiteers should be careful what they wish for. In an article for the Daily Telegraph,external, he said they did not have the numbers in Parliament to force through a ""hard Brexit"" - leaving the UK without any deal over market access or long-term customs arrangements. ""If ardent Brexiteers push too hard, they will end up without their main objective,"" he wrote. ""If there is no agreement this week on a plan for customs arrangements, the Commons will be much more likely to vote in the near future to stay in the customs union in its entirety. ""The choice is either to back a compromise plan now or to end up with a more watered-down version of Brexit that would be forced on ministers anyhow."" This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? The government is committed to leaving the current customs union but the two alternatives it proposed last year, a so-called customs partnership and maximum facilitation system, are believed to now be regarded as practically or politically undeliverable. Brexit: All you need to know On Monday, amid signs of growing Tory divisions, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke up in defence of his ""principled"" colleague Mr Rees-Mogg who had been criticised by other government ministers for his Daily Telegraph article. Brexit minister Steve Baker said Mr Rees-Mogg was right to air his concerns. Lord Hague said the ""sensible middle"" in his party would not forgive anything which destabilised Mrs May's position at such a critical time in the negotiations or was seen as ""naked"" political manoeuvring. ""Everyone threatening Theresa May with chaos, revolt, resignations and a leadership election if she does not do as they wish needs to think carefully about what might be the consequences of their actions,"" he said. The prime minister visited Dutch leader Mark Rutte on Tuesday although No 10 has insisted that no foreign leader will be given sight of the UK's latest plans before they are discussed at Cabinet. Mr Rutte said: ""We urgently need clarity about every aspect of the future relationship between the EU and UK and we are working very hard to achieve it."" Mrs May said she wanted to secure ""a future relationship that reflects the close ties we have with the Netherlands"".

'MI6 conman' fugitive held in Switzerland,"Mark Acklom is one of the UK's most wanted fugitives One of Britain's most wanted fugitives has been arrested in Switzerland, police have said. Mark Acklom, who allegedly posed as an MI6 agent to con a divorcee from Gloucestershire out of her Â£850,000 life savings, disappeared in 2012. The 45-year-old was tracked down to a luxury apartment in Zurich on Saturday night, Avon and Somerset Police said. He is currently in Zurich awaiting extradition hearing proceedings. Carolyn Woods alleged Mr Acklom posed as an MI6 agentand Swiss banker and conned her into ""lending"" him her savings during a year-long romance in Bath in 2012. Two years ago a European Arrest Warrant was issued for Mr Acklom, and he was believed to be in Spain having been released from a Spanish prison over a Â£200,000 property fraud. Carolyn Woods said her daughters ""felt she had been brainwashed"" by Mark Acklom In October 2016 he was among10 British fugitives named by the National Crime Agency (NCA) as the most wanted in Spain. Det Insp Adam Bunting, from Avon and Somerset Police, said the arrest was the result of co-ordinated efforts between its officers, the National Crime Agency and the Swiss authorities. ""Acklom thought he could continue to evade capture by moving around Europe but we were determined to locate him and bring him back to this country,"" he said. Ian Cruxton, from the NCA, said he was pleased for Ms Woods as she had been ""waiting a long time for news of his arrest"". ""The hunt for conman Mark Acklom started in Spain but as soon as intelligence indicated he had moved to Switzerland, we utilised our assets there to track him down,"" he said. ""I suspect a fraudster like Acklom will have continued offending while on the run, which is why it was so important to apprehend him."" Hunt for fugitive focuses on family Most wanted man 'spotted in Geneva' Woman claims 'MI6 lover' took Â£850,000 He added the UK has a ""well-established extradition treaty with the Swiss authorities"" and court proceedings would now begin. When Mr Acklom returns to the UK he will appear in court in relation to 20 fraud offences, 12 of converting or removing criminal property and eight of fraud by false representation.

"Birthday girl, 3, dies after knife attack","This video can not be played ""This was an attack on the most vulnerable"" A three-year-old girl died of her injuries on Monday, after a knife attack at her birthday party left nine injured in Boise, Idaho, US police say. They believe Saturday's attack at a complex, home to many refugees, was motivated by ""vengeance"" after the suspect was asked to leave the place the day before following bad behaviour. Seven people remain in hospital, some with ""serious or critical injuries"". The suspect has been named as Timmy Earl Kinner, a US citizen. All nine people attacked on Saturday are members of refugee families from Ethiopia, Iraq and Syria. Six children - aged between three and 12 - were injured, including the three-year-old birthday girl who died in Utah after being flown there for treatment. Timmy Kinner, a Los Angeles resident, has been charged Police said on Monday that one child has been treated and released from hospital. Police chief William Bones said: ""This was an attack on those who are most vulnerable: our children."" He described the attack, in a statement, as ""untenable, unconscionable"" and ""pure evil"",external. Mr Kinner, 30, is charged with first-degree murder, several counts of aggravated battery and six counts of injury to a child. The Los Angeles resident wanted to represent himself in court, the Associated Press reported, but a judge ordered a public defender. Mr Kinner, who has an extensive criminal history spanning several states, according to police, is being held without bail. Mr Bones told reporters that the evidence did not suggest the attack was a hate crime. The suspect had been staying with an acquaintance at the complex - but was kicked out on Friday due to bad behaviour. He returned the following day to ""exact vengeance"", attacking people at the birthday party, the police chief said. ""It appears from the investigation, it was a matter of where they [victims] lived, not a matter if they knew the suspect,"" Mr Bones added. Boise Mayor Dave Bieter said, in a statement, thathe was ""heartbroken"" to learn of the child's death.,external ""The thought of a happy occasion like a child's birthday party being turned into the darkest of sorrows in such a vicious way is almost unfathomable.""

"Windrush generation 'badly let down'The Windrush generation was ""treated appallingly"" and ""set up to fail"", says a group of MPs.","""Root and branch reform"" of the Home Office's approach to immigration is needed following the Windrush scandal, according to a committee of MPs. The Windrush generation were ""badly let down"" and had to follow processes apparently designed to ""set them up to fail"", said the Home Affairs Committee. They called for urgent action to make sure the scandal is not repeated. Home Secretary Savid Javid's top priority is to ""right the wrongs that have occurred"", the Home Office said. The Windrush scandal began to be uncovered earlier this year when it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants. Some who had lived and worked in the UK for years were threatened with deportation or refused jobs and healthcare. Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush victims detained 'unlawfully' In pictures: The pioneering Windrush generation Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said people had been ""denied their rights and treated appallingly by the Home Office"" and that there was ""still a very long way to go to put this right or to ensure it won't happen again"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We found when looking at what's happened to the Windrush generation that thousands of people have been denied their rights and have been badly let down by the Home Office. ""It's truly appalling what's happened to people who have been here lawfully, many of them British citizens. ""That's why we looked at areas around the culture that had developed - the lack of discretion, the treating people with scepticism and suspicion - we've looked at some of the policies that affected people, and also the lack of oversight in the system, the lack of any checks and balances to prevent it happening.

The MPs also said they were concerned that enforcement targets may have led to a ""focus on people like the Windrush generation who may have been easier to detain and remove"". By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent This detailed report, compiled in less than six weeks, is the most comprehensive attempt so far to explain why the Windrush scandal came about and scrutinise the government's response. But tellingly, it suggests there's still a lot of crucial information we don't know: the links between removal targets and bonuses; the advice civil servants gave to ministers on the issue; and how many Windrush migrants have been wrongfully detained, deported and deprived of the rights they should have had. There's also concern that the policies and mistakes will be repeated with other potentially vulnerable groups - undocumented children, people from the Chagos Islands and EU citizens seeking to settle in the UK indefinitely. It's a reminder for Sajid Javid to keep his eye firmly on the ball as the media attention over Windrush inevitably subsides. Some 8,000 people have now contacted the Windrush task force set up by the government, with more than 2,000 receiving documents confirming their right to stay in Britain. But there are ""too many unanswered questions"" and the Home Office should now reveal how many people have been unlawfully subject to deportation, detention and reporting requirements, the report said. Unless lessons are learned from the Windrush scandal, the same mistakes could happen with the three million EU nationals living in the UK who have to take on a new migrant status after Brexit, the MPs warned. They said there are 144,000 children currently in Britain who could be in a similar situation to the Windrush migrants because they do not have the documents proving their right to be here. Failing to solve the problem of those undocumented children ""will leave many in a precarious position, unable to study, work or seek the support of social security as they transition into adulthood"", they warned.

Evacuation threat eases over forest fire,"Large patches of scorched earth can be seen at Carmel A spate of wildfires have put firefighters under ""tremendous pressure,"" prompting calls for people to put out barbecues and cigarettes properly. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service still had crews at six wildfires on Tuesday evening after dealing with multiple blazes in the past 24 hours. Fires have also broken out across Wales over the past week. Officials have described the number of incidents as ""unprecedented"". Kevin Roberts, senior fire safety manager at North Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""These fires place tremendous pressure on our resources. ""In these dry conditions, fires involving grass, bracken and heather can develop extremely quickly, especially in raised winds, and fires can soon get out of control. ""So if you are out, it is more important than ever in these conditions to make sure that any smoking materials are discarded and extinguished properly. ""If you are out camping, again make sure that campfires or barbeques are fully extinguished. Better still, avoid open fires altogether in this dry period."" North Wales fire crews have been called to 44 small fires and six large fires in the open since midnight on Monday and were still tackling the following blazes on Tuesday evening: Mynydd Cilgwyn, Carmel, near Caernarfon Braichmelyn, near Bethesda Pentre Halkyn, Holywell Bangor Mountain Pwllheli Talsarnau This video can not be played Fiona Griffiths' home near Carmel was surrounded by the fire on three sides In Gwynedd, 15 homes were evacuated on Monday evening as crews fought a mile-long mountain fire at Mynydd Cilgwyn in Carmel, near Caernarfon. Overnight and 20 miles away, residents in Braichmelyn, near Bethesda, were on standby to leave their homes when a fire broke out in a nearby pine forest at about 03:10 BST. Both blazes are under control, along with another fire at Bangor mountain, and the areas are continuing to be monitored.

Ferndale Community School, which is nearby, opened on Tuesday - but staff were advised to keep all doors and windows closed and not go out at lunchtime because of the smoke and ash. South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said the blaze had been extinguished, but crews would continue to monitor and check the area. Pembrey Mountain in Carmarthenshire was another location to see a fire from previous days reignite. On Monday, crews also tackled blazes at Kilvey Hill in Swansea, and Penrhys, Rhondda Cynon Taff, while there was also a large forest fire near the Bryn Pica landfill site in Aberdare. Crews battled a gorse fire at Carmel, Gwynedd The wildfire in Carmel could be seen from a distance on Monday evening Hot, dry weather and wind all make the perfect recipe for a wildfire Sometimes fires start naturally, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike The majority are the result of arson, campfires, discarding lit cigarettes, barbecues, not burning debris properly, or playing with matches or fireworks A fire on Maerdy mountain reignited on Tuesday morning A helicopter drops water on fires at Maerdy mountain Across the weekend, a helicopter was brought in to drop water on the Cwm Rheidol mountainside and a fire was tackled at Garth Hill in Maesteg, Bridgend county. Andy Fry, chief fire advisor for Wales, said wildfires were fairly common, but there had been twice as many as an average June. He added: ""Historically there have been a number of years where we've seen very significant numbers of wildfires, particularly in 2015.

"More children feeling lonely, says report","Social media may be making isolation worse, Childline has said Childline has seen a 14% rise in the number of children contacting the charity about loneliness. In 2017/18, the charity delivered 4,636 counselling sessions on loneliness,compared to 4,063 the year before. Nearly 80% of sessions went to girls. Some said watching their friends socialise without them on social media made them feel increasingly isolated. This is the second year loneliness data has been recorded - it used to go down as ""low self-esteem"" or ""unhappiness"". The youngest person to call with the problem was just 10 years old. One teenage boy told Childline: ""I see all my friends having a good time on social media and it gets me down, I feel like no one cares enough to invite me. ""My mood is getting worse and now I'm just upset all the time and can't stop crying."" Loneliness more likely in young Is Britain really 'the loneliness capital of Europe'? Is loneliness damaging your health? The charity's founder Dame Esther Rantzen said: ""Loneliness needs to be taken seriously because it is potentially damaging to children's physical and mental health. ""The crucial question is what is causing this rise among the young? ""Are we all too busy to make space and time for our children? Is it that we have lost the habit of eating together? ""Or is it the illusion created by social networks that everyone else is liked, popular and enjoying a far more exciting life so they feel lonelier than ever?"" Younger people aremore prone to feeling lonelythan older age groups, according to the Office for National Statistics. Research in April found that almost 10% of people between the ages of 16 and 24 were ""always or often"" lonely, more than three times higher than people aged 65 or over. Mental Health Foundation's Cal Strode said loneliness among young people could be driven by social media. ""Teens can have thousands of friends online and yet feel unsupported and isolated,"" he said. ""Technology - including social media - could be exacerbating social isolation.""

Windrush generation 'badly let down',"""Root and branch reform"" of the Home Office's approach to immigration is needed following the Windrush scandal, according to a committee of MPs. The Windrush generation were ""badly let down"" and had to follow processes apparently designed to ""set them up to fail"", said the Home Affairs Committee. They called for urgent action to make sure the scandal is not repeated. Home Secretary Savid Javid's top priority is to ""right the wrongs that have occurred"", the Home Office said. The Windrush scandal began to be uncovered earlier this year when it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants. Some who had lived and worked in the UK for years were threatened with deportation or refused jobs and healthcare. Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush victims detained 'unlawfully' In pictures: The pioneering Windrush generation Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said people had been ""denied their rights and treated appallingly by the Home Office"" and that there was ""still a very long way to go to put this right or to ensure it won't happen again"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We found when looking at what's happened to the Windrush generation that thousands of people have been denied their rights and have been badly let down by the Home Office. ""It's truly appalling what's happened to people who have been here lawfully, many of them British citizens. ""That's why we looked at areas around the culture that had developed - the lack of discretion, the treating people with scepticism and suspicion - we've looked at some of the policies that affected people, and also the lack of oversight in the system, the lack of any checks and balances to prevent it happening.

'Best of both worlds' customs plan promised,"This video can not be played May: Brexit means Brexit does mean Brexit A new plan for post-Brexit customs arrangements will be a ""significant step forward"", a Downing Street source has promised. The proposal, to be presented to ministers on Friday, will offer ""the best of both worlds"" - an independent trade policy and friction-free trade, the source added. But no details have yet been revealed about how it will work. Ministers have so far failed to agree what type of customs model to pursue. Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? Reality Check: The government's customs options Friday's Chequers summit, which will be followed by a White Paper setting out more details, is aimed at finalising the UK's preferred path which can then be put to the EU. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some ministers appeared not to have been involved in drawing up the new proposal, which is being called a ""third way"" after two previous proposals divided opinion. Earlier, government divisions were underlined when Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson intervened in defence of Eurosceptic backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had been accused by two other foreign office ministers of ""threatening"" Theresa May over Brexit.

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what the future relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. Key things that have yet to be agreed are how the two sides will trade with each other in years to come - and how to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which is a member of the EU. Before reaching agreement with the EU, Mrs May needs to resolve splits within her cabinet on the shape of Brexit. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The immediate problem with the ""new plan"" is whether or not it really exists. Because while Number 10 says it does, ask other people in government and they are not quite so sure. Ministers who you might have thought would be aware of the detail like - oh, you might imagine - the Brexit secretary had not agreed the lines, before Number 10 made their intervention. And it's said tonight that the reason he has not been involved in agreeing the ""new plan"" is because it does not actually exist yet. The customs decision expected in some parts of government therefore is what has been anticipated for some time as ""max fac plus"" - a souped up version of the proposal that originally won the day in the Brexit subcommittee what feels like a lifetime ago - with, you assume, a long lead-in time while the technology is made to work. Baffled? Quite possibly so. But it's perhaps only safe to say that four days before ministers are expected to actually make some final decisions, all is not precisely as you might have expected. Read the rest of Laura's blog Earlier, she urged the EU to consider her blueprint for future relations ""seriously"" as she updated MPs on last week's Brussels summit. Pressed to give more detail of her plans as she took questions in the Commons, Mrs May said she hoped her vision for the UK's future relations would address the ""real differences"" on the issue of the Irish border. ""The EU and its member states will want to consider our proposals seriously,"" she said. ""We both need to show flexibility to build the deep relationship after we have left that is in the interests of both our peoples."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the cabinet was irrevocably split between different Tory factions. But Mrs May rejected calls to ""pick a side"" between Remainers and Brexiteers, saying: ""I have picked the side of the British people and these are the ones for whom I will deliver."" She is also due to have talks in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of the Chequers meeting. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming Mrs May hopes to resolve cabinet splits on Brexit at a meeting this week Sources in both the European Council and the European Commission deny they have seen a draft of the UK's Brexit White Paper. Officials in Brussels predict it will mostly be a compilation of existing British positions - ""a best of"" is how one described it. Theresa May ""hinted"" at the publication of the document when she addressed EU leaders at their summit last week but she did not elaborate on its contents. Ministers from the remaining 27 member states are planning to respond to the White Paper at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on 20 July. EU officials expect to be going through the document until the end of July. The government has so far talked publicly about two potential customs options. One, a customs partnership, would mean the UK applies the EU's own tariffs and rules of origin to all goods arriving in the country and then hands over what was owed for goods that subsequently end up in the EU. The other, known as maximum facilitation or max-fac, aimed to employ new technology to remove the need for physical customs checks where possible. Brexit: All you need to know It is understood both options have been deemed practically or politically undeliverable and a third option is on the table, believed to involve ""alignment"" with the EU in regulations covering trade in goods but a looser relationship for services. Writing in the Daily Telegraph earlier, Mr Rees-Mogg said,externalhe and other members of the 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs he leads, known as the European Research Group, would reject a deal that did not amount to a clean break with the EU. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Mr Rees-Mogg said a deal which restricted the UK's ability to make trade agreements with other nations or control migration could not be accepted and Mrs May ""must stick to her righteous cause and deliver what she has said she would"". But, speaking in the Commons, pro-EU MP Anna Soubry said the public were tired of what she said were continual ""fudges"" on key questions and urged Mrs May to stamp her authority once and for all. And her colleague Nicky Morgan said Mrs May ""would not be thanked for the mess we will end up in"" if the government did not prioritise the needs of the economy in a ""pragmatic, sensible, flexible"" Brexit. The Democratic Unionist Party, whose support Theresa May needs to have a majority in key Commons votes, said it would not support any deal which did not give the UK full control over its borders. ""We don't give blank cheques to anybody,"" its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said after meeting the PM for an hour in Downing Street. ""We want to see a proper Brexit which fulfils the referendum result but we have been very clear that it has to be on the basis of the whole of the UK leaving the EU as one."" He accused Dublin and other European capitals of trying to ""bully"" the UK and using the issue of the Northern Irish border to ""create an outcome which is to their liking"", adding ""they won't succeed in that"".

PM's Eddie Mair 'offered to take pay cut',"Eddie Mair has denied he is leaving the BBC over ""pay problems"" - saying he offered ""in writing, to take a cut"". The departing presenter of Radio 4's PM programme said he was leaving the corporation after more than 30 years ""to do something a little different"". The presenter earned between Â£300,000 and Â£350,000 a year. He said it ""tickled"" him that he was ""apparently refusing"" to reduce his salary. Mr Mair will leavePM in August to take on a new role at LBC. After the BBC was criticised for its gender pay gap, six male journalists - including leading Today presenter John Humphrys, and News at Ten's Huw Edwards -agreed to take a cut. Some reports suggested that Mr Mair refused to do likewise - but, writing in the Radio Times, he said that wasn't true. ""None of my thinking has been influenced by the BBC's pay problems. I'd offered, in writing, to take a cut. ""The first article appeared before we'd even discussed pay, and later it was said I was staying off work in some kind of protest: in fact, as RT [Radio Times] readers know, I was in hospital trying to avoid sepsis."" He added: ""Whenever anyone leaves a job, people ask 'Did they jump or were they pushed?' There can be a lot of truth hidden behind gushing statements.

Archbishop sentenced for abuse cover-up,"Archbishop Philip Wilson was convicted in May A Catholic archbishop in Australia has been given a maximum sentence of 12 months in detention for concealing child sexual abuse in the 1970s. Philip Wilson, now archbishop of Adelaide, is the most senior Catholic globally to be convicted of the crime. He was found guilty by a court last month of covering up abuse by a paedophile priest in New South Wales. On Tuesday, the court ordered Wilson to be assessed for ""home detention"" - meaning he will probably avoid jail. Magistrate Robert Stone said the senior clergyman had shown ""no remorse or contrition"". He will be eligible for parole after six months. Wilson has not resigned as archbishop, despiterelinquishing his duties in the wake of his conviction. In May, a court foundhe had failed to report his colleague James Patrick Fletcher's abuseof altar boys to police. This video can not be played 'Wilson ignored my story for decades' Wilson, then a junior priest in the Maitland region, had dismissed young victims in a bid to protect the Church's reputation, Magistrate Stone ruled. Fletcher was convicted of nine child sexual abuse charges in 2004, and died in jail two years later. During his trial, Wilson denied that he had known about Fletcher's actions. The archbishop's lawyers had sought to have the case thrown out on four occasions, citing the 67-year-old's diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease. One of his victims, former altar boy Peter Creigh, told the court he had described the abuse to Wilson in detail in 1976, five years after it took place. Abuse and the Church: What you need to know Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' Inquiry reveals Catholic shame in Australia Magistrate Stone rejected Wilson's claims that he had no memory of the conversation, and said he had found Mr Creigh to be a reliable witness. Another victim, who cannot be named, testified that Wilson had told him he was telling lies, and to recite 10 Hail Mary prayers as punishment. Survivors of abuse said they had mixed feelings about the sentence. One, Peter Gogarty, said it was ""probably letting [Wilson] off a little bit too lightly"". However, Mr Gogarty said: ""We have made history here in Australia. ""The highest-ranking church official to ever be brought to account [for] what we know was a worldwide, systematic abuse of children and the concealment of that abuse."" Mr Creigh did not attend the hearing on Tuesday due to health reasons. But earlierhe told the Adelaide Advertiser,externalthat ""irrespective of the sentencing, the victory was had"" in May when Wilson was convicted. The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said it hoped that the sentence would ""bring some sense of peace"" to Fletcher's victims. It added that the Church had made ""substantial changes"" to prevent abuse and its concealment. Hywel Griffith, BBC News, Sydney Inside the crowded courtroom, survivors and their families listened studiously as the magistrate delivered his decision. There were gasps as Magistrate Stone said only a period of imprisonment would suffice, then disappointment at the prospect of home detention. The sentence is significant - it means a senior Church figure could be made to wear an electronic tag, no longer free to go where he wants. But what angers some victims is that the Church has refused to disown Philip Wilson, and that he holds on to his role as one of its leaders. In 2012, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard set up a royal commission, the country's highest form of public inquiry, to look into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. By the time it had published its final report in December last year, it had handled 42,000 calls and referred more than 2,500 cases to the authorities. It said institutions including churches, schools and sports clubs had ""seriously failed"" to protect children. Catholic institutions came in for particular criticism. Mr Creigh reacts after Wilson was convicted in May Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said ""a national tragedy"" had been exposed. Sex abuse redress scheme begins The first cases of molestation by priests came to light in the 1980s. In the 1990s, revelations began of widespread abuse in Ireland, with cases spreading to more than a dozen countries this century. The abuse victim who has protested in the same spot for 20 years Ireland, the US and Australia have carried out national inquiries, and there have been cover-up scandals such as in the Archdiocese of Boston in the US. Although there have been convictions of priests for sexual abuse, in many cases accused clergymen were either moved or retired by their Church, with financial settlements agreed in some cases, particularly in the US. Victims rights groups have complained the convictions do not often extend beyond priest level, with few senior figures brought to account, although a number have left their positions over their actions in sexual abuse cases,including Cardinal Bernard Law in Boston. One of the most high-profile recent cases has been in Chile.All of its 34 Catholic bishops offered to resign.Pope Francis had handed them a 10-page document accusing Chile's Church hierarchy of negligence in sexual abuse cases.

Childline sees 14% rise in loneliness calls,"Social media may be making isolation worse, Childline has said Childline has seen a 14% rise in the number of children contacting the charity about loneliness. In 2017/18, the charity delivered 4,636 counselling sessions on loneliness,compared to 4,063 the year before. Nearly 80% of sessions went to girls. Some said watching their friends socialise without them on social media made them feel increasingly isolated. This is the second year loneliness data has been recorded - it used to go down as ""low self-esteem"" or ""unhappiness"". The youngest person to call with the problem was just 10 years old. One teenage boy told Childline: ""I see all my friends having a good time on social media and it gets me down, I feel like no one cares enough to invite me. ""My mood is getting worse and now I'm just upset all the time and can't stop crying."" Loneliness more likely in young Is Britain really 'the loneliness capital of Europe'? Is loneliness damaging your health? The charity's founder Dame Esther Rantzen said: ""Loneliness needs to be taken seriously because it is potentially damaging to children's physical and mental health. ""The crucial question is what is causing this rise among the young? ""Are we all too busy to make space and time for our children? Is it that we have lost the habit of eating together? ""Or is it the illusion created by social networks that everyone else is liked, popular and enjoying a far more exciting life so they feel lonelier than ever?"" Younger people aremore prone to feeling lonelythan older age groups, according to the Office for National Statistics. Research in April found that almost 10% of people between the ages of 16 and 24 were ""always or often"" lonely, more than three times higher than people aged 65 or over. Mental Health Foundation's Cal Strode said loneliness among young people could be driven by social media. ""Teens can have thousands of friends online and yet feel unsupported and isolated,"" he said. ""Technology - including social media - could be exacerbating social isolation.""

Missing Thai boys found alive,"This video can not be played Finding the Thai cave boys and getting them out Twelve boys and their football coach missing in caves in Thailand for nine days have been found by divers, in a drama that has gripped the nation. They were discovered by two British divers on a ledge in a cavern after a marathon search operation in the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai. The challenge now will be to extract the party safely, with rising water and mud impeding access. Families of the missing group were ecstatic at news of the rescue. Rescuers had hoped they would find safety on a ledge in an underground chamber nicknamed Pattaya Beach but they were found 400m (440 yards) away having moved to higher ground to avoid the rising water. How will rescuers free the Thai boys? The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search As it happened - the hours after the boys were found There was jubilation among family members camping near the caves The two British rescuers are believed to be Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, who arrived in Thailand early last week. It took them several hours to reach the group on Monday. Invideo posted on Facebook by Thai Navy SEAL special forces,external, one can be heard speaking in English to the group, as they sit on a ledge above water in a cavern, picked out by torchlight. ""How many of you?"" the rescuer asks. ""Thirteen!"" comes the reply. ""Thirteen? Brilliant!"" The group appear to ask when they will be taken to safety and one of the unseen rescuers replies: ""Not today. There's two of us. We have to dive. We are coming. OK? Many people are coming. We are the first."" One of the boys is heard to say: ""Eat, eat, eat, tell them we are hungry."" Thais show their love for lost cave boys What to do to survive underground When the group, whose voices are indistinct, ask what day it is, the divers pause, then one replies, ""Monday, Monday. You have been here... 10 days. You are very strong."" The divers explain that they have to leave but will be back. ""Thank you so much,"" says one of the huddled group. ""Where you come from?"" ""England. The UK."" ""Oh. See you tomorrow."" The group's plight has gripped the country and led to an outpouring of support. The boys aged 11 to 16 and their coach went to explore the caves on 23 June. By Jonathan Head, BBC News, Tham Luang There are scenes of jubilation here at the cave entrance - drowned out by the generators powering the water pumps and filling the air tanks for the dozens of divers whose persistence in the toughest of underground conditions has paid off. Family members celebrated near the cave Now the authorities must figure out how to extract them. The first priority is to get them medical treatment and food where they are, to rebuild their strength. The whole country has watched every stage of this operation, holding its breath for what seemed an increasingly unlikely happy ending. They are not out yet but this is an uplifting breakthrough after the Thai government threw everything it could at the effort to save these boys' lives. A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the missing children The 12 boys are members of the Moo Pa - or Wild Boar - football team. Their 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekkapol Janthawong, is known to have occasionally taken them out on day trips - including a trip to the same cave two years ago. The youngest member, Chanin ""Titan"" Wibrunrungrueang, is 11 - he started playing football aged seven. Duangpet ""Dom"" Promtep, 13, is the team captain and said to be the motivator of the group. Tinnakorn Boonpiem, whose 12-year-old son Mongkol is among the 13, told AFP news agency near the caves she was ""so glad"" to hear they were safe. ""I want to him to be physically and mentally fit,"" she said. ""I'm so happy I can't put it into words,"" another relative of one of the group told reporters as tears of joy streamed down his cheeks. ""They are all safe but the mission is not completed,"" Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn   told a press conference at the command centre at the cave entrance. ""Our mission is to search, rescue and return. So far we just found them. Next mission is to bring them out from the cave and send them home."" The governor said they would continue to drain water out of the cave while sending doctors and nurses to dive into the cave to check the health of the boys and their coach. ""If the doctors say their physical condition is strong enough to be moved, they will take them out from the cave,"" he said. ""We will look after them until they can return to school."" Edd Sorenson, a regional co-ordinator in Florida for the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery Organisation, advises against trying to get the party out through the flooded caves using scuba gear. This video can not be played Footage from the Thai Navy shows rescuers at the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai ""That is extremely dangerous and hazardous, and I would consider that an absolute last resort,"" he told the BBC. ""Having somebody in zero visibility that's not familiar with ... that kind of extreme conditions, it's real easy and very likely that they would panic, and either kill themselves and or the rescuers. ""So at this point, you know, I think they would be better off bringing in food, water, filtration systems, oxygen if the air space needs it and requires it, and at least they have lights and hope now, so I think waiting it out, as long as they can get supplies in there to make them comfortable and warm and fed and hydrated.""

How will the boys get out?,"After nine days, the group of boys and their coach have finally been found After nine days trapped in darkness in a cave in Thailand, 12 boys and their football coach have been found alive. Two British divers found all 13 safe in a cavern in the Tham Luang cave system in the northern Chiang Rai province. But the issue now is to get them all out of the cave with rising waters and mud hindering access and the trapped group's health a major concern. The army saysthe group might have to wait in the cave for up to four months for floods to recede. So what are the options to free the youngsters and their coach? This video can not be played Finding the Thai cave boys and getting them out Missing Thai boys found alive in caves What to do to survive underground ""The option to bring them out by diving is the quickest but it's also the most dangerous,"" Anmar Mirza, national co-ordinator of the US Cave Rescue Commission, told the BBC. Thai navy divers, three top British cave divers and US military personnel all attempted to find the boys. In total, more than 1,000 people have been involved in the operation, including teams from China, Myanmar, Laos and Australia. Oxygen tanks were prepared for divers outside the cave complex These skilled professional divers still needed several hours to get to the trapped group from the entrance, through tiny, debris-strewn passages and aided by round-the-clock water pumping efforts to try to clear the flood waters. And these boys are not trained divers. Edd Sorenson, regional co-ordinator in Florida for the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery Organisation, told the BBC the diving option is ""extremely dangerous and hazardous"", saying he would consider it ""an absolute last resort"". ""Having somebody in zero visibility that's not familiar with... that kind of extreme conditions, it's real easy and very likely that they would panic, and either kill themselves and/ or the rescuers."" Authorities have tried to drill holes in the cave walls to help drain some of the flood water - although the thick rock has hampered efforts. There have also been suggestions that drilling could be another way to get to the boys, and to help them out. But to even begin the process, new roads would need to be built up above the caves to accommodate the heavy drilling equipment needed to break through the rock. Authorities have tried to drill holes to let out flood waters On top of that, Mr Mirza explains you would need to have conducted a survey of the caves and to know them back to front before you could start drilling - otherwise there would be little chance of digging a hole in the correct place for the boys and their coach. ""It sounds easy but it's actually very difficult,"" he says. ""It's a needle in a haystack problem."" In a press conference, Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said they would continue to drain water out of the cave while sending doctors and nurses in to check the health of the boys and their coach. ""If the doctors say their physical condition is strong enough to be moved, they will take them out from the cave,"" he said. But Mr Mirza says their health is a serious concern. ""After nine days without food, you have to watch their food intake,"" he says. Authorities have set up a temporary hospital near the cave entrance in preparation to handle the trapped team People deprived of food can suffer ill-health effects if not properly reintroduced to food - sometimes as severe as heart failure or comas. Mr Mirza says if the group are on high ground, safe from flooding, and can be resupplied there that might be a good option for now. Their ill-health ""significantly compromises the rescue effort,"" he says. Mr Sorenson agrees. ""I think they would be better off bringing in food, water, filtration systems, oxygen if the air space needs it and requires it"", he says. ""They have lights and hope now, so I think waiting it out, as long as they can get supplies in there to make them comfortable and warm and fed and hydrated.""

"Birthday girl, 3, dies after knife attackA knifeman injured eight others at a party for children of refugees in Idaho, police say.US & Canada","This video can not be played ""This was an attack on the most vulnerable"" A three-year-old girl died of her injuries on Monday, after a knife attack at her birthday party left nine injured in Boise, Idaho, US police say. They believe Saturday's attack at a complex, home to many refugees, was motivated by ""vengeance"" after the suspect was asked to leave the place the day before following bad behaviour. Seven people remain in hospital, some with ""serious or critical injuries"". The suspect has been named as Timmy Earl Kinner, a US citizen. All nine people attacked on Saturday are members of refugee families from Ethiopia, Iraq and Syria. Six children - aged between three and 12 - were injured, including the three-year-old birthday girl who died in Utah after being flown there for treatment. Timmy Kinner, a Los Angeles resident, has been charged Police said on Monday that one child has been treated and released from hospital. Police chief William Bones said: ""This was an attack on those who are most vulnerable: our children."" He described the attack, in a statement, as ""untenable, unconscionable"" and ""pure evil"",external. Mr Kinner, 30, is charged with first-degree murder, several counts of aggravated battery and six counts of injury to a child. The Los Angeles resident wanted to represent himself in court, the Associated Press reported, but a judge ordered a public defender. Mr Kinner, who has an extensive criminal history spanning several states, according to police, is being held without bail. Mr Bones told reporters that the evidence did not suggest the attack was a hate crime. The suspect had been staying with an acquaintance at the complex - but was kicked out on Friday due to bad behaviour. He returned the following day to ""exact vengeance"", attacking people at the birthday party, the police chief said. ""It appears from the investigation, it was a matter of where they [victims] lived, not a matter if they knew the suspect,"" Mr Bones added. Boise Mayor Dave Bieter said, in a statement, thathe was ""heartbroken"" to learn of the child's death.,external ""The thought of a happy occasion like a child's birthday party being turned into the darkest of sorrows in such a vicious way is almost unfathomable.""

Riot prison 'overcrowded and in crisis',"This video can not be played Former prison officer Stuart Weddell says he blames the stress of the job for his panic attacks A prison where six inmates have died this year has been branded overcrowded, chaotic and ""controlled by prisoners"". HMP Birmingham was the scene of a huge riot in 2016 involving 600 inmates. Its monitoring board chairman said some live in inhumane conditions, a senior G4S source told the BBC the firm is in ""a state of chaos"" and a former officer said the jail manages crisis every day. G4S has denied the claims saying it accepted there were challenges but it was in control and making improvements. The Ministry of Justice said of those who have died in the prison this year, two of the deaths were down to natural causes, one was self-inflicted and it is awaiting more information on the remaining three. But prison charity the Howard League for Penal Reform said the figure was the joint highest in England and Wales this year, along with HMP Durham, and added the figures were ""extremely concerning"". Roger Swindells, from the prison's Independent Monitoring Board, cited a number of problems within the jail, including overcrowding, with inmates in the Victorian cells facing cramped conditions with cockroaches and rat infestations. HMP Birmingham, formerly known as Winson Green Prison, has been run by G4S since 2011 He said there was also a high sickness rate among officers and problems with staff retention. G4S, which currently runs five of the 14 privately run jails in the UK, took over the management of the prison in 2011. It promised to ""continue to invest"" in Birmingham, which holds more than 1,400 inmates. Carl Brookes and Ross Queen were both cleared of prison mutiny but admitted taking a selfie during the riot But Stuart Weddell, who worked at the jail from 1995 until October 2017, said staffing numbers, including among the most experienced staff, had been cut to unsafe levels since the firm took over. He said he was dismissed by G4S on health grounds after being diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder and depression, which he said was due to his job. The 52-year-old, from the West Midlands, who said he considered suicide at one point, added: ""It was absolutely horrendous. ""Staff assaults daily, staffing figures had been eroded to terrible levels. Chaotic. Crisis management every day. An unverified photo appears to show debris and damage caused during the disturbance ""You didn't really have any control of the prisoners. The prisoners were controlling you. The prisoners were running the jail."" His comments come after a string of incidents at the jail, which have included: Inmates appeared to live-stream footage of them smoking drugs and using mobile phones in April Twenty-eight prisoners were moved after some refused to return to their cell last September In June 2016, inspectors reported that violence was on the rise because of a high volume of illegal drugs inside Inmates built bonfires and baited an injured prisoner during a 15-hour riot in December 2016 Mr Weddell, who said he was nominated for Prison Officer of the Year in 2013, said the stress of the job led to him deteriorating mentally and having regular anxiety attacks, leaving him now unable to work. ""I would sit in my car for a length of time trying to get myself in the right state of mind to do a day's work. ""I've gone from walking past 200 prisoners out on a wing to not being able to cope in a supermarket."" G4S is adamant it's in control of a troublesome prison. However, a senior source at the organisation has told the BBC the company is in ""a state of chaos"" and that the management is struggling to work out what steps to take to bring order in the jail. Since the riot 18 months ago, the prison has been in the spotlight and G4S has been trying to fight off criticism. But recent episodes haven't helped its image. In April, inmates at HMP Birmingham live-streamed footage of themselves using mobile phones and smoking what looked like drugs. The managing director of G4S has repeatedly said the situation at the jail is improving. However, six fatalities this year alone, with a grim image portrayed by the chair of the monitoring board as an overcrowded jail infested with rats, arguably paints a contrasting picture. The chair of the board does say he believes the prison is going in a positive direction but he eagerly awaits the next inspectorate of prisons' report to see its assessment. Follow Sima Kotecha on Twitter,external Mr Weddell warned the regular incidents of colleagues being ""punched, kicked, spat on"", or having faeces thrown at them, could escalate and it was only a matter of time before an officer was more seriously assaulted, or worse. He said he was still in contact with officers at the jail and feared another riot could happen. Jerry Petherick from G4S said he would not allow people to live in conditions that were not acceptable Stolen keys were used to free the hundreds of prisoners from their cellson 16 December 2016, before inmates threw TVs out of windows, built bonfires and used an injured prisoner as ""bait"" during the disorder. Ten men were subsequently jailed for their part in the disorder. But Mr Swindells said the recent appointment of Rob Kellett as the new director at the prison, which he said had been in the top 10 of the most concerning jails for at least the past three years, had led to some positive changes. ""It is a troublesome prison. It has been a troubled prison. It still has a lot of difficulties to face up toâ¦ but I am satisfied at the moment those are being tackled,"" he said. More than 600 prisoners were involved in the riot in 2016 Incidents of violence over the past three months had been reducing, he added. Mr Petherick said he could not comment on Mr Weddell's claims but said staff were able to access support at the jail if they needed it. He accepted the prison was still in a recovery phase from the riot, but said the initial rise in staff attrition and sickness rates had now declined, which were good indicators for the running of the category B jail. He denied there were overcrowding issues, adding: ""From time to time, not least because of the age of the buildings, there are issues we have to deal with. ""Let me make it absolutely clear. I'm not going to have people living in conditions that are not acceptable."" But Andrew Neilson, Director of Campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said Birmingham has been under tremendous strain in recent years, ""While some of Birmingham's problems are systemic, it is notable that this was the first public sector prison to be privatised. Seven years on from that decision, there is little to suggest that privatisation has been successful and much to be deeply concerned about.""

'Root and branch reform' needed post-Windrush,"""Root and branch reform"" of the Home Office's approach to immigration is needed following the Windrush scandal, according to a committee of MPs.

Missing Thai boys found alive in caves,"This video can not be played Finding the Thai cave boys and getting them out Twelve boys and their football coach missing in caves in Thailand for nine days have been found by divers, in a drama that has gripped the nation. They were discovered by two British divers on a ledge in a cavern after a marathon search operation in the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai. The challenge now will be to extract the party safely, with rising water and mud impeding access. Families of the missing group were ecstatic at news of the rescue. Rescuers had hoped they would find safety on a ledge in an underground chamber nicknamed Pattaya Beach but they were found 400m (440 yards) away having moved to higher ground to avoid the rising water. How will rescuers free the Thai boys? The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search As it happened - the hours after the boys were found There was jubilation among family members camping near the caves The two British rescuers are believed to be Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, who arrived in Thailand early last week. It took them several hours to reach the group on Monday. Invideo posted on Facebook by Thai Navy SEAL special forces,external, one can be heard speaking in English to the group, as they sit on a ledge above water in a cavern, picked out by torchlight. ""How many of you?"" the rescuer asks. ""Thirteen!"" comes the reply. ""Thirteen? Brilliant!"" The group appear to ask when they will be taken to safety and one of the unseen rescuers replies: ""Not today. There's two of us. We have to dive. We are coming. OK? Many people are coming. We are the first."" One of the boys is heard to say: ""Eat, eat, eat, tell them we are hungry."" Thais show their love for lost cave boys What to do to survive underground When the group, whose voices are indistinct, ask what day it is, the divers pause, then one replies, ""Monday, Monday. You have been here... 10 days. You are very strong."" The divers explain that they have to leave but will be back. ""Thank you so much,"" says one of the huddled group. ""Where you come from?"" ""England. The UK."" ""Oh. See you tomorrow."" The group's plight has gripped the country and led to an outpouring of support. The boys aged 11 to 16 and their coach went to explore the caves on 23 June. By Jonathan Head, BBC News, Tham Luang There are scenes of jubilation here at the cave entrance - drowned out by the generators powering the water pumps and filling the air tanks for the dozens of divers whose persistence in the toughest of underground conditions has paid off. Family members celebrated near the cave Now the authorities must figure out how to extract them. The first priority is to get them medical treatment and food where they are, to rebuild their strength. The whole country has watched every stage of this operation, holding its breath for what seemed an increasingly unlikely happy ending. They are not out yet but this is an uplifting breakthrough after the Thai government threw everything it could at the effort to save these boys' lives. A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the missing children The 12 boys are members of the Moo Pa - or Wild Boar - football team. Their 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekkapol Janthawong, is known to have occasionally taken them out on day trips - including a trip to the same cave two years ago. The youngest member, Chanin ""Titan"" Wibrunrungrueang, is 11 - he started playing football aged seven. Duangpet ""Dom"" Promtep, 13, is the team captain and said to be the motivator of the group. Tinnakorn Boonpiem, whose 12-year-old son Mongkol is among the 13, told AFP news agency near the caves she was ""so glad"" to hear they were safe. ""I want to him to be physically and mentally fit,"" she said. ""I'm so happy I can't put it into words,"" another relative of one of the group told reporters as tears of joy streamed down his cheeks. ""They are all safe but the mission is not completed,"" Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn   told a press conference at the command centre at the cave entrance. ""Our mission is to search, rescue and return. So far we just found them. Next mission is to bring them out from the cave and send them home."" The governor said they would continue to drain water out of the cave while sending doctors and nurses to dive into the cave to check the health of the boys and their coach. ""If the doctors say their physical condition is strong enough to be moved, they will take them out from the cave,"" he said. ""We will look after them until they can return to school."" Edd Sorenson, a regional co-ordinator in Florida for the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery Organisation, advises against trying to get the party out through the flooded caves using scuba gear. This video can not be played Footage from the Thai Navy shows rescuers at the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai ""That is extremely dangerous and hazardous, and I would consider that an absolute last resort,"" he told the BBC. ""Having somebody in zero visibility that's not familiar with ... that kind of extreme conditions, it's real easy and very likely that they would panic, and either kill themselves and or the rescuers. ""So at this point, you know, I think they would be better off bringing in food, water, filtration systems, oxygen if the air space needs it and requires it, and at least they have lights and hope now, so I think waiting it out, as long as they can get supplies in there to make them comfortable and warm and fed and hydrated.""

The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search,"This video can not be played The moment divers discover the missing boys The first voice 12 young Thai footballers and their coach heard after nine days trapped in caves was that of Briton John Volanthen. ""How many of you?"" he asked. ""Thirteen? Brilliant."" It meant that, finally, they had been found. Mr Volanthen and Richard Stanton were in the cave after being called in by Thai authorities along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper. The trio arrived in Thailand three days after the football team went missing. More than 1,000 people have been involved in the operation, from all over the world. (Left to right) Richard Stanton, Robert Harper and John Volanthen The British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC) - the body for voluntary underground rescue in the British Isles - said it has been in contact with the British divers since their return. Bill Whitehouse, the council's vice chairman, said the men had described the dive as ""gnarly"" in an email, meaning there were complications and problems. Thai cave search: As it happened How to survive underground Thailand shows love for trapped boys It was a three-hour round trip, involving a 1.5km passage, partly flooded and partly open, he told BBC's Breakfast. On hearing the boys had been found, Mr Whitehouse said: ""It was really quite a moment, I can tell you."" However, he said that ""moment of euphoria"" for the divers and the boys would have been followed by: ""Now what?""

Mr Stanton, a retired firefighter from Coventry, was also involved in the rescue of six British cavers in Mexico in 2004. Richard Stanton was made an MBE in recognition of his cave diving rescue services During that rescue Mr Stanton was able to persuade one of the group - who was terrified of water - to make a 180-metre dive out of the cave, the West Midlands Fire Service said. Ina 2007 interview,external, he said he became interested in diving after watching a programme called ""Underground Eiger"" as a child. He joined caving and diving clubs at university. Speaking to the BBC in 2004 he described the difficulties of navigating caves: ""When people landed on the moon they had a map, they knew where they were going but in a cave if you're beyond the known limit of the cave, nobody knows where it goes, you never know what will happen round the corner."" Mr Stanton was made an MBE in the New Year's Honours List at the end of 2012 for his cave diving rescue services. John Volanthen is a member of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team Mr Volanthen is an IT consultant based in Bristol but who grew up in Brighton. He started caving as a scout. Speaking to theSunday Times in 2013,external, he said cave rescue requires a calm head. ""Panic and adrenaline are great in certain situations - but not in cave-diving,"" he said. ""The last thing you want is any adrenaline whatsoever."" He added: ""It [cave diving] is like that puzzle with the fox, the chicken and the grain. It's not dangerous if you do it right.""

How will rescuers free them?,"After nine days, the group of boys and their coach have finally been found After nine days trapped in darkness in a cave in Thailand, 12 boys and their football coach have been found alive. Two British divers found all 13 safe in a cavern in the Tham Luang cave system in the northern Chiang Rai province. But the issue now is to get them all out of the cave with rising waters and mud hindering access and the trapped group's health a major concern. The army saysthe group might have to wait in the cave for up to four months for floods to recede. So what are the options to free the youngsters and their coach? This video can not be played Finding the Thai cave boys and getting them out Missing Thai boys found alive in caves What to do to survive underground ""The option to bring them out by diving is the quickest but it's also the most dangerous,"" Anmar Mirza, national co-ordinator of the US Cave Rescue Commission, told the BBC. Thai navy divers, three top British cave divers and US military personnel all attempted to find the boys. In total, more than 1,000 people have been involved in the operation, including teams from China, Myanmar, Laos and Australia. Oxygen tanks were prepared for divers outside the cave complex These skilled professional divers still needed several hours to get to the trapped group from the entrance, through tiny, debris-strewn passages and aided by round-the-clock water pumping efforts to try to clear the flood waters. And these boys are not trained divers. Edd Sorenson, regional co-ordinator in Florida for the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery Organisation, told the BBC the diving option is ""extremely dangerous and hazardous"", saying he would consider it ""an absolute last resort"". ""Having somebody in zero visibility that's not familiar with... that kind of extreme conditions, it's real easy and very likely that they would panic, and either kill themselves and/ or the rescuers."" Authorities have tried to drill holes in the cave walls to help drain some of the flood water - although the thick rock has hampered efforts. There have also been suggestions that drilling could be another way to get to the boys, and to help them out. But to even begin the process, new roads would need to be built up above the caves to accommodate the heavy drilling equipment needed to break through the rock. Authorities have tried to drill holes to let out flood waters On top of that, Mr Mirza explains you would need to have conducted a survey of the caves and to know them back to front before you could start drilling - otherwise there would be little chance of digging a hole in the correct place for the boys and their coach. ""It sounds easy but it's actually very difficult,"" he says. ""It's a needle in a haystack problem."" In a press conference, Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said they would continue to drain water out of the cave while sending doctors and nurses in to check the health of the boys and their coach. ""If the doctors say their physical condition is strong enough to be moved, they will take them out from the cave,"" he said. But Mr Mirza says their health is a serious concern. ""After nine days without food, you have to watch their food intake,"" he says. Authorities have set up a temporary hospital near the cave entrance in preparation to handle the trapped team People deprived of food can suffer ill-health effects if not properly reintroduced to food - sometimes as severe as heart failure or comas. Mr Mirza says if the group are on high ground, safe from flooding, and can be resupplied there that might be a good option for now. Their ill-health ""significantly compromises the rescue effort,"" he says. Mr Sorenson agrees. ""I think they would be better off bringing in food, water, filtration systems, oxygen if the air space needs it and requires it"", he says. ""They have lights and hope now, so I think waiting it out, as long as they can get supplies in there to make them comfortable and warm and fed and hydrated.""

"LGBT people 'fear holding hands in public'A government survey of 108,000 LGBT people suggests 68% avoid holding hands in public.UK","Controversial ""gay conversion therapies"" are to be banned as part of a government plan to improve the lives of gay and transgender people. A national survey,externalof 108,000 members of the LGBT community suggested 2% have undergone the practice with another 5% having been offered it. It also found more than two-thirds of LGBT people avoid holding hands in public, for fear of negative reactions. The prime minister said nobody ""should ever have to hide who they are"". A 75-point plan to improve the lives of LGBT people, costing Â£4.5m, has been produced in response to the survey. It includes plans to introduce a national LGBT health adviser, tackle discrimination, improve the response to hate crime and to improve diversity in education institutions. Theresa May has also launched a 16-week public consultation in England and Wales about the process of gender reassignment after research showed that trans people find it ""overly bureaucratic and invasive"".

While the government did not offer a definition of ""conversion therapy"", its report said it ""can range from pseudo-psychological treatments to, in extreme cases, surgical interventions and 'corrective' rape"". Faith organisations were by far the most likely to have carried out the practice, according to the report. It is often either forced on people or they go voluntarily. The NHS does not refer people for it and disagrees with the practice. Equalities minister Penny Mordaunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme of the practice: ""This is very extreme so-called therapy that is there to try and 'cure' someone from being gay - of course you can't cure someone from being gay. In its most extreme form it can involve corrective rape. ""That's very different from psychological services and counselling. It's pretty unpleasant, some of the results we found, and it shows that there's more action to do."" She said the government is consulting on the best way to implement a ban, adding: ""It's absolutely right that that abhorrent practice has to go."" Journalist Patrick Strudwick, who went undercover to expose so-called conversion therapists, said he has ""seen, and felt, the damage it does"", writing: ""Conversion therapy does need to be banned. It is abuse."" He said it would be difficult to do so though, with the government recognising the scale of the issue. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There are many, many young people suffering mental issues, self-harm, suicidal tendencies as a result of this, because they feel so guilty when it doesn't work."" Vicky Beeching sought therapy as a teenager, but the experience led to depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and physical health symptoms. ""This is devastating,"" she said of such practices. ""People's lives are literally in the balance."" Dr Louise Theodosiou of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which ""100% backs the ban"", told the programme: ""There's no evidence base to support this therapy. Your sexuality and your gender ID are inherent and there's no evidence base and no therapeutic treatment to change what is simply part of someone's nature."" By Michelle Roberts, BBC News online health editor Sometimes called ""reparative"" or ""gay cure"" therapy, conversion therapy is a term used for any form of so-called treatment which attempts to change sexual orientation or reduce attraction to others of the same sex. Experts say the word therapy is misleading because there is no scientific basis for it Allmajor therapy professional bodies,externalas well as the NHS in the UK disagree with it on logical, ethical and moral grounds. Stonewall says,externalthat ""no one should be told their identity is something that can be cured"". Those identifying as gay or lesbian made up 61% of respondents to the survey, carried out between July and October last year. Just over a quarter identified as bisexual and a small number identified as pansexual (4%) and asexual (2%). People identifying as transgender accounted for 13% of respondents. A quarter of those who took part in the survey said they were not open at all about being LGBT with family members they lived with. Of the trans men who took part in the survey, 56% said they had avoided expressing their gender identity for fear of a negative reaction from others. That figure rose to 59% for trans women and 76% for non-binary respondents. LGBT hate incidents had been experienced by 40% of people in the survey, with more than nine in 10 of the most serious offences going unreported. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We can be proud that the UK is a world leader in advancing LGBT rights, but the overwhelming response to our survey has shone a light on the many areas where we can improve the lives of LGBT people. ""I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction. ""No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love."" Ruth Hunt, chief executive of Stonewall, said she was pleased the government was listening to the LGBT community,. But she added there was ""still a long way to go until we reach full equality"". Campaigner Peter Tatchell welcomed the government trying to ban conversion therapy. But he said the 75 point-plan did not go far enough. ""The biggest fail is the lack of any pledge to end the detention and deportation of LGBT+ refugees fleeing persecution in violently homophobic countries like Uganda, Iran, Russia, Egypt and Jamaica,"" he said. ""Another big omission is the absence of any commitment to compensate gay and bisexual men who were convicted under past anti-gay laws.""
