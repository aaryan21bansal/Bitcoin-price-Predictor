Nokia warns UK over using Huawei 5G kit,"Nokia has been showing off its own 5G equipment at the Mobile World Congress expo in Shanghai Telecoms giant Nokia has disowned the comments one of its senior executives made about rival Huawei. Nokia's chief technology officer Marcus Weldon told the BBC that the UK should be wary of using the Chinese hardware. He said Huawei's telecoms kit had vulnerabilities that meant it posed a risk to 5G networks. In a statement issued after the BBC story was published,,externalthe Finnish firm said his comments do ""not reflect the official position of Nokia"". It added: ""Nokia is focused on the integrity of its own products and services and does not have its own assessment of any potential vulnerabilities associated with its competitors."" The statement undermines assertions made by Mr Weldon in which he said Huawei's failings were serious. He pointed to a new report from US security firm Finite State,which detailed vulnerabilities in Huawei enterprise networking equipment.,external ""In virtually all categories we studied,"" the report said, ""we found Huawei devices to be less secure than comparable devices from other vendors."" Mr Weldon added: ""Some of it seems to be just sloppiness, honestly, that they haven't patched things, they haven't upgraded. But some of it is real obfuscation, where they make it look like they have the secure version when they don't."" In the UK, Huawei equipment has been subject to close scrutiny by a unit staffed by GCHQ. It has produced reports severely critical of the security of some software, although it has not found backdoors in the firm's products. ""We read those reports and we think OK, we're doing a much better job than they are,"" said Mr Weldon. He conceded that Nokia's equipment was not subject to the same checks in the UK as Huawei, but said it did face scrutiny around the world. He said Nokia's equipment was ""a safer bet"" for mobile operators. Huawei has denied that its equipment poses a security risk, with a spokesman calling Mr Weldon's comments ""misleading"". US Huawei supplier resumes some shipments Huawei smartphone sales hit amid US curbs 5G: Finally, it's here in the UK - so what? In a separate statement given after Nokia disowned the tech boss's comments, Huawei said Nokia's had recognised that ""ill-informed loose talk does not help our customers or the industry more widely"". It added: ""We win new business by fair competition and on the basis of our technology and customer focus, not by denigrating our competitors. ""The best way to improve cyber security and ensure network resilience is for all vendors to agree to independent testing of their equipment and source code - just as we have done in the UK,"" it said. Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson are competing with Huawei to sell next-generation telecoms equipment. Huawei is seen as leading the race in many markets, but the US is putting pressure on allies, including the UK, to bar the firm over security fears. Mr Weldon said the pressure from the US was serving as a counterbalance to unfair financial advantages that Huawei had enjoyed in the past. ""It's fairness returning to the market,"" he told the BBC. ""We were disadvantaged in the past relative to the practices that the Chinese were allowed to have in terms of funding mechanisms."" US networks are deploying Nokia's radio antennas as part of their 5G rollout A Huawei spokesman said: ""We believe secure, resilient networks can only be delivered by collaboration across the whole industry, working to common standards on privacy protection and cyber-security, so that all participants can be judged equally. ""We have a proven track record of delivering secure, trustworthy and high-quality products to every major telecoms operator in Europe. Cyber-security remains Huawei's top priority and here, in the UK, we are subject to the most rigorous oversight compared to any competitors in our sector."" This video can not be played Robert Strayer, a senior US cyber-security official, told the BBC that Huawei's vulnerabilities 'create a bug door'' The UK government has been conducting a review into the security of Huawei's telecoms supply chain and Mr Weldon said: ""That means being wary of adding Chinese vendors into network infrastructure, as long as these security vulnerabilities are either provably there or likely to be there based on past practices."" He said Huawei represented a risk relative to Nokia and Ericsson. Huawei has invested heavily in 5G technologies in the expectation of them driving future profits It was reported in April that the prime minister had decided that, while the Chinese firm should not be allowed into the heart of 5G networks, it would not be banned completely. Downing Street has insisted that a final decision has yet to be made UK mobile operators are beginning to roll out 5G networks and are all using some Huawei equipment. They have warned that a ban on the Chinese firm would mean a lengthy delay in the 5G roll-out and added costs because of a lack of competition.

Supreme Court blocks census citizenship question,"Demonstrators rally against the citizenship question The US Supreme Court has blocked the Trump administration from adding a question on citizenship to the 2020 census for the time being. The White House has argued that the question will bolster protections for minority voters. But opponents say it could deter immigrant households from taking part because of fears that data could be shared with law enforcement agencies. President Trump responded by saying he would try to delay the census. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The justices wrote in a 5-4 ruling that the reason for including the question seemed ""contrived"". Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's liberal justices, saying the administration did not provide adequate justification for the question. The Census Bureau's own experts say it would lead to a major undercount. Though the ruling deals a blow to the Trump administration, the complicated decision does not bar the question for either its language or the underlying premise. Instead, by sending the case back to a lower court, Justice Roberts left open the possibility that the Trump administration could provide the necessary justification to add a question on citizenship to the census. The battle over the 2020 census has played out across the US. Civil rights groups have called it an attack on people of colour. Three federal judges have issued rulings to block the question, one calling it a threat ""to the very foundation"" of US democracy. Trump defends census citizenship question US census citizenship query sparks outcry Why is the US Supreme Court so important? And though the Trump administration has maintained the question is necessary for an accurate national headcount, the majority decision pointed to a ""disconnect between the decision made and the explanation given"". ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?"" If the Trump administration eventually gets its way, federal law will require this question be asked of every living person in the US as part of the 2020 census. The citizenship question has not appeared on a US census for all Americans since 1950, though it has been asked to some subsets of the population between 1970 and 2000. The once-a-decade population count helps the US government draw up districts for state and local elections, and determine how much federal funding each state receives - a matter of hundreds of billions of dollars. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross - the billionaire financier who oversees the Census Bureau - testified to Congress last year that the request for the citizenship question came from the Department of Justice. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross testified that the question is needed for an accurate count According to Mr Ross, the justice department needs more accurate data to enforce the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters. In a 2018 report, Census Bureau researchers found that the inclusion of a citizenship question will likely suppress response rates in households with immigrants and minority groups, leading to a ""lower-quality population count"". But Mr Ross has insisted that detailed citizenship data is of ""greater importance than any adverse effect"" posed by an undercount. When it comes to including a citizenship question to the 2020 census, Donald Trump had the US Constitution on his side - but that wasn't enough. It's been a common critique of the Trump administration - at least from their supporters - that many of the sweeping conservative changes it has tried to achieve have been undermined by ham-handed implementation. Environmental and workplace deregulation and tougher immigration and border policies have been tied up in the courts because officials in charge were either sloppy or unaware of proper procedures. Much to the delight of the president's political opponents, the citizenship question can be added to this list. It is well within the power of a presidential administration to ask about citizenship status, a majority of the justices wrote, but it needs to be clear and up-front about why. The Trump team wasn't. Now it's back to the drawing board for the White House, with little if any time to find a way forward. Those on the left feared including citizenship would deprived immigrant communities of needed government resources and stripped them - and the Democrats who largely represent them - of political power. These fears have been put to rest for now. The battle over the 2020 census hinges on the motives underlying the new question. The White House maintains the decision was made for practical reasons. Mr Trump has defended the citizenship question ""When you have a census and you're not allowed to talk about whether or not somebody's a citizen or not, that doesn't sound so good to me,"" Mr Trump said to reporters in June. But critics claim the question has more insidious origins. Democrats and civil rights groups say the question is politically motivated, meant to suppress responses from particular groups, namely immigrants and racial minorities. ""Is it really about citizenship?"" said Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib. ""No. It's about reducing the number of people of colour being counted in the census. That's exactly what it's about."" This suspicion has been fuelled by reports, released last month, that the question was the brainchild of a top Republican political consultant who argued it would help his party politically. US Representative Rashida Tlaib has called the new question politically motivated Redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller, who died last August, had concluded in a 2015 study that adding the question to the 2020 census would create an electoral advantage for Republicans and ""non-Hispanic Whites"" by altering voting districts. And released emails show that Mr Ross lobbied the justice department for a question on citizenship, contradicting his previous claims that the request originated from them. The Supreme Court's decision appears to confirm Mr Ross's decisive role in pushing the question forward. ""Materials before us indicate that Commerce went to great lengths to elicit the request from DOJ (or any other willing agency"", Justice Roberts wrote for the majority. Congressional Democrats have recently ramped up efforts to access more documents that could shed light on the decision. Last week, after the White House refused to hand over materials regarding the decision to ask the citizenship question, the House Oversight Committee voted to hold both Mr Ross and US Attorney General William Barr in contempt. The Census Bureau's research indicates the citizenship question will dramatically reduce the number of people willing to participate, particularly among those who fear it could lead to deportation. Adding the question could mean that up to 4 million people - mostly Latinos and African Americans - go uncounted, according to a study from the Urban Institute, a non-partisan research group based in Washington. The proposed citizenship question has provoked protests across the US The ""last-minute introduction"" of a citizenship question has incited ""a potential chill"" among immigrants groups, the study said. Even in a lower-risk scenario, the 2020 count will be less accurate than previous years. This will almost certainly favour the Republican party, at the expense of Democrats. The US census determines the size of each state's congressional delegation, and shapes how congressional and state legislative boundaries are drawn within them. The census also guides how an estimated $880bn (Â£633bn) in public funding is distributed for schools, roads and other public services. The states with the highest immigration populations, such as California and New Mexico, are at greatest risk of an undercount. Many of these states tend to vote Democrat. Depressed response rates in these states will allow for electorate boundaries to be redrawn, pulling political power - and funding - away from Democratic-leaning, minority households. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the question this month, just in time for the Census Bureau to print out the 1.5bn questionnaires needed to begin the national headcount this summer.

Workers join gig economy to make ends meet,"Daniel Lewis does gig economy work on top of his full-time job to increase his earning power Daniel Lewis, 33, was struggling to save up to buy a house, despite saving for years from his full-time 37-hour-a-week job. To increase his earnings, he started doing an additional 14 hours a week of part-time, or gig economy, work. The number of people doing gig economy work has doubled in the past three years, the TUC trades union body says. Young people are most likely to be doing this type of flexible, insecure work. The TUC says the majority of people using apps such as Uber or Handy to find work have other jobs. This shows that ""working people are battling to making ends meet"", said TUC chief Frances O'Grady. Mr Lewis and his partner Zoe, based in Leeds, had a target of saving up Â£9,000 for a house deposit. However, they still didn't have enough money after saving money from their monthly wages into an ISA and using the government's help-to-buy scheme. In 20 months, Mr Lewis managed to earn Â£4,500 extra after tax to help them reach their goal, by working an additional 3.5 hours a day, four times a week, as a driver for Amazon and Uber Eats. ""We were stuck in the rental market for years - you tend to find you don't have anything left at the end of it, especially those who come out of university,"" he told the BBC. ""It was literally the only way we could get onto the property ladder, given the amount of money you have to save these days."" Even though they now have a house, Mr Lewis continues to do gig economy work in order to help with additional expenses, such as doing up their garden. ""I've continued to do it because you just get used to having the money I suppose,"" he added. He was attracted to work for Amazon and Uber Eats because both services pay their drivers once a week and offer instant, flexible working. These benefits outweighed the fact that he had to pay for his own petrol and do his own taxes, because gig economy workers are classed as being self-employed. Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too Workplace reforms 'will protect gig economy workers' One in 10 working age adults now find gig economy work through apps or websites, the TUC said, compared with about one in 20 in 2016. The data comes from a survey of 2,235 UK residents carried out by the University of Hertfordshire and Ipsos Mori. The survey of 2,235 UK residents found that nearly two-thirds of workers using apps to find work at least once a week were aged between 16 and 34. Ms O'Grady said: ""Huge numbers are being forced to take on casual and insecure platform work - often on top of other jobs. ""But as we've seen with Uber, too often these workers are denied their rights and are treated like disposable labour."" Ursula Huws, professor of labour and globalisation at the University of Hertfordshire, said the work being sought was not just taxi driving and food delivery. ""They're only a small proportion of gig workers. They're outnumbered by an invisible army of people working remotely on their computers or smartphones or providing services in other people's homes,"" she said. Six in 10 of the respondents to the survey admitted buying services in this way at some point. The TUC said the survey showed that it was time for all workers to get basic rights such as the minimum wage and holiday. ""The world of work is changing fast and working people don't have the protection they need,"" Ms O'Grady said. At the end of last year, the government said it was introducing measures to give better protection to workers on zero-hour contracts, agency employees or gig economy workers. Staff would have to be told details of their rights from their first day in a job, including eligibility for paid and sick leave, and given the right to require more predictable hours. In February 2018,the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy published research,externalshowing that 4.4% of the population in Great Britain had worked in the gig economy in the last 12 months.

Baby badly injured in flat window fall,"Emergency services were called to Wellington Street in Luton at about 13:00 A baby has been taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries after falling from an open window of a first-floor flat. Emergency services were called to Wellington Street in Luton at about 13:00 BST. Jason Watkins, who works in the street, said he had been told it was a boy who was hurt. He said the road was closed but had since reopened. Police have asked anyone who was in the area at the time to get in touch. The child's age or sex has not been confirmed by Bedfordshire Police. Albert Constantin, 32, a barber who has a shop nearby, said he saw the boy on the ground and a lot of people crowded around. He heard one woman, who came to help, on the phone to the emergency services and she was told to put the baby on his side. Albert Constantin runs a barber shop close to where the baby fell Albert Popescu, 32, a builder from Luton, said he was in the street when he heard a woman, who he thought was the child's mother, screaming ""help me, help me"". ""We all gathered round while we saw the baby being put on its shoulders by a man. There was silence for a minute or two, before the baby started crying."" George Feron, 44, the manager of Luton Market, said: ""It was really amazing to see everyone come together to help this woman. ""People in the street gathered round her, were holding her. They stood around for around two, three hours. ""I have lived here for 25 years and I've never seen anything like it in this town.""

UK Astra production 'depends on Brexit',"The Vauxhall Astra is currently built in Ellesmere Port The next generation of the Vauxhall Astra will be built at its Ellesmere Port car plant if a satisfactory Brexit deal is reached, its owners have said. The PSA Group said it would also invest in the RÃ¼sselsheim plant in Germany to manufacture Opel Astras from 2021. It said the decision would be conditional on the New Vehicle Agreement, negotiated with Unite. In a statement, it said the decision demonstrated ""the continuous effort and commitment"" of the group. Currently the Vauxhall and Opel Astra are built in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, which was opened in 1962, and in Gliwice, Poland. The PSA Group said the decision on the allocation to the Ellesmere Port plant ""will be conditional on the final terms of the UK's exit from the European Union and the acceptance of the New Vehicle Agreement, which has been negotiated with the Unite trade union"". The New Vehicle Agreement is an agreement between management and unions covering working practices along with terms and conditions which are struck prior to the production of new models. By BBC business correspondent Theo Leggett Vauxhall employs about 3,000 people in the UK The decision to build the new model at Ellesmere Port would help to safeguard the future of the Cheshire plant, which has been in doubt since PSA Group took control of Vauxhall in 2017. The factory currently makes an older version of the Astra, but sales have been declining, and the number of people working there has almost halved since the takeover. Under the plan, Ellesmere Port would be one of two factories which will begin building the new Astra in 2021. However, PSA Group has made it clear the decision to build the car in the UK will depend on the terms of the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. Sources say the minimum the company is looking for is a commitment to frictionless trade after Brexit, and no-deal is not an option. Vauxhall has previously said it faces falling sales and relatively high manufacturing costs at the Ellesmere Port plant, which employs about 1,100 people. A Unite union spokesman, said: ""PSA have made it very clear that no deal means no deal for Ellesmere Port. ""We are calling on the government to take no deal off the table so that the future of Ellesmere Port - and the thousands of jobs in the supply chain - can be secured."" Vauxhall owner warns over no-deal Brexit Ford to cut 12,000 jobs in Europe What's behind the car industry crisis? Car production has been falling in the UK over the past year, amid increasing pleas from the industry for a Brexit deal. The UK's automotive industry has received a series of blows in recent months, with Honda announcing it will close its Swindon plant in 2021. Ford also said its Bridgend engine plant in south Wales would close in September 2020 with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Japanese car producers, including Nissan, have said that Brexit uncertainty is not helping them ""plan for the future"".

How iPhones have changed over the years,"He's the key designer behind the iPhone, iMac and iPod: products which have helped make Apple the world's most valuable company. But now Sir Jony Ive isleaving the tech giant to set up his own business. Despitesome recent falls in sales,the iPhone is still a giant in the mobile market. Now as the man largely responsible for the iconic phone leaves, we cast our minds back to the evolution of the handset. Can you remember how we got to a point where an iPhone can cost more than a thousand pounds in just over eleven years of existence? We've taken a look at the key changes - from its size and features to its fluctuating price. iPhone 2G - remember when an iPhone could actually fit in the palm of your hand? Let's not get our Gs mixed up here - the 1st generation iPhone was released in the United States, June 2007. Apple gave a $499 (Â£381) price tag for the 4GB model and $599 (Â£457) for the 8GB model. Despite being the first generation it became known as the iPhone 2G because Apple decided only to make it work with the 2G data network, not the faster 3G. It is now considered a collector's item by some - and has been sold on eBay for significantly more than its original retail price. 'Twice as fast, for half the price' The iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 across 22 different countries and sold over 1 million units in its first weekend. The second generation phone came in two colours - black and white - and was priced significantly cheaper at Â£99 with a two-year contract. The phone came with iOS 2.0 software and received a wave of other updates enabling features such as multimedia messaging (MMS) and copy and paste. A year later the iPhone 3GS was released - the S stood for speed - the new slogan being: ""The fastest, smartest phone yet."" The iPhone 3G was discontinued in June 2010. Apple CEO Steve Jobs passed away in 2011, aged 56 Back in June 2010, the fourth generation iPhone was revealed at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, CEO Steve Jobs dubbed the iPhone 4 as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time. ""This changes everything. Again,"" was the slogan this time. The phones newly introduced front-facing camera gave Apple an edge on other smartphone competitors - as it meant there was nowFaceTime video chat. The 16GB model would have cost you Â£499, and the 32GB version Â£599. A fifth generation device, the iPhone 4S was released just over a year later - which introduced voice-assistant Siri for the very first time in October 2011. 'The biggest thing to happen to iPhone since iPhone"" The iPhone 5 was released in September 2012 and was the last Apple device which had been overseen by Steve Jobs - he had died the year before in 2011. When Apple had begun taking pre-orders they'd received over two million orders in 24 hours. Its new features included being 4G enabled, being thinner, lighter andhaving a taller screen than its predecessors. The iPhone 5 was priced at Â£529 (16GB), Â£599 (32G) and Â£699 (64GB). The announcement of the iPhone 5C and 5S in 2013 signified Apple's discontinuation of the original iPhone 5. iPhone 6 Plus (left), iPhone 6 (right) The release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plusin September 2014 saw Apple introduce a plus-size option. The 6 and 6 Plus sported 4.7 and 5.5 inch displays respectively. An upgraded camera, increased battery life and the introduction of Apple Pay were just some of the many features of the new device. The iPhone 6 was priced at Â£539, sim-free. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were Apple's flagship phones for just under a year until they were replaced with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. iPhone 7 The iPhone 7 was released in September 2016 - its starting price in the UK was Â£549. For Â£669 you'd get the iPhone 7 Plus. Both models came in either 32GB or 128GB sizes and were available in a range of colours - grey, black and red. This generation of iPhone saw the headphone jack removed, the addition of water-resistant technology and a new and improved 12 mega-pixel camera. iPhone 8 (left), iPhone X (middle), iPhone 8 Plus (right) The iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X were announced in September 2017 at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple's headquarters in California, US. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were released later that September and were available in silver, space grey and a new gold colour. Instead of the aluminium casing featured in the iPhone 7, Apple moved swiftly to an all-glass design for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Prices started at Â£699 for the 64GB iPhone 8 and Â£799 for the 64Gb version of the iPhone 8 Plus. As for the iPhone X - it was released in November 2017, marking the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. It featured the removal of the home button, an OLED display on a 5.8 inch screen and wireless charging. Its new and improved features meant the anniversary phone was priced just under the thousand pound mark - at Â£999. Apple have released three more phones. iPhone XR, iPhone XS and XS Max. It would cost you Â£749 to buy the cheapest of the three and a whopping Â£1,449 to buy the most expensive. But those prices could all change after Apple boss Tim Cook's hint the firm could reduce its iPhone prices in the future - when, where, by how much? We don't know yet. And would a change in price bring a change in look now Sir Jony has moved on? Apple's next iPhone announcements could be the most interesting yet.

Johnson must 'be straight' over no-dealJeremy Hunt questions his rival's Brexit plans as Boris Johnson says further delay will 'erode trust'.UK Politics,"This video can not be played What some Tory voters think of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt Jeremy Hunt has urged Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson to ""be straight with people"" about what a no-deal Brexit would mean. The foreign secretary said Mr Johnson's ""million to one"" claim about the chance of a no-deal ""flies in the face of reality"". Mr Johnson said any suggestion Brexit could be delayed again would ""end up eroding trust in politics"". Both men have said they would try to renegotiate a deal with the EU. But Mr Johnson says the UK must leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", with or without a deal. Mr Hunt says he would leave without a deal in October if there was no prospect of leaving with one - but has not ruled out a further delay and has called 31 October a ""fake deadline"". Compare the candidates Reject no-deal Brexit, say first ministers May refuses unconditional support for next PM Who chooses the next PM? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know They are competing for Conservative Party members' votes in the race to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader - and prime minister. At a hustings in Bournemouth, Mr Johnson was asked if he would rule out suspending Parliament - a controversial move - in order to push through a no-deal Brexit. Describing it as an ""archaic device"", he said: ""I'm not attracted to the idea of a no-deal exit from the EU but, you know, I think it would be absolutely folly to rule it out. I think it's an essential tool of our negotiation. ""I don't envisage the circumstances in which it will be necessary to prorogue Parliament, nor am I attracted to that expedient."" A no-deal exit would see the UK leave the customs union and single market overnight and start trading with the EU on World Trade Organization rules. Mr Johnson has said a mechanism known as GATT 24 could be used to prevent tariffs, if there was a no-deal Brexit. But in a letter to his rival, Mr Hunt quoted Leave-backing cabinet ministersLiam Foxand Geoffrey Cox, who have argued that this would require a deal with the EU. In his letter, he asked: ""Who is correct: You, or the Attorney General and the International Trade Secretary?"" He also questioned Mr Johnson's suggestion that a free trade agreement could be negotiated during an ""implementation period"", if no deal was reached - saying it was a ""fact"" that without a deal, there would be no implementation period and Brussels negotiators put the political cohesion of the EU before economics. ""We must be careful to face the facts as we find them. Will you be straight with people that no deal means no implementation period?"" At the hustings, Mr Johnson criticised Mr Hunt's suggestion that the current Brexit deadline of 31 October could be delayed again - having been pushed back from 29 March after MPs repeatedly rejected the deal Mrs May had agreed with the EU. ""Anybody who proposes any further delay is simply going to end up eroding trust in politics, eroding people's confidence in our democratic institutions further,"" he said. ""And further weakening out great Conservative Party and our mission to lead this country. ""And it simply won't work. Kick the can again and we kick the bucket, my friends, that's the sad reality."" He also stood by his suggestion that the chances of leaving the EU without a deal were a ""million to one"", arguing there had been a ""change in mood in Westminster"" and that there was now a ""growing opportunity to get this thing done with style"". In other answers from the hustings, Mr Hunt suggested he would quit as PM if he failed to deliver Brexit. Asked if he would ""fall on his sword"", he said: ""Of course, no PM is going to last any time at all if they don't deliver Brexit and deliver it very quickly."" He also ruled out involving Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage in negotiations with the EU: ""Nigel Farage doesn't want a deal, he wants a WTO Brexit straight away. ""And while I would be prepared to do that if there was no other alternative and I'm absolutely clear about that, I think it would be much better for our businesses and much better for our Union if we could get a deal and I haven't given up on that."" Mr Johnson dismissed his rival's pledge to cancel student debts for some entrepreneurs, saying: ""I think people, a lot of people, would automatically be defining themselves as entrepreneurs."" ""I think the more sensible things to look at are the interest rate, and a reduction of the interest rate, also looking at the cost of maintenance because I think those are very, very high and that people are paying a lot of money back over a long time."" The candidates are set to face each other at an ITV debate on 9 July and at an event hosted by the Sun newspaper and talkRADIO on 15 July.

Extreme heat triggers huge Spain wildfire,"This video can not be played The fire is expected to spread rapidly in the intense heat Hundreds of firefighters are battling wildfires in Spain's Catalonia region, as temperatures soared to 40C (104F) and above across parts of Europe. Officials say the fires are the worst in the region for 20 years and may spread rapidly. Much of Europe is experiencing extreme heat. Germany, France, Poland and the Czech Republic have all recorded their highest ever June temperatures. Meteorologists say hot air drawn in from northern Africa is responsible. Why Europe's heatwave is so unusual In pictures: Europe's June 2019 heatwave A guide to coping with hot weather The heat is expected to rise further in many countries over the next three days, meteorologists warn. France could break its all-time record on Friday. 44.1C was recorded in the Gard region in August 2003 but temperatures could now go as high as 45C. Gard is one of four southern regions to be placed on red alert, the highest crisis level. The others are HÃ©rault, Vaucluse and Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne. Another 76 of the remaining 92 are on orange alert. By mid-afternoon temperatures had reached 39C in Turin in Italy and 41C in the Spanish city of Zaragoza. Grospierres in southern France recorded a high of 42.3C on Thursday afternoon - a national June record. The ski resort of Val D'Isere - which sits at 1,850m altitude - experienced its highest temperature ever recorded with 29.2C. At least 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) are affected by the wildfires, near the town of La Torre de l'Espanyol, 80km from the coastal city of Tarragona. Officials said that in the intense heat the area of the fire could increase to 20,000ha. At least 45 people have been evacuated and five roads have been closed. There have been no reports of casualties. This video can not be played Simon King explains the causes behind the heatwave Regional interior minister Miquel Buch told Catalan radio the fire might have been caused by ""an accumulation of manure in a farm that generated enough heat to explode and generate sparks"". In total, 11 provinces in the east and centre of Spain have experienced or are set to experience temperatures above 40C. In parts of the north-east, they may reach 45C. Temperatures are expected to top 40C in Italy too, particularly in central and northern regions. Several cities, including Rome, have issued the highest heat warnings. Milan also expects the mercury to top 40C on Thursday On Thursday morning the body of a 72-year-old homeless Romanian man was found near Milan's central train station. Officials say the heat may have been a factor in his death. Philip Trackfield, a British tourist in Rome, told the BBC: ""Last night at the Spanish steps it was 41C. It's exhausting when you're trying to do all the sights."" Meanwhile the whole of France - where a heatwave in 2003 was blamed for 15,000 deaths - is now on orange alert, the second-highest warning level. This video can not be played BBC colleagues in hot countries give their tips for staying cool In Paris, fountains and sprinklers connected to hydrants have been set up. Some schools have delayed important exams and even closed. In Toulouse, where temperatures are expected to reach 41C on Thursday, charities have been handing out water to homeless people. Temperatures have been climbing in recent days. On Wednesday, Coschen in Brandenburg peaked at 38.6C - a new German record for June. Radzyn in Poland and Doksany in the Czech Republic also recorded new national highs, with temperatures hitting 38.2C and 38.9C respectively. Even in the high-altitude Alps, temperatures topped 30C in places. Parts of Austria recorded their local all-time highest temperatures on Wednesday. This video can not be played A coati eating iced fruit in a Rome zoo While the UK will avoid the worst of the heat, parts of the country - including London - are expected to see temperatures top 30C on Saturday. Linking a single event to global warming is complicated. While extreme weather events like heatwaves occur naturally, experts say these will happen more often because of climate change. Records going back to the late 19th Century show that the average temperature of the Earth's surface has increased by about one degree since industrialisation. Last four years are 'world's hottest' World headed for warmest period on record A climatology institute in Potsdam, Germany, says Europe's five hottest summers since 1500 have all been in the 21st Century.

Breaking|Breaking newsiPhone designer Ive to leave AppleSir Jonathan Ive to leave Apple after two decades as its chief designerBusiness,"Sir Jony Ive, the Briton who over two decades helped turn Apple into the world's most valuable company, is leaving to set up his own venture. Sir Jonathan, designer of the iMac, iPod and iPhone, leaves later this year to start a creative firm, LoveFrom, with Apple as its first client. ""This just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change,"" he said. Apple boss Tim Cook said his ""role in Apple's revival cannot be overstated"". But the departure comes at a time of wider change at the tech giant. Retail chief Angela Ahrendts left in April and investors have been worried about falling iPhone sales. Sir Jonathan said in a statement: ""After nearly 30 years and countless projects, I am most proud of the lasting work we have done to create a design team, process and culture at Apple that is without peer."" Little is known about LoveFrom, but it will be based in California and there are reports one area of focus will be wearable technology.News of his departure broke in an exclusive interview in the Financial Times,external. In the article, Sir Jonathan saidÂ Marc Newson, a friend and collaborator at Apple, would also join the new firm. There would also be ""a collection of creatives"" spanning several different disciplines beyond design, he said. The iPhone is the most profitable product in history He became head of Apple's design studio in 1996, when the company was in poor financial health and cutting jobs. The turnaround began with Sir Jonathan's iMac in 1998, and the iPod in 2001. Apple's founder, the late Steve Jobs, once said of Sir Jonathan: ""If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it's Jony."" One of Sir Jonathan's most recent projects was finishing Apple's new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, an ultra-modern complex designed in partnership with British architects Foster + Partners. This video can not be played Why Apple is worth $1 trillion... and who could challenge it Ben Bajarin, analyst with Creative Strategies, said: ""It's the most significant departure of somebody who was a core part of the growth story"" under Mr Jobs. Sir Jonathan, knighted by the Queen in 2012, will not have an immediate successor. Since 2012, he has overseen design for both hardware and software at Apple, roles that had previously been separate. The departure of the ""thoughtful"" Sir Jonathan for his own company will be a loss for Apple, which is already facing challenges. From the ""ground-breaking"" iMac to Apple's ambitious new Apple Park campus, he has helped to shape one of the world's most successful companies. ""Jony is a singular figure in the design world and his role in Apple's revival cannot be overstated,"" said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive. Who is Apple's top designer? Apple said on Thursday the roles would again be split, with design team leaders Evans Hankey taking over as vice-president of industrial design and Alan Dye becoming vice-president of human interface design. Ms Hankey is the first woman to lead Apple's industrial design team. Steve Jobs and Jony Ive, the Lennon and McCartney of Apple - it's impossible to see the company becoming what it is today without the most creative partnership in recent business history. Ive was a relatively junior figure when Jobs returned from exile to revive Apple. He picked out the British designer as a kindred spirit who shared his obsession with the idea that the look and feel of a product was as important as the technology inside it. Their first hit was the iMac, breaking away from the beige boxes that dominated the PC market to show that computers could be beautiful design objects. The iPod, the iPhone and the iPad followed, each setting new standards in product design which rivals rushed to imitate. Like Mr Ive's other designs, rivals rushed to imitate the iPod After the death of Steve Jobs, there was speculation that Jony Ive might one day move into the chief executive's office. That always seemed unlikely. Instead he remained the firm's design guru, the often parodied voice of those iconic Apple product videos, while Tim Cook drove the mighty profit machine ever onwards. In recent years, it has been harder to detect the Ive magic - while the Airpods look set to become another classic, the $999 stand for a Mac Pro monitor stand seemed to symbolise a company taking its fans for granted. But the man who started his career by designing toilets and toothbrushes and ended up giving us the most profitable product in history, the iPhone, is assured of his place in history. Who is Apple's top designer Jony Ive? Five Jony Ive designs you probably don't know Tech Tent: Apple takes a stand on design Apple iPhone sales drop at record pace Apple's new AirPods have Siri built-in How iPhones have changed over the years 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

May refuses unconditional support for next PM,"Theresa May has refused to promise unconditional support for her successor's Brexit plan. Asked if she would back whichever Brexit outcome the next prime minister achieves, including a no-deal Brexit, she said that amounted to agreeing to ""whatever happens in future"". Jeremy Hunt or Boris Johnson will be announced as the winner of the Tory Party leadership race on 23 July. Both men have said they would try to renegotiate a deal with the EU. Speaking to journalists on her official flight to the G20 summit in Osaka, Mrs May said: ""It is important that we deliver a Brexit that is good for the British people. ""It will be up to my successor to take this forward. To find the majority in Parliament that I was not able to find and to deliver the decision of the British people in 2016."" Pienaar: Will Theresa May be a backseat driver? Compare the candidates Who chooses the next PM? Kuenssberg: The ringmaster or the safe-ish pair of hands? Mr Johnson has said the UK must leave on 31 October ""deal or no deal"", but that the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening are a ""million to one"". However, in an interview with Conservative Home, Mr Johnson said every member of his cabinet would have to be ""reconciled"" with the policy of leaving on 31 October - with or without a deal. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 31 October must not be a 'papier-mache' deadline Speaking to the BBC he said not leaving on 31 October would mean ""a very, very serious further loss of confidence in politics"". ""Let's not turn this into some papier-mache deadline,"" he added. Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said if the UK got to October without the prospect of a deal, ""we will leave without a deal"". But he also called the Brexit date a ""fake deadline"" that could trigger a general election if Parliament rejects a no-deal Brexit. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? What is a vote of no confidence? How could a UK points-based immigration system work? A no-deal exit would see the UK leave the customs union and single market overnight and start trading with the EU on World Trade Organization rules. The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, despite this featuring in the plans of both candidates. By John Pienaar, BBC deputy political editor Theresa May arrived in Osaka something of a leader in limbo - an outgoing prime minister beset by incoming crises at home and abroad. So far she's been conspicuously trying to stay above the fray of the Tory leadership contest. She's told no-one who she voted for in narrowing the field down to two; she's taken no sides. On the RAF Voyager flight into Osaka, she gave journalists a hint that she has more to contribute before this saga ends, assuming, of course, it ever does. The prime minister refused to pledge her support for whatever outcome may take shape under the next leader. Read more from John Pienaar The leadership rivals have beenunveiling pledges including on education and on immigrationas their campaign continues. Mr Johnson has promised to deliver an Australian-style points-based immigration system if he becomes prime minister, while Mr Hunt said he would cancel the tuition fee debts of young entrepreneurs who start businesses and employ people. Both candidates are meeting the public in the Isle of Wight, ahead of hustings for party members in Bournemouth later. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood said ""a dozen or so"" Conservative MPscould support a vote of no confidenceto stop a no-deal Brexit. But Mrs May said she believed it would be wrong for Conservatives to vote against the government on a confidence motion, saying that defeat on such a vote could lead to a general election. The prime minister told reporters: ""I believe there should be a Conservative government in the UK because a Conservative government would be better for the people of the UK."" In an attempt to block a no-deal Brexit, Conservative Dominic Grieve and Labour's Dame Margaret Beckett have tabled an amendment that would stop funding going to certain government departments if the UK leaves without a deal - unless it has been specifically approved by MPs. If a vote in the Commons on Tuesday is successful, it would have the potential to cut off cash to four Whitehall departments - education, housing; communities and local government; international development; and work and pensions. Under parliamentary procedure, MPs have to approve government spending, known as estimates, twice a year. A spokesman for the prime minister said it would be ""grossly irresponsible"" to seek to stop a no-deal Brexit by blocking government spending.

Baby seriously injured in flat window fall,"Emergency services were called to Wellington Street in Luton at about 13:00 A baby has been taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries after falling from an open window of a first-floor flat. Emergency services were called to Wellington Street in Luton at about 13:00 BST. Jason Watkins, who works in the street, said he had been told it was a boy who was hurt. He said the road was closed but had since reopened. Police have asked anyone who was in the area at the time to get in touch. The child's age or sex has not been confirmed by Bedfordshire Police. Albert Constantin, 32, a barber who has a shop nearby, said he saw the boy on the ground and a lot of people crowded around. He heard one woman, who came to help, on the phone to the emergency services and she was told to put the baby on his side. Albert Constantin runs a barber shop close to where the baby fell Albert Popescu, 32, a builder from Luton, said he was in the street when he heard a woman, who he thought was the child's mother, screaming ""help me, help me"". ""We all gathered round while we saw the baby being put on its shoulders by a man. There was silence for a minute or two, before the baby started crying."" George Feron, 44, the manager of Luton Market, said: ""It was really amazing to see everyone come together to help this woman. ""People in the street gathered round her, were holding her. They stood around for around two, three hours. ""I have lived here for 25 years and I've never seen anything like it in this town.""

US top court blocks census citizenship question,"Demonstrators rally against the citizenship question The US Supreme Court has blocked the Trump administration from adding a question on citizenship to the 2020 census for the time being. The White House has argued that the question will bolster protections for minority voters. But opponents say it could deter immigrant households from taking part because of fears that data could be shared with law enforcement agencies. President Trump responded by saying he would try to delay the census. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The justices wrote in a 5-4 ruling that the reason for including the question seemed ""contrived"". Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's liberal justices, saying the administration did not provide adequate justification for the question. The Census Bureau's own experts say it would lead to a major undercount. Though the ruling deals a blow to the Trump administration, the complicated decision does not bar the question for either its language or the underlying premise. Instead, by sending the case back to a lower court, Justice Roberts left open the possibility that the Trump administration could provide the necessary justification to add a question on citizenship to the census. The battle over the 2020 census has played out across the US. Civil rights groups have called it an attack on people of colour. Three federal judges have issued rulings to block the question, one calling it a threat ""to the very foundation"" of US democracy. Trump defends census citizenship question US census citizenship query sparks outcry Why is the US Supreme Court so important? And though the Trump administration has maintained the question is necessary for an accurate national headcount, the majority decision pointed to a ""disconnect between the decision made and the explanation given"". ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?"" If the Trump administration eventually gets its way, federal law will require this question be asked of every living person in the US as part of the 2020 census. The citizenship question has not appeared on a US census for all Americans since 1950, though it has been asked to some subsets of the population between 1970 and 2000. The once-a-decade population count helps the US government draw up districts for state and local elections, and determine how much federal funding each state receives - a matter of hundreds of billions of dollars. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross - the billionaire financier who oversees the Census Bureau - testified to Congress last year that the request for the citizenship question came from the Department of Justice. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross testified that the question is needed for an accurate count According to Mr Ross, the justice department needs more accurate data to enforce the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters. In a 2018 report, Census Bureau researchers found that the inclusion of a citizenship question will likely suppress response rates in households with immigrants and minority groups, leading to a ""lower-quality population count"". But Mr Ross has insisted that detailed citizenship data is of ""greater importance than any adverse effect"" posed by an undercount. When it comes to including a citizenship question to the 2020 census, Donald Trump had the US Constitution on his side - but that wasn't enough. It's been a common critique of the Trump administration - at least from their supporters - that many of the sweeping conservative changes it has tried to achieve have been undermined by ham-handed implementation. Environmental and workplace deregulation and tougher immigration and border policies have been tied up in the courts because officials in charge were either sloppy or unaware of proper procedures. Much to the delight of the president's political opponents, the citizenship question can be added to this list. It is well within the power of a presidential administration to ask about citizenship status, a majority of the justices wrote, but it needs to be clear and up-front about why. The Trump team wasn't. Now it's back to the drawing board for the White House, with little if any time to find a way forward. Those on the left feared including citizenship would deprived immigrant communities of needed government resources and stripped them - and the Democrats who largely represent them - of political power. These fears have been put to rest for now. The battle over the 2020 census hinges on the motives underlying the new question. The White House maintains the decision was made for practical reasons. Mr Trump has defended the citizenship question ""When you have a census and you're not allowed to talk about whether or not somebody's a citizen or not, that doesn't sound so good to me,"" Mr Trump said to reporters in June. But critics claim the question has more insidious origins. Democrats and civil rights groups say the question is politically motivated, meant to suppress responses from particular groups, namely immigrants and racial minorities. ""Is it really about citizenship?"" said Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib. ""No. It's about reducing the number of people of colour being counted in the census. That's exactly what it's about."" This suspicion has been fuelled by reports, released last month, that the question was the brainchild of a top Republican political consultant who argued it would help his party politically. US Representative Rashida Tlaib has called the new question politically motivated Redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller, who died last August, had concluded in a 2015 study that adding the question to the 2020 census would create an electoral advantage for Republicans and ""non-Hispanic Whites"" by altering voting districts. And released emails show that Mr Ross lobbied the justice department for a question on citizenship, contradicting his previous claims that the request originated from them. The Supreme Court's decision appears to confirm Mr Ross's decisive role in pushing the question forward. ""Materials before us indicate that Commerce went to great lengths to elicit the request from DOJ (or any other willing agency"", Justice Roberts wrote for the majority. Congressional Democrats have recently ramped up efforts to access more documents that could shed light on the decision. Last week, after the White House refused to hand over materials regarding the decision to ask the citizenship question, the House Oversight Committee voted to hold both Mr Ross and US Attorney General William Barr in contempt. The Census Bureau's research indicates the citizenship question will dramatically reduce the number of people willing to participate, particularly among those who fear it could lead to deportation. Adding the question could mean that up to 4 million people - mostly Latinos and African Americans - go uncounted, according to a study from the Urban Institute, a non-partisan research group based in Washington. The proposed citizenship question has provoked protests across the US The ""last-minute introduction"" of a citizenship question has incited ""a potential chill"" among immigrants groups, the study said. Even in a lower-risk scenario, the 2020 count will be less accurate than previous years. This will almost certainly favour the Republican party, at the expense of Democrats. The US census determines the size of each state's congressional delegation, and shapes how congressional and state legislative boundaries are drawn within them. The census also guides how an estimated $880bn (Â£633bn) in public funding is distributed for schools, roads and other public services. The states with the highest immigration populations, such as California and New Mexico, are at greatest risk of an undercount. Many of these states tend to vote Democrat. Depressed response rates in these states will allow for electorate boundaries to be redrawn, pulling political power - and funding - away from Democratic-leaning, minority households. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the question this month, just in time for the Census Bureau to print out the 1.5bn questionnaires needed to begin the national headcount this summer.

"Civil rights leader Ivan Cooper diesSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mr Cooper ""embodied the contrasting traditions of this land"".","Ivan Cooper was injured in rioting in Londonderry in August 1969 One of Northern Ireland's best-known civil rights leaders, Ivan Cooper, has died aged 75. Mr Cooper was one of the leaders of the civil rights march in Londonderry in 1972 that ended in 13 people being shot dead on Bloody Sunday. Obituary - Ivan Cooper He was a founding member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and played a major role in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was ""born to break the mould"". Mr Cooper was born into a working-class Protestant and unionist family in Killaloo, County Londonderry, in January 1944. He was briefly involved in unionist politics before later becoming involved with the civil rights movement and with constitutional nationalism. Mr Eastwood said Mr Cooper ""embodied the contrasting traditions of this island"". ""A working class Protestant man who saw a common injustice and inequality that had taken root in Protestant and Catholic communities, he dedicated his life to fighting it,"" he said. ""As an early leader in the civil rights movement, few have contributed as much to peace and equality on this island than Ivan. ""Alongside his close friend John Hume, he helped blaze the trail on the path that led to the Good Friday Agreement."" Ivan Cooper served in the short-lived power-sharing executive of 1974 As violence escalated in Northern Ireland, Mr Cooper remained involved in constitutional nationalism, becoming a Stormont MP and eventually community relations minister in the power-sharing executive at Stormont in 1974. That power-sharing arrangement between nationalists and moderate unionists was brought down by the Ulster Workers' Council strike, supported by the muscle of loyalist paramilitaries like the Ulster Defence Association. He left active politics in 1983 and went on to work as an insolvency consultant in Derry. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ivan Cooper began as a member of the Claudy Young Unionist Association but, in 1965, he switched to the Northern Ireland Labour Party. In the late 1960s, he played a major role in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, campaigning for equality. He became president of the Derry Citizens' Action Committee from 1968 to 1969. He was passionately committed to non-violence and he believed that both Catholic and Protestants should work together to fight for their rights. Read morehere. John Hume (left) and Ivan Cooper ""walked hand in hand"" ""His commitment and courage and his desire and determination to tackle these issues never waned,"" Mrs Hume added.

Â ""At a time when many were resorting to violence as a means of achieving political aims, his commitment to purely non-violent, peaceful and democratic methods was an example of how politics should be conducted."" Ivan Cooper received an honorary degree from Ulster University, presented by Chancellor James Nesbitt Actor James Nesbitt, who played Mr Cooper in the film Bloody Sunday, said: ""He will be remembered as a politician of startling courage and conviction who passionately believed in equality for all. ""On a personal note his impact on my career was inestimable. Playing him in Bloody Sunday was a privilege and also a huge responsibility. Professionally it changed my life."" Irish President Michael D Higgins paid tribute, describing Mr Cooper as ""a beacon of hope"" and ""the embodiment of the power of non-violent actions in pursuit of justice"". ""His work as a campaigner in the 1960s was rewarded when he won the largest political mandate of any nationalist member of the parliament of Northern Ireland and his legacy of personal courage, leadership and the dedication to the cause of justice continues to inspire activists and politicians alike,"" he added.

May refuses unconditional support for next PMThe prime minister has declined to guarantee her backing for her successor's Brexit plan.,"Theresa May has refused to promise unconditional support for her successor's Brexit plan. Asked if she would back whichever Brexit outcome the next prime minister achieves, including a no-deal Brexit, she said that amounted to agreeing to ""whatever happens in future"". Jeremy Hunt or Boris Johnson will be announced as the winner of the Tory Party leadership race on 23 July. Both men have said they would try to renegotiate a deal with the EU. Speaking to journalists on her official flight to the G20 summit in Osaka, Mrs May said: ""It is important that we deliver a Brexit that is good for the British people. ""It will be up to my successor to take this forward. To find the majority in Parliament that I was not able to find and to deliver the decision of the British people in 2016."" Pienaar: Will Theresa May be a backseat driver? Compare the candidates Who chooses the next PM? Kuenssberg: The ringmaster or the safe-ish pair of hands? Mr Johnson has said the UK must leave on 31 October ""deal or no deal"", but that the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening are a ""million to one"". However, in an interview with Conservative Home, Mr Johnson said every member of his cabinet would have to be ""reconciled"" with the policy of leaving on 31 October - with or without a deal. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 31 October must not be a 'papier-mache' deadline Speaking to the BBC he said not leaving on 31 October would mean ""a very, very serious further loss of confidence in politics"". ""Let's not turn this into some papier-mache deadline,"" he added. Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said if the UK got to October without the prospect of a deal, ""we will leave without a deal"". But he also called the Brexit date a ""fake deadline"" that could trigger a general election if Parliament rejects a no-deal Brexit. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? What is a vote of no confidence? How could a UK points-based immigration system work? A no-deal exit would see the UK leave the customs union and single market overnight and start trading with the EU on World Trade Organization rules. The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, despite this featuring in the plans of both candidates. By John Pienaar, BBC deputy political editor Theresa May arrived in Osaka something of a leader in limbo - an outgoing prime minister beset by incoming crises at home and abroad. So far she's been conspicuously trying to stay above the fray of the Tory leadership contest. She's told no-one who she voted for in narrowing the field down to two; she's taken no sides. On the RAF Voyager flight into Osaka, she gave journalists a hint that she has more to contribute before this saga ends, assuming, of course, it ever does. The prime minister refused to pledge her support for whatever outcome may take shape under the next leader. Read more from John Pienaar The leadership rivals have beenunveiling pledges including on education and on immigrationas their campaign continues. Mr Johnson has promised to deliver an Australian-style points-based immigration system if he becomes prime minister, while Mr Hunt said he would cancel the tuition fee debts of young entrepreneurs who start businesses and employ people. Both candidates are meeting the public in the Isle of Wight, ahead of hustings for party members in Bournemouth later. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood said ""a dozen or so"" Conservative MPscould support a vote of no confidenceto stop a no-deal Brexit. But Mrs May said she believed it would be wrong for Conservatives to vote against the government on a confidence motion, saying that defeat on such a vote could lead to a general election. The prime minister told reporters: ""I believe there should be a Conservative government in the UK because a Conservative government would be better for the people of the UK."" In an attempt to block a no-deal Brexit, Conservative Dominic Grieve and Labour's Dame Margaret Beckett have tabled an amendment that would stop funding going to certain government departments if the UK leaves without a deal - unless it has been specifically approved by MPs. If a vote in the Commons on Tuesday is successful, it would have the potential to cut off cash to four Whitehall departments - education, housing; communities and local government; international development; and work and pensions. Under parliamentary procedure, MPs have to approve government spending, known as estimates, twice a year. A spokesman for the prime minister said it would be ""grossly irresponsible"" to seek to stop a no-deal Brexit by blocking government spending.

Teachers strike over violence fears,"Some teachers took to the picket line outside of the school gates earlier Teachers have gone on strike over concerns about violence and knife threats from pupils. Some staff at Starbank Secondary School in Birmingham said they received little support from bosses in confronting badly-behaved pupils. A teaching union says a ""knife audit"" needs to take place, along with extra training for teachers and a behaviour policy for pupils. Birmingham City Council said it was in discussions with trade unions. It added that ""suitable provision has been made to ensure that lessons will continue"" during the two-day strike. Parents said they do not feel their children are safe at the school. Latest news from the West Midlands About 30 teachers took to the picket line at the school. Paul Nesbitt, from the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), said there had been three incidents in the last three weeks, including one which saw a pupil bring in a 12-inch knife. A teacher was also threatened with a knife, and the pupil was excluded for a number of days but later returned, he added. Another teacher also suffered a ""split lip"" after being hit by a year seven pupil last year, the union said. The teaching union says teachers' concerns are not being taken seriously by the school Staff have alerted union officials over ""Fight Thursdays"", which they say take place on the school playing fields. They also raised concerns over senior staff failing to respond to teachers who hit so-called ""panic buttons"", which are installed on school computers as a means to raise the alarm over problems in the classroom. ""Even though the school was aware that they have students causing serious issues, there's no risk assessment being carried out on these pupils"" Mr Nesbitt said. ""Sufficient practical steps have not been taken to ensure poor behaviour is addressed and that teachers are supported in maintaining good order in the classroom."" Transgender hate crime rises by 81% 'I've never had the wish to dress normally' 'Safe' Witch's Hat returns to playground Parent Emma Wall, who has a 13-year-old daughter with special needs who attends the school, said: ""My daughter alone has been physically attacked. She has been verbally and mentally attacked. ""All they (the school) are offering is mediation, but that's been going on since February. ""The school has not been safeguarding the children as they should be. I do not feel she is safe at school at all."" Parents Saima Begum and Emma Wall have concerns about their daughters who have special educational needs and attend the school Saima Begum, who also has a daughter with special needs who attends the school, said parents were ""really shocked"" to find out ""how deep this issue is"". ""Some of these little kids in Birmingham are not afraid to use a knife, but to know that it's happening in the school your child attends, that's a shock to the system,"" she added. Another union, the National Education Union, said ""the aggressive behaviour of some pupils towards staff"" had resulted in members being assaulted but that it had called off its planned strike action because it had made ""very significant progress"" working with the school.

Japan urges UK to avoid no-deal BrexitThe country's foreign minister says he is concerned about the UK leaving the EU without a deal.BusinessComments,"Taro Kono said carmakers were worried about the free flow of parts to the UK from the EU Japan's foreign minister has told the BBC that he has been telling the two prospective Conservative leaders to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Taro Kono told the Today programme that he knew Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt ""very well"" and had told them in meetings, ""please no no-deal Brexit"". He said trade talks could not take place until the UK leaves the EU. Japanese firms were ""very concerned"" about the implications of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, he said. Speaking to the BBC ahead of the up-coming G20 meeting in Osaka, he said he had urged both Mr Hunt - the current foreign secretary - and his predecessor, Mr Johnson, to give clarity on Brexit. ""Whenever we had a meeting, that was one of the major issues - please... no no-deal Brexit,"" he said. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt unveil new pledges in leadership race Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt divided over Brexit plans ""There are over 1,000 Japanese companies operating in the United Kingdom so we are very concerned with this no-deal Brexit. That would have [a] very negative impact on their operations. ""So whoever wins, whoever becomes a new leader for the UK, [I hope] they would consider those foreign companies operating in the United Kingdom and take good care of it"". Duringthe current leadership campaign, Mr Johnson has said he will get the UK out of the EU on 31 October, but he thinks the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening are a ""million to one"". Mr Hunt has said he would leave the EU with no deal, but it is not his preferred option. Mr Kono said Japan did not want to disrupt economic relations with the UK. This video can not be played Taro Kono tells Today Japanese firms in the UK would be threatened by a no-deal Brexit ""So we've been asking the UK government, let the Japanese companies know what they can expect, and things should happen smoothly without any disruption"". He gave the example of carmakers, worried about the free flow of parts to the UK from the EU if there was a no-deal Brexit. ""Right now they have very smooth operations. Their stock for each part is only for a few hours. But if there is no-deal Brexit, and if they have to go through actual custom inspection physically, those operations may not be able to continue. ""And many companies are worried about [the] implications because they don't know what's going to happen,"" he said, so they have started to move their operations to other places in Europe. Honda: Is Japan losing faith in the UK? Toyota and BMW warn no-deal Brexit could hit UK investment He also doubted the UK could sign a new trade deal with Japan - or other nations - before leaving the EU. ""I don't think so,"" said Mr Kono when asked if he thought it was possible, adding there would be ""some kind of gap"" before a deal could be agreed. It was possible the UK could join the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, he said. But again, he said negotiations could not take place until the UK had left the EU. There would be ""some kind of gap"" before a deal could be ratified. But he would like to strengthen the relationship between the two countries, he said. The president of the largest Japanese company in the UK, Fujitsu, also told the BBC that the Brexit-related uncertainty was difficult for his company. Takahito Tokita, who has worked for Fujitsu in London, said contingency plans had been made. But when asked if the company - which employs 10,000 people in the UK - could move its offices out of the UK, he said: ""No, definitely no.""

"Ford to cut 12,000 jobs in Europe","Ford's Bridgend site is one of the European plants closing Car giant Ford has said it is planning to cut about 12,000 jobs across its European operations by the end of 2020. The carmaker is trying to cut costs and restructure its European business, which is losing money. It plans to have closed five of its plants by the end of next year, including the Bridgend engine plant in Wales, and it is selling another. Ford, which employs 51,000 people in Europe, hopes to achieve most of the cuts through voluntary redundancy. The whole car sector is currently struggling to cope with weak or falling demand in major markets, and the huge investments required for the shift towards electric vehicles. Five reasons the car industry is struggling Ford said that of the 12,000 jobs affected, 2,000 were salaried roles, which are among thepreviously announced 7,000 salaried jobs that are being cut worldwide. ""Separating employees and closing plants are the hardest decisions we make, and in recognition of the effect on families and communities, we are providing support to ease the impact,"" said Stuart Rowley, president of Ford of Europe. ""We are grateful for the ongoing consultations with our works councils, trade union partners and elected representatives. ""Together, we are moving forward and focused on building a long-term sustainable future for our business in Europe."" Analysis by Theo Leggett, business correspondent The planned closure of Ford's plant in Bridgend is just part of a much wider picture, and one which shows just how difficult life has become for the US giant in Europe. This isn't the first time its European business has undergone major surgery over the past decade. Previous restructuring efforts also saw factories closed and thousands of jobs lost. There was a turnaround of sorts, leading to a healthy profit in 2016. But since then the trend has reversed, and the division has been struggling once again. At the same time, Ford needs to free up cash, so that it can invest in electric and hybrid cars. That will be essential if it is to meet new EU emissions targets which apply from 2021. So the axe is being swung, and swung hard. But for the moment, Ford does seem confident a slimmer business in Europe can prosper. It's worth remembering that another US giant - General Motors - recently gave up on its European businesses altogether. It's tough out there. Ford plans to have shed six manufacturing plants by the end of next year. These include: The proposed closure of the Bridgend Engine Plant in south Wales The closure of the Ford Aquitaine Industries Transmission Plant in France The closure of the Naberezhnye Chelny Assembly, St Petersburg Assembly and Elabuga Engine Plant in Russia The sale of the Kechnec Transmission Plant in Slovakia to Magna. The company is also carrying out shift reductions at its assembly plants in Saarlouis, Germany, and Valencia, Spain. Ford said its European operations would be reorganised, with three ""customer-focused"" business groups for commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and imports. The commercial vehicles business will be based at Dunton in the UK. The company also said that every new Ford car brand would include an electric option. ""Our future is rooted in electrification,"" said Mr Rowley. ""We are electrifying across our portfolio, providing all of our customers with more accessible vehicle options that are fun to drive, have improved fuel economy and are better for our environment.""

The teaching union says teachers' concerns are not being taken seriously by the school Staff have alerted union officials over ""Fight Thursdays"", which they say take place on the school playing fields. They also raised concerns over senior staff failing to respond to teachers who hit so-called ""panic buttons"", which are installed on school computers as a means to raise the alarm over problems in the classroom. ""Even though the school was aware that they have students causing serious issues, there's no risk assessment being carried out on these pupils"" Mr Nesbitt said. ""Sufficient practical steps have not been taken to ensure poor behaviour is addressed and that teachers are supported in maintaining good order in the classroom.""

"Ford to cut 12,000 jobs in EuropeThe car giant aims to make the cuts by the end of 2020 as it seeks to streamline its operations.BusinessComments","Ford's Bridgend site is one of the European plants closing Car giant Ford has said it is planning to cut about 12,000 jobs across its European operations by the end of 2020. The carmaker is trying to cut costs and restructure its European business, which is losing money. It plans to have closed five of its plants by the end of next year, including the Bridgend engine plant in Wales, and it is selling another. Ford, which employs 51,000 people in Europe, hopes to achieve most of the cuts through voluntary redundancy. The whole car sector is currently struggling to cope with weak or falling demand in major markets, and the huge investments required for the shift towards electric vehicles. Five reasons the car industry is struggling Ford said that of the 12,000 jobs affected, 2,000 were salaried roles, which are among thepreviously announced 7,000 salaried jobs that are being cut worldwide. ""Separating employees and closing plants are the hardest decisions we make, and in recognition of the effect on families and communities, we are providing support to ease the impact,"" said Stuart Rowley, president of Ford of Europe. ""We are grateful for the ongoing consultations with our works councils, trade union partners and elected representatives. ""Together, we are moving forward and focused on building a long-term sustainable future for our business in Europe."" Analysis by Theo Leggett, business correspondent The planned closure of Ford's plant in Bridgend is just part of a much wider picture, and one which shows just how difficult life has become for the US giant in Europe. This isn't the first time its European business has undergone major surgery over the past decade. Previous restructuring efforts also saw factories closed and thousands of jobs lost. There was a turnaround of sorts, leading to a healthy profit in 2016. But since then the trend has reversed, and the division has been struggling once again. At the same time, Ford needs to free up cash, so that it can invest in electric and hybrid cars. That will be essential if it is to meet new EU emissions targets which apply from 2021. So the axe is being swung, and swung hard. But for the moment, Ford does seem confident a slimmer business in Europe can prosper. It's worth remembering that another US giant - General Motors - recently gave up on its European businesses altogether. It's tough out there. Ford plans to have shed six manufacturing plants by the end of next year. These include: The proposed closure of the Bridgend Engine Plant in south Wales The closure of the Ford Aquitaine Industries Transmission Plant in France The closure of the Naberezhnye Chelny Assembly, St Petersburg Assembly and Elabuga Engine Plant in Russia The sale of the Kechnec Transmission Plant in Slovakia to Magna. The company is also carrying out shift reductions at its assembly plants in Saarlouis, Germany, and Valencia, Spain. Ford said its European operations would be reorganised, with three ""customer-focused"" business groups for commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and imports. The commercial vehicles business will be based at Dunton in the UK. The company also said that every new Ford car brand would include an electric option. ""Our future is rooted in electrification,"" said Mr Rowley. ""We are electrifying across our portfolio, providing all of our customers with more accessible vehicle options that are fun to drive, have improved fuel economy and are better for our environment.""

Boeing hit by new 737 Max problemRegulators uncover a new issue with the troubled aircraft that could delay its return to service.,"US regulators have uncovered a possible new flaw in Boeing's troubled 737 Max aircraft that is likely to push back test flights. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it had identified the ""potential risk"" during simulator tests, but did not reveal details. Boeing's top-selling aircraft was grounded in March after two crashes. The company is upgrading the aircraft's flight control system, which is the focus of crash investigators. The control system can help prevent a plane from stalling. In a tweet, the FAA said: ""On the most recent issue, the FAA's process is designed to discover and highlight potential risks. The FAA recently found a potential risk that Boeing must mitigate."" A source familiar with the situation told the BBC: """"During simulator testing last week at Boeing, FAA test pilots discovered an issue that affected their ability to quickly and easily follow the required recovery procedures for runaway stabiliser trim (ie, to stop stabilisers on the aircraft's tail moving uncontrollably). ""The issue was traced to how data is being processed by the flight computer."" Last month, the FAA indicated that approval of Boeing's changes to the 737 Max could come in late June. That would have allowed test flights in early July. There were initial hopes among airlines that the 737 Max would be back in the air during the summer, but that timetable was pushed back to late this year even before the latest news. Reuters, which first reported the new issue, said during an FAA pilot simulation in which the software was activated, it had taken longer than expected to recover the aircraft. Other sources said the problem was linked to the aircraft's computing power and whether the processor possessed enough capacity to keep up. Boeing said ""we are working closely with the FAA to safely return the Max to service"" and that it believed a software fix would address the problem. But the FAA will be looking into whether it is a hardware issue. This video can not be played Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg: ""We apologise to the families"" If regulators are unsatisfied with the software fix, the microprocessor unit will have to be replaced and the grounding may stretch on for months longer than previously thought. The loss of Ethiopian flight ET302 in March was the second fatal accident involving a 737 Max in the space of five months. A near identical aircraft, owned by the Indonesian carrier Lion Air, went down in the sea off Jakarta in October 2018. Theo Leggett, business correspondent The news that the FAA has found a ""potential risk"" in software developed for the 737 Max should come as no surprise. Firstly, fixing the plane is clearly not a simple process. Boeing has been working on the issue for the past eight months - and if a quick and easy solution had been available, perhaps the second of the two accidents could have been avoided. Meanwhile, the regulator itself is under intense pressure and its credibility is at stake. Its own actions certifying the aircraft and its relationship with Boeing have come under fierce scrutiny. In deciding whether the aircraft is safe to fly again, it needs to be absolutely rigorous - and needs to be seen to be rigorous as well. There's a great deal at stake here. The longer the 737 Max remains grounded, the more the costs will mount up, for Boeing and for the airlines which were counting on using the new plane. But 346 lives have already been lost, and no-one - not Boeing, not the airlines and not the regulator - can afford another accident. Preliminary reports into both accidents have suggested they were triggered by a flight control system deploying at the wrong time, due to a faulty sensor. The FAA has beencriticised for its lack of oversightand the certification process that cleared the Max to fly. Earlier this month, Capt Chesley Sullenberger, whose landing of a crippled aircraft on New York's Hudson River was turned into a Hollywood film, told a Congressional hearing into the 737 Max that the ""crashes are demonstrable evidence that our current system of design and certification has failed us"". Airlines, regulatory authorities and equipment makers met in Montreal on Wednesday to discuss the Boeing 737 Max situation, a gathering organised by industry trade group the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Following the meeting, IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac said: ""The Boeing 737 Max tragedies weigh heavily on an industry that holds safety as its top priority. ""We trust the Federal Aviation Administration, in its role as the certifying regulator, to ensure the aircraft's safe return to service. And we respect the duty of regulators around the world to make independent decisions on FAA's recommendations. ""At the same time, aviation is a globally integrated system that relies on global standards, including mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators. ""Aviation cannot function efficiently without this co-ordinated effort, and restoring public confidence demands it.""

Ms Sturgeon is asked about a ""Â£1bn black hole"" in the government's budget by Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser, with the first minister concluding: ""What a tremendous way 
to end the session"". And with that, the benches empty and parliament heads off on its summer holidays.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour MSP James Kelly asks why the 2018-19 Scottish budget was underspent by Â£449m. Last week, during theprovisional outturn statement, the finance secretary confirmed Â£32bn had been spent against a fiscal budget of Â£32.5bn with an overall cash variance of Â£449m. Ms Sturgeon says it is ""quite staggering"" how little Mr Kelly appears to understand about government budgeting, saying it is ""common sense"" to keep money aside to respond to emergencies and other unforeseen circumstances. Tory MSP Brian Whittle asks what action the Scottish government is taking to ensure that parents have access to clear and accurate information about childhood vaccination programmes. Vaccines have saved tens of millions of lives in the past century, yet a huge worldwide study revealed there is a growing hesitancy against vaccination. Experts warn public mistrust of vaccines means the world is taking a step backwards in the fight against preventable infectious diseases, and a study by the World Health Organisation, thebiggest global study into people's attitudes on immunisation, shows trust is worryingly low in some regions. SNP MSP Stuart McMillan asks, in light of the Heriot-Watt University reportHard Edges Scotland,external, what the Scottish government is doing to improve the general wellbeing of adults. According to the research almost 200,000 adults in Scotland experience at least one form of extreme disadvantage each year, including homelessness, substance dependency and offending. When additional disadvantages such as mental ill-health and domestic violence are considered, the numbers affected more than double to nearly 450,000 people each year. Allow Twitter content?

SNP MSP Keith Brown says given the couple who reported domestic disturbance in the Boris Johnson flat have had to move out, does the first minister agree the Scottish Tories are guilty of criminal hypocrisy. Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh says he does not think that is a matter for the first minister's responsibilities, and she is not given a chance to respond. Labour MSP Elaine Smith criticises the health secretary for taking the decision to close Monklands Hospital on its current site. She urges the first minister to order a rethink of this decision. Ms Sturgeon says the member is wrong, insisting there is a commitment to a replacement hospital build. An independent review panel has put forward recommendations around the site and the issue is there is not enough room on the current site to expand, she says. NHS Lanarkshire has been told to continue consultation on a range of options she adds. SNP MSP Sandra Whitehighlights payments are starting to arrive in bank accounts today as part ofGlasgow's equal pay deal. Ms Sturgeon says she is ""absolutely delighted"" women are getting the money they have been denied. Tory MSP Maurice Corryhighlights this week is Armed Forces Week. The first minister offers a ""heartfelt thank you"" to all those in the forces. Tory MSP Graham Simpsonsays the government's latest statistics on homelessness came out this week which made for pretty grim reading, with a rise on almost every indicator this year. The number of applications for homelessness status in Scotland has gone up for the second year in a row. Latest Scottish government figures,externalshow 36,465 people asked for help from their local council in 2018-19, up 3% on the previous year. How much longer is the first minister going to tolerate this, asks Mr Simpson. The first minister says any rise is unacceptable and she is very concerned. However these latest figures predate the Ending Homelessness Action Plan  and relate to 2018-19, she adds. Ms Sturgeon cites Â£50m of investment by the Scottish government and calls on Tory MSPs to make a case to the UK government to stop the cuts altogether. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Rennie says it ""breaks my heart to hear family's talk about their loss"". We all have a responsibility to care, he says, pointing to a SAMH report today finding 5,000 children were turned away from mental health services. The first minister says she takes this responsibility very seriously. We will take forward recommendations made by SAMH she confirms and also points to the children and young people taskforce looking at CAMHS. A suicide prevention action plan was published last year The number of suicides in Scotland increased by 15% last year, according to official figures. The NHS Information Services Division (ISD) said there were 784 probable suicides in Scotland in 2018 - up from 680 in 2017. National mental health charity SAMH described the figures as ""devastating"". Mental Health Minister Clare Haughey said the increase was ""concerning"" - but was in contrast to a fall in the suicide rate over the previous decade. Thenew ISD figures,externalhighlight that the rate of suicide is three times higher in the most deprived areas of Scotland. Read more here. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie says suicide rates were at the highest for years last year. Mental health services can't cope, police can't cope and prisons can't cope, he says. What more will the first minister do to stop suicides from rising again, he asks? Ms Sturgeon agrees the statistics on suicide are concerning, but highlights a longer term downward trend. She points to the suicide action plan to tackle the problem. We are working through investment and other initiatives to ensure mental health services are available and to shift the balance towards prevent, the first minister states. Allow Twitter content?

"Transgender hate crime rises by 81%A charity says it shows ""transphobia is everywhere"", while police say more hate crimes are being reported.UK","This video can not be played A charity says ""transphobia is everywhere"", but police say more crimes are being reported. The number of transgender hate crimes recorded by police forces in England, Scotland and Wales has risen by 81%, latest figures suggest. Data obtained by the BBC showed there were 1,944 crimes across 36 forces in the last financial year compared with 1,073 in 2016-17. The Stonewall charity said it showed the ""consequences of a society where transphobia is everywhere"". The Home Office said it was largely due to better reporting and recording. Some 36 out of 44 police forces in England, Scotland and Wales fully responded to a BBC freedom of information request for their most up to date figures. Eight forces did not provide the full data. West Yorkshire Police and South Yorkshire Police saw reporting of transgender hate crimes more than treble over three years. Suffolk Constabulary and Merseyside Police were the only forces which recorded fewer crimes in 2018-19 than in 2016-17. The figures were gathered by a BBC freedom of information request, with 36 out of 44 police forces responding In Wales there were 82 transgender hate crimes in 2018-19, up from 37 in 2016-17. Police Scotland recorded 92 crimes in the year to March 2019, compared with 76 two years earlier. Sue Pascoe, who lives near York, was flagged as a vulnerable person by North Yorkshire Police for the amount of transgender hate abuse and threats she had received. ""It's a sad fact of life that this abuse is going to happen and I'll challenge it whenever it does,"" she said. ""The trend for the last five years is nothing but going up and those divisions are in our society generally. For me it's one of the scariest times I've lived through and I'm 59 now."" Andi Woolford says she was targeted while she was at work Equal rights charity Stonewall estimated that two in five trans people had experienced a hate crime or incident in the past year. Andi Woolford, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, works in social housing and was abused while she was sitting in her car. ""A guy came out of a block of flats, called me a paedophile, threatened to stab me, smashed my car up, held a dog chain up to my face, just really unbelievable."" ""Given what's happening on the other side of the Atlantic and the divisions with Brexit, everything seems to be kind of tribal - oh you're not in my tribe so therefore I must hate you."" West Yorkshire Police is currently running a campaign to help prevent hate crime A hate crime is defined as ""any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice"" based on one of five categories: religion, faith or belief; race, ethnicity or nationality; sexual orientation; disability; or gender identity. Section 146 ofThe Criminal Justice Act 2003,,externalamended in 2012, says that if an offence is motivated by hostility towards persons who are transgender then prosecutors can apply to the court to increase the offender's sentence - called a sentence uplift. Source:Crown Prosecution Service,external Laura Russell, from Stonewall, said: ""These statistics are the real life consequences of a society where transphobia is everywhere - from the front pages of newspapers, to social media, and on our streets. ""We need people to realise how severe the situation is for trans people, and to be active in standing up as a visible ally to trans people, in whatever way they can."" By BBC LGBT Correspondent Ben Hunte As these latest hate crime figures show, transgender people in the UK currently have it harder than most. Hearing people talk about being too scared to leave their homes in fear of being attacked does not sound like modern day Britain, but this is the sad reality for a lot of transgender men and women. While the increased rates may be somewhat due to more people coming forward about their experiences, some may find it shocking that more is not being done to protect these clearly vulnerable individuals. Many have described the current plight of transgender people as being similar to that of the gay rights movement in the 1980s and 1990s. Restricted, ridiculed and ignored. Transgender people have their existence debated on a near daily basis across UK media, and several activists believe this negative attention reinforces the poor treatment they receive on our streets. Whilst the gender debate rages on, many of those at the heart of it will have to continue living in fear. Deputy Chief Constable Julie Cooke, from the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""Traditionally, transphobic hate crimes have been significantly under-reported but we are working closely with trans groups to increase awareness and understanding of our staff; as well as to build confidence and trust in the police by the trans community. ""We believe some of the increase may be down to better reporting, however, there is always more that can be done."" Transgender no longer ranked as 'disorder' Why do young people love to hate? 'How to be body positive as a trans person' A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Abuse or violence directed at someone on the basis of their transgender identity is never acceptable. ""That's why we are committed to tackling hate crime in all its forms, including abuse targeted at transgender people, through the government's hate crime action plan.""

Hunt's tax plans 'could cost up to Â£65bn',"Jeremy Hunt's promises in his race to be the next Conservative Party leader would cost between Â£37-65bn, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Mr Hunt has proposed a corporation tax cut and an increase in the point at which workers pay National Insurance. He would also raise defence spending and cut the interest on student debt. Mr Hunt's campaign said the pledges were ""designed to turbocharge the economy attracting inward investment and driving growth."" However,the IFS concluded the foreign secretary's plans,externalwould leave no scope to relieve the pressure on other spending departments without tax rises or risking higher borrowing. TheIFS has also analysed Mr Hunt's rival Boris Johnson's tax plan,externaland said they would cost ""many billions"" and benefit the wealthy the most. In its analysis of Mr Hunt's proposals the IFS said: Cutting the corporate tax rate to 12.5% could cost Â£13bn a year in the short run Raising the National Insurance threshold would cost at least Â£3bn for every Â£1,000 it is increased, so raising it to the same level as income tax, which is Â£12,500, would cost Â£11bn a year Increasing defence spending from 2% of GDP to 2.5%, would cost Â£12bn more but in the past Mr Hunt has talked about doubling it to 4%, which would cost Â£40bn a year extra Cutting interest rates on student loans would cost Â£1bn more IFS director Paul Johnson said ""like his rival"" Boris Johnson, Mr Hunt had made some ""expensive pledges"". The IFS said Mr Hunt's policies for higher spending and lower taxes would ""amplify the long-run challenges facing the UK public finances. ""The UK already faces considerable spending pressures from an ageing population and rising health care costs. ""Mr Hunt's combination of policy proposals would exacerbate these pressures and widen a gap in the public finances that will ultimately need to be filled through some combination of higher borrowing, tax increases or cuts to other areas of spending."" Johnson tax plan 'would benefit wealthy' Hunt pledges Â£15bn more on defence budget Mr Hunt's campaign responded: ""By growing our economy we can afford to invest in our public services, support the lowest paid and ensure that Britain walks tall in the world again, all while ensuring that debt continues to fall.""

Japan 'very concerned' about no-deal Brexit,"Taro Kono said carmakers were worried about the free flow of parts to the UK from the EU Japan's foreign minister has told the BBC that he has been telling the two prospective Conservative leaders to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Taro Kono told the Today programme that he knew Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt ""very well"" and had told them in meetings, ""please no no-deal Brexit"". He said trade talks could not take place until the UK leaves the EU. Japanese firms were ""very concerned"" about the implications of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, he said. Speaking to the BBC ahead of the up-coming G20 meeting in Osaka, he said he had urged both Mr Hunt - the current foreign secretary - and his predecessor, Mr Johnson, to give clarity on Brexit. ""Whenever we had a meeting, that was one of the major issues - please... no no-deal Brexit,"" he said. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt unveil new pledges in leadership race Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt divided over Brexit plans ""There are over 1,000 Japanese companies operating in the United Kingdom so we are very concerned with this no-deal Brexit. That would have [a] very negative impact on their operations. ""So whoever wins, whoever becomes a new leader for the UK, [I hope] they would consider those foreign companies operating in the United Kingdom and take good care of it"". Duringthe current leadership campaign, Mr Johnson has said he will get the UK out of the EU on 31 October, but he thinks the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening are a ""million to one"". Mr Hunt has said he would leave the EU with no deal, but it is not his preferred option. Mr Kono said Japan did not want to disrupt economic relations with the UK. This video can not be played Taro Kono tells Today Japanese firms in the UK would be threatened by a no-deal Brexit ""So we've been asking the UK government, let the Japanese companies know what they can expect, and things should happen smoothly without any disruption"". He gave the example of carmakers, worried about the free flow of parts to the UK from the EU if there was a no-deal Brexit. ""Right now they have very smooth operations. Their stock for each part is only for a few hours. But if there is no-deal Brexit, and if they have to go through actual custom inspection physically, those operations may not be able to continue. ""And many companies are worried about [the] implications because they don't know what's going to happen,"" he said, so they have started to move their operations to other places in Europe. Honda: Is Japan losing faith in the UK? Toyota and BMW warn no-deal Brexit could hit UK investment He also doubted the UK could sign a new trade deal with Japan - or other nations - before leaving the EU. ""I don't think so,"" said Mr Kono when asked if he thought it was possible, adding there would be ""some kind of gap"" before a deal could be agreed. It was possible the UK could join the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, he said. But again, he said negotiations could not take place until the UK had left the EU. There would be ""some kind of gap"" before a deal could be ratified. But he would like to strengthen the relationship between the two countries, he said. The president of the largest Japanese company in the UK, Fujitsu, also told the BBC that the Brexit-related uncertainty was difficult for his company. Takahito Tokita, who has worked for Fujitsu in London, said contingency plans had been made. But when asked if the company - which employs 10,000 people in the UK - could move its offices out of the UK, he said: ""No, definitely no.""

"Trust 'undermined' by food delivery firmsHundreds of takeaways with poor hygiene ratings were listed on Just Eat and Deliveroo, the BBC finds.","Food inspectors check the kitchen of a restaurant which is listed on Deliveroo Food delivery platforms are undermining public trust by hosting outlets with poor hygiene ratings, the Food Standards Agency has said. The comments come after the BBC discovered hundreds of takeaways with low FSA hygiene scores available on Just Eat and Deliveroo. The BBC research found more than 400 outlets with an FSA rating of one - in need of ""major improvement"". The delivery companies say they are committed to improving standards. Our investigation focused on the cities which offer the biggest markets for the services: Manchester, Birmingham and London. We compared theFood Standards Agency database,externalof restaurants and takeaways awarded a hygiene rating of one with listings that were trading on Just Eat and Deliveroo on 17 May 2019. We found 404 takeaways rated one for hygiene across the three cities, split almost evenly between the two rivals, and with many appearing on both. There were also 21 outlets which had been given the lowest possible hygiene rating of zero - in need of ""urgent improvement"", 18 on Deliveroo and three on Just Eat. Deliveroo and Just Eat customers complain of fraud Just Eat profits up amid merger pressure Amazon invests in Deliveroo food courier Food outlets in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are graded by the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS). The scheme ranks hygiene on a scale of zero to five, with five being the most hygienic. For a premises to be given a rating of one, inspectors might find dirty surfaces, poor food handling and a lack of adequate record-keeping. By allowing low-rated outlets on their platforms, delivery companies are ""undermining trust in food"", says Heather Hancock, chairwoman of the Food Standards Agency. ""They're not helping drive up standards, they're not doing the consumer a service. Convenience is fantastic but convenience at what cost?"" In her view, delivery companies should not accept restaurants with a hygiene rating below three - ""generally satisfactory"". According to research from the FSA, ratings between zero and two are associated with higher levels of food-borne illness outbreaks and contamination. Scottish establishments are graded by a different food safety standard - the Food Hygiene Information Scheme - which uses ""Pass"", ""Improvement Required"" and ""Exempt Premises"" categories. A Just Eat spokesperson said: ""We are at the forefront of raising food hygiene standards across the UK takeaway sector."" After a previous BBC investigation last year, Just Eat, which is the biggest of the delivery companies, said it would no longer allow zero-rated outlets on its appand pledged to remove them by 1 May 2019. Most have now had their Just Eat accounts disabled, although they remain on the platform. However, our research conducted on 17 May found three from which food could still be ordered. Our latest research found 259 takeaways with a one rating: 50 in Manchester, 57 in Birmingham and 152 in London. Just Eat said: ""Restaurants with a food hygiene rating of zero or one are allowed to trade on the High Street, meaning that customers can walk into any of these outlets and order food directly. ""However, we do not allow zero-rated restaurants to trade on the Just Eat platform, and are also investing more than Â£1m in a bespoke improvement programme for restaurants with a food hygiene rating of below three."" A Deliveroo spokesperson said: ""Food safety is an absolute priority for our company and we know our customers would expect nothing less. ""Our hygiene policy requires that restaurants maintain a minimum of two stars in order to list on Deliveroo. We conduct regular checks to remove restaurants who fall below the high standards we expect, and restaurants are contractually obliged to inform us if they drop below our required ratings."" Deliveroo also says restaurants with a rating of zero are immediately removed. Our Deliveroo investigation found 18 zero-rated outlets across the three cities. We also found 251 outlets with a rating of one. Of these, 23 were in Manchester, 20 in Birmingham and 208 in London. Deliveroo said that independent food safety auditors work with its one-rated listings, which are given 21 days to improve their hygiene standards before they are removed. A food inspector examines the underside of a zinc work surface The kitchen was hot, smelly and crowded on my visit, writes Angus Crawford. The environmental health team arrived without notice, and got straight on with the job. The manager of the restaurant had no choice, that's the law. One officer opened a cupboard to find pots and pans encrusted with filth, mouse droppings and what looked like the remains of a cockroach. Moving to the main zinc table where the food is prepared we ducked down underneath - I wish I hadn't. The underside was covered in grease and dirt. Below were plastic containers with herbs and spices - the lids were filthy. When asked about the temperature of food left out on the side, one cook produced an electronic probe, which was rusty and cannot have been used for months. This place had a hygiene rating of one - in need of major improvement. That sticker was not on the door. Instead there was one for Deliveroo. Many of the worst-rated restaurants for hygiene nonetheless had high customer review scores online. The average customer score for a Deliveroo restaurant with a poor (zero or one) hygiene rating was 4.2 out of five. For Just Eat listings with a hygiene rating of one, the average customer score was 4.7 out of six. While it is unclear how representative the ratings were of customer base, ratings were displayed prominently on Deliveroo and Just Eat listings.

"Crime solving rates 'woefully low'Police officers need more resources to drive up clear-up rates, the Met Police Commissioner says.UK","Too many crimes are being left unsolved, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner has said. During a speech about the future of policing in England and Wales, Cressida Dick admitted that national detection rates for some offences were ""woefully low"". ""The courts are emptying, not filling,"" she said, adding ""It's not good and I'm not proud of it."" She said sifting through vast amounts of phone and computer data is partly to blame as it slows down investigations. She is calling for investment in resources, technology and expertise to drive up clear-up rates. During the speech at the annual John Harris lecture for the Police Foundation - an independent think-tank - Ms Dick contrasted the state of policing now with the service 36 years ago, when she joined the Met. She said: ""We are, in my view, infinitely more accountable and trustworthy, less secretive, less, frankly, arrogant, more humble, more responsive and of course very much, but not enough, more diverse."" But the commissioner said criminal investigations in the 1980s were generally ""straightforward"" and could be completed quickly, with suspects often charged within 24 hours, whereas inquiries now were more complex, involving a large amount of digital evidence. Violent offences 'dealt with informally' Unpaid forensic roles 'disaster in waiting' Part-time option for Met Police recruits ""There is so much data that has to be looked at... and you've got to know your data inside out and back to front,"" she said. Ms Dick, who became commissioner in April 2017, linked the growing digital demands on policing with a fall in the number of crimes that are solved. Home Office figures show that in England and Wales last year only 8.2% of crimes recorded by police resulted in a suspect being charged or summonsed to appear in court, the lowest level since 2015 when a new method of counting detections was introduced. For some individual crimes, clear-up rates were even lower: 3.8% for sexual offences; 5.4% criminal damage and arson; 6% theft. ""Overall police detection rates nationally are low, woefully low I would say in some instances, and the courts are emptying, not filling,"" the Commissioner said. ""It's not good, and I'm not proud of it,"" she added. The Home Office statistics suggest there is a range of reasons why fewer prosecutions are being brought. In 45.7% of offences, no suspect was identified. Over one-in-five of cases failed to proceed because the victim did not co-operate, and in almost one in 10, there were other problems with evidence. Ms Dick claimed if police were able to harness data more effectively, a ""very, very large proportion"" of crimes could be solved, pointing to cases of murder and manslaughter to illustrate how it could be achieved. The homicide detection rate has historically been around 90%, although BBC analysis shows it's been on the decline in London since 2016. To raise clear-up levels to those of homicide cases, the Commissioner said it would need a ""magic wand"" of extra resources, better use of technology and greater expertise.

Give children 'less sugar in baby food',"The amount of sugar in baby food should be restricted and parents should give their young children more vegetables to stop them developing a sweet tooth, a report from child health experts says. It warns that even baby food marked ""no added sugar"" often contains sugars from honey or fruit juice. Parents should offer bitter flavours too, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health recommends. This will guard against tooth decay, poor diet and obesity. The recommendation is one of many included ina report,externalon how to improve the health of children in the UK. Reducing child obesity is a key priority in all parts of the UK, with England and Scotland committing to halving rates by 2030. Targeting food high in sugar and fat is an important part of that aim, following the introduction of a tax on sugary drinks in England in 2018. The report says the government should introduce mandatory limits on the amount of free sugar in baby foods. Many can contain high levels of sugar added by the manufacturer or present in syrups and fruit juices, it says, despite labels suggesting otherwise. The report says infants should not be given sugary drinks. Instead, they should have sugar in a natural form, such as whole fresh fruit, milk or unsweetened dairy products. Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said products for weaning babies often contained a high proportion of fruit or sweet-tasting vegetables. ""Pureed or liquid baby foods packaged in pouches also often have a high energy density and a high proportion of sugar,"" she said. ""If sucked from the pouch, the baby also misses out on the opportunity to learn about eating from a spoon or feeding himself. ""Baby foods can be labelled 'no added sugar' if the sugar comes from fruit - but all sugars have the same effects on the teeth and on metabolism."" She said babies had a preference for sweet tastes but parents should not reinforce that. ""Babies are very willing to try different flavours, if they're given the chance,"" Prof Fewtrell said, ""and it's important that they're introduced to a variety of flavours, including more bitter tasting foods such as broccoli and spinach, from a young age."" Prof Fewtrell also said parents should be educated on the impact of sugar. ""Excess sugar is one of the leading causes of tooth decay, which is the most common oral disease in children, affecting nearly a quarter (23%) of five-year-olds."" She added that sugar intake also contributed to children becoming overweight and obese. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition recommends sugar provides no more than 5% of daily total energy intake for those aged two and over, and even less for children under two. But results from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey suggest the average daily intake for the children between one-and-a-half and three years is 11.3% - more than double the recommended amount. A review of food and drinks aimed at young children, by Public Health England, found that processed dried fruit products contained the highest amount of sugar - but were often marketed as healthy snacks. The products, which contain fruit juices, purees and concentrates, making them high in free sugars, should not be sold as suitable snacks for children, PHE said.

Tory rivals split on Brexit plans,"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says he is the right man to negotiate a new deal Tory leadership rivals Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are at loggerheads over how the UK should leave the EU. Both contenders for prime minister claim they can renegotiate a Brexit deal that the EU says is closed. Mr Johnson said the UK must leave on 31 October ""deal or no deal"" but Mr Hunt called this a ""fake deadline"" that could trigger a general election if Parliament rejects a no-deal Brexit. The winner of the contest will take over from Theresa May on 24 July. The two men will face more questions from the public on Wednesday in a digital hustings, streamed on the Conservative Party's Facebook and Twitter accounts. In an interview with Talk Radio, Mr Johnson insisted he would take the UK out of the EU by Halloween ""come what may, do or die""and has challenged his opponent to make the same commitment. Mr Hunt said he was prepared to leave without a deal, but not if there was a ""prospect of a better deal"". During a phone-in on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, the Mr Hunt agreed with a caller who said the EU was ""treating us like dirt"", adding: ""I don't think they've shown respect for us at all."" He has secured the backing of Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson- who supported Sajid Javid and then Michael Gove in previous rounds - because she said he had ""put the Union first"".

No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Johnson's 'deal or no deal' challenge to Hunt A no-deal exit would see the UK leave the customs union and single market overnight and start trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules. Opponents say it would cause huge disruption at the borders and be catastrophic to many firms reliant on trade with the continent - supporters say any negative effects would be manageable. The EU has repeatedly insisted it will not re-open negotiations on the withdrawal agreement drawn up between Brussels and Theresa May - rejected three times by MPs. On Wednesday, a European Commission spokeswoman confirmed that remained the bloc's position even if the only alternative was a no-deal exit. Jeremy Hunt said he is prepared to leave the EU without a deal The foreign secretary was on the campaign trail in Chelmsford, Essex, on Wednesday Earlier, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, who is backing Mr Johnson, said Mr Hunt had shown ""weakness"" and ""naivety"" by entertaining the possibility of another extension. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be the ""EU's choice"" to see the UK leave without an agreement, adding: ""There is nothing stopping us getting a deal by October, if there's the political will."" He predicted ""vanishingly few"" Tory MPs would vote to bring down a government pursuing a no-deal exit in a vote of no confidence - even though Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood has said ""a dozen or so"" Conservatives couldsupport such a move. It comes as International Trade Secretary Liam Fox - who is backing Mr Hunt - again criticised Mr Johnson's claim that the UK could continue tariff-free trade with the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson has argued that a provision under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -known as GATT 24- could be used to avoid tariffs for up to 10 years. But Mr Fox said this would require the agreement of the EU, which Brussels has made clear it would not give. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson conceded that his plan would require the approval of the rest of the EU, but insisted it was still ""an option"". Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt say they are serious about pushing for a no-deal Brexit if they are unable to negotiate a better withdrawal agreement with Brussels. Yet the EU seems unfazed. Why, when we know EU leaders want to avoid a no-deal Brexit? Part of the reason, at least, is time. It's summer. European capitals are sweltering under a heatwave with government ministers counting the days until they hit the beach or find some cool mountain air. The day the Brexit extension runs out - 31 October - seems an eternity away in political terms. Also, just as Messrs Johnson and Hunt do not accept the EU's word when it says the Withdrawal Agreement cannot and will not be re-negotiated, EU leaders do not take them at their word when they threaten no deal by the end of October. Read more from Katya Former leadership candidate Rory Stewart, who is backing Mr Hunt, said the problem with Mr Johnson's plan was that he was just telling people ""what they want to hear"". The international development secretary told the Today programme Mr Johnson was ""pretending he has a magic solution"" which was ""not going to damage them at all"", but the reality was he was going to let people down. What is a vote of no confidence? Can Parliament stop no deal? He also said he would definitely vote against a Tory government to stop a no-deal Brexit, but would stop short of backing a no confidence vote. Mr Johnson continues to face scrutiny about Friday's row with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, which prompted neighbours to call the police. After days of criticism that he was hiding away, Mr Johnson undertook a series of media and public appearances on Tuesday - but declined to answer questions about the argument. Mr Johnson spoke to members of the public in Surrey as part of a series of appearances on Tuesday On Tuesday Mr Hunt told the BBC the next prime minister should be someone who is ""trustworthy""and the ability to negotiate a new Brexit deal was about ""personality"", but stopped short of directly criticising his rival. The day before, Mr Johnson told the BBC anyone questioning his character was ""talking absolute nonsense"".
