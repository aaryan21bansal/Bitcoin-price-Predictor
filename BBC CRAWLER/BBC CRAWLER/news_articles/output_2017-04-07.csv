Queens Park Rangers 1-2 Brighton & Hove Albion,"Glenn Murray's 21st league goal of the season opened the scoring for Brighton in the second half Brighton beat QPR to return to the top of the Championship with their third win in the space of six days. Glenn Murray's 21st goal of the season broke the deadlock in the second half after he and Tomer Hemed saw first-half finishes disallowed for offside. Sebastien Pocognoli doubled the Seagulls' lead soon after with a spectacular free-kick. Matt Smith's header from a corner pulled one back for QPR but Brighton held on to go two points clear. Brighton's win at QPR as it happened Victory for Brighton - their fifth in their past six games - stretched their advantage over third-placed Huddersfield to 12 points with five games remaining. The Terriers, who still have seven games to play, are in action at Nottingham Forest on Saturday, while second-placed Newcastle travel to Sheffield Wednesday. Brighton's first win at Loftus Road in almost 60 years came after a dour first half of few chances. But, approaching the hour mark, Murray broke the Rangers' offside trap to latch on to Hemed's neat through ball and finish past Alex Smithies. Left-back Pocognoli, whose last goal was in 2011, then executed a pinpoint free-kick with his left foot which flew in off the crossbar for an unstoppable second. QPR striker Smith flicked in a header at the near post to make it a nervous last 15 minutes for the visitors. David Stockdale had parried an earlier effort by Smith from close range and the Brighton goalkeeper had to be alert to prevent his team-mate Steve Sidwell accidentally diverting a Ryan Manning cross into his own net. QPR manager Ian Holloway: ""If the league are looking at us wondering if we had a go, then boy oh boy did we have a go. We were absolutely terrific. ""I'm in total admiration. We did everyone else in the league proud by giving everything."" Brighton manager Chris Hughton: ""It's a big win and at this moment every win feels like the biggest one. ""I thought we deserved it, we rode our luck near the end but over the 90 minutes I felt we were the better side. ""It became an old-fashioned game at the end, when you are 2-0 down you are going to go direct. They were difficult to handle but we showed great character and determination.""

There's a stoppage in play as Brighton's Dale Stephens receives treatment following a heavy tackle on him by QPR captain Nedum Onuoha. Perhaps the break in play is just what the Seagulls need. QPR 1-2 Brighton Oh, almost a QPR equaliser. A left-wing cross takes a ricochet off someone. Don't know who. David Stockdale keeps it out with his feet. It's getting exciting. Brighton's Anthony Knockaert makes way for Oliver Norwood. QPR 1-2 Brighton Brighton are looking edgy. They give the ball away cheaply and it finds its way into the box to Idrissa Sylla, who is superbly denied by Uwe Hunemeier's block, and then Conor Washington balloons a shot over. QPR 1-2 Brighton There can't be too many better target men in the Championship, for a situation like this when you're chasing a goal, than Matt Smith.

Clubs increase spending on agents by 37%,"This video can not be played Football agents: Are they worth Â£220m? The amount paid by English clubs to agents has risen by 38% in a year - up from Â£160m to Â£220m. The Premier League paid Â£174m to agents, up from Â£130m, with Manchester City being the biggest spenders (Â£26.3m) ahead of Chelsea (Â£25.1m) and Manchester United (Â£19m). England's second tier, the Championship, spent Â£42.4m on agents, an increase of 62%. The Football Association figures cover from February 2016 to January 2017. They come two years after the last full-year results (2014-15). How much did your club spend on agents? Premier League teams spenta record Â£1.38bnon transfers in the 2016-17 season - a 43% increase on transfer spending from the 2014-15 season. In both League One and League Two the total spending on agents and intermediaries decreased from the 2014-15 figures. League One sides spent Â£3,098,508, down from Â£3,167,964, while League Two teams spent Â£821,450, down from Â£1,007,920. Liverpool led the Premier League in agents' feeswhen the last full-year results were published for the period 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, but the Reds' spending has decreased from Â£14.3m to Â£13.8 for the 2016-17 period. Manchester City now top the Premier League list with Â£26.3m, up from Â£12.4m, followed by Chelsea, who have also more than doubled their spending on agents' fees, up from Â£12m to Â£25.1m. Manchester United (Â£19m) and Arsenal (Â£10.2m) complete the top five, while Tottenham's outlay has risen from Â£6m to Â£7.2m. Yet despite being considered part of the Premier League's 'big six' clubs, Spurs trail behind West Ham (Â£9.5m) and Bournemouth (Â£7.4m) in agents' fees paid for 2016-17. Former England, West Ham and QPR winger Trevor Sinclair I was very fortunate. I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually. On top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself. The influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power. In relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for Â£1m, why would there be another Â£1m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football. Jonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group Agents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one. People get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter. However, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football. We get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly. Stoke City chairman Peter Coates Football clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised. I wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5%, 10% or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get. There are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it. All clubs do their best, obviously we don't want to pay any more than we have to. But it's a tough market. They play the field, which they're entitled to, and it's not easy.

Let's have a look at the close of play scores... Yorkshire 273 v Hampshire 58-5 A crazy final session comes to a close in Leeds as Kyle Abbott sees out the last over for Hampshire. The visitors would have been so pleased to bowl Yorkshire out for 273, especially with skipper Gary Ballance making a fine century. But the batting collapse in the last hour, with Ben Coad taking all five wickets, has left them with a huge task to salvage something from the game already. Yorkshire 273 v Hampshire 58-5 Extraordinary! Hampshire are in tatters, Yorkshire seamer Ben Coad has 5-18! Rilee Rossouwis the latest man to go, pinned lbw for 23. It's Coad's first five-wicket haul in just his fourth first-class game. Essex 39-2 v Lancashire 319 Stumps at Essex. The hosts finish on 39-2 with Varun Chopra and Tom Westley set to resume in the morning.

Mitchell Claydon was the last man to fall for 17, having ridden his luck for the best part of half an hour. His partner, James Harris, was 33 not out at the other end. The last two of Kent's wickets cost the hosts 74 runs, which will please their skipper Sam Northeast, even if little else will. Gloucestershire now have a tricky period to navigate before the close of play. Kent's first innings is over at Canterbury - they've made 298 aided by a 10th-wicket partnership of 36 between James Harris (33 not out) and Mitch Claydon (17).

The visitors would have been so pleased to bowl Yorkshire out for 273, especially with skipper Gary Ballance making a fine century. But the batting collapse in the last hour, with Ben Coad taking all five wickets, has left them with a huge task to salvage something from the game already. Yorkshire 273 v Hampshire 58-5 Extraordinary! Hampshire are in tatters, Yorkshire seamer Ben Coad has 5-18! Rilee Rossouwis the latest man to go, pinned lbw for 23. It's Coad's first five-wicket haul in just his fourth first-class game. Essex 39-2 v Lancashire 319 Stumps at Essex. The hosts finish on 39-2 with Varun Chopra and Tom Westley set to resume in the morning. Dane Vilas' 74 and a last-wicket stand of 51 between Kyle Jarvis and James Anderson helped Lancashire up to a highly-competitive score. We're into the last few overs now. Day one has finished at Canterbury where Gloucestershire ended 9-1 in reply to Kent's 298. It's also the close at Grace Road in Division Two where Nottinghamshire reached 52-1. Earlier Stuart Broad took three wickets as Leicestershire were bowled out for 251. Essex 35-2 v Lancashire 319 Jimmy doesn't look overly impressed with his wicket. Maybe he's still fuming about that second over which went for 13?! Essex 25-2 v Lancashire 319 Jimmy has his wicket! The England man removes Essex nightwatchmanAaron Beard, caught behind. How many times has Anderson done that in his career? You have to say it's been Lancashire's day now. Surrey 327-3 v Warwickshire A day dominated by Surrey opener Mark Stoneman comes to a close. The former Durham man made 165 on debut and shared an opening stand of 154 with Rory Burns (71). It all came after Warwickshire captain Ian Bell chose to bowl. He won't sleep easy, especially with Kumar Sangakkara returning in the morning on 47. Essex 25-1 v Lancashire 319 Essex lose a late wicket at Chelmsford. Nick Browneedges Kyle Jarvis behind and goes for 16. Aaron Beard comes in as nightwatchman. Yorkshire 273 v Hampshire 55-4 Hampshire are in trouble now - it's that man Ben Coad again! Sean Ervinehits him straight to Gary Ballance at mid-off and departs for a duck. Coad has 4-15. Wow. Kent 298 v Gloucestershire 7-1 Bob HuntBBC Radio Gloucestershire It was always going to be a tricky five overs for Gloucestershire to get through, and so it has proved. Overseas signing Cameron Bancroft was comprehensively bowled by evergreen Darren Stevens for one leaving Liam Norwell to come in as nightwatchman. Earlier, all Kent batsmen had reached double figures for only the fifth time in their first-class history. Essex 22-0 v Lancashire 319 James Anderson will be absolutely steaming. England's leading Test wicket-taker goes for three fours in his second over, two from Nick Browne and one from Varun Chopra. Yorkshire 273 v Hampshire 49-3 Yorkshire seamer Ben Coad is on fire! The 23-year-old Ripon lad picks up his third wicket asMichael Carberryedges him to Jack Leaning at third slip. Yorkshire are ending day one on top at Headingley. Essex 8-0 v Lancashire 319 Watch that injured finger Haseeb - your country needs you! As this picture indicates, Essex are now batting with Varun Chopra and Nick Browne at the crease. Kent 298 v Gloucestershire 0-0 Adam WhittyBBC Radio Kent Gloucestershire have finally rattled out the last of the Kent batsmen. Mitchell Claydon was the last man to fall for 17, having ridden his luck for the best part of half an hour. His partner, James Harris, was 33 not out at the other end. The last two of Kent's wickets cost the hosts 74 runs, which will please their skipper Sam Northeast, even if little else will. Gloucestershire now have a tricky period to navigate before the close of play. Kent's first innings is over at Canterbury - they've made 298 aided by a 10th-wicket partnership of 36 between James Harris (33 not out) and Mitch Claydon (17). Gloucestershire will have five overs to bat. Northants' Adam Rossington has just gone for 58 - the 16th wicket of the day at Wantage Road. The hosts are 175-6 in reply to Gloucestershire's 101 all out. Nottinghamshire have lost an early wicket against Leicestershire - Greg Smith falling lbw to Zak Chappell. Essex v Lancashire 319 Lancashire's gutsy last-wicket stand at Chelmsford is ended by old boy Neil Wagner. Varun Chopra snafflesKyle Jarvisfor a fine 28, with James Anderson left not out on 13. Wagner finishes with 3-100 on his Essex debut and the hosts will have about nine overs to face this evening. Yorkshire 273 v Hampshire 18-2 Late wickets are tumbling at both ends of the country. Hampshire captainJames Vincehas not enjoyed the run-scoring start to the season he would have wanted - the right-hander slaps Ben Coad straight to Alex Lees at mid-wicket. Yorkshire's 273 isn't looking so below-par after all. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Why Chelsea would be a no-brainer for Lukaku,"Everton striker Romelu Lukaku could have a big decision to make in the summer. He is a fantastic athlete who scores lots of goals but he is still learning the game and, under the right coach and around better players, he is going to get better - the question is, where? Everton are an ambitious club and a fantastic platform for Lukaku to continue his development but if a Champions League side come in for him and tell him he is going to be first choice, there is not much of an argument for him stay. Lukaku has scored 83 goals in 159 games in all competitions for Everton since 2013 and is the Premier League's top scorer this season with 21 goals in 30 league games That is a big 'if' because he comes with a Â£60m price tag,but there is already plenty of speculation about Lukaku's next move.,external The obvious club to splash out and throw the 23-year-old Belgian straight in the team would be his former side, Chelsea, if they were to sell Diego Costa. Lukaku has already saidhe will not sign a new contract at Evertonand, if he does get an offer from Chelsea at the end of the season, then it would be a no-brainer - he has to do it. He would be Chelsea's main striker, playing in the Champions League and challenging for the title in a team which will give him lots of chances, which is exactly where he wants to be. Lukaku joined Chelsea from Anderlecht for around Â£20m in August 2011 but he made only one Premier League start during three years at Stamford Bridge and was loaned out to West Brom and then Everton before joining the Toffees permanently in 2014 for a club record Â£28m fee What he doesn't want is to be stuck on the bench somewhere. For example, if Zlatan Ibrahimovic signs for another year at Manchester United and they come in for Lukaku, then he would be thinking: why would I go there now when I won't be playing every week? Whichever club you name, if Lukaku joins them for next season and plays 45 games, scores 25 goals and wins a trophy, then he will have made the right choice. If he doesn't, then the argument will be that he should have stayed at Everton for another year, where he will definitely play and his stock could rise even higher. It is a case of seeing who wants him, having that conversation with them about what his role would be and making a decision. As a player it is hard to know what the right choice is sometimes, but it is not a bad situation for him to be in, really. Lukaku is the Premier League's leading scorer with 21 goals but his hold-up play still gets criticised when people question how good he is. I actually think his touch is OK - yes it could be better, but there are not many top-flight strikers who are brilliant at link-up play. Costa can also be a bit sloppy at times, and Tottenham's Harry Kane is probably the best at it. In any case, it is something that Lukaku can work on, along with his awareness. He will have to - the bigger the team you play for, the more packed defences you face and the less space you have to operate in. But he is still young - he turns 24 next month - and those are the parts of your game that you can improve. It is not just something that comes with age either. That development comes with playing with better players, who give you better quality balls from closer range. His main asset as a striker, though, is his ability to score goals - with his right foot, left foot and his head. That is a gift, and he does it so well that I really don't think the other parts of his game are a weakness, or would be a worry for any club buying him. Another claim I hear about Lukaku is thathe does not perform against the big teams,,externaland it is true that most of his goals this season have come against lesser sides. But that is true for most Premier League strikers, and there is a logical reason why. When Everton play the top teams they do not have as much possession or create as many chances, and Lukaku is up against better defenders too. He scored against Tottenham last month, but he is not going to go White Hart Lane and cause Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld as many problems as he does when he faces Sunderland's defence at the Stadium of Light, playing two centre-halves who are low on confidence and with Everton seeing loads of the ball. The time when questions come is when you are a striker playing in a top team and you are not scoring against the other top teams. But it is hard to judge Lukaku like that because he has not played against many big teams while being on an equal footing. That is the opportunity a move to, say, Chelsea would provide him with - the step-up to play for a team that is going to give you more chances in every game, whoever the opposition. There is nothing wrong with having that ambition. In fact, it is completely normal. Lukaku scored a hat-trick against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light in September, and scored against the Black Cats again at Goodison Park in February. He has also hit four goals against Bournemouth this season, all of them in the same game. Lukaku's refusal to sign a new Everton contract has been well publicised, and it means that when he plays people are looking for evidence that he is not happy, or does not care. I don't think that is the case, and I don't agree with the claims he did not try hard enough inTuesday's draw with Manchester United. The on-pitch argument that Lukaku had with Ashley Williams seemed to start with Williams asking him to chase the ball more - my understanding from watching it was that he wanted Lukaku to get across the pitch when a couple of clearances went on the opposite side to where he was standing. What I would say in Lukaku's defence was that he was very isolated and he could not really win, especially because many of the balls up to him were generally pretty poor - there is only so much pressing you can do when you are outnumbered. I certainly didn't see a Lukaku who wasn't trying for his team. Lukaku ran 8.67km and made 50 sprints in Everton's 4-0 win over Hull on 18 March, when he scored twice. He had 36 touches against the Tigers (left-hand graphic) and six shots - four of which were on target. Against United on Tuesday, he had 47 touches (right-hand graphic). None of his five shots at Old Trafford were on target but he ran 8.77km and made 58 sprints. Yes, he lost the ball too easily sometimes, and of course that means you are going to get a volley off the players behind you, because they want a rest. ""Get hold of it, man"" is the kind of thing they would be shouting. But in terms of his work ethic and his running, then it looked to me like he was giving the same physical output as I've seen from him in games where he has played well and scored. This video can not be played Man Utd's late equaliser 'hard to take' - Koeman Lukaku's fall-out with Williams at Old Trafford was a mountain out of a mole-hill as far as I am concerned, because that sort of thing happens all the time. Yes, Lukaku shushing him was a little bit condescending, but I have been shushed before and I have probably shushed people myself. It is not the end of the world. It does not mean there is a serious rift between the pair of them. Quite the opposite, probably. As a player, I had loads of rows with my team-mates during games and you quickly forget about it. When you have calmed down you have a handshake and a hug and everything is fine. This video can not be played Lukaku could be world's best number nine - Martinez I remember one with Steven Gerrard when I was at Liverpool in a game against Leeds. He was my room-mate at the time and we were best buddies, but I had messed up in midfield and lost the ball after dwelling on it, and he had a right good go at me. It was along the lines of ""sort yourself out and get yourself going quickly"" but not in those exact words, and I responded, very defensively, along similar lines without registering that he was actually right. Even though the way I acted was poor, the volley he gave me actually did get me going, and I realised that after the game. I apologised for coming back at him the way I did, and told him he was right but he just said don't worry, it is done with now - and that was that. That is the way it should be, and I would be shocked if Williams and Lukaku had not sorted things out in the dressing room after the match or, at the very latest, in training the next day. It didn't really matter who was right, and who was wrong, but I actually saw Lukaku's reaction as a positive. He cares, and wants to do well for the team. That sort of passion is part of the game and it would be more of a worry for Everton - or any prospective buyers - if he didn't show any. Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

Lets twist again," Monday 3rd April 2017 Friday 31 March saw the Ballet Final ofBBC Young Dancer 2017onBBC Four, and while we might not think of ballet as being a controversial dance form, it's caused its fair share of scandals - not least when Vaslav Nijinsky's choreography combined withIgor Stravinsky's score to cause anear-riotat the premiere of The Rite of Spring in Paris, 1913. The truth is that there's barely been a moment in history when a new dance hasn't appalled parents, dramatically widened the generation gap and shocked newspaper editors. Here are seven crazes that caused a genuine fuss, beginning with... Bear dancing to The Pussycat Dolls: Planet Earth II Trailer - BBC One 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info The Oxford English Dictionary defines twerk as a ""dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance."" As an example of how the word is used, it suggests: ""Just wait till they catch their daughters twerking to this song."" Well, quite! The word itself is thought to come from New Orleans bounce music culture (its use in songs has been traced back to 1993), and became a well-known dance in hop hop videos towards the end of the 2000s. AfterMiley Cyrustwerked withRobin Thickeat the 2013 MTV VMA Awards, it went viral, causing outrage and not just because of the sexual nature of the dance. She was accused, including bythe Guardian, of cultural appropriation. There was a near-frenzy of interest in what twerking was. As the Guardianalso reported, the search term ""what is twerking?"" shot to the top of one of Google's annual Zeitgeist lists in 2013, and researchers managed totrace the word's origins back to 1820. And thenPlanet Earth IIfilmmakers found out that bears have been twerking away - sort of - in the woods, possibly for centuries. Another consequence of twerkgate was that it caused much discussion about other dance scandals of yore, particularly the controversy surrounding the Charleston, a 1920s jazz age dance named after the city in South Carolina where it originated. In a BBC News article titled,What do twerking and the Charleston have in common?, choreographer Jreena Green says, ""Twerking [is] nothing new, it's from the Charleston,"" and likened the freewheeling moves of 'flappers' - female hipsters of the time, essentially - to those of twerkers today. And it wasn't just in the US that the Charleston became a sensation. It made it to our shores in 1925, and as historian Lucy Worsley says, ""It took the dance floor by storm. It allowed women to break free from a man's embrace and dance on their own."" [LISTEN] BBC Radio 3 - The Listening Service: Whatever Happened to the Watlz? It's fascinating that the Charleston could cause outrage byseparatingthe sexes on the dancefloor, because nearly every dance craze that caused contention before the jazz age did so by bringing young folk close enough together to terrify older members of society. In the above episode ofRadio 3'sThe Listening Service, presenter Tom Service explains how the waltz caused a scandal in the early 19th century because of ""the shameless physical closeness of the dancing couples"". And it had been preceded by even more racy renaissance-era dances likethe volta, which Service suggests would ""make any of today's waltzers blush since it required the swain - the bloke - to physically lift his lady into the air and then turn her about. The technique involved lifting her up with one of his hands on her busk... and turning her using the torsion of his thigh between her buttocks"". Do the volta today, in other words, and you'd likely be thrown out of every nightclub in the land. Dances that followed it, like the minuet, were tamer and easier, as indeed the waltz is - with one main difference. As dance historian Darren Royston explains: ""It was two people face-to-face. Earlier court dances, such as the minuet, were really done with dancers side-by-side... It was a 'turning' dance, and this is where the scandal of the waltz is made - not necessarily because you can face your partner, but because no one else can really see what's going on."" [WATCH] BBC Archive - Doing the twist in the 1960s You can't mention a turning dance without remembering the twist, the worldwide dance craze spawned fromChubby Checker's 1960 cover of theHank Ballard and The Midnighterssong The Twist. A year later a spin-off film, Twist Around the Clock, was released starring TV host Clay Cole, who sings the title track in the above clip of cool kids doing the dance. The twist is all in the hips, and that's what made it controversial. It was considered sexually provocative, vulgar and, asBBC iWonderreported in 2014, ""Medical concerns were raised. An orthopaedic surgeon reported a rise in knee injuries and the Society of New Jersey Chiropractors said it could cause 'strains in the lumbar and sacroiliac areas'."" Other famous 60s dances like jerk, the pony, the mashed potato and the funky chicken were all inspired by the twist. Like the Charleston, the twist is performed without a partner but in a group, and the same applies to moshing - a combination of punk pogo dancing, heavy metal headbanging and slamdancing. And, as all rock fans know, although moshing seems to be an incitement to chaos, mosh pits are usually organised affairs with sets of rules to ensure people don't get hurt. Moshing endures, but it became a fad in the early-80s punk scene in the US before spreading to other forms of rock and also into raves. And although moshing is regarded by many as harmless fun, on occasion it can be overtly violent and dangerous. To protect their fans, Washington DC punk bandFugazitook a stand against moshing at their gigs in the 1980s and a small number of people have died as a consequence of being crushed or fighting in mosh pits, including at twoSmashing Pumpkins' shows (in 1996 and 2007) and at aKorn performance in 2006. BBC News - Viewpoint: Mosh pits and lessons for life BBC Radio 4 - Rave: The Beat Goes On For those who didn't want to rock in the 1980s and 1990s, there was raving - not necessarily a specific dance style, although all ravers (andBob the Builderfans) will remember Big Fish, Little Fish, Cardboard Box, but a movement that caused a scandal largely because of its close association with illegal drugs and trespassing. The above documentary is about Spiral Tribe, the free-party sound system that was established in 1990 by a group of young people who thought they'd found an entire new way of living, powered by music, dancing, love, and, yes, drugs. No dance fad in the UK managed to get caught up in politics more than rave and, asthe Guardianreported in 2010, one rave in particular - the Castlemorton Common festival in 1992 - ""set in train the moral panic that led to the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act"". Dancing was forced back indoors again, discotheque-style; superclubs like Cream in Liverpool and Fabric in London emerged; and the rave sound, acid house, splintered into an incalculable number of new styles. [WATCH] BBC Archive - Lambada We'll finish with the lambada, a Brazilian dance that can be traced back to the 1930s when it caused almost as much outrage as the tango had 50 years earlier. The issue, asBBC iWonderreported, was how close it brought dancers together, ""with hips pressed together as they performed a series of spinning steps"". Allegedly, the Brazilian president of the time, Getulio Varga, was horrified by the dance's ""immorality"" and banned it, but the lambada got its revenge when it became a craze again in 1989 after French-Brazilian pop groupKaomahad a hit with a song named after it.
