Trump rejects Puerto Rico storm death toll,"The US territory has asked Congress for $139bn in recovery funds US President Donald Trump is disputing official findings that nearly 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of last year's storms. ""3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter, without offering evidence for the claim. He accused Democrats of inflating the official death toll to ""make me look as bad as possible"". The official figure was released last month after an independent study. On Thursday, Mr Trump tweeted that Democrats were attacking him ""when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico"". This video can not be played Months after Maria, many on this US island still suffered in the dark The Republican president suggested the hurricane death toll was artificially boosted by adding those who had passed away from natural causes such as old age. ""Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!"" he tweeted. Mr Trump's tweets came as Hurricane Florence - a category two storm projected to bring catastrophic flooding - bore down on the US East Coast. US hurricane could 'kill a lot of people' Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A George Washington University study,externalin July found that 2,975 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, which struck the island territory in September 2017. The governor of Puerto Rico, who commissioned that research, said he accepted the estimate as official. The study concluded the initial death toll of 64 only included those killed directly by hurricanes Maria and Irma - either by drowning, flying debris or building collapse. George Washington University also counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water. Puerto Rico hurricane death toll jumps Anger at Trump Puerto Rico 'success' claim Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis. Last May, Harvard University public health researcherspublished a study,externalthat estimated the death toll was even higher. They said about 4,600 people died in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the hurricane from delayed medical care. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Donald Trump simply can't abide criticism of his performance as president. How else to explain his decision, as a hurricane looms off the US coast, to call adjusted Puerto Rican death-toll figures from Hurricane Maria a Democratic-inspired plot against him? The politics of the Thursday-morning tweets are rough. The president has guaranteed coverage of the government response to Florence will be intermixed with talk of his feud with Puerto Rico officials and questions about the veracity of his assertions. Mr Trump's dismissive attitude toward the loss of life also risks the ire of the tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who have relocated to Florida and can cast ballots in that state's key races in November's mid-term elections. The president, with some justification, has said the situation in Puerto Rico after Maria was exacerbated by the island's remote location and pre-existing infrastructure issues, such as an antiquated power grid. That could have been a reason to do more to help these American citizens. Instead, the recovery effort has devolved into a political tug-of-war that now includes debate over ""legitimate"" deaths from this tragedy. In response, the Mayor of Puerto Rico's capital San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, tweeted: ""Mr Trump you can try and bully us with your tweets BUT WE KNOW OUR LIVES MATTER."" ""You will never take away our self respect. Shame on you!"" Earlier this week, Mr Trump hailed the US response in Puerto Rico as ""an incredible, unsung success"". Ms Cruz then shot back: ""If he thinks the death of 3,000 people is a success God help us all."" Last month she described Mr Trump's handling of Maria as a ""stain on his presidency"". Mountainous communities and fishing villages in Puerto Rico are still suffering one year later Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosello said in a statement this week that Maria was ""the worst natural disaster in our modern history"". Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US, is home to some 3.3 million people. Even a few of Mr Trump's fellow Republicans have spoken out against him. Florida Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring from Congress, called the president's tweets ""mind-boggling"". She said it is a ""warped-mind that would turn this statistic into 'fake news'"", and it ""may be a new low"" for the president. Florida Governor Rick Scott, who is currently running for the US Senate, tweeted: ""I've been to Puerto Rico 7 times & saw devastation firsthand. The loss of any life is tragic."" Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who is also retiring, said: ""There is no reason to dispute these numbers. ""This is a devastating storm that hit an isolated island. And that's really no one's fault. It's just what happened."" Democratic lawmakers were scathing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US federal government's response to Hurricane Maria has come under fresh scrutiny this week. Some 20,000 pallets of bottled water were left on the runway in Ceiba, Puerto Rico Photos have emerged showing 20,000 pallets of bottled water meant for victims still sitting on a runway in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, a year after the storm. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said it was investigating whether or not it placed the water bottles on the runway and if so it would ""fess up"". Ottmar Chavez, head of the General Services Administration (GSA) in Puerto Rico, said he only became aware of the water bottles on Tuesday. Mr Chavez said his agency had received complaints about the taste and smell of the water, and that Fema should accept responsibility. Puerto Rican officials have previously blamed mismanagement on Fema, whereas President Trump has said authorities on the island are incompetent.

Series of home explosions in Massachusetts,"This video can not be played Suspected gas explosions set homes ablaze At least one person has been killed and many others injured after a series of reported gas explosions rocked towns north of Boston in Massachusetts. Local police reported ""fires and explosions"" at dozens of homes and other properties on Thursday evening. Hundreds of people were evacuated, with gas and electricity services cut to try and prevent further incidents. A local fire chief described it as an ""overwhelming event"" that resembled ""Armageddon"". ""I have been in the fire service for almost 39 years and I have never seen anything like this in my entire career,"" Andover Fire Rescue Chief Michael Mansfield said. Leonel Rondon, 18, was killed inside a car in the town of Lawrence when a chimney fell on his vehicle from a house explosion, a spokeswoman with the Essex County District Attorney's office said. Family members told local media that he had been in the car with two friends,external, who were now in hospital. The towns are located approximately 27 miles (43km) north of Boston Officials say at least 25 people have been treated for injuries, but it is not clear how severe a condition they are in. Mr Mansfield said investigators suspected the fires were caused by ""over-pressurisation of a gas main"" belonging to Columbia Gas lines. Officials said that between 60 and 80 fires and a number of explosions broke out in homes and businesses in the towns of Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, which are located around 30 miles (45km) north of Boston. Witness accounts suggest the incidents began at about 16:30 local time (20:30 GMT). Fire crews then spent hours going from property to property tackling blazes, as gas technicians rushed to shut off gas supplies and assist in safety checks. Residents were also urged to cut off their gas supplies if they could do so safely, and advised to evacuate. Neighbouring police chief Joseph Solomon, who came in to assist from the town of Methuen, said there were so many fires burning at one point that you could not see the sky. Allow Twitter content?

Shelters were later set up in schools, churches and other properties while roads leading into the areas affected were closed. Firefighters battled dozens of fires in homes across the area In the early hours of Friday the Governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, described the incident as a ""public safety event"", but said officials were now ""confident"" there would be no further fires. He later said that it had been an ""incredibly difficult day"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The gas firm's parent company, Indiana-based NiSource, earlier said its thoughts were with those affected. ""The first priority for our crews at the scene is to ensure the safety of our customers and the community by supporting first responders and completing safety checks on our system and in the surrounding area,"" it said in a statement. Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera has asked some South Lawrence residents to stay away from their homes until further notice - even if they do not have Columbia Gas. ""There could still be a gas leak in your home,"" he said. ""You can't see it and in some cases you won't be able to smell it, and God forbid you go to sleep and don't wake up."" He described the community as ""very resilient"" but warned people to make alternative arrangements until they are told it is safe to return. Residents in North Andover who were evacuated were told to ""expect that the restoration process will take several days - or longer,"" by the town manager, Andrew Maylor. He said that a number of North Andover streets had been ""cleared to return"", but advised residents not to switch on their gas supplies. ""Call Columbia Gas to do that,"" he said in a tweet. Almost 18,000 customers had been left without power because of the emergency switch-offs, according to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. The incident is being investigated by the FBI, the State Fire Marshal's Office and the National Transportation Safety Board, local media report.

Free phone roaming 'not guaranteed',"This video can not be played Dominic Raab says the cabinet has agreed a plan to ''manage, mitigate or avoid the risks of a no-deal scenario"" Britons visiting the EU could be hit with mobile phone roaming charges in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government would try to force firms to limit charges but he could not give a ""cast iron guarantee"" on the issue. The EU rule capping what mobile phone operators could charge each other will stop applying to the UK after Brexit. Meanwhile, the Bank of England governor told the cabinet house prices could drop 35% in three years without a deal. Mark Carney presented cabinet ministers with a range of scenarios under which prices would fall if the UK and EU do not reach a deal. A cabinet source confirmed that he said the Bank of England was prepared for a worst-case scenario where house prices could go down by as much as 35% over three years. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was trying to give the ""reassurance that consumers need"" on the issue of mobile phone roaming charges but admitted that European operators could pass on charges. Brexit papers: What no-deal could mean Rory Cellan-Jones: EU network charges could revive roaming fees John Lewis boss rejects Raab Brexit jibe He said: ""No, I can't give a cast-iron guarantee. What I can say is that the government would legislate to limit the ability of roaming charges to be imposed on customers."" The government haspublished its latest contingency plans,externalin the event of a no-deal Brexit. On mobile phone charges, the document says that ""in the unlikely event"" of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, consumers should ""check the roaming policies of your mobile operator before you go abroad"". The main points include: UK driversmay have to get an international permitif they want to drive in European countries Anyone travelling to the EU should make sure they have at least six months left on their passport, although that will not apply to travel in Ireland People applying for a new passport after Brexit will continue to get burgundy passports for a while - although they will not say ""European Union"" on the front cover Blue passports will start being issued from late 2019 Many products tested in the UK after Brexit will no longer be able to be sold on the EU market without being re-tested by an EU recognised body to meet minimum safety standards This does not cover automotive, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemicals or medical devices Mr Raab told Laura Kuenssberg Cabinet ministers earlier spent three hours examining ""all the plans across government to make sure we can manage, mitigate or avoid the risk of a no-deal scenario"". He also said there must be a ""shift across the board in the EU's approach"" on the issue of Northern Ireland: ""They will have to meet us halfway... if they meet the ambition, the pragmatism we've shown through our White Paper proposals then I'm confident we can get a good deal for this country, but also for the EU."" Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The only reason the government is talking about no-deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the prime minister from negotiating a good deal. ""With the clock ticking, ministers should drop the irresponsible rhetoric and start putting jobs and the economy first."" Extra charges for people using their phones in another EU country were scrapped in June 2017. But the EU regulation banning them will not automatically be part of UK law after Brexit on 29 March next year. In theory this means UK mobile operators, if they want to, could reintroduce the charges that could make it expensive to use a mobile phone in another EU country. However,the government said it would legislate to make operators set a cap of Â£45 a month on data usage while abroad,external- in line with the current EU limit of â¬50. Mr Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme two mobile operators, Vodafone and Three, had publicly agreed not to bring back roaming charges for British citizens. The government was aiming to get a Brexit deal with Brussels by mid-November at the latest but was stepping up contingency planning in case that did not happen, he added. He said one of the consequences of a ""no deal"" Brexit ""is that obviously we wouldn't pay out the money that has been agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement"". The UK would ""recognise our strict legal obligations"" but that the amount paid would be ""significantly, substantially lower"" than the Â£39bn agreed with the EU. Analysis by BBC Political Correspondent Laura Kuenssberg Ministers believe the chances of there being no agreement are now relatively small. They are hopeful that next week EU leaders will give helpful hints at a special meeting in Salzburg. Yet there is a long way to go until Dominic Raab, or anyone in government, can be sure. And don't doubt that many Tory MPs are adamant they simply won't vote for the kind of proposal Theresa May has put on the table. Read Laura's full blog A senior EU diplomatic source told BBC News Mr Raab's divorce bill comments were ""a statement of the obvious"" as the financial settlement was part of the withdrawal agreement. ""The [EU27] will keep our heads cool as we always do,"" he added. Business leaders have repeatedly warned about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal, with theCBI saying the UK would face tariffs on 90%of its EU exports and a number of new regulatory hurdles. UK consumers could find going on holiday and making card payments for EU products more expensive because Britain would no longer be part of the EU's payments process. CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said the government's latest planning papers ""make clear firms would be hit with a sledgehammer in the event of no-deal"". ""They also illustrate the extent of the disruption consumers can expect if ideology wins over evidence."" There are also concerns about delays at the UK border. The Road Haulage Association has warned it will take ""an average of about 45 minutes to process one truck on both sides of the channel"" if customs checks are put in place. ""If that happens then the queues of HGVs in Kent will make the jams seen in the summer of 2015 appear as little more than waiting for the traffic lights to change,"" it adds. Lorries on the M20 during 2015's 'operation stack' Mr Raab said there was a risk of disruption at the border if the EU did not respond ""with the collaborative spirit"" he said the UK ""would want to show"". The UK government was planning contra-flow systems on the M20 and was talking to EU member states about ""mitigating"" potential disruption. And he took a swipe at businesses,such as John Lewis, saying: ""I think it's probably rather easy at this moment in time for any business that isn't doing rather well to point to Brexit."" Please upgrade your browser Last month the government published 24 no-deal documents covering industries including medicine, finance and farming. There were warnings of extra paperwork at borders and extra credit card charges for Britons visiting the EU. More no-deal publications are expected in the coming weeks. Labour MP Ian Murray, a member of the campaign for another referendum, said: ""Nobody voted to make Britain poorer, to diminish our national influence or to ruin their holidays. ""The government has no mandate for any of this and it's too big an issue to be left to a Brexit elite in Westminster. That is why we must have a people's vote on the final Brexit deal.""

Brexit: Bank chief in house price warning,"The Bank of England's governor has warned the cabinet that a chaotic no-deal Brexit could crash house prices and send another financial shock through the economy. Mark Carney met senior ministers on Thursday to discuss the risks of a disorderly exit from the EU. His worst-case scenario was that house prices could fall as much as 35% over three years, a source told the BBC. The warning echoes some of the Bank's previous comments. The Bank of England routinely carries out ""stress tests"" to check whether the banking system can withstand extreme financial shocks. Its latest one was conducted in November, when it said a 33% fall in house prices could occur in a worst-case scenario. Several reports said that the Bank governor also told the Downing Street meeting that mortgage rates could spiral, the pound could fall and inflation would rise, and countless homeowners could be left in negative equity. Speaking on Friday in Dublin, Mr Carney said the stress test was aimed at making sure the the largest UK banks could continue to meet the needs of the country through ""even through a disorderly Brexit, however unlikely that may be"". ""Our job, after all, is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst,"" he added. Preparing for two 'no deal' scenarios Brexit papers: What no deal could mean Ahmed: Carney and the ""no deal"" Brexit threat Brexit could 're-ignite conflict' in Northern Ireland Bank holds rates amid Brexit uncertainty May says Â£39bn bill linked to Brexit deal Mr Carney, who has just agreed to stay on as governor of the central bank until 2020, has faced strong criticism in the past, with Brexiteers accusing him of being part of the Remain camp. Kamal Ahmed, economics editor It appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit. He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test. It was not a forecast. It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur. The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year. The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy. But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen. Read more from Kamal here In August,Mr Carney told the BBC that the risk of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"". That comment prompted leading Tory eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg to call Mr Carney ""the high priest of Project Fear"", while former minister Iain Duncan Smith said ""there is no such thing as a no-deal"" and the Bank ""struggled to understand how this would work"". Independent property expert Henry Pryor told the BBC that Mr Carney was ""not predicting Armageddon, he was not predicting house prices would fall by a third, they are just making sure that if, for some extraordinary reason anything was to go horribly wrong, the bank is prepared."" But he warned house prices were likely to fall in the first half of the 2019 as people put off buying amid the Brexit uncertainty, while the number of sellers, ""driven by death, debt and divorce"" would remain about the same. Mark Wahlberg reveals gruelling regimen Dead rat in soup costs restaurant $190m Apple unveils iPhone XS and new Watch Following the Downing Street meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said ministers remained confident of a Brexit deal, but had agreed to ""ramp up"" their no-deal planning. ""As a responsible government, we need to plan for every eventuality. The Cabinet agreed that no-deal remains an unlikely but possible scenario in six months' time,"" the spokesman said. The Bank of England declined to comment. The cabinet meeting was part of a series of no-deal planning sessions designed to discuss the ""unlikely"" scenario that the UK leaves the EU without an agreement in place. After each meeting, planning papers are published on various subjects. On Thursday, the papers disclosedthat UK car drivers may have to get an international driving permit if they want to drive in some European countries after a no-deal Brexit. The government said that after March 2019 ""your driving licence may no longer be valid by itself"" in the EU, in its latest no-deal planning papers. The papers also warned that Britons travelling to the EU may need to make sure their passports have six months left to run. And, in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was trying to give the ""reassurance that consumers need"" on the issue of mobile phone roaming charges but admitted that European operators could pass on charges.

Church keeps Amazon shares despite criticism,"The Church of England has said it will keep its shares in Amazon - a day after the Archbishop of Canterbury said the firm was ""leeching off the taxpayer"". The Church Times has revealed Amazon was among the 20 biggest global investments,externalby the Church last year. A statement from the CofE said it considered the most effective way to seek change was to be ""in the room with these companies"" as a shareholder. Amazon has repeatedly said it pays all taxes required in the UK. Archbishop Justin Welby, in a speech to the Trades Union Congress on Wednesday, said: ""When vast companies like Amazon and other online traders, the new industries, can get away with paying almost nothing in tax, there is something wrong with the tax system. ""They don't pay a real living wage, so the taxpayer must support their workers with benefits. ""And having leeched off the taxpayer once they don't pay for our defence, for security, for stability, for justice, health, equality, education."" His comments came a week after he told the BBC there needed to be a fundamental rethink of how the economy works, including higher taxes on technology giants and the wealthy. UK taxes must rise, says Archbishop Welby Should tech companies be paying more tax? The 2017 annual report from the Church Commissioners, which deals with the Church's investments, revealed Amazon Inc was one of its top 20 global equity investments. A statement from the Church said: ""We consider aggressive tax avoidance or abusive tax arrangements to be both a business risk and an ethical issue. ""As with other issues, we take the view that it is most effective to be in the room with these companies seeking change as a shareholder. ""We continue to work with other shareholders to tackle this issue via engagement with companies and their managers."" The Church made a return of 18.6% on global equities in 2017. In 2014,the commissioners sold around Â£75,000 of shares in the payday lender Wongaafter the archbishop pledged to ""put it out of business"". He had admitted to being ""embarrassed"" and ""irritated"" when details of the link emerged in 2013. Last week, Amazon briefly became the second US-listed firm to have a market value of more than $1 trillion (Â£779bn). Archbishop Welby has also attracted criticism regarding comments he made about zero-hour contracts which he called the ""reincarnation of an ancient evil"". In aletter to the Times,external, the Reverend Ray Anglesea, a minister who worked on a zero-hours contract in a cathedral bookshop, said: ""What the Most Rev Justin Welby did not disclose was how many of his cathedrals are zero contract hour employers and how many cathedral employees have no job certainty, no sick or holiday pay, and no maternity cover."" The Church of England said advice to its parishes on zero-hours contracts was issued in 2013, and ""does not reflect the current thinking"" of the Church.

MP brings baby to Commons debate,"An MP has cradled her baby on the House of Commons benches for what is thought to be the first time during a debate. Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson appeared in the chamber with Gabriel to listen to the closing remarks of a discussion about proxy voting. Proxy voting could allow MPs on maternity and paternity leave to nominate a colleague to cast their vote in their absence. Ms Swinson gave birth to Gabriel - her second child - on 29 June. MPs have often been seen in the Commons chamber with their children during votes, but not during active debates. Labour's Harriet Harman, the Mother of the House as the longest-serving female MP, stroked Gabriel's head after sitting next to Ms Swinson. Speaker John Bercow also shared a word with the mother and baby as they left. Ms Swinson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, earlier warned the debate was ""too little, too late"" and went on to reference the debacle around herfailed pairing with Tory chairman Brandon Lewison key Brexit legislation. She said: ""This House first resolved that members with small babies should be able to vote by proxy seven months ago - since then Gabriel, Elijah and Solomon have been born and two more Commons babies are on the way. ""A cynic might conclude that because all five pregnant and new mum MPs are on the opposition benches the government is trying to kick this issue into the long grass. ""And after what happened to me in July I think I might be able to be forgiven for being cynical about the government's motivations."" Opening the debate, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said proxy voting would be a ""significant change"" as it would allow MPs ""for possibly for the first time ever"" to vote while not being present in parliament. She said: ""Proxy voting will be a profound change to the procedures of this House and so we must get it right to ensure robust voting practice for generations to come. ""If we take this significant step now then, in my view, we will have a fairer, more inclusive parliament for future generations."" Mrs Leadsom said issues to be considered include whether proxy voting will only be limited to new parents, the types of Commons business it is allowed to be used for, and who should exercise such a vote on behalf of an MP.

Early Banksy partially painted over,"The early Banksy artwork was partially painted over before a passerby intervened One of Banksy's earliest works has been partially destroyed by a shop owner who had no idea of its provenance. The artwork was painted on the shutters of a skate shop in Bristol's Park Row in the 1990s. New owner Jo Xie is opening a teashop on the site, and started work to clean up the shutters. ""We were halfway done painting, and someone asked if they could take one last photo because it's a Banksy - but I had no idea."" The chipped and faded artwork was recognised by Banksy aficionado Simon Whiteway. ""I walked by and saw a painter going over the mural; I had to explain to him what it was and he was shocked. ""The shop was a skate shop called Rollermania for a long time, and Banksy knew its owner Tony Coffey. ""In the 1990s, Tony gave him Â£20 or Â£30 to spray his shutters."" The work was done long before Banksy's stencil artworks became internationally recognised. Jo Xie and her business partner are inviting local street artists to come up with new ideas for the bottom half of the shutters.

Being a young carer," There were children playing - doing gymnastics on the grass. Charlotte joined in with the somersaults until she cut her knee. She didn't think anything of it. It was June 2016 and Charlotte had been invited to a family barbecue. Charlotte was a cleaner and a single mother to Katie, then nine, and Shaun, who was 11. They lived in Blackpool. Everything seemed fine that weekend and Charlotte went to work on Monday and Tuesday as normal. By Tuesday evening she had some backache but had a bath and went to bed as usual. I thought I was coming down with the flu, severe flu, because I'm never poorly. Wednesday was Charlotte's morning off and she went to meet a friend. She wasn't feeling great, but still wanted to get out. She drove to Preston, but could barely get out of the car and was struggling to walk. “I had severe backache, as if I was going into labour.” Her friend got her home, by which time she was pouring with sweat and shivering. She hoped a couple of hours’ sleep would help. But she wasn't well enough to go to work. Still she managed to get up to collect Katie from school, before falling back into bed. “I thought I was coming down with the flu, severe flu, because I'm never poorly.” Katie came in the next morning to ask her Mum to do her hair for school. But it was clear Charlotte couldn’t drive her there. Charlotte's face had puffed up and had changed colour. Katie knew she needed urgent help. “You need an ambulance,” she said and went to dial 999. That call saved her mother’s life. Within an hour of Katie calling the ambulance Charlotte was in hospital and being put in an induced coma. She remembers her final words to her family. “Goodnight everybody. See you. I love you loads.” Charlotte She was to remain in a coma for the next 23 days, on life support. Charlotte had pneumococcal sepsis. Sepsis is a bacterial infection which can shut down organs and cause blood clots that block vessels, cutting off oxygen and causing parts of the body to die. Charlotte's kidneys had begun to fail and she had to be resuscitated three times. She was finally brought round from her coma on 22 July 2016. Katie was relieved. “The first thing my Mum wrote down or said was, ‘I want to see my kids.’” Charlotte had lasting damage to her feet, hands, nose, tongue and skin. It was devastating news but her response was incredibly positive: “Oh my goodness, I'm alive.” She spent a further eight months in hospital. Damage to her tongue left her unable to speak and swallow and she needed a tracheotomy to help her breathe. It was the start of a series of operations. Charlotte used flashcards to communicate while she went through speech and language therapy and learned to swallow again. She was allowed out of hospital to go to a wedding, and walked for the last time on damaged feet that she knew she would lose. On 20 September 2016, Charlotte had both legs amputated below the knee. A month later, the surgical team had to amputate her left hand and four-and-a-half digits on her right hand. The rehabilitation continued as Charlotte was fitted with prosthetic legs and given physiotherapy to learn to walk. The next upheaval was leaving hospital. Charlotte now needed a house that was adapted for a wheelchair. That meant a new home, a new area, a new school and a new life. Katie’s brother Shaun, affected by the situation at home, has moved to live with his Dad. So now it’s just Katie and Charlotte. “Katie has become my young carer, who saved my life. I wouldn't know what to do without her. If it wasn't for her, I don't think I'd be here today. Completely different life than we expected, isn't it? Katie is now a very slight 11-year-old. She looks tired as she opens the door. The bungalow is close to Katie's new school, and has a ramp up to the door. “Have you got my tray there sweetheart?” asks Charlotte. “Coffee?” replies Katie. “Don't forget my straw.... would you like to pass me my medication and my juice?” says Charlotte. Charlotte has just got a new battery-powered wheelchair. She moves the joystick with the end of her arm. There has been amazing progress since leaving hospital and Charlotte is even having meetings with doctors in Leeds about the possibility of a hand transplant. “I do have prosthetic legs, but for one reason or another I've not been able to get my legs on full time. Although I can walk on them, you know, but it's an ongoing process.” The carers come in four times each day to help with tasks like dressing and washing as well as making snacks and ready meals. The rest of the time, Katie looks after her Mum. Charlotte has limited mobility, so Katie has become her legs. Every time her Mum needs her medication, Katie has to get it, along with a cup of water with a straw in it, putting it away when she's finished. In the morning she makes her Mum a hot drink while getting herself ready for school and fixing her own breakfast as well as finding her Mum's phone and taking it to her. Katie also helps get her Mum into the shower and sometimes washes her. When there’s not much left in the fridge, Katie has to be aware and regularly pops to the shops.  She finds important bills Charlotte needs to look at, she puts the rubbish in the bin and she puts the shopping away. Katie is also Charlotte's hands. As her mother can no longer hold or manipulate things, Katie has to fetch everything her mother needs and even write for her. She collects the post, answers the door to deliveries, opens the post and parcels, fills and boils the kettle, helps Charlotte with her clothes and finds her bag when they go out. “She's had to grow up a lot - very quickly,” says Charlotte, who finds it very frustrating not being able to do all the things she used to. When they decide to head into town on the bus, Katie zips up her Mum’s coat and locks the door as Charlotte wheels down the ramp. On the bus, Katie has to make sure the wheelchair is in the right spot, before pulling down the handle to secure it. “You're doing a grand job,” says one of the passengers to Katie. “She is,” says Charlotte. In town Katie goes to the cash machine for her Mum, before they get the shopping they need, which Katie hangs on the back of the wheelchair and piles up on her Mum's lap. “Her life has drastically changed. She's gone from Mum doing everything for her, and now Mum has to ask her to do everything,” says Charlotte. On the way home, Katie gets a ride as she balances on one of the arms of the wheelchair, her arms round her Mum. Back at home Katie seems an energetic and lively young girl. She talks about school, make-up, what she’s watching on her iPad and how she talks to friends until late in the evening. She loves gymnastics and she cartwheels and handstands her way around the room and off the furniture. She proudly shows off the certificate for being a young carer she was awarded at a council reception. In the kitchen, Charlotte has to rely on Katie to use the cooker, microwave and washing machine - lifting things, doing some washing-up, clearing up and putting things away. Katie has to keep the house running. “She's been learning to iron. She's been learning to cook a few simple meals... normal things an 11-year-old wouldn't be doing.” Charlotte recently had a scare. She started choking and panicked. She went into the bathroom where she was sick. Katie didn’t realise and only found her Mum later. “That's my main worry, because it's life-threatening,” says Katie. Afterwards she lay awake with the episode preying on her mind. “She's a little worrier,” says Charlotte. “If I've had a bad night, [she’s] worrying if I'm going to be OK, if I'm going to be poorly, am I going to be here when she gets home from school.” Katie’s memory of finding her Mum - in a critical condition from sepsis - has had a deep and lasting effect on her. She admits there have been times she has cried herself to sleep and can easily get upset, angry or feel down. “She has suffered with anxiety,” says Charlotte. “She felt scared to speak to me about her feelings, thinking I'd get upset. Now she knows that she can talk to me and scream and shout and cry if she needs to, and everything's going to be OK.” The after-effects of Charlotte’s illness have been mental as well as physical. “I have good days and bad days like anybody else. There are a lot of side-effects of sepsis, afterwards, [like] hair loss. I’ve got a liver investigation going on at the moment. I’ve never suffered with anxiety or depression before… but I’m getting help for that.” The respect that mother and daughter have for each other, and the strong bond between them, are clear. “She's very courageous, she's very loving, very caring, she's hands-on, she just wants to help. I love her to pieces,” says Charlotte. But there have been questions from Katie as she learns to cope with what she’s lost. “We've had our moments when she's asking, ‘Why us? Why did it happen to us?’ I don't know the answer. The main thing is I’m still here,” says Charlotte. She turns to Katie: “I’m still alive and if it wasn’t for you then this could be a different story. “I’ve heard her saying so many times, ‘I just want my old Mum back.’” Charlotte understands how her daughter feels and wants to do more as a mother again and have fun days out. Katie misses so many things about the old Mum - especially her cooking, now they rely more on ready meals. “I hate microwave meals, they’re tasteless. “Seeing my Mum struggle - it upsets me because I remember ages ago when she used to do everything. “I'm mum, I’m your mum right now,” says Katie. Charlotte acknowledges the scale of her need for Katie’s care. “It'd be miserable, dull and lonely - a very, very lonely life [without Katie’s help]. It's unbearable to think about to be honest.” She feels that Katie misses out on some of the normal things that children do. It’s a common emotion among parents of young carers. “I feel I've taken away her childhood, or should I say sepsis has taken her childhood away. It's a cruel world but we're just making the best of a bad situation.” Since Charlotte became ill the family have had help from a host of services, organisations and agencies. Countless assessments, appointments, forms and meetings have had to be navigated. Charlotte says she couldn't have done it without Citizens Advice and Lancashire Wellbeing Service. She describes getting their new house as an early Christmas present, and is thankful to a housing officer at Blackpool Council who made strenuous efforts to find the right home. Charlotte is on what's described as a full-care package - she has been assessed by a social worker who has confirmed she needs high-level help each day. It's part-funded by Lancashire County Council now that they’ve moved outside Blackpool, with Charlotte paying a top-up of about £200 each month. Carers from a private company come for an hour in the morning to help her get up, dressed, washed and have breakfast, half an hour at lunchtime, an hour at teatime to help Katie with the evening meal and washing up, and half an hour at bedtime. Charlotte is happy with the level of care. But Katie says she wants “more carers, more help”. They live on a number of benefits. Personal independence payments have replaced disability living allowance for people who need help with daily activities or getting around because of a long-term illness or disability. They also receive employment support allowance which used to be called incapacity benefit - and they get housing benefit. Then for Katie, Charlotte receives child benefit which is £84 per month as well as £45 per week in child tax credit. Despite having extra costs, such as taxis to medical appointments, Charlotte says they get by. She hopes they might even be able to get away for a holiday next year. Katie also has a range of professionals helping her. Charlotte says the help took some time to be put in place. Katie’s social worker has arranged a needs assessment for Katie - all young carers are supposed to get one of these. The council then brought in the children's charity, Barnardo's, to work with Katie and she was introduced to their support worker, Lauren. The charity worked with nearly 3,500 young carers in the UK last year. Katie has had one-to-one sessions where she could talk about how her Mum's illness has made her feel and to explore ways to cope with those feelings. Barnardo's also arranged some group work that looked at topics like keeping healthy, first aid and being safe on the internet. Here Katie got to meet other young carers and was taken out on trips. What fun does Katie think young carers need? “A place that does make-up or things like that and then, for the boys, Xbox or PlayStation rooms  - and then a play area for the younger ones.” Lauren, from Barnardo's, was also involved when Katie moved from primary to secondary school to make sure support at school continued. The school has assigned Katie a mentor and she also sees a counsellor - the same one she saw at primary school. After 12 months, Barnardo’s reviewed the help they provided to Katie and, according to Lancashire County Council, decided she was coping well and that the support could be “stepped down”. Charlotte wishes Katie still had her support worker and feels it was due to budget constraints at the council. The council says if the family needs more help there could be a reassessment. Katie knows that she can speak to staff at school if she is having problems. “If it's been a really bad week then they will try to do their best to help.” Her school understands Katie’s situation at home, and work to support her whenever needed. There should be more options for activities and places where Katie could go for time apart, Charlotte feels. “I feel there should be more after-school clubs that don't cost the earth.” Access to young carers’ group activities that promote relaxation is key, says Emma James, policy officer at Barnardo's. “They feel less socially isolated, they're talking to other young people in the same situation as them and that sort of provision has been cut massively across the country.” Charlotte feels she has had to deal with too many different workers. “We've had social workers, key workers involved, but… they've got a time limit of how long they can work on a case. There's no continuity.” Katie feels there needs to be more help. “We all know that I need more support than what I get.” We ignore these children at our peril and at the peril of these children’s futures. “Well done, that's brilliant, that's brilliant, that,” says Charlotte. Katie has come home with a certificate from school for work she's done on additional English tasks she's been set. Charlotte is concerned about Katie's progress at school. After the disruption and the house move, Charlotte now thinks Katie is about two years behind where she's expected to be. One-to-one tutoring is being laid on at school to help bring Katie’s grades back up. “Sometimes if I think about my Mum way too much, like every day - I'll go straight off my work, and then get angry with my teacher,” says Katie. This is not an unusual problem for young carers, explains Prof Saul Becker. Caring before school can affect their ability to go to school, their concentration at school, their ability to stay awake in classrooms or to do their homework. The impact of a disrupted education for young carers stretches well beyond school. Emma James, from Barnardo's, says it can have an impact on their adult lives. “We know they're less likely to go into higher education because of their caring roles, they're less likely to be able to get a steady and secure job and they're much more likely to have mental health issues.” Katie already has dreams of what she might do when she grows up. “A YouTuber, a model and a beautician.” Sadly, there is another challenge that many young carers face - socialising and making friends both in school and at home. Many will find it difficult to play and interact with those who aren't young carers, explains Prof Becker. Katie says the hardest thing about being a young carer is the bullying. “Someone actually did say to me, ‘Lol your Mum's gonna die’. “These girls were like saying, ‘Ah, you stupid cow’ and things like that to us. “I've heard someone say, ‘You and your mum are silly bitches.’” Katie has had to cope with these comments by children at both her primary and secondary schools since her Mum became ill. “It's quite horrible what I'm going through and then I'm coming to school. I've not come to be called horrible names or anything. I've come to school to learn.” The school is supporting Katie and says it acts upon any reports of bullying. Katie and Charlotte both describe the lack of understanding of their situation as the main problem. People make judgements about them and how they feel. Katie has found her own way of dealing with some of the remarks she's suffered. She tells herself it's down to ignorance about her situation. “At the end of the day, I turn my back on those people.” Some people have been more understanding after Katie explained the situation to them. She had to describe it a few times, but once she had, their reaction was: “We're so grateful she's alive.” We ignore these children at our peril and at the peril of these children’s futures. “Well done, that's brilliant, that's brilliant, that,” says Charlotte. Katie has come home with a certificate from school for work she's done on additional English tasks she's been set. Charlotte is concerned about Katie's progress at school. After the disruption and the house move, Charlotte now thinks Katie is about two years behind where she's expected to be. One-to-one tutoring is being laid on at school to help bring Katie’s grades back up. “Sometimes if I think about my Mum way too much, like every day - I'll go straight off my work, and then get angry with my teacher,” says Katie. This is not an unusual problem for young carers, explains Prof Saul Becker. Caring before school can affect their ability to go to school, their concentration at school, their ability to stay awake in classrooms or to do their homework. The impact of a disrupted education for young carers stretches well beyond school. Emma James, from Barnardo's, says it can have an impact on their adult lives. “We know they're less likely to go into higher education because of their caring roles, they're less likely to be able to get a steady and secure job and they're much more likely to have mental health issues.” Katie already has dreams of what she might do when she grows up. “A YouTuber, a model and a beautician.” Sadly, there is another challenge that many young carers face - socialising and making friends both in school and at home.

She had to describe it a few times, but once she had, their reaction was: “We're so grateful she's alive.” Katie’s situation is not unusual. The last census in 2011 foundthere were 166,000 young carers in England aged five-17 years. But charities and organisations working with young carers have long thought this was an underestimate. There is a certain stigma, says Prof Becker. Many families where someone has an illness or disability would not like it to be “on record” that the children are carrying out caring roles. They worry that there may be a perception by the authorities that they're not coping. New research carried out by BBC News and Nottingham University presents a very different picture. The questionnaire was completed by 925 children across England from two year groups - 11 to 12-year-olds and 14 to 15-year-olds. If the survey was extrapolated across England it would correspond to more than 800,000 secondary-school age children carrying out some level of care. Of those, the survey suggests more than 250,000 young carers are carrying out a high level of care, with 73,000 taking on the highest amount of care. Katie is one of them. “The fact that there are so many vulnerable children who are slipping through the net is one of the biggest scandals of our generation,” says Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardo's. “These findings tell us, that as a nation, we are relying very heavily on children to provide care to other family members and in some cases to a number of family members,” says Prof Becker. While the survey only covered England, the prevalence of young carers is an issue across the UK. In Wales, the official figures say there are 7,000 but research suggestsa figure four times higher. In Scotland, the Carers Trust says there are29,000 young carers.The trust says there are30,000 young carersin Northern Ireland. Within the past five years two new pieces of legislation have been brought in, giving significant new rights to carers in England - the Children and Families Act 2014 and the Care Act 2014. Young carers have the right to a “carer's assessment”, which is the duty of the local authority. These assessments measure the effect on young carers’ wellbeing - health, education or friendships – and whether they should continue carrying out that level of care. “There are many children in this country whose burden of care is so extreme that it would be really difficult, if not impossible, for many adults to do those kinds of care-giving roles for other people – but we are expecting children as young as five and six to [do them]. They need to be assessed and... receive services that reduce the amount of care-giving,” says Prof Becker. But there are young carers not known to the authorities and others have to wait too long for an assessment, some experts suggest. Many local authorities are under intense financial pressure, says Prof Becker. “Some of the authorities are providing good services… [but] there’s very little in large parts of the country.” Once the assessment has been carried out, the young carer and their family should be told of the support they need, which should then be provided by the local council, the NHS or an organisation commissioned to work with young carers. But services can be patchy. Government guidance says children are not supposed to undertake inappropriate or excessive caring roles that may have an impact on their development. The Care and Support Statutory Guidance 2016 lists duties which would be considered inappropriate: - personal care such as bathing and toileting- strenuous physical activity such as lifting- administering medication- maintaining the family budget- emotional support to the adult The UK government says its Carers Action Plan will help young carers over the next two years and says it will soon explore long-term solutions. “Young carers make an invaluable contribution in looking after their loved ones. That’s why we changed the law to improve how we identify and support them and their families,” a spokeswoman says. Many experts believe that more could be done. “To some extent, as we face more austere times,” says Prof Becker, “the prognosis for young carers and young carers’ services gets bleaker and bleaker.” In the past two years, Katie and Charlotte have been through intensely challenging times. “My Mum is my inspiration and my hero.” Katie wants people to know this is how she views her Mum and that she's not looking to be pitied. Charlotte also has a message for those who would be unkind to Katie or other young carers. “Stop and think twice. But try and put yourself in their shoes for five minutes - they don't want sympathy, they just want to be treated as a normal person, who's doing an absolutely fantastic job behind closed doors.” They have fun doing all the normal sorts of things that mothers and daughters do. Katie loves spending time with Charlotte. “Going shopping and watching movies... and eating popcorn!” I leave Katie and Charlotte cuddling up on the sofa, watching TV. What does her Mum mean to Katie? She doesn’t need to think about it: “The world.” Built with Shorthand"
UK driving licence 'may not be valid in EU',"UK drivers may have to get an international driving permit if they want to drive in some European countries after a no-deal Brexit. The government says that after March 2019 ""your driving licence may no longer be valid by itself"" in the EU, in itslatest no-deal planning papers,external. It also warns that Britons travelling to the EU may need to make sure their passports have six months left to run. International permits cost Â£5.50 and are available at some post offices. Aprevious report from the National Audit Office,externalsuggested that between 100,000 and seven million international driving permits may need to be issued in the first year, if no Brexit deal is reached. AA president Edmund King said: ""This will be an extra burden for UK drivers wanting to take a holiday abroad. ""We envisage quite a rush on post offices next year for the Â£5.50 IDPs if no deal is reached. ""Hopefully an agreement can be reached to prevent further red tape and expense for drivers."" The cabinet met earlier for a ""no deal"" planning session. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC that the government was aiming to get a Brexit deal with Brussels by mid-November at the latest but was stepping up contingency planning in case that did not happen. Brexit papers: What no deal could mean Free mobile phone roaming 'not guaranteed' May says Â£39bn bill linked to Brexit deal After the meeting, ministers published the latest series of papers outlining the work it has done to prepare for the ""unlikely"" scenario that the UK leaves the EU without a deal in place. While UK driving licences are currently valid in the EU, the papers say if no deal is reached, an international driving permit may be required - as it is currently to drive in Japan, some US states and other countries. It did not rule out that this could apply to Ireland - saying it will be up to the Irish government if they require an international driving permit from a UK driver. However, Ireland'sNational Driver Licence Service website says,external: ""As a visitor to Ireland, you can drive on a driving licence from any state outside the EU/EEA for up to a year provided the driving licence is current and valid."" Precise rules about permit requirements for non-EU licence holders varies between EU member states. There are two types of permit, depending on which EU state you are driving in. The government says the current process for getting one type of permit over the counter at the 90 post offices it is available at ""takes around five minutes on a turn-up-and-go basis"". It says it will start providing both types of permits itself from February and applications will be made at 2,500 post offices across the UK. In the event of no deal, the papers also state that British passport holders would face different rules for travelling in countries which are part of theSchengen area,external- and would need passports that have at least three months to run from the intended departure date. As they would be allowed to stay up to 90 days, the actual check could end up being that the passport has six months left to run on arrival. This would not apply to travel to Ireland, because of theCommon Travel Area,externalbetween Ireland and the UK.

Beetle comes to the end of the road,"In recent years its production moved away from Europe to Mexico, closer to its key US market Volkswagen is ending production of its Beetle in 2019, closing the door on one of the world's most iconic car designs. The German company said output would end at its plant in Mexico next July after production of celebration models. The Beetle has its roots in Nazi Germany with the creation of a ""people's car"", but went on to star in a series of successful Disney films as a vehicle called Herbie. But sales, particularly in the key US market, have fallen in recent years. Mexico's enduring love for a classic car Volkswagen: A brief history Consumers in the US have increasingly turned to larger cars such as crossovers and sports utility vehicles. Volkswagen, in the wake of the diesel emissions scandal and huge investment in electric vehicles, says it will look to slim down its model range with a greater focus on family and electric cars. The company say the final Beetle models will be available in both coupe and convertible styles. The iconic design found fame in the 1960s as Herbie in The Love Bug - a character revived in 2005 ""The loss of the Beetle after three generations, over nearly seven decades, will evoke a host of emotions from the Beetle's many devoted fans,"" said Hinrich Woebcken, chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America. The Beetle was originally designed in the 1930s by legendary engineer Ferdinand Porsche - a name now synonymous with fast cars - at the behest of Adolf Hitler, who wanted to see a cheap and practical mass-produced car made available to the German people. But the outbreak of war would stall its production, as military necessity took precedence. The plant would be severely damaged, then fell into the hands of allied forces - who were eventually to play a large part in its recommissioning. It was intended as a family saloon for the average German worker Production began to take off in the late 1940s, and by 1955 a million of the cars were driving on German roads. The design would find international fame in the 1960s and '70s in films featuring Herbie the Love Bug, a racing car with a mind of its own. It was also popular with the 1960s counter-culture types who extolled the Beetle's small, practical, but aesthetic qualities. How Hitler's idea became a design icon What if the VW Beetle had never existed? Production of the Beetle has ceased and then been revived several times over the decades, with the last of the original design rolling out of VW's Mexican factory in 2003. The ""New Beetle"" redesign, which was based on VW's Golf, stormed the US market in the late 1990s, selling more than 80,000 in 1999. The iconic ""bug"" cars have been a cult favourite for generations The company is already thought to have reviewed a possible model revamp and options for electric versions in recent years, before deciding on its abandonment. But Mr Woebcken didn't completely rule out that the model could one day be resurrected: ""Never say never."" Volkswagen sold 11,151 Beetles during the first eight months of 2018, down 2.2% from the same period a year earlier. US consumers looking for a small Volkswagen vehicle overwhelmingly prefer the Jetta sedan, or the Tiguan compact sport utility vehicle.

Dominic Pitter and wife Emily, from Derby, were in Jamaica with their two children when Mr Pitter was rushed to hospital for a life-saving operation. His 12-year-old daughter Amelia later fell ill with acute gastroenteritis. Mr Pitter's father Len then flew out to be at his son's bedside but suffered a heart attack while snorkelling. Teacher Mrs Pitter, 42, said: ""What we hoped would be a well-earned holiday of a lifetime in paradise ended up being any family's worst nightmare with three family members receiving emergency medical treatment.""

US hurricane could kill 'a lot of people',"This video can not be played Why do people ignore hurricane warnings? Hurricane Florence, which is nearing the US East Coast, could kill ""a lot of people"", officials warn. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) says storm surges could bring catastrophic flooding to inland areas. Nearly 1.7m people along the coastlines of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia have been ordered to evacuate. Strong winds and heavy rains have already begun lashing North Carolina's coastline, leading to some early flooding. Some 11,000 power outages had already been reported in the state. Reuters news agency reports. Latest updates Florence was 155 miles (250km) east of Myrtle Beach in South Carolina at 17:00 EDT (21:00 GMT), and is projected to make landfall on Friday at 08:00 local time. It was downgraded to a category two storm with 105mph (165km/h) winds, and the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it does not expect much change in the strength before the eye of Florence makes landfall. Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? Your guide to Hurricane Florence's risks Fema administrator Brock Long told Thursday morning's news conference that while Florence's wind speed had dipped, its wind field had expanded and total rainfall predictions were unchanged. Floodwaters may rise up to 13ft (4m) as rivers see their flows ""reversed"", meteorologists have warned. ""So this is a very dangerous storm,"" said Mr Long. ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people unfortunately and that's what we're about to see."" ""Your time is running out,"" he warned those who had not yet heeded the warning to evacuate. ""The ocean is going to start rising."" ""Your time to get out of those areas in storm surge inundation is coming to a close. I cannot emphasise that enough."" He said that people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. This video can not be played People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane A guide to the world's deadliest storms Prisons in hurricane's path not evacuated The latest weather predictions show the storm slowing to a near standstill as it pummels the coast with ""copious amounts of rain"" from Thursday night to Saturday, said Mr Long. Parts of the Carolina coast are expecting 20-30 (50-75cm) inches of rain, with isolated regions seeing up to 40in of downpour. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is imposing a 12-hour curfew from 19:00 local time on Thursday. Trump rejects Puerto Rico storm death toll Petrol stations in the area are reporting shortages and energy companies predict that one to three million homes and businesses may lose power. Over 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, as most of the coastal region's airports are closed to ride out the storm. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

Swipe to progress  North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned people: ""Today the threat becomes a reality."" Emergency workers are arriving from other parts of the US to aid in rescues. The Coast Guard has shallow-water response boats ready to help trapped residents. The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Are you in the area? How are you preparing for the hurricane?

Tears as partner watches bridge attack CCTV,"Andrei Burnaz had been planning to propose to Andreea Cristea on the day of the attack The partner of a woman killed in the 2017 Westminster terror attack has told an inquest he searched frantically for her after she was hit by the car. Khalid Masood ran down and killed four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer to death. Romanian Andreea Cristea was visiting London with her boyfriend when Masood's car knocked her into the Thames. She died from her injuries two weeks later. Andrei Burnaz said he ran all ""over the bridge"" looking for Ms Cristea. He told the inquest, sitting at the Old Bailey, that he called her mobile and it rang - which he thought was a positive sign - but then found both it and her glasses ""in a pool of blood"". Mr Burnaz added that after trying to get help from officers in his search he ""thought maybe it would be better to jump in the river to search for her, but I didn't"". Those killed in the attack on 22 March last year were Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Ms Cristea, 31. Masood was shot dead at the scene by armed police officers. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Westminster inquest: Day three Mr Burnaz wiped away tears as CCTV footage of their final moments together were shown to the court. Speaking on the fourth day of the inquest, he told the hearing it had been ""very busy, very crowded on both sides of the bridge"", adding: ""We stopped a little bit to take some pictures."" He said: ""Very suddenly I heard some crashing and some noises in front of me. ""After that, loud banging. I heard something hit something and after that at the same time people were screaming."" He said he saw the car coming towards them and ""it was very quick."" ""The left part of the car was on the pavement and the right part was on the road,"" he added. The witness told the inquest he then felt a ""burning sensation"" on one leg. ""After the vehicle passed I looked on the left side of me to search for Andreea, but I couldn't see her,"" he continued. ""I started searching for Andreea. I started running over the bridge."" Mr Burnaz said at one point he started running towards Masood's car to see if she had become stuck under it. He said: ""I saw plenty police officers armed with machine guns. ""I run and tried to explain to him what happened and tried to explain that I could not find my girlfriend. He only started yelling: 'Go back, go back, clear the area'."" Ms Cristea died from her injuries two weeks after the attack He called Ms Cristea's sister to tell her what had happened, the court heard. He described going to the other side of the bridge where he told a female police officer that his partner was ""in the water right now"". The witness told the court he looked over both sides of the bridge but was unable to see Ms Cristea. When he explained the situation to another officer, who told colleagues over a police radio, he said: ""That was the first time that somebody took action about this."" Mr Burnaz said he was later taken to hospital to be treated himself and later still taken to see Ms Cristea in another hospital. Ms Cristea took this photo on Westminster Bridge just before the attack Witness Michael Brown had been driving his white van across the bridge when he saw Masood's Hyundai ""hitting people as it drove along the pavement"". He told the Old Bailey he saw Ms Cristea go ""10ft in the air"" before ""she came down straight into the Thames"". The witness described doing a ""U-turn"" and parking his van before looking into the river and calling 999 to raise the alarm. At first he could not spot Ms Cristea, but then saw her ""floating in the Thames face down"". Mr Brown said he then tried to assist others on the bridge. He described the scene as ""carnage"". When the barrister representing Ms Cristea's family thanked him for his efforts that day, Mr Brown began weeping. The witness also described ""screaming just trying to get attention"" of those on a boat below, which he did. He said he even considered jumping into the water, but changed his mind because he cannot swim. The inquest heard that vital minutes were lost in trying to rescue Ms Cristea from the river. Despite an emergency distress signal, along with shouts from Mr Brown and passengers on the City Cruises tourist clipper, the boat's first mate Danny Cooper initially thought Ms Cristea's body was ""garbage"". Gareth Patterson QC, representing Ms Cristea's family, said she had been face down in the river for two minutes when she was first secured, but remained immersed for five minutes before the London Fire Brigade's Fire Flash boat arrived and pulled her aboard. Mr Cooper said he thought Ms Cristea was dead and had been in the water ""for a long time"" and was worried the presumed body would ""fall apart"" if pulled aboard. ""It wouldn't have been nice for anyone involved,"" he said. ""There were children sitting downstairs."" Mr Patterson asked: ""Mr Cooper, there was nothing stopping her being lifted by a matter of inches to see if she was alive, to lift her face out of the water?"" ""I don't know,"" Mr Cooper replied. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Witness Joanne Fant, an ambulance technician involved in helping Ms Cristea, said the victim ""did actually squeeze my hand"" after she had been taken ashore. Witness Dr Samy Sadek oversaw Ms Cristea's care at the Royal London Hospital after the attack. Mr Patterson asked if she might ""have survived"" if rescued from the water after two minutes when first seen by the pleasure boat - rather than the more than five minutes it took before the fire service boat recovered her. ""I have absolutely no way of knowing,"" Dr Sadek said. Ms Cristea's family in Bucharest watched the proceedings via video link. The inquest is set to last about five weeks. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held once the hearing into his victims' deaths has concluded. The coroner is expected to examine Masood's background, police records, and look into the fact that he briefly featured in MI5 investigations in 2009 and 2010. The absence of armed officers at the scene will also be examined.

Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists',"Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov said they were visiting Salisbury Two men named as suspects in the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy in the UK have said they were merely tourists. The men, named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, told the state-run RT channel they had travelled to Salisbury on the recommendation of friends. The UK believes the men are Russian military intelligence officers who tried to kill Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury last March. Downing Street dismissed the interview. ""The lies and blatant fabrications in this interview given to a Russian state-sponsored TV station are an insult to the public's intelligence,"" Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said. On WednesdayRussian President Vladimir Putin said ""there is nothing criminal about them""and called them ""civilians"". What happened to the Skripals? Skripal suspects interview: Key excerpts What is the GRU? The Skripals survived being poisoned by the nerve agent Novichok, but Dawn Sturgess - a woman not connected to the Russian events - died in July having been exposed to the same substance. Appearing nervous and uncomfortable, the men confirmed their names as those announced by the UK investigators - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. ""Those are our real names,"" they said. RT is Russia's state-run international broadcaster, and the pair were interviewed by its chief editor, Margarita Simonyan. ""Their passports match and the photos and the information from the British side shows it's these people,"" she said. The men said they worked in the sports nutrition business and had travelled to London for a short holiday, fitting in a couple of day trips to Salisbury. ""Our friends had been suggesting for a long time that we visit this wonderful town,"" Mr Petrov said. They said they only stayed an hour in Salisbury on Saturday 3 March because of the snowy weather conditions, but returned on Sunday 4 March to visit the sights. The two men admitted they may have passed Mr Skripal's house by chance ""but we don't know where it is located,"" Mr Petrov said. When asked about Novichok, they emphatically denied carrying it, or the modified Nina Ricci perfume bottle which UK investigators say contained the substance. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in ""For normal blokes, to be carrying women's perfume with us, isn't that silly?"" Mr Boshirov asked. The two men told RT their lives had been ""turned upside down"" by the allegations. ""We're afraid to go out, we fear for ourselves, our lives and lives of our loved ones,"" said Mr Boshirov. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow described the interview as carefully choreographed and bizarre, pointing out that in tone and content it matched the whole Russian response to the case - flat denial mixed with mockery. The British police believe the men to be officers of Russian military intelligence, GRU, who may have travelled on false passports to London from Moscow in March. This video can not be played On the trail of Russians Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who UK police say carried out a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018 They say the purpose of the men's visit to Salisbury on 3 March was reconnaissance, and on 4 March they returned to apply Novichok to the Skripals' front door. The UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says there is enough evidence to convict the two men, although it is not applying to Russia for their extradition because Russia does not extradite its own nationals. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case they travel to the EU, and UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid has warned that the men will be caught and prosecuted if they ever step out of Russia. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera The appearance of the two men looks like the next step in the struggle between London and Moscow to convince their own publics and those around the world about their respective cases. The amount of detail put out by British police last week, and the direct accusation that the men were officers in Russian military intelligence, was something the Kremlin will not have wanted to go unchallenged. And the Russian government will be hoping this interview will generate sympathy at home for what are said to be a pair of sports nutrition salesmen who wanted to see a beautiful English cathedral with its 123-metre spire, but who instead have found themselves accused of being assassins. But the risk for Russia is that the interview raises more questions than it answers and offers more details for sceptics to unpick and challenge. How plausible are the men generally and specifically about their reasons for visiting Salisbury? How plausible is their account of their movements around the town when compared to the CCTV? And given the UK has suggested the names they use are pseudonyms, how convincing are their stories about who they are, including their past, their jobs and their travel? At around 15:00 GMT on Friday 2 March, the two men arrived at Gatwick Airport Police say they travelled to London Victoria at 17:40 GMT, and were at Waterloo Station between 18:00 and 19:00 GMT before travelling to their London hotel At 11:45 GMT on Saturday 3 March, they took a train from Waterloo Station to Salisbury CCTV footage shows the men in Salisbury around 14:25 GMT The men say they spent less than an hour in Salisbury, deciding against seeing Stonehenge, Old Sarum and Salisbury Cathedral because of ""muddy slush everywhere"" CCTV footage shows the men taking a train back to London at 16:11 GMT On Sunday 4 March, CCTV cameras filmed the men arriving at Salisbury train station at 11:48 GMT Police say they were then seen on CCTV near the home of Sergei Skripal at 11:58 GMT The men say they then visited Salisbury Cathedral CCTV footage shows the men leaving Salisbury station at 13:50 GMT At 19:28 GMT, the men were at Heathrow Airport for an Aeroflot flight to Moscow Yulia Skripal flew in to the UK from Russia on Saturday 3 March to visit her father, Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent who was living in Salisbury. They had been for lunch at a restaurant in central Salisbury on 4 March when they were found ""in an extremely serious condition"" on a bench outside the restaurant. They spent weeks in intensive care in hospital before recovering. Ms Skripal was discharged from hospital on 9 April and her father on 18 May. They are both now in a secure location. Why Novichok stays deadly for so long UK police are linking the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June, when Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about 13km (eight miles) away.

Skripal suspects tourist claims 'offensive',"The British authorities released photos of the two men they suspected of carrying out the poisoning Claims the suspects in the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy were only in the UK as tourists are ""deeply offensive to the victims"", the UK government has said. The two men told the state-run RT channel they had travelled to Salisbury on the recommendation of friends. Downing Street described the interview as ""lies and blatant fabrications"".

Man guilty of Lee Rigby fundraising fraud,"Gary Gardner was accused of using some of the money raised to release a ""flop"" charity song A fundraiser has been convicted of two counts of fraud after pocketing cash collected for the young son of murdered soldier Lee Rigby. Gary Gardner, 56, raised at least Â£24,000 but only Â£4,000 made its way to any organisation, a court heard. Leicester Crown Court was told Gardner put on three truck-pull events attended by thousands, including Fusilier Rigby's widow Rebecca and son Jack. Gardner, of Medbourne, Leicestershire, will be sentenced on Friday. The jury heard Gardner, of Old Holt Road, spent up to Â£5,000 donated by the public for Jack on production of a charity music single which only raised Â£200. He was cleared of one count of fraud which alleged he failed to keep a record of the amounts raised from fundraisers. Lee Rigby was killed outside Woolwich Barracks in south-east London in May 2013 The court was told Gardner put on the truck-pull events in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in the Leicestershire villages of Medbourne and Market Harborough, and Stroud, Gloucestershire, which Mrs Rigby and Jack attended. The soldier was killed outside Woolwich Barracks in south-east London five years ago, andtwo men have been jailed for his murder. East Midlands Live: Wrong way M1 drunk driver jailed for death crash; Princess Diana letter to be auctioned Shortly after his death, Gardner said he wanted to raise money for Jack and Medbourne village causes. Giving evidence in the trial, Mrs Rigby said: ""There were talks of climbing Kilimanjaro, there were a number of things [Gardner] wanted to do to raise funds for Jack. ""He spoke about large money - thousands - and it was as if it would set Jack up for life."" Mrs Rigby was asked: ""Have you ever received any money from this defendant?"" to which she replied: ""Jack and myself have never received a penny from him."" Gardner, who denied three counts of fraud, claimed his charity single failed because of ""atrocious weather"" at the launch event in London's Trafalgar Square in February 2014. He claimed he spent charity cash producing the single he knew would be a ""flop"" because of his ""enthusiasm for promoting emerging music artists"". But the jury found him guilty of two counts after accepting he had used trust funds to ""prop up"" his overdrawn bank account. After the verdict, Steven Kennell from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Gardner had ""behaved dishonestly throughout, even inviting the Rigby family to attend his events and posing publicly with a presentation cheque to imply he had donated the money"".

BBC Radio 5 Live said the podcast had been released at the request of Bland and her husband, Steve, with whom she has a two-year-old son, Freddie. In it, she says: ""I know I'm probably not going to be living for much longer but I don't think about it too deeply because I wouldn't be able to look at Freddie without weeping all over him. ""I want to spend valuable time with him - whatever time I have left - I want it to be good time and the same with Steve.""

""When we recorded it, we didn't know at the time that this would be the final time that we would be together. ""However, it's her explicit wishes that not only do we air it but that we continue with it."" Bland, a familiar voice on BBC Radio 5 Live as a newsreader and presenter, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016.

"Actor backs dwarf wrestling eventsActor James Lusted, who has dwarfism, says wrestling events should go ahead despite protests.Wales","James Lusted carried the Olympic flame through his home town as part of the torch relay for London 2012 An actor with dwarfism has backed the organisers of a controversial wrestling event involving people with the condition. James Lusted, from Colwyn Bay, says the shows in Cardiff and Swansea should go ahead next month. He was responding to calls from a charity for venues to boycott Extreme Dwarfanators Wrestling. Venues in Leicester and Ferndown, near Bournemouth, have already cancelled performances. The Restricted Growth Association (RGA) compared the event to a ""freak show"" that ridicules people with dwarfism. The Extreme Dwarfanators Wrestling event was due to take place in Leicester in October However, Mr Lusted, a TV presenter, motivational speaker and county councillor, says those involved in the event deserve the opportunity to perform. ""If they want to wrestle then let them crack on. If you don't agree with it don't go,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""I'm really frustrated the shows have been cancelled. ""That's how they've chosen to live, that's how they've chosen to support their families, pay their bills. Why don't we just encourage and support them in that. ""These professional entertainers, they're well trained and fit but they're actually going to lose finances now. I feel sorry for them."" Charity wants dwarf wrestling cancelled Dwarf wrestling 'freak show' cancelled Organisers say the ""family"" show is about promoting equality. However Gillian Martin, of RGA, said the event was ""deeply offensive"" and urged venues to ""move into the 21st Century"" by cancelling the event. ""They are about making people laugh at the Victorian spectacle of people with dwarfism fighting each other,"" she added. Wrestlers said they were ""deeply upset"" that shows had been cancelled Standing at 3ft 7in tall, Mr Lusted was born with Diastrophic Dyslasia - a rare genetic condition that causes dwarfism - despite his parents both being of average height. He has twice represented Great Britain in the World Dwarf Games and has been the UK champion at Class One badminton for nine years. Hecarried the Olympic torchwhen it travelled through Wales in 2012. Mr Lusted presented a programme on the Welsh-language channel S4C 'I fell in love with a man with dwarfism' ""I can understand that some people don't like this kind of thing,"" he said.

Two dead as lorry and cars crash on M5,"This video can not be played The M5 in Somerset was closed following a crash involving two lorries and several cars. A man and a woman died and four people were injured - two critically - in a crash involving a lorry and six cars on the M5 in Somerset. Emergency services were called to the southbound carriageway of the motorway, a mile north of Taunton, at 8:30 BST. The road between junctions 24, at Huntworth, and 25, for Taunton, opened about 11 hours after the crash. Police said a female driver and male passenger from another car died at the scene. Two women were in a critical condition in hospital on Thursday evening. Two other people have been receiving treatment for non life-threatening or life-changing injuries. Hundreds of vehicles were caught up in the tailbacks on the M5 Insp Frazer Davey, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""I'm very sad to report two people have lost their lives at the scene this morning. ""There have been a number of other people injured who have been taken to hospital. ""An investigation of this nature will take some time and I'd like to apologise to the number of people caught up in the quite-sizeable tailback."" The northbound carriageway reopened after being closed for about three hours He said the southbound carriageway remained closed while the circumstances were investigated and any damage to the road surface was repaired. The northbound carriageway was re-opened at lunchtime after being closed immediately after the crash. The southbound route reopened at about 19:30 - some 11 hours after the crash took place. BBC reporter Clinton Rogers was on a bridge near to the site of the crash and said it happened just a few metres away from the scene ofa multiple pile-up on the motorway seven years ago. In 2011, seven people were killed and more than 50 injured in a crash involving 34 vehicles on the northbound carriageway of the M5 close to junction 25. The M5 was closed between junctions 24 and 25 Somerset Council said the motorway closure was also causing delays on the local road network, with tailbacks reported on the A358 and along the A38 corridor.

Snowden surveillance powers ruled unlawful,"The UK's bulk interception powers, exposed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, have been found to be illegal by the European Court of Human Rights. In a landmark judgement, the court ruled agencies had violated rights as there were no proper safeguards. The court crucially said bulk interception was legitimate and it had seen no evidence it had been abused. Parliament reformed surveillance powers in 2016 and introduced a new watchdog. Critics say the system is still flawed. In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed that GCHQ - the UK's eavesdropping agency - had beensecretly collecting communications sent over the internet on an industrial scale. It could reassemble the communications, filter them and then analyse the remainder for anything useful to protecting national security. Bulk surveillance programmes revealed: ""Tempora"" - the bulk storage of all internet traffic GCHQ could harvest ""Karma Police"" - an attempt to catalogue the web habits of any user who could be found ""Black Hole"" -  a digital library of more than one trillion internet ""events"" The agency could also obtain data and content from its US partners and companies including Apple, Google and Facebook. Campaigners argued that these collection systems violated the right to privacy - and on Thursday the European Court of Human Rights agreed. The judgement said the system revealed by Mr Snowden simply did not have any proper safeguards because it led to completely ""untargeted"" collection of information. In practice, this meant personal information could be seen by GCHQ, even if it had nothing to do with national security threats. The judgement said: ""While there is no evidence to suggest that the intelligence services are abusing their powers - on the contrary, the [then British watchdog] observed that the selection procedure was carefully and conscientiously undertaken by analysts, the court is not persuaded that the safeguards governing selection of bearers [internet cables] for interception and the selection of intercepted material for examination are sufficiently robust to provide adequate guarantees against abuse. ""Of greatest concern, however, is the absence of robust independent oversight of the selectors and search criteria used to filter intercepted communications."" The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg The court also criticised powers to ask internet companies to hand over ""communications data"" - the basic technical facts of how people have exchanged information. It said: ""The content of an electronic communication might be encrypted and, even if it were decrypted, might not reveal anything of note about the sender or recipient. ""The related communications data, on the other hand, could reveal the identities and geographic location of the sender and recipient and the equipment through which the communication was transmitted. ""In bulk, the degree of intrusion is magnified, since the patterns that will emerge could be capable of painting an intimate picture of a person through the mapping of social networks, location tracking, internet browsing tracking, mapping of communication patterns, and insight into who a person interacted with."" In 2016, Parliament passed the Investigatory Powers Act in a massive overhaul of surveillance law. A government spokeswoman said it would give ""careful consideration"" to the judgement - but added that new safeguards were already in place. ""The Investigatory Powers Act 2016 replaced large parts of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) which was the subject of this challenge,"" she said. ""This includes the introduction of a 'double lock' which requires warrants for the use of these powers to be authorised by a secretary of state and approved by a judge. ""AnInvestigatory Powers Commissioner,externalhas also been created to ensure robust independent oversight of how these powers are used."" UK surveillance powers explained But Jim Killock of Open Rights Group - one of the bodies behind the challenge - said:  ""Viewers of the BBC drama, Bodyguard, may be shocked to know that the UK actually has the most extreme surveillance powers in a democracy. ""Since we brought this case in 2013, the UK has actually increased its powers to indiscriminately surveil our communications whether or not we are suspected of any criminal activity. ""In light of today's judgment, it is even clearer that these powers do not meet the criteria for proportionate surveillance and that the UK government is continuing to breach our right to privacy."" Silkie Carlo, of Big Brother Watch, added: ""This landmark judgment confirming that the UK's mass spying breached fundamental rights vindicates Mr Snowden's courageous whistleblowing."" Lord David Anderson QC, the former independent terror laws watchdog, said that judgement was ""enormously important"" because the court had backed the use of bulk interception powers that had so worried Edward Snowden. ""That should come as a relief - not only to the agencies who do this work, but the rest of us who they are trying to keep safe,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. ""I have looked pretty carefully at this over a number of years and there is no doubt in my mind that these powers are very useful - not just in counter-terrorism, but in cyber defence and at a much more everyday level they are useful for the police in fighting online sex crime, county lines and in a missing persons investigation. ""What they [the judges] are doing are holding the feet of our new super regulator to the fire, and saying if you are going to give government these powers, then you have to look really closely at how they are authorised, how they are used and what happens to the data after it's been collected.""

Cliff collapse in Greece injures tourists,"This video can not be played Holidaymakers filmed the aftermath of the cliff collapse At least seven people were injured when part of a cliff face broke away at the popular Navagio beach on the Greek island of Zakynthos, officials say. ""We haven't found any trapped people but we will continue searching,"" a spokesperson for the fire brigade said. None of the injuries sustained in the incident on Thursday afternoon are believed to be life-threatening. The beach, also known as ""shipwreck beach"", is popular with tourists and can be reached only by boat. ""There was a noise and a small piece of rock fell, then a second bigger and finally a third big piece of rock that during the fall created a sea whirlpool that overturned the boats,"" one eyewitness said.

Greek authorities said they had received no reports of missing people but that search and rescue teams were continuing to operate by air and sea into the late afternoon as a precaution. Among those injured was a 34-year-old woman from the Czech Republic, who suffered a fractured vertebra. Her husband and two children were also treated for minor injuries by hospital staff, according to the Greek news website Kathimerini. Three others were also hurt in the incident. ""Shipwreck beach"" on Zakynthos, or Zante, is one of the Ionian island's main attractions Footage posted on social media showed people running in panic as a large section of the cliff peeled off and crashed down close to several bathers. The port of Zakynthos, which is also known as Zante in Western Europe, was evacuated as a precaution. It is one of the Ionian island's main attractions, in part because of the shipwreck on the shore and also because of its surrounding steep cliffs.

Second patient may have drunk toilet cleaner,"Joan Blaber, 85, died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in September last year An inquest into the death of a woman who died after drinking cleaning fluid has heard another patient at the same hospital may have drunk toilet cleaner. Joan Blaber, 85, from Lewes, died while being treated at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. She died on 23 September 2017, six days after drinking Flash cleaner from a water jug on her bedside table. Hove Coroner's Court heard it was ""highly unlikely"" what happened was the result of a mistake. Before Mrs Blaber's death staff had been told another patient had drunk toilet cleaner, the jury heard. Housekeeper Daniel Gonzales said: ""Apparently the patient, who had dementia or something like that, took it and drank it. ""It's just a story, I'm not sure if it was true."" Mr Gonzales was asked how he thought Flash was found in a patient's water jug. He replied: ""It doesn't make any sense to me. No-one would pour the product into a jug you normally use for patients."" Ashley Le May, who was part of a team whose job it was to clean communal areas, said he had to carry a container of Flash through the wards on 17 September 2017 to get to other parts of the building as it was too big to fit on a trolley. He said: ""At no point did we stop and at no point did the bottle of Flash leave its cardboard box."" His colleague Kayleigh Regan said in a statement read to the court, there was ""no real structure"" to cleaning and claimed she had received ""no official training"" from the hospital. Senior coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley suggested it was ""highly unlikely"" what happened was the result of an error. At a pre-inquest review in June, she saida ""deliberate act"" could not be ruled out. The inquest continues.

Abortion clinic 'buffer zone' call rejected,"This video can not be played Anti-abortion campaigners protest outside London clinic in 2018 Calls for buffer zones to be introduced outside abortion clinics to stop patients being harassed have been rejected by Home Secretary Sajid Javid. He said such protest-free areas around clinics in England and Wales ""would not be a proportionate response"". A Home Office review found cases of harassment and damaging behaviour but they were ""not the norm"", he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the decision was a ""shocking failure to protect women"" and should be reversed. In a written statement, Mr Javid said the review had gathered evidence that showed protesters' behaviour had left patients distressed and caused some to rebook their appointments and not to follow medical advice. He said that in some cases, protesters handed out model foetuses, displayed graphic images, followed people, blocked their paths and even assaulted them. However, he added that the review showed these activities were ""not the norm"" and most anti-abortion activities were ""more passive"", such as praying, displaying banners and handing out leaflets. 'I felt like a criminal for having an abortion' 'That's where the babies are suffering' In 2017, 363 hospitals and clinics in England and Wales carried out abortions - 36 of which experienced anti-abortion demonstrations, according to the review. Mr Javid said: ""Having considered the evidence of the review, I have therefore reached the conclusion that introducing national buffer zones would not be a proportionate response, considering the experiences of the majority of hospitals and clinics, and considering that the majority of activities are more passive in nature."" He went on to say that there was already legislation - such asthe Public Order Act 1986,external- in place that restricted protest activities which caused harm to others. Defending the decision, Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told the Commons the government would continue with the current scheme of enabling councils to apply for Public Space Protection Orders. In April, the west London council of Ealing took matters into their own hands, imposing a 100m protest-free ""buffer zone"" outside a Marie Stopes clinic. But the constituency MP, Labour's Rupa Huq, said it was a ""national problem that requires a national solution"". She told the Commons the conclusions were ""a bit disappointing"". ""It seems to be saying there has to be a disproportionate number of women affected before any action takes place,"" she added. Speaking later to the BBC, she said shoving the burden onto already cash-strapped local authorities was not the best solution, and would leave women running ""a gauntlet of a barrage of abuse just to have their NHS procedure done"". This video can not be played Newsnight: Should there be 'buffer zones' around abortion clinics in Britain? Mr Javid's predecessor, Amber Rudd, who launched the review last year, has previously said it was ""unacceptable"" that anyone should feel intimidated at a clinic. However, Ms Rudd, who resigned as home secretary in April, told the Commons that now that she could ""travel slightly less conspicuously"", she had visited the Ealing clinic. She told MPs there was ""no harassment continuing which, I believe, continues to reflect what has been concluded"" in the government's announcement. Clare Murphy, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which provides abortion services in the UK, said the charity would seek to work with councils to roll out the Ealing ""model"" across the country to protect women and clinic staff from protesters. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said Public Spaces Protection Orders could be useful but had not been designed for this purpose. It said new legislation would make sure the approach towards protests was ""consistent and effective"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mr Javid had ""given the green light for women to be harassed and abused for exercising their right to choose. ""This is a disgusting failure to uphold women's rights over their own bodies. Sajid Javid must urgently reconsider,"" the Labour MP said. And her party colleague, Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the home affairs select committee, said: ""The whole point of having this review was because existing powers are not working or are proving cumbersome and difficult for councils or the police to use."" Elizabeth Howard, of Be Here For Me - a campaign group which opposed the ban on buffer zones - welcomed Mr Javid's ""common sense"" decision which would mean ""women could continue to be offered much needed help and support"". Antonia Tully, of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, said they were ""delighted"" by the decision. ""This is a massive victory for common sense, democracy and above all for the hundreds of vulnerable women who are saved from the horror of abortion at the very gates of the abortion clinic.""

John Lewis half-year profits slump 99%,"This video can not be played Sir Charlie Mayfield on the challenges facing John Lewis Profits at the John Lewis Partnership have fallen to almost zero in the first half of the year as its department store chain matched discounting ""extravaganza days"" by rivals. John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said the retail sector was facing ""challenging times"". Its results, which include Waitrose, showed profits for the six months to 28 July sank 99% from last year to Â£1.2m. The retailer also warned that full-year profits would be ""substantially lower"". The company is rebranding its stores to John Lewis & Partners and Waitrose & Partners to highlight the chain's 85,000 members of staff, known as ""partners"" who are given an annual bonus based on the chain's profits. ""With the level of uncertainty facing consumers and the economy, in part due to ongoing Brexit negotiations, forecasting is particularly difficult but we continue to expect full year profits to be substantially lower than last year for the partnership as a whole,"" the retailer said. In the first six months, profits at the John Lewis department store business were hit hardest. Sir Charlie said that the stores' profit margins had been squeezed in ""what has been the most promotional market we've seen in almost a decade"". John Lewis boss rejects Dominic Raab Brexit jibe Is it time to ditch ""Never knowingly undersold""? Why we no longer love department stores Six reasons behind the High Street crisis He told the BBC's Today programme: ""The biggest single reason for the decline in profits is all about margin"". The department store pledges to be ""never knowingly undersold"" - cutting prices to match those of competitors, which have also been discounting. ""This year there has been twice as many extravaganza days as there were a year ago and actually the discounts have been even deeper,"" he said. ""We're never knowingly undersold at John Lewis, so of course we are matching that, and that affects margins."" It was an ""extremely valuable"" promise, he added. Sir Charlie said the chain had also not been passing on to consumers all of the inflationary impact from the weakness in sterling. The pound has slumped since the vote to leave the EU, pushing up the cost of imported produce. Analysts said the results demonstrated the impact of the price-matching promise. Steve Dresser, retail analyst at Grocery Insight, tweeted that ""the business feels like it's broken"", adding that the never knowingly undersold pledge ""needs refining, badly"". The department store sector has been undergoing a period of change.Sports Direct bought House of Fraser in Augustwhile Debenhams, in which Sports Direct has a 29.7% stake, was this weekforced to stress that its sales had not collapsed. Sport Direct has also been forced to deny that it does intend to make a full bid for Debenhams. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the profits fall at John Lewis heralded further problems for the retail sector. ""This brand was hailed as the model to which all should follow, and as a commercial and customer success - make no mistake, for the high street this is as significant as the fall of the Roman empire. ""And much like the fall of Rome, it's not just the empire that suffers, the infrastructure that supplies it will too. The UK industry must steel itself for dark times to rise again."" For most of the last decade John Lewis appeared to defy gravity. While its High Street rivals were brought crashing down by the combined pull of the internet and ever-higher costs, it seemed to sail serenely on, smartly moving sales online while keeping customers coming to its stores. Now gravity has finally exerted itself. John Lewis sold Â£5.5bn worth of goods in the first six months of this year, and made just Â£1.2m profit - close enough to nothing. The partnership's chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, has rejected the obvious response. This is not the time, he said, to be cutting back, closing stores and stopping investment. Instead, he has stepped up investment in stores, while also husbanding costs, as can be seen in a review of the future of the retailer's final-salary pension scheme. Sir Charlie's main strategic move, however, is hidden in the fine print of the financial statements. He is paying down John Lewis's debt as fast as he can. In a downturn this severe, the last person standing is often the winner - and by getting rid of debt, Sir Charles is doing his best to make sure that is John Lewis. Like-for-like sales - which strip out new floor space - at the John Lewis stores fell 1.2%, and it reported an underlying operating loss of Â£19m compared with a Â£54m profit a year earlier. At Waitrose, like-for-like sales were up 2.6%, but operating profits fell 12% to Â£96.4m. The group had warned in June that its half-year profits would be wiped out and that it would invest more in developing ""unique"" products and services, as well as placing more emphasis on its own brand. It said it would continue to invest between Â£400m and Â£500m per year in the business. Sir Charlie said: ""You don't succeed by retrenching so if anything we are investing more and pushing on with differentiation. ""The simple truth is that times like these call for cool heads and really determined ambition."" Is 'Never knowingly undersold' killing John Lewis?

Man tells of search for Westminster victim,"Andrei Burnaz had been planning to propose to Andreea Cristea on the day of the attack The partner of a woman killed in the 2017 Westminster terror attack has told an inquest he searched frantically for her after she was hit by the car. Khalid Masood ran down and killed four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer to death. Romanian Andreea Cristea was visiting London with her boyfriend when Masood's car knocked her into the Thames. She died from her injuries two weeks later. Andrei Burnaz said he ran all ""over the bridge"" looking for Ms Cristea. He told the inquest, sitting at the Old Bailey, that he called her mobile and it rang - which he thought was a positive sign - but then found both it and her glasses ""in a pool of blood"". Mr Burnaz added that after trying to get help from officers in his search he ""thought maybe it would be better to jump in the river to search for her, but I didn't"". Those killed in the attack on 22 March last year were Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Ms Cristea, 31. Masood was shot dead at the scene by armed police officers. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Westminster inquest: Day three Mr Burnaz wiped away tears as CCTV footage of their final moments together were shown to the court. Speaking on the fourth day of the inquest, he told the hearing it had been ""very busy, very crowded on both sides of the bridge"", adding: ""We stopped a little bit to take some pictures."" He said: ""Very suddenly I heard some crashing and some noises in front of me. ""After that, loud banging. I heard something hit something and after that at the same time people were screaming."" He said he saw the car coming towards them and ""it was very quick."" ""The left part of the car was on the pavement and the right part was on the road,"" he added. The witness told the inquest he then felt a ""burning sensation"" on one leg. ""After the vehicle passed I looked on the left side of me to search for Andreea, but I couldn't see her,"" he continued. ""I started searching for Andreea. I started running over the bridge."" Mr Burnaz said at one point he started running towards Masood's car to see if she had become stuck under it. He said: ""I saw plenty police officers armed with machine guns. ""I run and tried to explain to him what happened and tried to explain that I could not find my girlfriend. He only started yelling: 'Go back, go back, clear the area'."" Ms Cristea died from her injuries two weeks after the attack He called Ms Cristea's sister to tell her what had happened, the court heard. He described going to the other side of the bridge where he told a female police officer that his partner was ""in the water right now"". The witness told the court he looked over both sides of the bridge but was unable to see Ms Cristea. When he explained the situation to another officer, who told colleagues over a police radio, he said: ""That was the first time that somebody took action about this."" Mr Burnaz said he was later taken to hospital to be treated himself and later still taken to see Ms Cristea in another hospital. Ms Cristea took this photo on Westminster Bridge just before the attack Witness Michael Brown had been driving his white van across the bridge when he saw Masood's Hyundai ""hitting people as it drove along the pavement"". He told the Old Bailey he saw Ms Cristea go ""10ft in the air"" before ""she came down straight into the Thames"". The witness described doing a ""U-turn"" and parking his van before looking into the river and calling 999 to raise the alarm. At first he could not spot Ms Cristea, but then saw her ""floating in the Thames face down"". Mr Brown said he then tried to assist others on the bridge. He described the scene as ""carnage"". When the barrister representing Ms Cristea's family thanked him for his efforts that day, Mr Brown began weeping. The witness also described ""screaming just trying to get attention"" of those on a boat below, which he did. He said he even considered jumping into the water, but changed his mind because he cannot swim. The inquest heard that vital minutes were lost in trying to rescue Ms Cristea from the river. Despite an emergency distress signal, along with shouts from Mr Brown and passengers on the City Cruises tourist clipper, the boat's first mate Danny Cooper initially thought Ms Cristea's body was ""garbage"". Gareth Patterson QC, representing Ms Cristea's family, said she had been face down in the river for two minutes when she was first secured, but remained immersed for five minutes before the London Fire Brigade's Fire Flash boat arrived and pulled her aboard. Mr Cooper said he thought Ms Cristea was dead and had been in the water ""for a long time"" and was worried the presumed body would ""fall apart"" if pulled aboard. ""It wouldn't have been nice for anyone involved,"" he said. ""There were children sitting downstairs."" Mr Patterson asked: ""Mr Cooper, there was nothing stopping her being lifted by a matter of inches to see if she was alive, to lift her face out of the water?"" ""I don't know,"" Mr Cooper replied. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Witness Joanne Fant, an ambulance technician involved in helping Ms Cristea, said the victim ""did actually squeeze my hand"" after she had been taken ashore. Witness Dr Samy Sadek oversaw Ms Cristea's care at the Royal London Hospital after the attack. Mr Patterson asked if she might ""have survived"" if rescued from the water after two minutes when first seen by the pleasure boat - rather than the more than five minutes it took before the fire service boat recovered her. ""I have absolutely no way of knowing,"" Dr Sadek said. Ms Cristea's family in Bucharest watched the proceedings via video link. The inquest is set to last about five weeks. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held once the hearing into his victims' deaths has concluded. The coroner is expected to examine Masood's background, police records, and look into the fact that he briefly featured in MI5 investigations in 2009 and 2010. The absence of armed officers at the scene will also be examined.

US hurricane could 'kill a lot of people',"This video can not be played Why do people ignore hurricane warnings? Hurricane Florence, which is nearing the US East Coast, could kill ""a lot of people"", officials warn. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) says storm surges could bring catastrophic flooding to inland areas. Nearly 1.7m people along the coastlines of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia have been ordered to evacuate. Strong winds and heavy rains have already begun lashing North Carolina's coastline, leading to some early flooding. Some 11,000 power outages had already been reported in the state. Reuters news agency reports. Latest updates Florence was 155 miles (250km) east of Myrtle Beach in South Carolina at 17:00 EDT (21:00 GMT), and is projected to make landfall on Friday at 08:00 local time. It was downgraded to a category two storm with 105mph (165km/h) winds, and the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it does not expect much change in the strength before the eye of Florence makes landfall. Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? Your guide to Hurricane Florence's risks Fema administrator Brock Long told Thursday morning's news conference that while Florence's wind speed had dipped, its wind field had expanded and total rainfall predictions were unchanged. Floodwaters may rise up to 13ft (4m) as rivers see their flows ""reversed"", meteorologists have warned. ""So this is a very dangerous storm,"" said Mr Long. ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people unfortunately and that's what we're about to see."" ""Your time is running out,"" he warned those who had not yet heeded the warning to evacuate. ""The ocean is going to start rising."" ""Your time to get out of those areas in storm surge inundation is coming to a close. I cannot emphasise that enough."" He said that people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. This video can not be played People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane A guide to the world's deadliest storms Prisons in hurricane's path not evacuated The latest weather predictions show the storm slowing to a near standstill as it pummels the coast with ""copious amounts of rain"" from Thursday night to Saturday, said Mr Long. Parts of the Carolina coast are expecting 20-30 (50-75cm) inches of rain, with isolated regions seeing up to 40in of downpour. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is imposing a 12-hour curfew from 19:00 local time on Thursday. Trump rejects Puerto Rico storm death toll Petrol stations in the area are reporting shortages and energy companies predict that one to three million homes and businesses may lose power. Over 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, as most of the coastal region's airports are closed to ride out the storm. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

Swipe to progress  North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned people: ""Today the threat becomes a reality."" Emergency workers are arriving from other parts of the US to aid in rescues. The Coast Guard has shallow-water response boats ready to help trapped residents. The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Are you in the area? How are you preparing for the hurricane?

"No abortion clinic buffers, says Javid","This video can not be played Anti-abortion campaigners protest outside London clinic in 2018 Calls for buffer zones to be introduced outside abortion clinics to stop patients being harassed have been rejected by Home Secretary Sajid Javid. He said such protest-free areas around clinics in England and Wales ""would not be a proportionate response"". A Home Office review found cases of harassment and damaging behaviour but they were ""not the norm"", he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the decision was a ""shocking failure to protect women"" and should be reversed. In a written statement, Mr Javid said the review had gathered evidence that showed protesters' behaviour had left patients distressed and caused some to rebook their appointments and not to follow medical advice. He said that in some cases, protesters handed out model foetuses, displayed graphic images, followed people, blocked their paths and even assaulted them. However, he added that the review showed these activities were ""not the norm"" and most anti-abortion activities were ""more passive"", such as praying, displaying banners and handing out leaflets. 'I felt like a criminal for having an abortion' 'That's where the babies are suffering' In 2017, 363 hospitals and clinics in England and Wales carried out abortions - 36 of which experienced anti-abortion demonstrations, according to the review. Mr Javid said: ""Having considered the evidence of the review, I have therefore reached the conclusion that introducing national buffer zones would not be a proportionate response, considering the experiences of the majority of hospitals and clinics, and considering that the majority of activities are more passive in nature."" He went on to say that there was already legislation - such asthe Public Order Act 1986,external- in place that restricted protest activities which caused harm to others. Defending the decision, Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told the Commons the government would continue with the current scheme of enabling councils to apply for Public Space Protection Orders. In April, the west London council of Ealing took matters into their own hands, imposing a 100m protest-free ""buffer zone"" outside a Marie Stopes clinic. But the constituency MP, Labour's Rupa Huq, said it was a ""national problem that requires a national solution"". She told the Commons the conclusions were ""a bit disappointing"". ""It seems to be saying there has to be a disproportionate number of women affected before any action takes place,"" she added. Speaking later to the BBC, she said shoving the burden onto already cash-strapped local authorities was not the best solution, and would leave women running ""a gauntlet of a barrage of abuse just to have their NHS procedure done"". This video can not be played Newsnight: Should there be 'buffer zones' around abortion clinics in Britain? Mr Javid's predecessor, Amber Rudd, who launched the review last year, has previously said it was ""unacceptable"" that anyone should feel intimidated at a clinic. However, Ms Rudd, who resigned as home secretary in April, told the Commons that now that she could ""travel slightly less conspicuously"", she had visited the Ealing clinic. She told MPs there was ""no harassment continuing which, I believe, continues to reflect what has been concluded"" in the government's announcement. Clare Murphy, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which provides abortion services in the UK, said the charity would seek to work with councils to roll out the Ealing ""model"" across the country to protect women and clinic staff from protesters. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said Public Spaces Protection Orders could be useful but had not been designed for this purpose. It said new legislation would make sure the approach towards protests was ""consistent and effective"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mr Javid had ""given the green light for women to be harassed and abused for exercising their right to choose. ""This is a disgusting failure to uphold women's rights over their own bodies. Sajid Javid must urgently reconsider,"" the Labour MP said. And her party colleague, Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the home affairs select committee, said: ""The whole point of having this review was because existing powers are not working or are proving cumbersome and difficult for councils or the police to use."" Elizabeth Howard, of Be Here For Me - a campaign group which opposed the ban on buffer zones - welcomed Mr Javid's ""common sense"" decision which would mean ""women could continue to be offered much needed help and support"". Antonia Tully, of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, said they were ""delighted"" by the decision. ""This is a massive victory for common sense, democracy and above all for the hundreds of vulnerable women who are saved from the horror of abortion at the very gates of the abortion clinic.""

Cancer waiting times 'at worst level ever',"The statistics cover waits for tests such as MRI scans The key cancer target has been missed by a record margin in England, figures show. Patients who are given an urgent referral by their GP are meant to start treatment within 62 days. But in July, 78.2% were seen in that timeframe, the worst performance since records began in October 2009. It means more than 3,000 people waited longer than two months for treatment to begin. The target for the NHS is 85%, which was last hit in December 2015. The target is also being missed elsewhere in the UK. NHS England said there were rising numbers of cancer cases being referred - over the past years there has been a 5% increase alone. The past three months in particular have seen a significant increase in total cases. It means in the past year while 125,000 were seen within the target time, 28,000 patients have waited longer than two months, nearly 11,000 of whom waited over three. Dr Fran Woodard, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said the figures were ""disappointing"" and were ""indicative of the immense pressure on the NHS"". It comes as the key targets for A&E and planned operations also continue to be missed. The number of people in England waiting more than 18 weeks for non-urgent operations is actually at the highest level in a decade. Nearly 504,000 were waiting more than the 18-week target time. The total on the waiting list for routine surgery at 4.12 million was the highest since August 2007.

No-deal Brexit 'won't hike phone charges',"This video can not be played Dominic Raab says the cabinet has agreed a plan to ''manage, mitigate or avoid the risks of a no-deal scenario"" Britons visiting the EU could be hit with mobile phone roaming charges in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government would try to force firms to limit charges but he could not give a ""cast iron guarantee"" on the issue. The EU rule capping what mobile phone operators could charge each other will stop applying to the UK after Brexit. Meanwhile, the Bank of England governor told the cabinet house prices could drop 35% in three years without a deal. Mark Carney presented cabinet ministers with a range of scenarios under which prices would fall if the UK and EU do not reach a deal. A cabinet source confirmed that he said the Bank of England was prepared for a worst-case scenario where house prices could go down by as much as 35% over three years. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was trying to give the ""reassurance that consumers need"" on the issue of mobile phone roaming charges but admitted that European operators could pass on charges. Brexit papers: What no-deal could mean Rory Cellan-Jones: EU network charges could revive roaming fees John Lewis boss rejects Raab Brexit jibe He said: ""No, I can't give a cast-iron guarantee. What I can say is that the government would legislate to limit the ability of roaming charges to be imposed on customers."" The government haspublished its latest contingency plans,externalin the event of a no-deal Brexit. On mobile phone charges, the document says that ""in the unlikely event"" of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, consumers should ""check the roaming policies of your mobile operator before you go abroad"". The main points include: UK driversmay have to get an international permitif they want to drive in European countries Anyone travelling to the EU should make sure they have at least six months left on their passport, although that will not apply to travel in Ireland People applying for a new passport after Brexit will continue to get burgundy passports for a while - although they will not say ""European Union"" on the front cover Blue passports will start being issued from late 2019 Many products tested in the UK after Brexit will no longer be able to be sold on the EU market without being re-tested by an EU recognised body to meet minimum safety standards This does not cover automotive, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemicals or medical devices Mr Raab told Laura Kuenssberg Cabinet ministers earlier spent three hours examining ""all the plans across government to make sure we can manage, mitigate or avoid the risk of a no-deal scenario"". He also said there must be a ""shift across the board in the EU's approach"" on the issue of Northern Ireland: ""They will have to meet us halfway... if they meet the ambition, the pragmatism we've shown through our White Paper proposals then I'm confident we can get a good deal for this country, but also for the EU."" Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The only reason the government is talking about no-deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the prime minister from negotiating a good deal. ""With the clock ticking, ministers should drop the irresponsible rhetoric and start putting jobs and the economy first."" Extra charges for people using their phones in another EU country were scrapped in June 2017. But the EU regulation banning them will not automatically be part of UK law after Brexit on 29 March next year. In theory this means UK mobile operators, if they want to, could reintroduce the charges that could make it expensive to use a mobile phone in another EU country. However,the government said it would legislate to make operators set a cap of Â£45 a month on data usage while abroad,external- in line with the current EU limit of â¬50. Mr Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme two mobile operators, Vodafone and Three, had publicly agreed not to bring back roaming charges for British citizens. The government was aiming to get a Brexit deal with Brussels by mid-November at the latest but was stepping up contingency planning in case that did not happen, he added. He said one of the consequences of a ""no deal"" Brexit ""is that obviously we wouldn't pay out the money that has been agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement"". The UK would ""recognise our strict legal obligations"" but that the amount paid would be ""significantly, substantially lower"" than the Â£39bn agreed with the EU. Analysis by BBC Political Correspondent Laura Kuenssberg Ministers believe the chances of there being no agreement are now relatively small. They are hopeful that next week EU leaders will give helpful hints at a special meeting in Salzburg. Yet there is a long way to go until Dominic Raab, or anyone in government, can be sure. And don't doubt that many Tory MPs are adamant they simply won't vote for the kind of proposal Theresa May has put on the table. Read Laura's full blog A senior EU diplomatic source told BBC News Mr Raab's divorce bill comments were ""a statement of the obvious"" as the financial settlement was part of the withdrawal agreement. ""The [EU27] will keep our heads cool as we always do,"" he added. Business leaders have repeatedly warned about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal, with theCBI saying the UK would face tariffs on 90%of its EU exports and a number of new regulatory hurdles. UK consumers could find going on holiday and making card payments for EU products more expensive because Britain would no longer be part of the EU's payments process. CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said the government's latest planning papers ""make clear firms would be hit with a sledgehammer in the event of no-deal"". ""They also illustrate the extent of the disruption consumers can expect if ideology wins over evidence."" There are also concerns about delays at the UK border. The Road Haulage Association has warned it will take ""an average of about 45 minutes to process one truck on both sides of the channel"" if customs checks are put in place. ""If that happens then the queues of HGVs in Kent will make the jams seen in the summer of 2015 appear as little more than waiting for the traffic lights to change,"" it adds. Lorries on the M20 during 2015's 'operation stack' Mr Raab said there was a risk of disruption at the border if the EU did not respond ""with the collaborative spirit"" he said the UK ""would want to show"". The UK government was planning contra-flow systems on the M20 and was talking to EU member states about ""mitigating"" potential disruption. And he took a swipe at businesses,such as John Lewis, saying: ""I think it's probably rather easy at this moment in time for any business that isn't doing rather well to point to Brexit."" Please upgrade your browser Last month the government published 24 no-deal documents covering industries including medicine, finance and farming. There were warnings of extra paperwork at borders and extra credit card charges for Britons visiting the EU. More no-deal publications are expected in the coming weeks. Labour MP Ian Murray, a member of the campaign for another referendum, said: ""Nobody voted to make Britain poorer, to diminish our national influence or to ruin their holidays. ""The government has no mandate for any of this and it's too big an issue to be left to a Brexit elite in Westminster. That is why we must have a people's vote on the final Brexit deal.""

Dead rat in soup costs restaurant $190m,"The dead rat was fished out a pot of boiling broth A popular Chinese restaurant chain has lost around $190m (Â£145m) in market value after a pregnant woman found a dead rat in her soup. Hotpot restaurant Xiabu Xiabu's stock hit its lowest level in almost a year, after photos of the dead rat being fished out of the broth with a pair of chopsticks quickly spread online. The outlet in Shandong province has now been temporarily suspended. The outlet reportedly offered her 5,000 yuan (Â£559, $729) as compensation. According to local news outlet Kankan News who spoke to her husband - identified as Mr Ma - he declined the offer, as he wanted his wife to undergo a full body check-up before deciding on a compensation amount. Crayfish removes claw to escape hotpot China uncovers fake jellyfish 'scam' Hong Kong's hot pot obsession The pregnant woman who had been out for hotpot with her family on 6 September, found the dead rat in her meal after she had already taken a few bites from the dish. Mr Ma also alleged that one of the staff had suggested his wife get an abortion if she was worried about the baby's health, and offered him 20,000 yuan for the procedure. Photos of the boiled rat quickly spread on Chinese social media site Weibo, where users reacted with anger and disgust. The dead rat was lifted out and put on a plate ""I feel like vomiting. I'm never going to eat hotpot outside again,"" said one user. On 11 September, the company's share price hit its lowest level since October last year. As of Wednesday, the hotpot restaurant's market value is slowly recovering. ""Xiabu Xiabu has always been one of my favourite restaurants, I thought they were quite clean as well... I can't believe this,"" another commented. ""If something happens to her baby how are they going to compensate her? Is a life worth only 20,000 yuan?"" one asked. Customers enjoying hotpot, a common meal in China The restaurant initially put out a statement on Saturday saying that it had ""ruled out"" the possibility that a lack of hygiene had caused the rat to end up in the hotpot, but later deleted it. Authorities in Weifang city, the restaurant branch where the rat was found, said they would conduct investigations into Xiabu Xiabu's restaurant. Hotpot is a common meal in China and across other parts of Asia. A simmering pot of hot soup is placed at a dining table and various vegetables and raw meats are then placed in the pot to cook.

Actor backs dwarf wrestling events,"James Lusted carried the Olympic flame through his home town as part of the torch relay for London 2012 An actor with dwarfism has backed the organisers of a controversial wrestling event involving people with the condition. James Lusted, from Colwyn Bay, says the shows in Cardiff and Swansea should go ahead next month. He was responding to calls from a charity for venues to boycott Extreme Dwarfanators Wrestling. Venues in Leicester and Ferndown, near Bournemouth, have already cancelled performances. The Restricted Growth Association (RGA) compared the event to a ""freak show"" that ridicules people with dwarfism. The Extreme Dwarfanators Wrestling event was due to take place in Leicester in October However, Mr Lusted, a TV presenter, motivational speaker and county councillor, says those involved in the event deserve the opportunity to perform. ""If they want to wrestle then let them crack on. If you don't agree with it don't go,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""I'm really frustrated the shows have been cancelled. ""That's how they've chosen to live, that's how they've chosen to support their families, pay their bills. Why don't we just encourage and support them in that. ""These professional entertainers, they're well trained and fit but they're actually going to lose finances now. I feel sorry for them."" Charity wants dwarf wrestling cancelled Dwarf wrestling 'freak show' cancelled Organisers say the ""family"" show is about promoting equality. However Gillian Martin, of RGA, said the event was ""deeply offensive"" and urged venues to ""move into the 21st Century"" by cancelling the event. ""They are about making people laugh at the Victorian spectacle of people with dwarfism fighting each other,"" she added. Wrestlers said they were ""deeply upset"" that shows had been cancelled Standing at 3ft 7in tall, Mr Lusted was born with Diastrophic Dyslasia - a rare genetic condition that causes dwarfism - despite his parents both being of average height. He has twice represented Great Britain in the World Dwarf Games and has been the UK champion at Class One badminton for nine years. Hecarried the Olympic torchwhen it travelled through Wales in 2012. Mr Lusted presented a programme on the Welsh-language channel S4C 'I fell in love with a man with dwarfism' ""I can understand that some people don't like this kind of thing,"" he said. ""But those involved are human beings so let's support them and not discourage them by campaigning to cancel their shows. ""There are more important things for the charity RGA to be campaigning about. I'd be campaigning for stuff like dropped kerbs and problems getting life insurance."" Tickets remain on sale for the show at Coyote Ugly Saloons in Cardiff, on 18 October, and Swansea on 21 October.

Tougher sentences for 999 staff attacks,"This video can not be played Footage has shown attacks on emergency staff Maximum prison terms for people found guilty of common assault against emergency workers are to double from six months to a year. Firefighters, police officers, prison officers and NHS staff are among those covered by the new law. Justice Minister Rory Stewart said staff deserve greater protection. The Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Bill receives Royal Assent later and comes into force in November. Judges will also have to consider tougher sentences for more serious offences such as GBH and sexual assault, if the victim is an emergency worker. The Ministry of Justice said there had been more than 26,000 assaults on police officers in the past year and 17,000 assaults on NHS staff. There has also been an increase in assaults on prison officers and firefighters, it said. Police called 'every day' to NHS violence Emergency staff assaulted '17 times a day' Labour MP Chris Bryant, who presentedthe private members' bill,external, said the ""growing tide of attacks"" on emergency staff was a ""national scandal"". ""All too often attackers get away with little more than a slap on the wrist,"" he said. ""I hope this new law will help put a stop to that attitude."" This video can not be played Chris Bryant: ""It's amazing those staff still go the extra mile for the British public"" Mr Bryant, the MP for Rhondda, has said there are 20 assaults on emergency staff in Wales every day. Jane Carroll, a senior Royal College of Nursing officer, told the BBC that she was attacked while out on a home visit. ""He was circling me and shouting at me and as I opened the door two hands came very hard on my back. I fell over and took the skin off my knees,"" she said. ""I sat in my car and cried for a little while but realised I couldn't stay there because I felt vulnerable."" ""When you go into your shift you don't expect to have to deal with the police,"" she added. ""It's not appropriate to have that disruption, but to do what you have to do, sometimes you have to call on them."" This video can not be played Jane Carroll says police are ""disruptive but needed"" in hospital ""This is not just about doing the right thing by our crews and making sure that people treat our crews with respect, this also impacts on our ability to get to the next patient,"" Garrett Emmerson, from the London Ambulance Service, told the BBC. ""And with the service as busy as it is today, over 5,000 calls a day, then that has a real tangible effect on our ability to treat and care for patients across London."" Mr Stewart said: ""Assaulting prison officers or any emergency worker is not just an isolated attack, it represents violence against the public as a whole."" Kim Sunley, national officer at the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""Physical assaults remain a fact of life for many healthcare workers, from A&E to community services. ""This bill is the first step towards changing that for good."" Professor Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer for England, said: ""We have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to deliberate threats, abuse or violence made to any NHS staff. ""This behaviour from patients or members of the public will never be tolerated and should rightly be reported to the police."" Correction 18 September 2018: This story was updated to make clear that people assisting emergency workers are not covered by the legislation. 999 attack crackdown law passes hurdle Crackdown law for 999 staff attackers Police called 'every day' to NHS violence Emergency staff assaulted '17 times a day' Emergency worker attacks law gets backing New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

US hurricane a looming 'disaster',"This video can not be played Why do people ignore hurricane warnings? Hurricane Florence has been downgraded to a category two storm as it approaches the US but officials still warn of a ""disaster at the doorstep"". Florence's winds may have dropped to 110mph (175km/h) but its slow-moving nature could mean it lingers for days, bringing catastrophic flooding. Some 10 million people are now under some form of storm watch. Florence may now be heading further south, and Georgia is the latest state to declare an emergency. It joins North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Washington DC. As of 05:00 Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday (09:00 GMT), Florence was 205 miles (330km) south-east of Wilmington in North Carolina, the latestNational Hurricane Centre advisory says.,external Forecasters have adjusted the predicted path of Florence. It is now expected to make landfall a little further south, on the Carolinas border on Thursday. Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? Your guide to Hurricane Florence's risks A guide to the world's deadliest storms The hurricane's wind speeds have fallen from a category 3 level of 111-129 mph to a category 2 level of 96-110 mph. However, they are not expected to weaken further and the forward speed of the hurricane is also dropping, meaning it could linger near the coastline through to Saturday. This means that torrential rainfall could last for significant periods and cause catastrophic flooding, including in inland areas such as Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said:  ""The time to prepare is almost over, Disaster is at the doorstep and it's coming in."" This video can not be played People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane Up to 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate across South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Some 5.25 million people are under hurricane warning or watch, and another 4.9 million people are under storm warning or watch, Associated Press reported. The biggest danger to life could be from storm surges, which are still predicted to be as high as 13ft (4m) between Cape Fear and Cape Lookout in North Carolina, areas that could also see up to 40in (101cm) of rain. There will be hurricane-force winds up to 80 miles from the centre of the storm, meteorologists say. President Donald Trump issued a video message saying: ""This is going to be one of the biggest ones to ever hit our country... Protection of life is the absolute highest priority."" A National Weather Service forecaster said: ""This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast. ""And that's saying a lot given the impacts we've seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd and Matthew. ""I can't emphasise enough the potential for unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge and inland flooding with this storm."" Jeff Byard, of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said: ""This is going to be a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast."" Florence could wreak more than $170bn (Â£130bn) of havoc and damage nearly 759,000 homes and businesses, says analytics firm CoreLogic. Energy companies warned Florence could knock out power in some areas for weeks Waves 83ft (25m) tall were recorded at sea on Wednesday morning. European astronaut Alexander Gerst shared images of Florence's eye wall from space, calling the storm a ""no-kidding nightmare"". Allow Twitter content?

A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds.

Swipe to progress  The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Hurricane Florence threatens east coast US.

Suspects interview: Key excerpts,"Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov say they were tourists visiting the English town of Salisbury The two men named as suspects in the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal in the UK - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - gave a surprise interview to RT, Russia's state-run international broadcaster. They claimed they were merely tourists visiting the English town of Salisbury at the time the poisoning happened. Here are some key excerpts from their interview. ""Our friends had been suggesting for a long time that we visit this wonderful town [Salisbury],"" Mr Petrov said. ""It's a tourist town - there's a famous cathedral there. Salisbury cathedral,"" Mr Boshirov said. ""It's famous for its 123-metre spire, it's famous for its clock - the first clock to be invented in the world, and it's still going."" Asked if they had gone to Salisbury to look at the clock Mr Petrov said: ""No, no - our plan from the outset was to arrive in London and chill out, basically. It wasn't a business trip. We planned to spend some time in London and travel to Salisbury - of course that was only intended to be a day-trip."" ""We arrived in England on 2 March, then went to the railway station to see the timetable, to see where we could go,"" Mr Petrov said. The pair planned to spend just a day in Salisbury, he said, because ""that's enough - there's no more to do there after one day"". ""We arrived in Salisbury on 3 March and tried to walk through the town, but as it was blocked up with snow we could only spend half an hour there,""Â Mr Petrov said. ""Of course, we went there to see Stonehenge, Old Sarum, but we couldn't do it because there was muddy slush everywhere. The town was covered with this slush. We got soaked, went back to the station and took the next train back [to London]."" The pair were seen in Salisbury on 4 March, a day after visiting for ""reconnaissance"", UK investigators say ""We drank hot coffee because we were just soaked. The longest we spent there on the 3rd was one hour,"" Mr Boshirov added. Mr Petrov said ""we had the aim of visiting Old Sarum [an Iron Age settlement] and the cathedral and decided to finish all that on the 4th"". When asked if they saw those sights he said, ""on the 4th, yes. We saw them, but again at lunchtime it started snowing heavily, so we left earlier than planned"". ""Maybe we did [approach] Skripal's house, but we don't know where is it located,"" Mr Boshirov said. WhenÂ the interviewer asked them whether they had Novichok or any poison with them, the men emphatically said no. What happened to the Skripals? The new Russian disinformation game Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far What is the GRU? She then asked whether they had the Nina Ricci perfume bottle which UK investigators say contained the substance. ""For normal blokes, to be carrying women's perfume with us, isn't that silly? The customs are checking everything, they would have questions as to why men have women's perfume in their luggage. We didn't have it,""Â Mr Boshirov said. The interviewer asked them why they went everywhere together and shared a hotel room. ""It's normal to arrive somewhere and share a twin-bed room. You save money. It's more fun to be together, simpler,"" Mr Boshirov said. Both men sounded distressed as they spoke about how their lives had changed since they were named in the UK as Russian intelligence agents who attempted to poison the Skripals. ""When your life [is] turned upside down, you don't know what to do and where to go. We're afraid to go out, we fear for ourselves, for our lives and the lives of our loved ones,""Â Mr Boshirov said.Â ""We just want to be left alone, we're tired,"" he said. Asked whether they had recently been to any European state, the two said they had. ""Sureâ¦ In Switzerland, we were there a couple of timesâ¦ We spent New Year in Switzerland."" The pair said they had been in Europe to do business related to sports nutrition. ""We examine the market, see if there is something new - some biologically active additives, amino acids, vitamins, microelements. We pick up the most necessary things, come here and decide how to bring the new products from that market here.""

Gordon Brown warns about next crisis,"This video can not be played Gordon Brown says we are sleepwalking into another financial crisis The world is not ready to deal with another financial crisis, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told the BBC. A breakdown in international co-operation means nations would be unable to act in a concerted way to tackle future threats - which are many. ""I feel we're sleepwalking into the next crisis"", said Mr Brown, speaking on the 10th anniversary of the start of the previous crisis. He added that some of the bankers involved should have gone to jail. Mr Brown, speaking from his living room, said: ""This is a leaderless world and I think when the next crisis comes, and there will be a future crisis, we'll find that we neither have the fiscal or monetary room for manoeuvre or the willingness to take that action. ""But perhaps most worrying of all, we will not have the international co-operation necessary to get us out of a worldwide crisis."" In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Wall Street banking giant Lehman Brothers, the UK government was one of the first to press the case for using public money to recapitalise failing banks and did exactly that - pumping taxpayer funds into Lloyds, HBOS and RBS. Mr Brown, UK prime minister as the crisis unfolded, said that it was possible to counteract the evaporation of trust in the markets by co-ordinated action between governments and regulators that trusted each other. ""But now with the trade wars, the disagreements over climate change, the nuclear deals that have fallen apart there is no spirit of co-operation - there is division and protectionism and I fear a new crisis would see nations trying to shift the blame to each other."" Bob Diamond defends risk-taking banks Hammond: Financial crisis 'shock' continues Carney warns against complacency He acknowledged that the use of public money to bail out high earning bankers was a difficult pill for the public to swallow and although he insists it was necessary, he says that he is frustrated that harsher penalties weren't dished out to some of the bankers involved. ""I'll be honest with you. Some of these bankers should have gone to jail and until we have proper laws that can find the guilty and show there are clear penalties, then people will think the bankers have got away with it and will go back to doing the same thing again."" What blame does he bear himself? Former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn (Lord) King has been critical of the way his government designed the regulatory regime - moving bank supervision away from the central bank to the Financial Services Authority. Mr Brown acknowledges that it didn't work perfectly, but argues that the system was designed to look at isolated outbreaks of bank distress - not a contagion which consumed the entire global financial system. No national warning system, he says, was equipped to see the full picture and no individual country could have tackled the meltdown. A global problem needs global co-operation. Without that - and with most of the tools available already used (rock bottom interest rates, trillions pumped into the system through quantitative easing) - Mr Brown paints a grim picture of our ability to face the next crisis.

Salisbury cathedral,"" Mr Boshirov said. ""It's famous for its 123-metre spire, it's famous for its clock - the first clock to be invented in the world, and it's still going."" Asked if they had gone to Salisbury to look at the clock Mr Petrov said: ""No, no - our plan from the outset was to arrive in London and chill out, basically. It wasn't a business trip. We planned to spend some time in London and travel to Salisbury - of course that was only intended to be a day-trip."" ""We arrived in England on 2 March, then went to the railway station to see the timetable, to see where we could go,"" Mr Petrov said. The pair planned to spend just a day in Salisbury, he said, because ""that's enough - there's no more to do there after one day"". ""We arrived in Salisbury on 3 March and tried to walk through the town, but as it was blocked up with snow we could only spend half an hour there,""Â Mr Petrov said. ""Of course, we went there to see Stonehenge, Old Sarum, but we couldn't do it because there was muddy slush everywhere. The town was covered with this slush. We got soaked, went back to the station and took the next train back [to London]."" The pair were seen in Salisbury on 4 March, a day after visiting for ""reconnaissance"", UK investigators say ""We drank hot coffee because we were just soaked. The longest we spent there on the 3rd was one hour,"" Mr Boshirov added. Mr Petrov said ""we had the aim of visiting Old Sarum [an Iron Age settlement] and the cathedral and decided to finish all that on the 4th"". When asked if they saw those sights he said, ""on the 4th, yes. We saw them, but again at lunchtime it started snowing heavily, so we left earlier than planned"". ""Maybe we did [approach] Skripal's house, but we don't know where is it located,"" Mr Boshirov said. WhenÂ the interviewer asked them whether they had Novichok or any poison with them, the men emphatically said no. What happened to the Skripals? The new Russian disinformation game Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far What is the GRU? She then asked whether they had the Nina Ricci perfume bottle which UK investigators say contained the substance. ""For normal blokes, to be carrying women's perfume with us, isn't that silly? The customs are checking everything, they would have questions as to why men have women's perfume in their luggage. We didn't have it,""Â Mr Boshirov said. The interviewer asked them why they went everywhere together and shared a hotel room. ""It's normal to arrive somewhere and share a twin-bed room. You save money. It's more fun to be together, simpler,"" Mr Boshirov said. Both men sounded distressed as they spoke about how their lives had changed since they were named in the UK as Russian intelligence agents who attempted to poison the Skripals. ""When your life [is] turned upside down, you don't know what to do and where to go. We're afraid to go out, we fear for ourselves, for our lives and the lives of our loved ones,""Â Mr Boshirov said.Â ""We just want to be left alone, we're tired,"" he said. Asked whether they had recently been to any European state, the two said they had. ""Sureâ¦ In Switzerland, we were there a couple of timesâ¦ We spent New Year in Switzerland."" The pair said they had been in Europe to do business related to sports nutrition. ""We examine the market, see if there is something new - some biologically active additives, amino acids, vitamins, microelements. We pick up the most necessary things, come here and decide how to bring the new products from that market here.""

Abuser 'should have been caught decades ago',"This video can not be played 'He abused me for years and got away with it' A woman who was raped by a paedophile has waived her right to anonymity to say he should have been brought to justice when she first reported him to police 21 years ago. Former soldier David Scott, 60, wasjailed for 12 years in May for abusing ""generations of girls"" in Edinburgh. Laura Lunn, 30, believes he could have been stopped in 1997 when she reported her abuse to police. Police Scotland said there was ""lack of corroboration"" to prosecute him then. They said Scott was ""fully investigated"" at the time but that no charges were able to be brought. Laura was first targeted by family friend Scott at the age of seven. She describes him as ""an absolute monster"" and ""evil."" Over the following three years, he repeatedly raped and abused her - and threatened to kill her mother if she ever told anyone. When Laura was 10, the abuse came to light after she wrote a letter to her mum telling her that she was unhappy. At the time, numerous other girls had been targeted, but they were only spoken to by police when two new victims came forward last year. David Scott was jailed for 12 years in May this year Scott was jailed at the High Court in Glasgow for attacks on six girls, including Laura, over a 45-year period starting in 1970. Laura believes the police - along with Edinburgh City Council social workers and the Crown Office - betrayed her and failed to protect later victims. She was removed from her family and placed in foster care and she says, as a 10-year-old girl, it felt like she was being ""punished"" after reporting her ordeal. She stopped attending school at the age of 14 and has attempted to take her own life. She has decided to go public because she is angry at the authorities' alleged failings and believes that other victims have yet to come forward. Laura, from Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland: ""I spoke out when I was 10, but was never believed and he continued to rape other kids and get away with it. ""I can't believe he got away with it for as long as he did and I do believe that the only reason he did was because the police didn't do their job. ""I was terrified because he'd always threatened to kill my mum. For me, coming forward to speak to my mum was massive because I had the fear that he was going to kill her."" David Scott when he was younger She said that rather than take her to a police station or ""to somewhere where children that have been abused should be taken, somewhere safer"" she was interviewed by a police officer and social worker in her mum's flat. ""It wasn't right. It didn't feel right, especially because I was terrified that I'd even said all this."" She described giving her statement as ""really hard"" and said a relative who was with her walked out because it was so upsetting hearing what she had been through. The abuse had not taken place within her family or her home but Laura was later placed in care. She said: ""Why did I just get put into foster care? Why did I get dragged away and taken from my family? Why did I get punished for telling the truth? ""If they'd investigated it back then when I'd spoken out, I believe that he would have been caught, he definitely would have been caught. Laura said Scott ""took my childhood away from me"" ""There was too much evidence but they just swept it under the carpet, swept me under the carpet. ""It was not just the police. You've got the police, the Crown Office, social work, everything. I was let down by every single one of them. ""They should have investigated it further and they would have found other people. They had a duty of care."" Laura believes that if the authorities had ""done their job properly, at least two of the six victims would never have been abused"". She added: ""Why did I not get believed? Why did you not listen to me? Why did you not investigate it when all this is here and that was all there back then? ""I tried to kill myself that many times because I couldn't cope with it."" Scott served four years with the Royal Scots but left at the age of 20, allegedly for getting a 14-year-old pregnant. The Army said that data protection laws prevented them from disclosing information about Scott's discharge and that their records may not even contain the reasons. A spokeswoman said: ""Regards the details of his discharge, we are unable to provide these under data protection legislation."" By the time Laura reported her abuse in 1997, Scott had already sexually abused at least two other girls and went on to target others. While awaiting trial, Scott stayed in a centre for military veterans in Edinburgh. When Laura reported him for alleged breach of bail by contacting her, she said the police failed again. ""I got a friend request from David Scott on Facebook. I couldn't breathe, I was like 'oh my God' and I phoned the police right away,"" she said. ""The police came up, gave me a wee bit of paper and said things were a bit different these days. ""They were just fobbing me off, every time I phoned. I didn't understand. Laura says she has been through ""21 years of hell"" ""He raped me all those years ago, he's now been caught for it, he's living 11 minutes away from me, opposite a primary school, he's contacted me but you're giving me nothing to make me feel protected. Yet again, all over again."" After admitting 10 charges, judge Lady Stacey told Scott: ""You moved through generations of girls. You created a culture of fear which allowed your abuse to carry on."" Laura believes the 12-year sentence is inadequate and is angry that she was not told Scott could apply for parole after six years. She said: ""That's not justice - two years per person when I've had to live through 21 years of hell. ""To get 12 years when he can apply for parole in six, I'm speechless about it. I just think it's disgusting, absolutely disgusting. The justice system is a joke."" She hopes that speaking out will persuade other victims to break their silence. ""I want people to come forward, whether it's been David Scott that's abused or raped you or it's been anybody else,"" she said. ""He was a predator, a paedophile that's been caught now for six us of and there's definitely more in my opinion. ""He took my childhood away from me. I still don't feel that I've got my justice. ""This is one of the reasons I'm doing this interview because he's not getting away with it. It's not over yet. Not for me it isn't."" A Police Scotland spokesman said the ""bravery of these victims cannot be understated"". He added: ""Police in Edinburgh originally received a report of sexual assault perpetrated by David Scott in the 1990s. ""The matter was fully investigated and detailed statements were noted from the victim and potential witnesses. ""Scott was detained and interviewed at that time, however, due to a lack of corroboration, no charges were able to be libelled."" Edinburgh City Council said that child safety was ""of paramount importance"". A spokesman added: ""We work closely with Police Scotland and our other partner agencies to investigate any allegations of abuse, whether current or historical."" A Crown Office spokesman said that sexual offences were high priority, citing the National Sexual Crimes Unit launched in 2009. He added: ""We would encourage anyone who has been a victim of a sexual crime to come forward, even if the crime was committed many years ago. ""They can be assured that they will be listened to and treated sensitively and with respect.""

Reality Check: Brexit and roaming,"Virgin Media O2 has announced it will not start charging Virgin Mobile or O2 customers extra for using their phones in Europe. Three, EE and Vodafone are all reintroducing roaming fees for customers travelling to the EU. Between 2017 and the end of 2020, UK consumers were able, within reason, to use the minutes, texts and data included on their mobile phone tariffs when travelling in the EU. But since January 2021, UK operators have been allowed to reintroduce so-called roaming charges because the UK left the EU and theBrexit trade dealdid not rule them out. None of the networks will be charging for roaming in the Republic of Ireland. From 23 May 2022, Three customers who have signed up or upgraded from October 2021 will have to pay Â£2 a day to use the minutes and data from their UK contracts in EU countries. It is also introducing a Â£5 a day charge for roaming in some countries outside the EU, where it previously allowed free roaming. EE will also be charging Â£2 a day in Europe. It will introduce the charges in January 2022 for customers who joined or upgraded their contracts after 7 July 2021. There will be 30-day packages available for people travelling for longer periods. Vodafone has three types of tariff: Its cheapest sim-only deals do not allow any use apart from emergency calls outside the UK and Ireland Some of its more expensive Xtra plans include roaming at no extra charge The rest of its tariffs offer roaming for Â£2 a day. Eight-day and 15-day passes are available for Â£1 a day. EE to reintroduce Europe roaming charges Vodafone to bring back roaming charges from January Three brings in EU roaming charges Virgin Mobile and O2 users will not face EU roaming charges All four of the big operators previously said they had no plans to introduce roaming charges. Whether or not your operator is imposing extra charges, there are ""fair use limits"" on the amount of time that customers will be allowed to use their phones abroad. UK customers have been told that their operators will charge extra if they spend more than half their time overseas, generally measured by being in another country for more than 62 days in a four-month period. That could have happened while the UK was still part of the EU, but some operators have only just started enforcing it. Similarly, data limits are also subject to fair use restrictions. Customers of O2 have a monthly data limit of 25GB and will be charged Â£3.50 for each GB after that. Vodafone's limit is also 25GB with a Â£3.13 charge per GB after that. Three has cut its fair use limit from 20GB a month to 12GB and will charge Â£3 per GB above that. The planned Â£2-a-day fees are still relatively small compared with the costs customers had to pay before the EU banned roaming charges. In the past some people returned from European trips to face bills for hundreds or even thousands of pounds. The UK's trade deal,externalwith the EU said that both sides would encourage operators to have ""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. The UK government also passed legislation to provide some safeguards for consumers: A Â£45-a-month limit on the amount they could be charged for using mobile data abroad before having to opt into further use Requirements for customers to be informed when they have reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance Operators also have to take ""reasonable steps"" to avoid customers being charged for accidental roaming in Northern Ireland, which could happen if a phone there locked on to a mobile signal coming from the Republic of Ireland Without the EU rules in place, the charges levied depend on agreements between UK operators and their counterparts in EU countries. Both sides may have seen this as an opportunity to make some money both from UK customers visiting EU countries and EU customers coming to the UK. The four main operators in the UK declined to comment on the commercial deals they have with other operators. The UK governmentrecommends that customers check the details of their individual tariff,externalwith their phone operator before travelling.

May: ÃÂ£39bn bill linked to deal,"This video can not be played Asked about the UK exit payment to the EU, the PM says ""without a deal, the position changes"". Theresa May has said she will reconsider paying the Â£39bn Brexit divorce bill if the UK is unable to reach a deal with the EU. Speaking in Parliament, she said the UK was a law-abiding nation which would honour its international commitments. But asked by Tory MP Chris Philp what would happen in the event of a no deal, she said the ""position changes"". ""The specific offer was made in the spirit of our desire to reach an agreement with the EU,"" she added. The proposed financial settlement is part of the withdrawal negotiations that both sides hope to complete by November at the latest ahead of the UK's exit next March. The UK and EU agreed in principle in December that the UK would pay about Â£39bn to cover outstanding financial obligations and future liabilities arising from its EU membership. At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brexit divorce cost 'uncertain' Mrs May was asked by Chris Philp whether the payment was dependent on reaching an agreement on the UK's future relations with the EU that was ""satisfactory"" to MPs. He also urged the prime minister not to be ""locked into"" any financial agreement unless there were guarantees the UK would be free to work on new trade agreements during the proposed transition period ending in December 2020 and to sign them the moment it leaves. In response, Mrs May said the negotiations were being conducted on the basis that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"". ""We are very clear we need to have a link between the future relationship and the withdrawal agreement."" Tory MPs have expressed concerns that the UK could find itself paying the money with no guarantees over its future trade relationship, Boris Johnson suggesting the UK has agreed to ""hand over Â£40bn of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat"".

Suu Kyi defends jailing of journalists,"This video can not be played Aung San Suu Kyi said their conviction had ""nothing to do with freedom of expression at all"" Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi has defended the jailing of two Reuters journalists, despite international condemnation. She said Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had broken the law and their conviction had ""nothing to do with freedom of expression at all"". The two were sentenced for possession of police documentswhile investigating the killing of Rohingya Muslims. Ms Suu Kyi also said her government could in hindsight have handled the Rohingya situation differently. Since last year, at least 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar, also known as Burma, after the army launched a brutal crackdown in response to attacks by a Rohingya militant group. The UN has called for top military figures to be investigated for genocide. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate - who is Myanmar's de facto leader - had been under intense pressure to comment on both the Rohingya crisis and more recently the journalists, following their jailing last week. This week, a UN rights body accused Myanmar of ""waging a campaign against journalists"" and the verdict has sparked criticism internationally, including from US Vice President Mike Pence. Has Suu Kyi turned her back on free press? The country where Facebook posts whipped up hate Aung San Suu Kyi: The democracy icon who fell from grace Breaking her silence on Thursday at an international economics conference in Vietnam, Ms Suu Kyi said the case against the international news agency journalists upheld the rule of law. She suggested that many critics had not actually read the verdict, saying: ""They were not jailed because they were journalists, they were jailed because... the court has decided that they have broken the Official Secrets Act."" The two, she added, had ""every right to appeal the judgement and to point out why the judgement was wrong"". This video can not be played The wives of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have spoken out. The Reuters pair were sentenced to seven years in prison on 3 September for violating the state secrets act while investigating a massacre of Rohingya men by the military at a village called Inn Din in Rakhine state. The two Myanmar nationals had been arrested while carrying official documents which had just been given to them by police officers in a restaurant. They said they were set up by police, a claim backed by a police witness in the trial. The verdict against Wa Lone (L) and Kyaw Soe Oo (R) has been widely condemned The Burmese authorities later launched their own investigation into what happened at Inn Din, andjailed seven soldiers for their involvement in the killings of 10 Rohingya Muslimmen there. It was a rare admission of wrongdoing - the military has exonerated itself of blame for the violence and refused to allow journalists and external investigators to work freely in Rakhine. Read their report 'Massacre in Myanmar',external The story behind the journalists' arrest Blow by blow: How a 'genocide' was investigated By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent Not once at the World Economic Forum event did Aung San Suu Kyi acknowledge the suffering of the Rohingyas, or the allegations of appalling atrocities against them by her armed forces. Instead she deflected the question. She referred to the decline of small minorities in Rakhine state, whose survival she worries about - a bizarre false equivalence to the alleged genocide of a Rohingya population numbering well over a million. And she fell back on a favourite refrain - the rule of law. It should apply equally to all communities in Rakhine, she explained. The two Reuters reporters, she said, were found to have broken the law, they were not punished for their journalism. Ms Suu Kyi has long talked about the need to reform Myanmar's judiciary and improve the rule of law. Some reforms have been made under her government. But the judicial system remains corrupt, capricious, with disproportionately harsh sentences and, says the International Commission of Jurists, with judges subject to political and military influence. Many laws are condemned as unjust relics of an authoritarian past. The colonial-era Official Secrets Act is so vague and sweeping it criminalises obtaining or reading any document the government deems sensitive. Under these conditions the term ""rule of law"" has little meaning. The 73-year-old former activist, who spent more than a decade under house arrest during the military junta period, was once seen as a global human rights icon. But her perceived failure to stop the rape and killing of Rohingyas has sullied her international reputation and several honours have been withdrawn. However, she remains very popular in Myanmar, where many people see the Rohingya as interlopers from Bangladesh. Human Rights Watch responded to Ms Suu Kyi's comments by saying that she ""got it all wrong"". Could Aung San Suu Kyi face Rohingya genocide charges? ""She fails to understand that real 'rule of law' means respect for evidence presented in court, actions brought based on clearly defined and proportionate laws, and independence of the judiciary from influence by the government or security forces,"" Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said. ""On all these counts, the trial of the Reuters journalists failed the test."" The Rohingya have faced decades of discrimination in Myanmar and are denied citizenship. The latest crisis erupted in August 2017 when a brutal military crackdown was launched in far-western Rakhine state in response to a Rohingya militant group attacking more than 30 police posts. Last month,a UN report said top military figures in Myanmar must be investigated for genocidein Rakhine state and crimes against humanity in other areas. The report describes the army's response - including murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery, persecution and enslavement - as ""grossly disproportionate to actual security threats"". Ms Suu Kyi has not criticised the powerful military but on Thursday admitted that, in hindsight, ""the situation could have been handled better"" by her government. ""But we believe that for the sake of long-term stability and security we have to be fair to all sides,"" she said. ""We cannot choose and pick who should be protected by the rule of law.""

He said such protest-free areas around clinics in England and Wales ""would not be a proportionate response"". A Home Office review found cases of harassment and damaging behaviour but they were ""not the norm"", he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the decision was a ""shocking failure to protect women"" and should be reversed. In a written statement, Mr Javid said the review had gathered evidence that showed protesters' behaviour had left patients distressed and caused some to rebook their appointments and not to follow medical advice. He said that in some cases, protesters handed out model foetuses, displayed graphic images, followed people, blocked their paths and even assaulted them. However, he added that the review showed these activities were ""not the norm"" and most anti-abortion activities were ""more passive"", such as praying, displaying banners and handing out leaflets. 'I felt like a criminal for having an abortion' 'That's where the babies are suffering' In 2017, 363 hospitals and clinics in England and Wales carried out abortions - 36 of which experienced anti-abortion demonstrations, according to the review. Mr Javid said: ""Having considered the evidence of the review, I have therefore reached the conclusion that introducing national buffer zones would not be a proportionate response, considering the experiences of the majority of hospitals and clinics, and considering that the majority of activities are more passive in nature."" He went on to say that there was already legislation - such asthe Public Order Act 1986,external- in place that restricted protest activities which caused harm to others. Defending the decision, Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told the Commons the government would continue with the current scheme of enabling councils to apply for Public Space Protection Orders. In April, the west London council of Ealing took matters into their own hands, imposing a 100m protest-free ""buffer zone"" outside a Marie Stopes clinic. But the constituency MP, Labour's Rupa Huq, said it was a ""national problem that requires a national solution"". She told the Commons the conclusions were ""a bit disappointing"". ""It seems to be saying there has to be a disproportionate number of women affected before any action takes place,"" she added. Speaking later to the BBC, she said shoving the burden onto already cash-strapped local authorities was not the best solution, and would leave women running ""a gauntlet of a barrage of abuse just to have their NHS procedure done"". This video can not be played Newsnight: Should there be 'buffer zones' around abortion clinics in Britain? Mr Javid's predecessor, Amber Rudd, who launched the review last year, has previously said it was ""unacceptable"" that anyone should feel intimidated at a clinic. However, Ms Rudd, who resigned as home secretary in April, told the Commons that now that she could ""travel slightly less conspicuously"", she had visited the Ealing clinic. She told MPs there was ""no harassment continuing which, I believe, continues to reflect what has been concluded"" in the government's announcement. Clare Murphy, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which provides abortion services in the UK, said the charity would seek to work with councils to roll out the Ealing ""model"" across the country to protect women and clinic staff from protesters. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said Public Spaces Protection Orders could be useful but had not been designed for this purpose. It said new legislation would make sure the approach towards protests was ""consistent and effective"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mr Javid had ""given the green light for women to be harassed and abused for exercising their right to choose. ""This is a disgusting failure to uphold women's rights over their own bodies. Sajid Javid must urgently reconsider,"" the Labour MP said. And her party colleague, Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the home affairs select committee, said: ""The whole point of having this review was because existing powers are not working or are proving cumbersome and difficult for councils or the police to use."" Elizabeth Howard, of Be Here For Me - a campaign group which opposed the ban on buffer zones - welcomed Mr Javid's ""common sense"" decision which would mean ""women could continue to be offered much needed help and support"". Antonia Tully, of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, said they were ""delighted"" by the decision. ""This is a massive victory for common sense, democracy and above all for the hundreds of vulnerable women who are saved from the horror of abortion at the very gates of the abortion clinic.""

BBC solves World Cup streaming delay,"Live streams of the World Cup online were delayed The BBC says it has worked out how to eliminate ""streaming lag"", which causes live TV to be delayed by several seconds when watched online. Many online viewers of football's World Cup in the summer heard neighbours cheering goals they had not yet seen happen, because the online stream was a few seconds behind the TV broadcast. BBC Research & Development said it has now managed to ""eliminate"" the delay. However, its software is not ready to be rolled out to the public yet. Live TV watched online is often behind by several seconds because it takes longer to reliably send video over the internet than to broadcast it. The issue has also affected Amazon's broadcast of the US Open tennis tournament. Analysts from streaming firm Phenix said the online broadcast was often up to 45 seconds behind the TV transmission. When video is streamed online it is broken up into small packets, which are reassembled by the recipient's device. If each segment is very short, processing them becomes inefficient. However, if they are too long, there is more of a delay between the TV broadcast and online stream. The BBC said it found ways to create smaller segments that can be passed through the system more quickly. It said viewers of the resulting online streams would see action ""at the same time as they would see it if they were watching on TV"". France went on to win the World Cup in 2018 ""With sport, it's irritating if you're watching something that is 20 or 40 seconds behind live TV,"" said Jake Bickerton, technology editor at the industry magazineBroadcast,external. ""The BBC also did trials at the World Cup streaming 4K [ultra high-definition] HDR content. Not only was there a delay, but consumers had to have really good broadband at home. ""It isn't going to be simple to get something compressed to a point where it can get to viewers at home through broadband very quickly. If the BBC is able to reduce latency, then it's a great thing going forward."" The innovation will be on show at the International Broadcasting Convention, which starts on Thursday in the Netherlands. However, the BBC said it would need the co-operation of the whole broadcasting industry to get the system up and running. It suggested the technology may be available by the time of the next World Cup in 2022, and could be delivered to existing equipment with a software update.

US boy impaled on meat skewer will recover,"Miraculously, the meat skewer missed major blood vessels and the boy's brain and eyes. A 10-year-old boy in Missouri is recovering after he was attacked by wasps and fell from a tree house face-first on to a meat skewer. The thin spike that went through Xavier Cunningham's head ""miraculously"" missed his eyes, brain, spinal cord and major blood vessels. He fell down from a tree house when the freak accident occurred on Saturday. Kansas University Hospital told local media he is expected to recover fully, although his voice may be affected. A team of Kansas University doctors successfully removed the square rod - which made for a trickier surgery than a rounded skewer due to the sharp edges - over several hours. Xavier was playing in a tree house at his home in Harrisonville, Missouri, when yellow jacket wasps began stinging him. US boy wakes before doctors pull plug Watch: Woman's miracle recovery after brain bleed 'Miracle' womb surgery twins start school The tree house from which 10-year-old Xavier fell He fell from the tree house and landed directly on a foot-long (30cm) metal meat skewer. The skewer penetrated around six inches into the boys skull. Xavier's mother Gabrielle Miller told Kansas City Star,externalthat she saw her son walk into the house, screaming, with the rod ""just sticking out"" of his head. ""I'm dying Mom, I can feel it,"" Mrs Miller recalled him telling her on the way to hospital. Xavier was taken to local hospital, transferred to hospital in Kansas City and again transferred to the University of Kansas hospital where he would eventually undergo surgery. His injury had no active bleeding and had avoided his eyes, brainstem, spinal cord and blood vessels, which enabled doctors to call in expert surgeons before attempting the removal surgery on Sunday morning. Xavier is recovering in hospital after being impaled by a meat skewer Koji Ebersole, director of endovascular neurosurgery at the University of Kansas Health System, told the Star: ""You couldn't draw it up any better. It was one in a million for it to pass 5 or 6 inches through the front of the face to the back and not have hit these things."" He said the biggest concern while removing the rod was the blood vessels in the boy's neck. Dr Ebersole called the boy's recovery ""miraculous"". ""I have not seen anything passed to that depth in a situation that was survivable, let alone one where we think the recovery will be near complete if not complete,"" he told the Star.

Pussy Riot activist 'possibly poisoned',"Pyotr Verzilov was one of those jailed for invading the World Cup final pitch Pyotr Verzilov, an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot, is reported to have been taken to hospital in a serious condition. Relatives speaking to the Meduza website said they believed he may have suffered poisoning but there is no official word on his condition. He reportedly fell ill after a court hearing on Tuesday for fellow Pussy Riot activist Veronika Nikulshina. Mr Verzilov was one of the activists who invaded the World Cup final pitch. He is a dual citizen of Russia and Canada. On Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the situation was a ""concern, obviously, given actions of recent months by the Russians in the UK"" - referring tothe poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and others in Salisbury. However, he added it was ""too early to draw any conclusions about what has happened or how it has happened"". Mr Trudeau said consular officials had contacted the facility where Mr Verzilov was being treated. The story of Pussy Riot's 2012 jailing Ms Nikulshina told Meduza that Mr Verzilov had complained of losing his sight, ""then the ability to talk, then the ability to walk"". She said that when he was admitted to hospital, an initial examination ""didn't turn up anything bad"", but that later doctors suddenly moved Mr Verzilov to the hospital's toxicology wing. Relatives quoted by Meduza say he still cannot speak and ""reacts only with his eyes"". A member of staff at Moscow's Sklifosovsky hospital later confirmed to AFP news agency that Mr Verzilov was in the intensive care unit in a ""serious condition"", but gave no further details. Mr Verzilov is married to Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, the Pussy Riot member who was sentenced in 2012 to two years in jail for a performance at a Moscow cathedral. Ms Tolokonnikova tweeted: ""Pyotr may have been poisoned. In the toxicology department in a very serious condition."" Maria Alyokhina, another Pussy Riot member who was jailed along with Ms Tolokonnikova, also tweeted that Mr Verzilov was in intensive care. Croatia's Dejan Lovren squared up to Mr Verzilov during the World Cup pitch invasion in July Meduza said Mr Verzilov was in the toxicology department,externalof a hospital in Moscow's Sokolniki district. It said Mr Verzilov's mother had not been allowed to see her son. Mr Verzilov was part of the Voina performance art group with Ms Tolokonnikova before it split in 2009 and then acted as spokesperson for Pussy Riot during the 2012 trial. He was jailed for 15 days this year along with three women activists after they staged a pitch invasion at the football World Cup final in Moscow on 15 July, wearing police uniforms. How Pussy Riot managed to burst into final They said the action, done in the name of Pussy Riot, was a protest against human rights abuses in Russia.

Patient 'may have drunk toilet cleaner',"Joan Blaber, 85, died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in September last year An inquest into the death of a woman who died after drinking cleaning fluid has heard another patient at the same hospital may have drunk toilet cleaner. Joan Blaber, 85, from Lewes, died while being treated at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. She died on 23 September 2017, six days after drinking Flash cleaner from a water jug on her bedside table. Hove Coroner's Court heard it was ""highly unlikely"" what happened was the result of a mistake. Before Mrs Blaber's death staff had been told another patient had drunk toilet cleaner, the jury heard. Housekeeper Daniel Gonzales said: ""Apparently the patient, who had dementia or something like that, took it and drank it. ""It's just a story, I'm not sure if it was true."" Mr Gonzales was asked how he thought Flash was found in a patient's water jug. He replied: ""It doesn't make any sense to me. No-one would pour the product into a jug you normally use for patients."" Ashley Le May, who was part of a team whose job it was to clean communal areas, said he had to carry a container of Flash through the wards on 17 September 2017 to get to other parts of the building as it was too big to fit on a trolley. He said: ""At no point did we stop and at no point did the bottle of Flash leave its cardboard box."" His colleague Kayleigh Regan said in a statement read to the court, there was ""no real structure"" to cleaning and claimed she had received ""no official training"" from the hospital. Senior coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley suggested it was ""highly unlikely"" what happened was the result of an error. At a pre-inquest review in June, she saida ""deliberate act"" could not be ruled out. The inquest continues.

'Gut instinct' helped catch rapist,"Keith Morris sexually abused two young girls from a remote Kenyan village A holidaymaker who helped catch a child rapist he saw with groups of young girls said ""gut instinct"" made him alert the authorities. David Bushell reported Keith Morris, 72, after observing him with groups of 10 to 12-year-olds at a hotel in Kenya. He contacted the National Crime Agency (NCA) as he believed something was ""seriously wrong"", he said. Morris, from Hull, wasjailed in July for sexually abusing two girlshe met during repeated trips to east Africa. Yorkshire breaking news: 'Urgent' talks needed to avoid city flood repeat; Woman's sepsis death 'avoidable' During his trial at Leeds Crown Court, jurors heard the retired locksmith repeatedly visited a rural village in Kilifi County over a period of about 20 years. In that time he befriended and helped vulnerable families, with many villagers regarding him as a father figure to local children. The court heard he then used his elevated status to groom young girls by taking them on trips. The NCA said Mr Bushell's report had been ""integral"" to securing Morris' conviction. David Bushell became so concerned with Morris's behaviour he referred him to the National Crime Agency Mr Bushell, from London, said he had watched Morris over three days after seeing him with a number of girls aged between about 10 and 12 years of age. He said: ""I felt like something was wrong but I was not really sure why the alarm bells were ringing. ""By the second day I felt like I just wanted to go and confront him and ask 'What are you doing with these children? What relationship are they to you?'."" He said when he questioned hotel staff about Morris he was told he was in the process of adopting eight girls. However, Mr Bushell was so concerned he referred Morris to the National Crime Agency in 2017. Morris went on to be convicted of four counts of rape, four counts of assault by penetration, two charges of sexual assault and two counts of perverting the course of justice.

Mike Canning, from the NSPCC, said: ""Gut feelings are important. If something doesn't feel right it's often because it isn't right.

Six dead in California shootings,"US police have named the alleged gunman who killed five people in linked shootings before killing himself in Bakersfield, California on Wednesday. Javier Casarez drove his ex-wife Petra Maribel Bolanos de Casarez, 45, to a trucking business in the city, where he killed two men and his estranged wife. The 54-year-old then drove to a home where he shot dead two more people. After hijacking a car from a woman with a child in it, Casarez was confronted by a deputy and shot himself dead. America's gun culture in 10 charts Boy, 12, 'tries to shoot teacher in face' Woman shoots husband dead in front of kids Police identified the other victims as Antonio Valdez, 51, Manuel Contreras, 50, Eliseo Garcia, 57 and his daughter Laura Garcia, 31. Authorities said there were ""strong indications"" of a domestic violence background but that they were still investigating motives behind the killings, which took place 145km (90 miles) north of Los Angeles. At 17:20 local time (00:20 GMT) deputies were called to the trucking business after reports of shots being fired. Casarez had confronted Manuel Contreras and then allegedly shot both him and Ms Bolanos de Casarez, the mother of his three children, using a handgun, police said. Antonio Valadez then appeared at the scene and Casarez shot at him, before pursuing him and shooting him dead. The 54-year-old then drove to a residence on Breckenridge Road and shot dead Eliseo and Laura Garcia. Relatives gathered at the Breckinridge Road home, where two victims had been shot Police are still investigating the connection between the gunman and his last two victims. They said Laura Garcia, a mother of four, may have tried to intervene. The alleged gunman then carjacked a car from the woman and child, who were allowed to escape. Casarez pulled over after a deputy confronted him with a firearm. Police body-cam video shows the officer repeatedly ordering the suspect to drop his weapon before he shot himself in the chest. Police say Casarez was in the midst of divorce proceedings with his ex-wife, who had recently filed for an unspecified change in orders involving child support and property. ""These are not random shootings,"" Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood told journalists. ""Obviously, there is some type of situation that caused the husband to be extremely upset,"" he said on Thursday. ""I'm pretty comfortable [saying] there will be a connection between all these players."" He said police were still investigating the motive behind the shooting of the four other victims. The entire incident took place over 10 to 15 minutes, Sheriff Youngblood said. He had earlier described the incident as a mass shooting, saying: ""This is the new normal, if you look across the country."" ""Six people lost their lives in a very short period of time.""

Yorkshire breaking news: 'Urgent' talks needed to avoid city flood repeat; Woman's sepsis death 'avoidable' During his trial at Leeds Crown Court, jurors heard the retired locksmith repeatedly visited a rural village in Kilifi County over a period of about 20 years. In that time he befriended and helped vulnerable families, with many villagers regarding him as a father figure to local children. The court heard he then used his elevated status to groom young girls by taking them on trips. The NCA said Mr Bushell's report had been ""integral"" to securing Morris' conviction. David Bushell became so concerned with Morris's behaviour he referred him to the National Crime Agency Mr Bushell, from London, said he had watched Morris over three days after seeing him with a number of girls aged between about 10 and 12 years of age. He said: ""I felt like something was wrong but I was not really sure why the alarm bells were ringing. ""By the second day I felt like I just wanted to go and confront him and ask 'What are you doing with these children? What relationship are they to you?'."" He said when he questioned hotel staff about Morris he was told he was in the process of adopting eight girls. However, Mr Bushell was so concerned he referred Morris to the National Crime Agency in 2017. Morris went on to be convicted of four counts of rape, four counts of assault by penetration, two charges of sexual assault and two counts of perverting the course of justice.

""Ultimately if there is nothing wrong then all you will do is cause someone a small amount of stress but if there's something seriously wrong you may save someone's life or save them from the horrendous actions of someone that is quite monstrous,"" he said. Mike Canning, from the NSPCC, said: ""Gut feelings are important. If something doesn't feel right it's often because it isn't right.

Analysis by Newsbeat's music reporter Jimmy Blake It's recently become more common for big names to play in Shanghai. It comes as record labels look to capitalise on a growth in the Chinese music market - despite Shanghai in particular being known as a difficult place to book shows in comparison to other major cities around the world. Before foreign artists can perform there, China's Ministry of Culture runs background checks on artists and their team. They have also been known to request to see set lists up to five months in advance of shows in order to approve lyrical content In 2006, Jay-Z wasn't allowed to play there because of his ""vulgar lyrics"" while the Rolling Stones were told to drop five songs - including Honky Tonk Woman and Let's Spend the Night Together - because of references to sexual themes. As more global super stars head to Shanghai with little sign of pre-tour admin being watered down, Dua Lipa might not be the last British export to be greeted with a different atmosphere to what they're used to on the rest of their world tour. This is the first time Dua Lipa has toured in China. She played in Guangzhou and Shanghai. A China representative for Dua Lipa's record company Warner Music Group told the BBC that no-one was available to comment. The singer is scheduled to perform next in Manila on Friday.

John Lewis profits slump 99%,"This video can not be played Sir Charlie Mayfield on the challenges facing John Lewis Profits at the John Lewis Partnership have fallen to almost zero in the first half of the year as its department store chain matched discounting ""extravaganza days"" by rivals. John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said the retail sector was facing ""challenging times"". Its results, which include Waitrose, showed profits for the six months to 28 July sank 99% from last year to Â£1.2m. The retailer also warned that full-year profits would be ""substantially lower"". The company is rebranding its stores to John Lewis & Partners and Waitrose & Partners to highlight the chain's 85,000 members of staff, known as ""partners"" who are given an annual bonus based on the chain's profits. ""With the level of uncertainty facing consumers and the economy, in part due to ongoing Brexit negotiations, forecasting is particularly difficult but we continue to expect full year profits to be substantially lower than last year for the partnership as a whole,"" the retailer said. In the first six months, profits at the John Lewis department store business were hit hardest. Sir Charlie said that the stores' profit margins had been squeezed in ""what has been the most promotional market we've seen in almost a decade"". John Lewis boss rejects Dominic Raab Brexit jibe Is it time to ditch ""Never knowingly undersold""? Why we no longer love department stores Six reasons behind the High Street crisis He told the BBC's Today programme: ""The biggest single reason for the decline in profits is all about margin"". The department store pledges to be ""never knowingly undersold"" - cutting prices to match those of competitors, which have also been discounting. ""This year there has been twice as many extravaganza days as there were a year ago and actually the discounts have been even deeper,"" he said. ""We're never knowingly undersold at John Lewis, so of course we are matching that, and that affects margins."" It was an ""extremely valuable"" promise, he added. Sir Charlie said the chain had also not been passing on to consumers all of the inflationary impact from the weakness in sterling. The pound has slumped since the vote to leave the EU, pushing up the cost of imported produce. Analysts said the results demonstrated the impact of the price-matching promise. Steve Dresser, retail analyst at Grocery Insight, tweeted that ""the business feels like it's broken"", adding that the never knowingly undersold pledge ""needs refining, badly"". The department store sector has been undergoing a period of change.Sports Direct bought House of Fraser in Augustwhile Debenhams, in which Sports Direct has a 29.7% stake, was this weekforced to stress that its sales had not collapsed. Sport Direct has also been forced to deny that it does intend to make a full bid for Debenhams. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the profits fall at John Lewis heralded further problems for the retail sector. ""This brand was hailed as the model to which all should follow, and as a commercial and customer success - make no mistake, for the high street this is as significant as the fall of the Roman empire. ""And much like the fall of Rome, it's not just the empire that suffers, the infrastructure that supplies it will too. The UK industry must steel itself for dark times to rise again."" For most of the last decade John Lewis appeared to defy gravity. While its High Street rivals were brought crashing down by the combined pull of the internet and ever-higher costs, it seemed to sail serenely on, smartly moving sales online while keeping customers coming to its stores. Now gravity has finally exerted itself. John Lewis sold Â£5.5bn worth of goods in the first six months of this year, and made just Â£1.2m profit - close enough to nothing. The partnership's chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, has rejected the obvious response. This is not the time, he said, to be cutting back, closing stores and stopping investment. Instead, he has stepped up investment in stores, while also husbanding costs, as can be seen in a review of the future of the retailer's final-salary pension scheme. Sir Charlie's main strategic move, however, is hidden in the fine print of the financial statements. He is paying down John Lewis's debt as fast as he can. In a downturn this severe, the last person standing is often the winner - and by getting rid of debt, Sir Charles is doing his best to make sure that is John Lewis. Like-for-like sales - which strip out new floor space - at the John Lewis stores fell 1.2%, and it reported an underlying operating loss of Â£19m compared with a Â£54m profit a year earlier. At Waitrose, like-for-like sales were up 2.6%, but operating profits fell 12% to Â£96.4m. The group had warned in June that its half-year profits would be wiped out and that it would invest more in developing ""unique"" products and services, as well as placing more emphasis on its own brand. It said it would continue to invest between Â£400m and Â£500m per year in the business. Sir Charlie said: ""You don't succeed by retrenching so if anything we are investing more and pushing on with differentiation. ""The simple truth is that times like these call for cool heads and really determined ambition."" Is 'Never knowingly undersold' killing John Lewis?

Suu Kyi defends jailing of journalistsMyanmar's leader says the conviction of the Reuters pair had nothing to do with freedom of expression.Asia,"This video can not be played Aung San Suu Kyi said their conviction had ""nothing to do with freedom of expression at all"" Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi has defended the jailing of two Reuters journalists, despite international condemnation. She said Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had broken the law and their conviction had ""nothing to do with freedom of expression at all"". The two were sentenced for possession of police documentswhile investigating the killing of Rohingya Muslims. Ms Suu Kyi also said her government could in hindsight have handled the Rohingya situation differently. Since last year, at least 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar, also known as Burma, after the army launched a brutal crackdown in response to attacks by a Rohingya militant group. The UN has called for top military figures to be investigated for genocide. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate - who is Myanmar's de facto leader - had been under intense pressure to comment on both the Rohingya crisis and more recently the journalists, following their jailing last week. This week, a UN rights body accused Myanmar of ""waging a campaign against journalists"" and the verdict has sparked criticism internationally, including from US Vice President Mike Pence. Has Suu Kyi turned her back on free press? The country where Facebook posts whipped up hate Aung San Suu Kyi: The democracy icon who fell from grace Breaking her silence on Thursday at an international economics conference in Vietnam, Ms Suu Kyi said the case against the international news agency journalists upheld the rule of law. She suggested that many critics had not actually read the verdict, saying: ""They were not jailed because they were journalists, they were jailed because... the court has decided that they have broken the Official Secrets Act."" The two, she added, had ""every right to appeal the judgement and to point out why the judgement was wrong"". This video can not be played The wives of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have spoken out. The Reuters pair were sentenced to seven years in prison on 3 September for violating the state secrets act while investigating a massacre of Rohingya men by the military at a village called Inn Din in Rakhine state. The two Myanmar nationals had been arrested while carrying official documents which had just been given to them by police officers in a restaurant. They said they were set up by police, a claim backed by a police witness in the trial. The verdict against Wa Lone (L) and Kyaw Soe Oo (R) has been widely condemned The Burmese authorities later launched their own investigation into what happened at Inn Din, andjailed seven soldiers for their involvement in the killings of 10 Rohingya Muslimmen there. It was a rare admission of wrongdoing - the military has exonerated itself of blame for the violence and refused to allow journalists and external investigators to work freely in Rakhine. Read their report 'Massacre in Myanmar',external The story behind the journalists' arrest Blow by blow: How a 'genocide' was investigated By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent Not once at the World Economic Forum event did Aung San Suu Kyi acknowledge the suffering of the Rohingyas, or the allegations of appalling atrocities against them by her armed forces. Instead she deflected the question. She referred to the decline of small minorities in Rakhine state, whose survival she worries about - a bizarre false equivalence to the alleged genocide of a Rohingya population numbering well over a million. And she fell back on a favourite refrain - the rule of law. It should apply equally to all communities in Rakhine, she explained. The two Reuters reporters, she said, were found to have broken the law, they were not punished for their journalism. Ms Suu Kyi has long talked about the need to reform Myanmar's judiciary and improve the rule of law. Some reforms have been made under her government. But the judicial system remains corrupt, capricious, with disproportionately harsh sentences and, says the International Commission of Jurists, with judges subject to political and military influence. Many laws are condemned as unjust relics of an authoritarian past. The colonial-era Official Secrets Act is so vague and sweeping it criminalises obtaining or reading any document the government deems sensitive. Under these conditions the term ""rule of law"" has little meaning. The 73-year-old former activist, who spent more than a decade under house arrest during the military junta period, was once seen as a global human rights icon. But her perceived failure to stop the rape and killing of Rohingyas has sullied her international reputation and several honours have been withdrawn. However, she remains very popular in Myanmar, where many people see the Rohingya as interlopers from Bangladesh. Human Rights Watch responded to Ms Suu Kyi's comments by saying that she ""got it all wrong"". Could Aung San Suu Kyi face Rohingya genocide charges? ""She fails to understand that real 'rule of law' means respect for evidence presented in court, actions brought based on clearly defined and proportionate laws, and independence of the judiciary from influence by the government or security forces,"" Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said. ""On all these counts, the trial of the Reuters journalists failed the test."" The Rohingya have faced decades of discrimination in Myanmar and are denied citizenship. The latest crisis erupted in August 2017 when a brutal military crackdown was launched in far-western Rakhine state in response to a Rohingya militant group attacking more than 30 police posts. Last month,a UN report said top military figures in Myanmar must be investigated for genocidein Rakhine state and crimes against humanity in other areas. The report describes the army's response - including murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery, persecution and enslavement - as ""grossly disproportionate to actual security threats"". Ms Suu Kyi has not criticised the powerful military but on Thursday admitted that, in hindsight, ""the situation could have been handled better"" by her government. ""But we believe that for the sake of long-term stability and security we have to be fair to all sides,"" she said. ""We cannot choose and pick who should be protected by the rule of law.""

"'Oldest known drawing' found on tiny rockEtched with an ""ochre crayon"", the 73,000 year old drawing looks a little like a modern-day hashtag.Science & Environment","The drawing dates back 73,000 years Scientists say they have discovered humanity's oldest known drawing on a small fragment of rock in South Africa. The drawing is about 73,000 years old, and shows cross-hatch lines sketched onto stone with red ochre pigment. Scientists discovered the small fragment of the drawing - which some say looks a bit like a hashtag - in Blombos Cave on the southern coast. The find is ""a prime indicator of modern cognition"" in our species, the report says. While scientists have found older engravings around the world,research published on Wednesday in the journal Nature,externalsays the lines on this stone mark the first abstract drawing. The article says the ancient artist used an ""ochre crayon"" to etch it onto the stone. Scientists found the stone fragment in Blombos Cave, 300 kilometres (185 miles) east of Cape Town Humanity has used ochre, a clay earth pigment, for at least 285,000 years. The drawing was ""probably more complex"" in its entirety, archaeologist Christopher Henshilwood told Reuters. ""The abrupt termination of all lines on the fragment edges indicates that the pattern originally extended over a larger surface,"" he said. Ancient 'paint factory' unearthed Neanderthals were capable of making art Traces found of 'world's oldest cheese' Egyptian mummification 'recipe' revealed Mr Henshilwood works at Norway's University of Bergen and South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand and led the research into the drawing. He told Reuters that while the team would be ""hesitant to call it art"", it almost definitely had ""some meaning to the maker"". There have been numerous other artefacts found in Blombos Cave, 300 kilometres (185 miles) east of Cape Town, including beads covered in red ochre, engraved ochre fragments, and a paint-making kit dating back around 100,000 years.

Agency's Drinkaware links 'damage credibility',"There are concerns about the high level of alcohol consumption in the UK Dozens of public health experts have told Public Health England (PHE) they oppose its decision to work with a charity funded by the alcohol industry. In a letter seen by BBC News, they say the tie-up ""will significantly damage the credibility of PHE"". On Tuesday, government alcohol adviser, Sir Ian Gilmore, resigned over the agency's decision to work with Drinkaware on a new campaign. PHE said it stood by its ""fresh and bold"" decision. The campaign,Drink Free Days,,externalis urging people aged between 45 and 65 to have regular days when they do not drink any alcohol. The letter, sent last month, said the link-up between PHE and Drinkaware was a ""significant risk both to the effective communication of alcohol advice to the public and also to the reputation of PHE"". The 46 signatories - including experts in tobacco and illegal drugs as well as alcohol - said PHE's own research had shown ""the limited effectiveness of communications campaignsâ¦to trigger behaviour change"". They criticise Drinkaware's advice on reducing alcohol consumption - saying its website does not provide full details on the risks of excessive drinking. ""Industry-funded messages and social marketing campaigns should not be a substitute for publicly-funded campaigns providing independent and evidence-based information,"" they conclude. Researchers have also pointed out that some of Drinkaware's funders do not adhere to the latest health advice on their products. Drinkaware messages are included on alcohol products Since 2016, the safe drinking limit for both men and women, according to the Chief Medical Officer for England, has been a maximum of 14 units per week, equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or seven glasses of wine. But Heineken Group, for instance, says on both its Heineken and Fosters beers that UK Chief Medical Officers recommend a maximum limit for men of three to four units a day, and two to three for women. A Heineken spokeswoman says they are in the process of producing new labels. Middle-aged urged to have 'drink-free' days Alcohol limits cut to reduce risks Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? Six charts on how the British drink Questions have also been asked about three officials from Public Health England, including its chief economist, attending a conference in May which discussed finding a way in which the drinks industry could pay for research into the effectiveness of public health alcohol campaigns. The conference, at Imperial College in London, included representatives from two large brewers - AB InBev and Molson Coors. One researcher said it was ""reminiscent of the tobacco industry paying researchers for decades to hide the harm they caused"". But the organiser of the conference told the BBC that little progress had been made since the meeting and that research ""standards will be developed exclusively by academics. We aim to be as transparent as possible"". In a statement, PHE admitted that its representatives had attended the conference - but did not comment further. On the decision to work with Drinkaware, it said: ""PHE is steadfast in its ambition to reduce the harms that drinking too much alcohol can cause and we will work together with any partner that speaks to the evidence and shares the same commitment. ""Drinkaware is an independent educational charity with an extensive reach to the key audiences. ""Working together to help communicate the message that having drink-free days will reduce the risks to your health is the first move in what we hope will be a long-term partnership.""

Officers to be quizzed over spit hoods,"Civil liberties groups have called the mesh hoods ""dangerous and degrading"" Met Police officers are to be quizzed about whether they should have a spit guard at their disposal. Commissioner Cressida Dick has previously saidfront-line officers would not be given the mesh guards. Members of the Met Police Federation (MPF) will also be asked if they have been spat at or bitten on duty in the past two years as part of the survey. Chairman Ken Marsh said the survey was being conducted to provide evidence for Ms Dick. Civil liberties groups have called the mesh hoods placed over suspects' heads ""dangerous and degrading"". In the capital, British Transport Police are currently permitted to use spit guards during arrests while the Met has used hoods in all custody suites during an extended pilot scheme. Met Police officers have only used the guards in custody suites Mr Marsh said Ms Dick had ""stated publicly that in the last 18 months, neither her or her senior officers have been asked by an operational officer for spit guards. ""Well, that's not what they have been telling us... officers are being spat at far too often.""

Pussy Riot activist 'in hospital',"Pyotr Verzilov was one of those jailed for invading the World Cup final pitch Pyotr Verzilov, an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot, is reported to have been taken to hospital in a serious condition. Relatives speaking to the Meduza website said they believed he may have suffered poisoning but there is no official word on his condition. He reportedly fell ill after a court hearing on Tuesday for fellow Pussy Riot activist Veronika Nikulshina. Mr Verzilov was one of the activists who invaded the World Cup final pitch. He is a dual citizen of Russia and Canada. On Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the situation was a ""concern, obviously, given actions of recent months by the Russians in the UK"" - referring tothe poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and others in Salisbury. However, he added it was ""too early to draw any conclusions about what has happened or how it has happened"". Mr Trudeau said consular officials had contacted the facility where Mr Verzilov was being treated. The story of Pussy Riot's 2012 jailing Ms Nikulshina told Meduza that Mr Verzilov had complained of losing his sight, ""then the ability to talk, then the ability to walk"". She said that when he was admitted to hospital, an initial examination ""didn't turn up anything bad"", but that later doctors suddenly moved Mr Verzilov to the hospital's toxicology wing. Relatives quoted by Meduza say he still cannot speak and ""reacts only with his eyes"". A member of staff at Moscow's Sklifosovsky hospital later confirmed to AFP news agency that Mr Verzilov was in the intensive care unit in a ""serious condition"", but gave no further details. Mr Verzilov is married to Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, the Pussy Riot member who was sentenced in 2012 to two years in jail for a performance at a Moscow cathedral. Ms Tolokonnikova tweeted: ""Pyotr may have been poisoned. In the toxicology department in a very serious condition."" Maria Alyokhina, another Pussy Riot member who was jailed along with Ms Tolokonnikova, also tweeted that Mr Verzilov was in intensive care. Croatia's Dejan Lovren squared up to Mr Verzilov during the World Cup pitch invasion in July Meduza said Mr Verzilov was in the toxicology department,externalof a hospital in Moscow's Sokolniki district. It said Mr Verzilov's mother had not been allowed to see her son. Mr Verzilov was part of the Voina performance art group with Ms Tolokonnikova before it split in 2009 and then acted as spokesperson for Pussy Riot during the 2012 trial. He was jailed for 15 days this year along with three women activists after they staged a pitch invasion at the football World Cup final in Moscow on 15 July, wearing police uniforms. How Pussy Riot managed to burst into final They said the action, done in the name of Pussy Riot, was a protest against human rights abuses in Russia.

Australia charge over 137 'poisoned' eagles,"The wedge-tailed eagle is Australia's largest bird of prey A man has been charged following the deaths of at least 137 wedge-tailed eagles in Victoria, Australia. Authorities found the animals - Australia's largest bird of prey and a protected species - in April, prompting raids on several properties. The man is alleged to have used poisoned baits to kill eagles since October 2016. State officials described it as the largest case of suspected wedge-tailed eagle killings they had ever seen. Authorities have previously said that the true number of dead birds may be even bigger. Under the state's Wildlife Act, killing a wedge-tailed eagle carries a fine of up to A$7,928 (Â£4,350; $5,700) and a maximum six-year jail term. Additional killings carry a fine of A$792 each. The birds were allegedly poisoned with bait The carcasses were found hidden in scrub on properties that covered about 2,000 hectares in East Gippsland, the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said. Authorities said the man was charged after an investigation involving about 30 people. They did not discuss a possible motive.

E. coli 'caused Egypt hotel deaths',"John and Susan Cooper died while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel in Hurghada E. coli caused the deaths of a British couple who died after falling ill at a holiday resort in Egypt, the country's authorities have said. John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, from Burnley,died in the Red Sea city of Hurghada on 21 August. In an official statement, the Egyptian general prosecutor said post-mortem examinations showed E. coli bacteria was a factor in both deaths. But the couple's daughter described the findings as ""absolute rubbish"". Kelly Ormerod, who was at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel with her parents, told the BBC she did not believe the symptoms her parents showed were consistent withE. coli infection. She added further post-mortem examinations of her parents' bodies would be carried out in the UK, on direction from the Home Office. The couple's daughter Kelly Ormerod was on holiday with them According to the Egyptian general prosecutor's statement, tests showed Mr Cooper suffered acute intestinal dysentery caused by E. coli, and Mrs Cooper suffered a complication linked to infection, likely to have been caused by E. coli. He also said drinking water samples taken from the hotel were clear of any harmful bacteria and the bodies showed ""no criminal violence"". 'Raw' food and 'illness' at Egypt hotel British holidaymakers return early from Egypt Egypt hotel deaths: Daughter recalls parents' death By Philippa Roxby, BBC Health reporter Any strain of E. coli capable of causing the couple's deaths so quickly would have been very toxic. E. coli is a type of bacteria present in the gut of humans and animals. Most strains are harmless - but some can cause cramps and diarrhoea, and others severe illness if damaging toxins are produced. Prof Brendan Wren, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, says they were ""very unlucky because these strains are very rare"". But E. coli has killed before, often after people have consumed contaminated food, such as meat, bean sprouts or salad leaves. In these rare cases, the effects can be particularly nasty and the toxins can have an immediate effect. The internal organs, like the liver and kidneys, are affected and simply start to shut down. Travel firm Thomas Cook said it noted the statement from the prosecutor and said it would continue to support the Coopers' daughter and the rest of their family. ""We have not yet seen the full report and we will need time for our own experts to review it,"" a spokesman said. Dr Rania Al-Mashat, Egypt's minister of tourism, said the health and safety of tourists to Egypt was ""paramount"". ""We will review the Attorney General's autopsy reports in fine detail to determine our next course of action to look after the welfare of our visitors,"" she said. The couple fell ill at the Red Sea resort last month Earlier, a report inThe Times,externalclaimed that the room in the hotel next door to the one the couple shared had been fumigated. But the head of the firm that carried out the work, Namaa Services, denied any wrongdoing and said it used authorised concentrations of chemicals. The Egyptian prosecutor's report, issued on Wednesday, also said the smell in the couple's room, which had been mentioned by Ms Ormerod, was that of an insecticide used in an adjacent room. It said the chemical was non-toxic and there were no traces of it discovered in samples taken from Mr and Mrs Cooper's bodies. Last week,hygiene testsat the Steigenberger Aqua Magic found high levels of E. coli. Thomas Cook said at the time the independent experts it had commissioned to carry out the tests did not believe the results ""shed any light"" on the cause of death. Mr Cooper died in his room, while Mrs Cooper, a Thomas Cook employee, died after being taken to hospital.

Rees-Mogg brushes off protest outside home,"This video can not be played Protesters shout at Jacob Rees-Mogg's children during protest Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has brushed off a demonstration outside his Westminster home where a protester shouted at his children. A video on the Facebook page of the Class War group shows a man telling one of the Tory MP's children ""your daddy is a horrible person"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Downing Street and many MPs have strongly criticised the stunt. But Mr Rees-Mogg told LBC: ""I wouldn't get too excited about it."" He added: ""It was a few anarchists who turned up and it wasn't very well organised. It wasn't terribly serious. ""We are a free country. They weren't violent. They aren't admirers of mine. I am in public life and not everybody is going to like me. That is a reality of public life. ""I'd have preferred it if it hadn't happened but I don't want to get it out of perspective. I think much worse things happen to many other people."" Police officers stood between the protesters and the MP during the incident outside his Westminster home. Downing Street said the ""intimidation"" was ""completely unacceptable"". ""No elected member or their family should be subjected to intimidation or abuse in that way,"" said the prime minister's spokesman. On Twitter, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said it was a ""shameful and disgraceful"" episode. ""We are - and must be - better than this,"" he said, adding that he would be praying for Mr Rees-Mogg's family that evening. Also writing on Twitter, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said the children of high-profile politicians should never be regarded as ""fair game"". Allow Twitter content?

Labour's shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman told the BBC's Politics Live the protesters' behaviour was ""abhorrent"". In the Class War video, a protester asked Mr Rees-Mogg how much he paid his family's nanny, and when she too came out on to the street, demanded to know her salary and told her she had ""Stockholm Syndrome"". A subsequent Class War Facebook post said people were getting their ""knickers in a twist"" over the footage, saying the MP's family had come outside after the protesters arrived. The protest is believed to have been staged by veteran anarchist Ian Bone, who has taken part in similar stunts in the past.

Mass evacuation from 'storm of a lifetime',"This video can not be played People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane US East Coast residents are running out of time to flee before Hurricane Florence hits the region as soon as Thursday evening, officials warn. The storm was downgraded to category three with maximum sustained winds of 120mph (195km/h), but officials say it is still ""extremely dangerous"". Up to 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate across South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Four South Carolina motorways have been diverted one-way to speed the exodus. On Wednesday, Georgia declared a state of emergency, following the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland and Washington DC. A National Weather Service forecaster said: ""This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast. ""And that's saying a lot given the impacts we've seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd and Matthew. ""I can't emphasise enough the potential for unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge and inland flooding with this storm."" This video can not be played Why do people ignore hurricane warnings? Jeff Byard, of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said: ""This is going to be a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast."" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned that ""disaster is at the doorstep"", and ""tens of thousands"" of buildings may be flooded. Waves 83ft (25m) tall were recorded at sea on Wednesday morning. But while many coastal residents have complied with mandatory evacuation orders, others are boarding up their homes and vowing to ride out the storm. A holidaymaker from Ohio says he plans to ride out the storm from his rental home in North Carolina's Outer Banks In other developments: Florence could wreak more than $170bn (Â£130bn) of havoc and damage nearly 759,000 homes and businesses, says analytics firm CoreLogic North Carolina farms are moving livestock to safety. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd left hundreds of thousands of dead hogs and chickens floating in floodwaters in the state Nearly 1,000 prisoners in South Carolina will not be moved from their cells, despite a mandatory evacuation order in the area. ""In the past, it's been safer to leave them there,"" said a state department of corrections spokesman There are fears for wild horse herds in North Carolina's Outer Banks, but experts say these equines can sense bad weather coming and head to higher ground In a video posted to his Twitter account on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump warned residents in Florence's bullseye to heed official warnings. ""Get out of its way, don't play games with it,"" said Mr Trump. ""It's a big one, maybe as big as they've seen, and tremendous amounts of water."" ""Bad things can happen when you are talking about a storm this size. It's called Mother Nature. You never know, but we know. We love you all, we want you safe.""

Forecasters say the storm poses such a threat because it is expected to slow down and hover for nearly two days over the Carolina coast, before dipping south towards Georgia. It is forecast to bring 20-40in (50-100cm) of rain and life-threatening storm surges of up to 13ft. As of Wednesday evening, officials say these surges are now ""highly likely"" as Florence churns closer. The National Weather Service also predicts ""catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding"" in parts of the Carolinas and Appalachians. Hurricane force winds will emanate up to 70 miles from the centre of the storm, say meteorologists. National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham warned that waterways up to 40 miles inland may flood. Mr Graham said the Pamlico and Neuse rivers in North Carolina will see their flows ""reversed"" as storm surges push water back inland. He added that half of fatalities during hurricanes are caused by storm surges, and another quarter of deaths are due to inland rains and flooding. The barrier islands of the Carolina coastline could be prone to flooding The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse?

'Disaster' still feared as US storm weakens,"This video can not be played Why do people ignore hurricane warnings? Hurricane Florence has been downgraded to a category two storm as it approaches the US but officials still warn of a ""disaster at the doorstep"". Florence's winds may have dropped to 110mph (175km/h) but its slow-moving nature could mean it lingers for days, bringing catastrophic flooding. Some 10 million people are now under some form of storm watch. Florence may now be heading further south, and Georgia is the latest state to declare an emergency. It joins North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Washington DC. As of 05:00 Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday (09:00 GMT), Florence was 205 miles (330km) south-east of Wilmington in North Carolina, the latestNational Hurricane Centre advisory says.,external Forecasters have adjusted the predicted path of Florence. It is now expected to make landfall a little further south, on the Carolinas border on Thursday. Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? Your guide to Hurricane Florence's risks A guide to the world's deadliest storms The hurricane's wind speeds have fallen from a category 3 level of 111-129 mph to a category 2 level of 96-110 mph. However, they are not expected to weaken further and the forward speed of the hurricane is also dropping, meaning it could linger near the coastline through to Saturday. This means that torrential rainfall could last for significant periods and cause catastrophic flooding, including in inland areas such as Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said:  ""The time to prepare is almost over, Disaster is at the doorstep and it's coming in."" This video can not be played People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane Up to 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate across South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Some 5.25 million people are under hurricane warning or watch, and another 4.9 million people are under storm warning or watch, Associated Press reported. The biggest danger to life could be from storm surges, which are still predicted to be as high as 13ft (4m) between Cape Fear and Cape Lookout in North Carolina, areas that could also see up to 40in (101cm) of rain. There will be hurricane-force winds up to 80 miles from the centre of the storm, meteorologists say. President Donald Trump issued a video message saying: ""This is going to be one of the biggest ones to ever hit our country... Protection of life is the absolute highest priority.""

Swipe to progress  The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Hurricane Florence threatens east coast US.

Putin: Skripal suspects are not criminals,"This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians The two suspects in the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter are civilians, not criminals, Russian President Vladimir Putin says. The UK government had named them as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, and said they were from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU. Mr Putin said he hoped the men would tell their story soon. Downing Street said that Russia has repeatedly been asked to account for what happened in Salisbury. The prime minister's official spokesman said that Moscow ""had replied with obfuscation and lies"". ""I have seen nothing to suggest that has changed,"" the spokesman said. Meanwhile, Security Minister Ben Wallace - speaking in the Commons - suggested there had been failures in the baggage checks before the two suspects boarded a plane from Russia to the UK. He added there was ""no doubt"" there would have been some checks on the Russian side of their journey but ""the baggage checks weren't probably as good as they might be"". Mr Skripal and Yulia were poisoned in Salisbury in the UK in March. ""We know who they are, we have found them,"" Mr Putin said in the far eastern city of Vladivostok. ""I hope they will turn up themselves and tell everything. This would be best for everyone. ""There is nothing special there, nothing criminal, I assure you. We'll see in the near future,"" he added. BBC Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford called Mr Putin's words a ""tantalising hint"" that the two men will speak ""very soon"". ""But the question of course is who will we see because don't forget that, in the UK, the suspicion is that the two names that were given are in fact aliases,"" our correspondent added. Russian state TV says one of the suspects, Mr Petrov, told the channel he might comment publicly on the case next week. By BBC Monitoring Within minutes, Putin's remarks became top news on Russian TV, which called them ""simply sensational"". On state TV's Channel One, a talk show speculated whether Theresa May would resign upon seeing that Petrov and Boshirov are not Russian hitmen after all, or whether the British government would come up with more ""lies"" to denigrate Russia. Rossiya 1, another government-run TV channel, showed a beaming commentator saying he was ""full of admiration for how Vladimir Putin is doing it"", as the studio erupted in applause. But the Kremlin's media machine suggested the most exciting news is yet to come - when the two suspects appear on TV in person and deal the final blow to accusations of Russia's involvement in the poisoning. Scotland Yard and the UK's Crown Prosecution Service have said there is enough evidence to charge the men, who are understood to have travelled to London from Moscow on 2 March on Russian passports. Two days later, police say they sprayed the nerve agent, Novichok, on the front door of Mr Skripal's home in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury, before travelling home to Russia later that day. What happened to the Skripals? The new Russian disinformation game Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far What is the GRU? UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid has warned the men, thought to be aged about 40, will be caught and prosecuted if they ever step out of Russia. The CPS is not applying to Russia for the extradition of the two men, as Russia does not extradite its own nationals. But a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case they travel to the EU. This video can not be played On the trail of Russians Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who UK police believe carried out a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018 Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in the city of Salisbury. He was later discharged from hospital, as were the Skripals. Police are linking the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June, when Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley became unwell at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles away. Ms Sturgess died in hospital on 8 July. Mr Putin said his government had found the pair and hoped they would appear soon and tell their story UK police said the two men arrived at Gatwick Airport from Moscow on 2 March and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. On 4 March they travelled to Salisbury - having also visited for reconnaissance the previous day - where Mr Skripal's front door was contaminated with Novichok. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew back to Moscow from Heathrow later that night. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. Police said Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley were later exposed to Novichokafter handling a contaminated container, labelled as Nina Ricci Premier Jour perfume. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing the small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put bottle and applicator together and got some of the contents on himself. His partner, Ms Sturgess, applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. The attack in Salisbury prompted an international row, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, including the US, while Moscow expelled diplomats in response. Last month the US confirmed it was implementing fresh sanctions against Russia over the incident. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has also said Britain will push for the EU to agree new sanctions. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals and have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. In response, Russia accused the British authorities of Russophobia, misleading the international community and UK citizens and of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"".

Apple unveils iPhone XS and new Watch,"This video can not be played WATCH: Hands on with new iPhone XS and XS Max Apple has updated its iPhone X handset with three more powerful models, two of which are larger than before. The iPhone XS Max has a 6.5in (16.5cm) display. The iPhone XS has the same 5.8in-sized component as the original. The iPhone XR's screen is 6.1in but is lower quality. A new smartwatch was also launched with an added fall-detection function. There had been concerns that the relatively high Â£999 entry price of iPhone X would limit its appeal. But Applesaid it had consistently proven more popular than either of the lower-priced iPhone 8 models,external. Market research firms suggest it also outsold rival companies' flagship devices. This video can not be played WATCH: Apple's event in 90 seconds That helped propel Apple to become the world's first company with a market capitalisation above $1tn (Â£768bn). However, China's Huawei still managed to overtake it in terms of overall smartphone market share in the April-to-June quarter, putting Apple into third place. ""Huawei was able to overtake it because Apple is not playing in the mid and low ends of the market,"" commented Francisco Jeronimo from IDC. ""But Apple is very well positioned in the premium segment, and we don't expect that to change over the next 18 months."" The iPhone XS and XS Max go on sale on 21 September, while the XR will follow in October The XS Max will become the most expensive handset Apple has sold to date, with its price ranging from Â£1,099 to Â£1,449 depending on its amount of storage. The XS will match the original X's Â£999-Â£1,349 cost, while the XR will be Â£749-Â£899. Apple has not, however, included a headphone dongle this time round, so owners of wired headphones will need to factor in an additional Â£9 charge to add one. Apple highlighted that the iPhone XS Max's display was significantly larger than the 5.5in display of the old iPhone 8 Plus despite the two handsets being similar in size. ""Even if the screen on the iPhone X last year was larger some people who were on the Plus models missed the feel of a larger device which is exactly what the Max is addressing,"" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at the consultancy Creative Strategies. The iPhone XR also has a bigger screen but uses LCD (liquid crystal display) rather than the OLED (organic light-emitting diode) technology found in the more expensive models. This will mean black appears less deep and its colours appear to have less contrast. The iPhone XR is offered in a range of colours In addition, its chassis is made from aluminium rather than steel, which means it is likely to be less damage-resistant. However, unlike the more expensive models it comes in six different colours. Analysts suggest the wider range may help encourage iPhone owners who did not upgrade last year to do so this generation. ""Retention has become very high for both Android and iOS - switching is largely a thing of the past,"" suggested analysts at UBS. ""Put simply, the replacement for iPhone is iPhone, the only question is when - and the when is driven in large part by form factor, namely the screen."" Apple launch: Bigger! Faster! Pricier! Innovative? Apple removes apps that harvested data Apple self-driving car in minor crash The latest phones feature a fresh processor - the A12 Bionic. It is the firm's first to feature seven nanometre transistor technology, which should aid energy efficiency and computation speeds. Its inclusion means the iPhone XS will last about 30 minutes longer on a battery charge than the X, Apple suggested. The firm also said that its Face ID system would now work faster than before and it demoed several apps, showing off its augmented reality prowess. Allow Twitter content?

Huawei recently announced it had developed a rival 7nm mobile chip of its own. Despite rumours that at least one of the new iPhones would feature three rear cameras - like Huawei's P20 Pro - Apple stuck with two 12 megapixel lenses for the XS and XS Max.

Apple has never told us how many Apple Watches it has sold since the first device was released in 2015, other than to say it's the top-selling device in its category. Analysts, though, think sales are in the region of 50 million. Minuscule compared to the iPhone, but this is a device that's clearly on the up. It began life as a fitness device, but this update will, and this isn't marketing puff, help people stay alive. Fall detection, and the ability to conduct an ECG to measure heart health, are both major new features that the healthcare industry is tremendously excited about. I haven't had a chance to try it yet, and one concern for me would be false positives - it thinking I've fallen over when I'm perfectly fine. And, if this is going to be marketed at elderly consumers, Apple's boast of packing the interface with more ""complications"" will make it, well, more complicated. But make no mistake. With US regulator approval - the first device of its kind to be given that clearance - insurance companies will be ordering these by the bucketload. The world is aging, and access to health is getting more expensive. It's not often a Silicon Valley company creates a product with the over-60s firmly in mind.

PM to discuss no-deal Brexit plans,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab says the cabinet has agreed a plan to ''manage, mitigate or avoid the risks of a no-deal scenario"" Britons visiting the EU could be hit with mobile phone roaming charges in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government would try to force firms to limit charges but he could not give a ""cast iron guarantee"" on the issue. The EU rule capping what mobile phone operators could charge each other will stop applying to the UK after Brexit. Meanwhile, the Bank of England governor told the cabinet house prices could drop 35% in three years without a deal. Mark Carney presented cabinet ministers with a range of scenarios under which prices would fall if the UK and EU do not reach a deal. A cabinet source confirmed that he said the Bank of England was prepared for a worst-case scenario where house prices could go down by as much as 35% over three years. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was trying to give the ""reassurance that consumers need"" on the issue of mobile phone roaming charges but admitted that European operators could pass on charges. Brexit papers: What no-deal could mean Rory Cellan-Jones: EU network charges could revive roaming fees John Lewis boss rejects Raab Brexit jibe He said: ""No, I can't give a cast-iron guarantee. What I can say is that the government would legislate to limit the ability of roaming charges to be imposed on customers."" The government haspublished its latest contingency plans,externalin the event of a no-deal Brexit. On mobile phone charges, the document says that ""in the unlikely event"" of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, consumers should ""check the roaming policies of your mobile operator before you go abroad"". The main points include: UK driversmay have to get an international permitif they want to drive in European countries Anyone travelling to the EU should make sure they have at least six months left on their passport, although that will not apply to travel in Ireland People applying for a new passport after Brexit will continue to get burgundy passports for a while - although they will not say ""European Union"" on the front cover Blue passports will start being issued from late 2019 Many products tested in the UK after Brexit will no longer be able to be sold on the EU market without being re-tested by an EU recognised body to meet minimum safety standards This does not cover automotive, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemicals or medical devices Mr Raab told Laura Kuenssberg Cabinet ministers earlier spent three hours examining ""all the plans across government to make sure we can manage, mitigate or avoid the risk of a no-deal scenario"". He also said there must be a ""shift across the board in the EU's approach"" on the issue of Northern Ireland: ""They will have to meet us halfway... if they meet the ambition, the pragmatism we've shown through our White Paper proposals then I'm confident we can get a good deal for this country, but also for the EU."" Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The only reason the government is talking about no-deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the prime minister from negotiating a good deal. ""With the clock ticking, ministers should drop the irresponsible rhetoric and start putting jobs and the economy first."" Extra charges for people using their phones in another EU country were scrapped in June 2017. But the EU regulation banning them will not automatically be part of UK law after Brexit on 29 March next year. In theory this means UK mobile operators, if they want to, could reintroduce the charges that could make it expensive to use a mobile phone in another EU country. However,the government said it would legislate to make operators set a cap of Â£45 a month on data usage while abroad,external- in line with the current EU limit of â¬50. Mr Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme two mobile operators, Vodafone and Three, had publicly agreed not to bring back roaming charges for British citizens. The government was aiming to get a Brexit deal with Brussels by mid-November at the latest but was stepping up contingency planning in case that did not happen, he added. He said one of the consequences of a ""no deal"" Brexit ""is that obviously we wouldn't pay out the money that has been agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement"". The UK would ""recognise our strict legal obligations"" but that the amount paid would be ""significantly, substantially lower"" than the Â£39bn agreed with the EU. Analysis by BBC Political Correspondent Laura Kuenssberg Ministers believe the chances of there being no agreement are now relatively small. They are hopeful that next week EU leaders will give helpful hints at a special meeting in Salzburg. Yet there is a long way to go until Dominic Raab, or anyone in government, can be sure. And don't doubt that many Tory MPs are adamant they simply won't vote for the kind of proposal Theresa May has put on the table. Read Laura's full blog A senior EU diplomatic source told BBC News Mr Raab's divorce bill comments were ""a statement of the obvious"" as the financial settlement was part of the withdrawal agreement. ""The [EU27] will keep our heads cool as we always do,"" he added. Business leaders have repeatedly warned about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal, with theCBI saying the UK would face tariffs on 90%of its EU exports and a number of new regulatory hurdles. UK consumers could find going on holiday and making card payments for EU products more expensive because Britain would no longer be part of the EU's payments process. CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said the government's latest planning papers ""make clear firms would be hit with a sledgehammer in the event of no-deal"". ""They also illustrate the extent of the disruption consumers can expect if ideology wins over evidence."" There are also concerns about delays at the UK border. The Road Haulage Association has warned it will take ""an average of about 45 minutes to process one truck on both sides of the channel"" if customs checks are put in place. ""If that happens then the queues of HGVs in Kent will make the jams seen in the summer of 2015 appear as little more than waiting for the traffic lights to change,"" it adds. Lorries on the M20 during 2015's 'operation stack' Mr Raab said there was a risk of disruption at the border if the EU did not respond ""with the collaborative spirit"" he said the UK ""would want to show"". The UK government was planning contra-flow systems on the M20 and was talking to EU member states about ""mitigating"" potential disruption. And he took a swipe at businesses,such as John Lewis, saying: ""I think it's probably rather easy at this moment in time for any business that isn't doing rather well to point to Brexit."" Please upgrade your browser Last month the government published 24 no-deal documents covering industries including medicine, finance and farming. There were warnings of extra paperwork at borders and extra credit card charges for Britons visiting the EU. More no-deal publications are expected in the coming weeks. Labour MP Ian Murray, a member of the campaign for another referendum, said: ""Nobody voted to make Britain poorer, to diminish our national influence or to ruin their holidays. ""The government has no mandate for any of this and it's too big an issue to be left to a Brexit elite in Westminster. That is why we must have a people's vote on the final Brexit deal.""

Tests reveal E. coli at Egypt hotel,"John and Susan Cooper died in August while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel in Hurghada High levels of E. coli have been found at the Egyptian hotel where two British tourists died, tests have revealed. The independent food and hygiene tests were ordered by Thomas Cook at Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. John and Susan Cooper, from Burnley, died at the hotel on 21 August. The results of post-mortem examinations are not yet known. The travel firm said its experts did not think E. coli killed the Coopers. It said the results of the tests identified ""a high level of E. coli and staphylococcus bacteria"", which were reviewed by Dr Vanya Gant from University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Thomas Cook said: ""It is clear from these results that something went wrong....and that standards fell below what we expect from our hotel partners. ""It is likely that the presence of E. coli and staphylococcus would explain the raised level of illness reported among guests at the hotel during this time, supporting Thomas Cook's decision to remove our 300 customers. ""However, neither our independent specialists nor Dr Gant believe that these results shed any light on the still unexplained cause of death of Mr and Mrs Cooper."" Mr Cooper, 69, died in his room, while Mrs Cooper, 63, died after being taken to hospital. Thomas Cook said standards at the hotel fell below its expectations The hotel's air and water quality was also tested with no evidence found of carbon monoxide, and normal carbon dioxide levels in the vicinity of the Coopers' room. Normal levels of chlorine were found in the hotel swimming pool and tests did not identify the presence of shigella, listeria or salmonella. However, Thomas Cook said its specialists were unable to access the Coopers' hotel room, which ""has remained under the control of the Egyptian authorities due to their ongoing investigation"". The company said it had shared its findings with the Cooper family, the Egyptian authorities and the Deutsche Hospitality group, which has a franchise agreement with the hotel. Travel boss in Egypt to discuss deaths 'Raw' food and 'illness' at Egypt hotel 'I thought Mum would survive' Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said everyone at Thomas Cook was ""deeply saddened"" by the couple's deaths adding that Mrs Cooper, who worked for Thomas Cook, was a ""longstanding and much-loved colleague of ours."" He added: ""These results, while not establishing the cause of the tragic deaths of John and Susan Cooper, have prompted us to commit further resource to tackle hygiene standards in those hotels where we identify a higher than average level of sickness."" It said it was preparing a compensation package for any of its customers who stayed at the hotel during August who said they were taken ill during their stay. Mr Fankhauser said he was ""very sorry for all our customers who fell ill while on a Thomas Cook holiday at this hotel"". The company has stopped its bookings for the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel until further notice.

She said ""about 40 people"" at the hotel were complaining of illness including ""projectile vomiting and diarrhoea"".

May: Â£39bn bill linked to deal,"This video can not be played Asked about the UK exit payment to the EU, the PM says ""without a deal, the position changes"". Theresa May has said she will reconsider paying the Â£39bn Brexit divorce bill if the UK is unable to reach a deal with the EU. Speaking in Parliament, she said the UK was a law-abiding nation which would honour its international commitments. But asked by Tory MP Chris Philp what would happen in the event of a no deal, she said the ""position changes"". ""The specific offer was made in the spirit of our desire to reach an agreement with the EU,"" she added. The proposed financial settlement is part of the withdrawal negotiations that both sides hope to complete by November at the latest ahead of the UK's exit next March. The UK and EU agreed in principle in December that the UK would pay about Â£39bn to cover outstanding financial obligations and future liabilities arising from its EU membership. At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brexit divorce cost 'uncertain' Mrs May was asked by Chris Philp whether the payment was dependent on reaching an agreement on the UK's future relations with the EU that was ""satisfactory"" to MPs. He also urged the prime minister not to be ""locked into"" any financial agreement unless there were guarantees the UK would be free to work on new trade agreements during the proposed transition period ending in December 2020 and to sign them the moment it leaves. In response, Mrs May said the negotiations were being conducted on the basis that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"". ""We are very clear we need to have a link between the future relationship and the withdrawal agreement."" Tory MPs have expressed concerns that the UK could find itself paying the money with no guarantees over its future trade relationship, Boris Johnson suggesting the UK has agreed to ""hand over Â£40bn of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat"".

Health watchdog industry ties attacked,"There are concerns about the high level of alcohol consumption in the UK Dozens of public health experts have told Public Health England (PHE) they oppose its decision to work with a charity funded by the alcohol industry. In a letter seen by BBC News, they say the tie-up ""will significantly damage the credibility of PHE"". On Tuesday, government alcohol adviser, Sir Ian Gilmore, resigned over the agency's decision to work with Drinkaware on a new campaign. PHE said it stood by its ""fresh and bold"" decision. The campaign,Drink Free Days,,externalis urging people aged between 45 and 65 to have regular days when they do not drink any alcohol. The letter, sent last month, said the link-up between PHE and Drinkaware was a ""significant risk both to the effective communication of alcohol advice to the public and also to the reputation of PHE"". The 46 signatories - including experts in tobacco and illegal drugs as well as alcohol - said PHE's own research had shown ""the limited effectiveness of communications campaignsâ¦to trigger behaviour change"". They criticise Drinkaware's advice on reducing alcohol consumption - saying its website does not provide full details on the risks of excessive drinking. ""Industry-funded messages and social marketing campaigns should not be a substitute for publicly-funded campaigns providing independent and evidence-based information,"" they conclude. Researchers have also pointed out that some of Drinkaware's funders do not adhere to the latest health advice on their products. Drinkaware messages are included on alcohol products Since 2016, the safe drinking limit for both men and women, according to the Chief Medical Officer for England, has been a maximum of 14 units per week, equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or seven glasses of wine. But Heineken Group, for instance, says on both its Heineken and Fosters beers that UK Chief Medical Officers recommend a maximum limit for men of three to four units a day, and two to three for women. A Heineken spokeswoman says they are in the process of producing new labels. Middle-aged urged to have 'drink-free' days Alcohol limits cut to reduce risks Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? Six charts on how the British drink Questions have also been asked about three officials from Public Health England, including its chief economist, attending a conference in May which discussed finding a way in which the drinks industry could pay for research into the effectiveness of public health alcohol campaigns. The conference, at Imperial College in London, included representatives from two large brewers - AB InBev and Molson Coors. One researcher said it was ""reminiscent of the tobacco industry paying researchers for decades to hide the harm they caused"". But the organiser of the conference told the BBC that little progress had been made since the meeting and that research ""standards will be developed exclusively by academics. We aim to be as transparent as possible"". In a statement, PHE admitted that its representatives had attended the conference - but did not comment further. On the decision to work with Drinkaware, it said: ""PHE is steadfast in its ambition to reduce the harms that drinking too much alcohol can cause and we will work together with any partner that speaks to the evidence and shares the same commitment. ""Drinkaware is an independent educational charity with an extensive reach to the key audiences. ""Working together to help communicate the message that having drink-free days will reduce the risks to your health is the first move in what we hope will be a long-term partnership.""

US boy impaled by meat skewer to recover,"Miraculously, the meat skewer missed major blood vessels and the boy's brain and eyes. A 10-year-old boy in Missouri is recovering after he was attacked by wasps and fell from a tree house face-first on to a meat skewer. The thin spike that went through Xavier Cunningham's head ""miraculously"" missed his eyes, brain, spinal cord and major blood vessels. He fell down from a tree house when the freak accident occurred on Saturday. Kansas University Hospital told local media he is expected to recover fully, although his voice may be affected. A team of Kansas University doctors successfully removed the square rod - which made for a trickier surgery than a rounded skewer due to the sharp edges - over several hours. Xavier was playing in a tree house at his home in Harrisonville, Missouri, when yellow jacket wasps began stinging him. US boy wakes before doctors pull plug Watch: Woman's miracle recovery after brain bleed 'Miracle' womb surgery twins start school The tree house from which 10-year-old Xavier fell He fell from the tree house and landed directly on a foot-long (30cm) metal meat skewer. The skewer penetrated around six inches into the boys skull. Xavier's mother Gabrielle Miller told Kansas City Star,externalthat she saw her son walk into the house, screaming, with the rod ""just sticking out"" of his head. ""I'm dying Mom, I can feel it,"" Mrs Miller recalled him telling her on the way to hospital. Xavier was taken to local hospital, transferred to hospital in Kansas City and again transferred to the University of Kansas hospital where he would eventually undergo surgery. His injury had no active bleeding and had avoided his eyes, brainstem, spinal cord and blood vessels, which enabled doctors to call in expert surgeons before attempting the removal surgery on Sunday morning. Xavier is recovering in hospital after being impaled by a meat skewer Koji Ebersole, director of endovascular neurosurgery at the University of Kansas Health System, told the Star: ""You couldn't draw it up any better. It was one in a million for it to pass 5 or 6 inches through the front of the face to the back and not have hit these things."" He said the biggest concern while removing the rod was the blood vessels in the boy's neck. Dr Ebersole called the boy's recovery ""miraculous"". ""I have not seen anything passed to that depth in a situation that was survivable, let alone one where we think the recovery will be near complete if not complete,"" he told the Star.
