Security and the world's seats of power,"London's tight security stopped the attacker from accessing parliament The attack on the British parliament building was stopped quickly, and security forces locked down the area within minutes. But the attacker still managed to enter Westminster and fatally wound an unarmed police officer, before he was shot. Prime Minister Theresa May has said police are now reviewing security, ""as is routine"". So what is security like in other national parliaments and seats of power, and how do other countries balance safety against accessibility? Berlin's Reichstag has fences in front of the building where the main entrance is, but it is relatively accessible to the public and there are no fences on other sides. Admission to the building's glass dome on the rooftop is free, but you do need to register in advance. There is even a rooftop restaurant - the only parliamentary building in the world with one, it claims - but it requires the names and dates of birth of guests 24 hours in advance, and you must bring your passport or ID with you. Despite its open-plaza appearance, the building is encircled by low concrete blocks. They provide no obstacle to pedestrians, but are a significant impediment to vehicles - and they dot the roadside all around the building, the park, and the German Chancellery nearby. The Reichstag was famously set alight in an arson attack in 1933, for which a young Dutch communist was sentenced to death - something the Nazi party then used to vilify communist opponents, resulting in electoral gains. A bridge linking buildings runs over a road in at the European Parliament The Brussels headquarters of the European parliament is part of a large, modern complex - and so is significantly different from the historic buildings used by many countries. It's also decentralised, with many of the plenary sessions taking place in France, and some administration work in Luxembourg. But it's the Brussels headquarters that is most iconic. It is easily accessibly by road or on foot, protected by low steel bollards on the roadside. Access to the buildings themselves requires a national ID card or passport, plus ""airport-style security checks"", but when parliament is in session, it's possible to slip in as an observer on the day without advance notice. The nearby Maelbeek metro station was one of the targets of the 2016 Brussels attacks - but the EU buildings themselves were untouched. It later emerged that one of the attackershad worked in the European parliament briefly during two summers. The National Assembly faces the Place de la Concorde over a long straight bridge The French National Assembly's grand front gates directly face a bridge of the river Seine, offering a straight-line view to the iconic Place de la Concorde. But, like the German Reichstag, concrete bollards set in front of the gates prevent any high-speed ramming from that long straight road. The Senate, meanwhile, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg. While one exterior wall by the roadside is solid stone, the remainder lies among public walkways in a park of the same name. Tourists and locals alike can stroll up to a waist-high gate separating them from the building's many windowed doors - although the area is patrolled by heavily armed police. This video can not be played James Reynolds: ""The government has suggested that that deployment to protect people is open-ended"" In contrast, the Elysee Palace, home to the French president, is a fortress of high walls, steel fencing, traffic restrictions, and armed patrols. It lies a short distance from the Champs-Elysees, one of the country's main tourist areas. Groups wishing to visit either the National Assembly or the Senate need the sponsorship of a senator - but because of security measures in effect in France, individual visits are suspended for both. More than 230 people have died in terror attacks in France since January 2015 - but none have targeted the Paris political strongholds. The US Capitol building is guarded by heavily armed officers There are two main centres of power in the centre of Washington DC: the Capitol building and the White House. The grounds around the Capitol building are open to pedestrians, but vehicle traffic is cut off by traffic barriers - only allowing those with permission in. The main entrance for visitors to the Capitol building is through a visitors' centre, where security is extremely tight - much like airport security. No liquids, food or pointed objects are allowed. The guards throughout the area and at several important nearby buildings are very well armed. A counter-sniper team member of the Secret Service on the White House roof, 2013 The White House is perhaps a more popular symbol of American power, and has a myriad of myths about its security - thanks in large part to Hollywood films. It is enclosed on all sides by steel railings several feet high, which are in turn encircled by steel bollards and chains. The mansion itself is quite distant from most of the railings, giving Secret Service plenty of time to pick up any fence-jumpers caught by the constant close surveillance -although one man, carrying a knife, made it into the building in 2014. The closest point from a public area to the mansion is on the North Lawn, a well-known viewpoint of the White House exterior. But security there is especially tight, with armed guards, and gatehouses which protect the entry points. And then there's the Secret Service and high-tech defences - including sniper surveillance, radar technology on the rooftop, and, of course, the ""bunker"" of the emergency operations centre under the building. Westminster lies by the water next to a public square, and is a popular tourist spot The BBC's Home affairs correspondent, Dominic Casciani, has written about ""the attack that security chiefs have been preparing for"". Here's what he had to say about the UK parliament: There is a ring of steel around the Palace of Westminster - but the attacker was able to enter into Parliament's grounds through the gates to New Palace Yard, which is below Big Ben. The entrance is guarded by armed officers but, unlike other parts of Parliament, there is no elaborate chicane. There will be inevitable questions about whether this entrance was appropriately protected - but given the rudimentary nature of this man's murderous plan, it would not have stopped him trying.

Morse's Oxford: Beyond the dreaming spires,"Of the main players in the Inspector Morse stories by Colin Dexter, one remains - the city of Oxford. The character died in The Remorseful Day, published in 1999. John Thaw, the actor synonymous with the role of the curmudgeonly detective, died in 2002. And Dexter himself died earlier this week. As the Lord Mayor of Oxford once said: ""In his novels Colin Dexter has shown our city as having a distinct and separate identity from its famous university."" The ""dreaming spires"" and attendant well-to-do academics and eccentrics were important factors in the books, but so were the lanes round the city centre, the arterial Iffley and Cowley roads, the north Oxford suburbs of Jericho and Summertown, and the railway station. Dexter himself was well aware of the city's allure for readers and viewers. When the first episode of the television series was broadcast in 1987, he said: ""The huge value for me as a writer is that, even if people haven't been to Oxford, they would love to be in the city. ""I think if the story had been set in Rotherham or Rochdale no-one would be particularly interested to see the streets and side streets, but so many people outside Oxford are delighted to see the High Street, St Giles and the colleges."" John Thaw, who played Inspector Morse in the television adaptation, pictured with Colin Dexter in 1999 The Randolph Hotel featured prominently in both Dexter's and Morse's lives. Morse was often to be found pondering cases while enjoying a real ale or red wine there, while Dexter's favoured drink in later life - he gave up alcohol for medical reasons - was tonic water. Staff at the hotel said the writer would often visit various rooms around the hotel to help him get details for a storyline. ""He continued to be a regular at the hotel bar and was so loved by staff, that we renamed the bar after his most famous character - Morse. He was very much part of this hotel and we will miss seeing him perched at the end of the bar or reading a book by the fireside, sipping his drink."" Famous haunts from the books and television series, such asthe Ashmolean museum,externaland theBodleian library,external, have expressed sorrow at his death. But, perhaps more significantly, so have lesser-known Oxford institutions, demonstrating Dexter was very much a man of the people - and a man of the real city. The writer shared his hero's affection for good beer, classical music and cryptic crossword puzzles, but by all accounts lacked his spiky nature. Alcock's Butcher and Fishmonger in the Summertown area has a blackboard outside saying ""Mr Dexter, you will be sadly missed"". Paul England from the shop said: ""He was a lovely guy. Always used to see him early in the morning. ""He used to walk down and get his paper and then he always used to come in for a pork pie and a chat. He used to tell us some good stories and jokes, which I think we'll always remember. We just knew him as Mr Dexter who bought his pork pie from the butcher."" Colin Dexter was often to be found enjoying a drink at the Randolph Hotel in Oxford - as was Inspector Morse Christiane Fagan fondly remembers him ""sitting quietly in the The Dew Drop Inn in Summertown. Such a lovely man"", while Carol Maling remembers chatting to him on a bench outside the old Radcliffe infirmary when he was waiting for his wife Dorothy to finish work. ""We used to share biscuits and chocolate,"" Ms Maling said. Although he claimed to know very little about actual police procedure, Dexter was a welcome visitor at Oxford CID. Former police officer Dermot Norridge was a detective in the city between 1986 and 2003. He said whenever he and his colleagues were investigating any incident related to one of the university colleges, they would say they were ""having a Morse moment"". Mr Norridge claims the irascible character even had an influence on the sounds heard floating through the corridors of the police station: ""There were certain offices where the radio was retuned to Radio 3 or Classic FM. The officers involved may well have been aware of classical music before Morse, but I'm completely convinced this listening to it was down to the influence of the programme. ""I met Colin a few times - he used to come with the crew to the station, and once he was invited to our annual dinner to give a talk. If I had to sum up my memory of him, it would be 'a complete gentleman'"". Sue Howlett remembers the author hopping on the bus from Summertown, and always saying hello, while Sue Parsons said she ""used to know him years ago when he would to come in to order stationery from Colegroves in Turl Street. Such a lovely man always having a laugh and a joke"". Bob Price, the leader of Oxford Council, says the city will always feel the impact of Dexter's work: ""The television programmes, and the way they were filmed, made a huge difference.  They really drew people to Oxford."" In his 13th - and final - book Dexter says: ""Morse had never enrolled in the itchy-footed regiment of adventurous souls, feeling little temptation to explore the remoter corners even of his native land; and this principally because he could imagine few if any places closer to his heart than Oxford - the city which, though not his natural mother, had for so many years performed the duties of a loving foster-parent."" He said of that paragraph: ""For 'Morse,' read me"". Colin Dexter is not the only author to have a strong link with a specific city. Here are a few more literary locations and their fictional dwellers The The Inspector Rebus novels are mostly based in and around Edinburgh and take in such landmarks as Arthur's Seat and Holyrood Palace, as well as Rebus' flat. The novels are characterised by the stark and dark depiction of a city characterised by corruption, poverty, and organised crime. Rebus bends the rules and ignores his superiors while battling his own personal issues. But he does solve the mysteries. You canexplore the key locations online,external. Joyce once claimed of his book Ulysses that if Dublin ""suddenly disappeared from the Earth, it could be reconstructed from my book"". Published in 1922, Ulysses focuses on the stream-of-consciousness wanderings through Dublin of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. Ulysses has been summarised as: ""Man goes for a walk around Dublin. Nothing happens."" The novel is seen by many as one of the most influential works of the 20th Century. The Assembly Rooms are the setting for many of the evening balls depicted in social satire Northanger Abbey and melancholic love story Persuasion, while the Pump Rooms were the place to mingle with during the day to give off a fashionable air of importance. Milsom Street, Bond Street (now New Bond Street), George Street and Edgar Buildings are all mentioned in the books.

'What's mum got to be depressed about?',"Bruce Turner's mum Tina was diagnosed with depression in 1990 and was hospitalised many times throughout his childhood. Now, at 20 years old, he still struggles to understand her condition. If you met my mum you would think she was the life and soul of the party. She's confident, full of energy and charisma, but she lives with depression and when it hits she is none of those things. In those times she becomes scared and fragile, sees the worst in situations, and her ability to love and show compassion is taken away. She'll shut herself off from the world and won't get out of bed or speak to anyone for weeks. It strips her of emotion - so if someone knocked on the door and told her she had won the lottery or her children had died in a car crash, her reaction would be the same. I've been surrounded by mental illness my entire life and, though I still live at home with my parents in Wilmslow near Manchester, I still can't get my head around it. The first time mum's depression affected me was when I was about nine, but it was hidden quite well from me, my twin sister Millie and my younger brother, Jake. Mum was admitted to hospital. Dad told us she was poorly but we didn't understand what was happening. He cried, which was a real shock, and when she returned he told us to be quiet around the house. She looked and acted differently. Normally mum was very glamorous but she became a shadow of herself, she stayed in her bedroom and was always in night-wear. Mum has since told me it took all her willpower to even go to the toilet back then. It was a shock to see her so vacant and she was scared of the people she loved the most. When her three children were laughing, it would send her into a panic and sleep became the only time the demons disappeared. She often hoped she wouldn't wake up. As children we went to youth club every Friday. Mum would never take us because she wasn't ""well"" so we would always go with friends. One Friday night, after she was discharged from hospital, she came to pick us up. It was amazing. I looked at her and thought she was back to normal again, but it was only the beginning of her recovery. She says she dreaded doing the pick-up and it took a huge amount of courage that night. As we grew up our grandparents kept family life as normal as possible. Millie now plays football for England and Bristol City WFC and my younger brother, Jake, 18, is a goalkeeper for Bolton Wanderers. Despite everything, they never missed a training session. Mum has said if she thought her illness had affected us in any way it would have made her battle worse. Mum has long periods of wellness but, when I was 16, the depression returned and I found it harder to cope with. This time I knew what was coming but the more I understood, the more I worried, and I was fearful that other people wouldn't understand. I put a brave face on at school and whenever anyone asked I would say mum was ""fine"" or cover the truth by saying she had a physical illness. At that age I found it hard to understand the situation and I was angry. She was admitted to hospital again and again and there was something about not being able to see anything physically wrong with her that made me question whether it was really there at all. I thought: ""What has mum got to be depressed about? She lives in a nice house with a nice family and is financially stable."" I didn't understand how ""being sad"" could be an illness and would make flippant remarks about how she should just ""pull herself together"". The triggers for mum's depression are difficult to understand. She lost a few close family members which she thinks affected her, but she also says one major episode came after watching the film Ray, about the blind rhythm and blues musician Ray Charles. It sounds surprising that she could be affected by a film like this, but she said it broke her heart and tipped her over the edge. The pain caused by depression within a family is tremendous, but it's brought us closer. It has made me appreciate every opportunity I receive, although I also live with the constant worry of when or if she'll have another episode. Mum, who's 49, is currently well and we hope it remains that way for as long as possible, but the dread of its return never goes away. The rapid disappearance of the person you love can be painful and frustrating. It's the fact they are facing the darkest battle and there is nothing you can do. I think the stigma surrounding mental health needs to be improved and it should be considered like any physical illness. Ignorance can't be acceptable for an illness where suicide could be the ultimate trauma. If depression affects someone you should surround them with love, appreciate the struggle and be there for them. Send them a ""get well soon"" card to let them know you're thinking about them. After 20 years of living alongside mum's battle, I still don't completely understand depression, but I'm getting there.

Life in the land of 'candle princesses',"Fair skin is more of a beauty ideal than darker skin across Asia - in Malaysia fair-skinned women are known as ""candle princesses"". Writer Eris Choo shares a frank account of growing up in a society with rigid beauty ideals. Have you ever heard of a candle princess? No, it isn't an obscure fairy tale. In Malaysia, a ""Puteri Lilin"" is someone who can't stand being in the sun for too long. Just like a candle, she'd melt from the heat. It originates from an ancient Malay folktale. The term is now used to refer to people who avoid the sun like the plague, for fear of getting darker. I've never been called one but I certainly know my fair share of candle princesses. You can spot them easily with their talismans the mini-umbrella, protector of fair-skinned girls everywhere. Outdoor sports like basketball and volleyball are taboo for them. They favour daintier indoor sports, like ping pong. I had one ""candle princess"" friend who would walk out with me, but when it came to going out in the sun, would unfurl her umbrella.  Growing up, I used to think it was funny, watching girls try to cross our school yard without even a ray of sunshine touching their skin. It stopped being funny when I found out why it was much better to be fair than dark-skinned in Malaysia. In Asia, the preference for light skin has less to do with race and more with class. Malaysia has the same prejudices as many societies around the world and just like the Evil Queen from Snow White, we are a nation obsessed with being fair-skinned. Among the Malaysian Chinese community, fair skin has long been considered ""pretty"". And I'm sure many of Malay and Indian ancestry would agree. Dark skin has historically been associated with peasants, farmers and labourers. The rich didn't have to work on the fields, and therefore, had fair skin. And the media hasn't helped, often favouring light-skinned actors with so-called ""pan-Asian looks"". Whitening creams are also often best sellers. 'Meatball Sweethearts': Shaming the fat shamers in Taiwan #unfairandlovely: Women speak out against skin lightening Being a basketball player in high school, I was quite tanned. But I remember an incident when I sauntered into class with my team mates after a gruelling game. A classmate started laughing, and called us ""Africa"". Everyone else picked up on it and started howling hysterically. We didn't stop playing because we loved basketball too much. But after that incident I began to avoid taking photographs. I felt ugly standing next to friends with ""normal""-looking skin. It also didn't help that these ideas were often reinforced among my own family. Every time I went back for family gatherings, there were only two things my relatives would comment on: if I had lost or gained weight, and whether I had gotten darker or fairer. This will be familiar to many across Asia, but even worse was that I felt validated by their ""praise"" and ashamed when I couldn't achieve those ideals. Sun bathing: probably a big taboo with candle princesses I only truly broke free from this cycle of self-loathing a few years ago by hanging out with people who were positive and encouraging. I also met someone who told me I was beautiful every day, and who really believed it. Slowly, I started believing in it too. And it's true that the term itself is not entirely a compliment: it has a tinge of scorn shot through with the awareness that a candle princess is delicate, to be taken care of, not robust. The advertising industry is part of this. A recent TV ad showed a model dodging the sunlight and then a voiceover: ""The sun can damage not just your looks and skin, but your confidence! Use X brand for fairer, healthy looking skin!"" But this is a marked improvement from older ads, which blatantly promoted having fairer skin just to look ""attractive"". The candle princesses in Malaysia are still here but there are a few, small signs that society might just be changing. Illustrations by Shing Yin.

What Next tells us about shops' woes,"If you want a clear explanation of what's wrong with the retail sector, read Next's results statement. Not a recommendation you'd hear very often, frankly, about most companies' financial reporting. But rather than seeming designed to confuse and mislead, Next's report crisply spells out the challenges it's facing. And of course it's not just Next that's up against it, it's the High Street as a whole. A stark reminder of the difficulties came just yesterday when ""value"" shoe retailer Brantano went into administration, its pricier sister company Jones Bootmaker is up for sale. One of the administrators said the fall in the pound and a change in shopping habits were key factors. Next's results reflect these trends in spades. Its annual profits have fallen for the first time in eight years and it doesn't seem in the mood to pull any punches. The most obvious challenge is the continuing gravitation to online shopping. Next Directory sales have been rising every year for the past 10. This time they rose by 4% to Â£1.7bn but sales in the stores - pretty much flat for the past 10 years - fell by nearly 3% to Â£2.3bn. It's still a significant chunk of business, and as Next points out in its statement, it's still opening new shops. However, it concedes that with increasing amounts of business being transferred online ""it is legitimate to question the long term viability of retail stores and whether the possession of a retail portfolio is an asset or a liability"". Its conclusion is that the stores are indeed ""valuable"" assets which will remain profitable ""even in very difficult circumstances"". Nevertheless it has painstakingly worked through a scenario of what would happen if retail sales continued to decline at ""high rates"" for the next decade, and it says the stores could be ""managed down profitably"". Another issue which leaps out from the pages of Next's statement is the change in what the UK consumer is prepared to spend money on. A new dress or pair of shoes is no longer the go-to quick fix of choice, it seems. Instead Next quotes Barclaycard figures which show the growth in spending on pubs, restaurants and entertainment, compared with High Street clothing in the last three months of 2016. ""We believe that these numbers demonstrate the continuing trend towards spending on experiences away from 'things',"" says Next. ""Shifts in consumer spending patterns are not unusual and we expect that the trend will stabilise and reverse at some point,"" it continues. Is it all gloom for Next's stores? As if the fickleness of shoppers were not enough, of course, consumers have finally woken up to the fact that higher inflation means their money spreads more thinly. The fall in sterling since the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of imports for the likes of Next, although it says it doesn't expect price rises to be any worse in the second half of the year, and ""they may be a little better"". Nevertheless, it doesn't see inflationary pressures easing until the second half of next year. Meantime, it says, inflation is ""slowly rising to the level of general wages growth and look set to continue to do so for the remainder of the year, we therefore expect a continuing squeeze on real incomes in the year ahead"". Added to this Next has is own internal problems which it's dealing with, including taking its eye off the ball in terms of stocking its ""heartland"" products. That is ""easy to wear styles that can be delivered in large volumes and great prices across several colours"". In short, Next reckons the year ahead looks ""tough"" with a ""combination of economic, cyclical and internal factors working against us"". But it's worth remembering this is not the first time Next - or retailers in general - have confronted such a mountain of adversity. Back at the start of the financial crisis in 2008, the number of retailers exiting the High Street seemed unstoppable. Woolworths went, and that was the last time Next saw profits drop. As chairman John Barton points out today ""by the following year our profits had started to grow again and our share price recovered strongly in the following years. ""I believe that by focusing on our core strengths as we did during 2008, we will see Next emerge from this period stronger than before"" he adds. Investors may well agree. Next's shares were up following the release of the results, and not just because they were a textbook example of how a company should get its message across.

How a seed is helping to save the elephant,"The tagua seed reaches 9cm (3.5 inches) in length, and can be carved like ivory Onno Heerma van Voss jokes that he never intended to be a conservationist, but he is helping to save the African elephant. Numbers of elephants in the wild are still falling; it's estimated 100 of them are killed by poachers every day for their tusks to meet the continuing demand for ivory. There are now only around 415,000 African elephants across the continent, down from as many as five million a century ago, according to global campaign group WWF (formerly known as the World Wide Fund for Nature). While the worldwide sale of new ivory was outlawed in 1989, the animals are still being slaughtered to fuel an illegal trade led by continuing demand in China. So what exactly is Mr Heerma van Voss, a 48-year-old Dutchman, doing to help protect the African elephant? He sells seeds. Onno Heerma van Voss had never heard of tagua before he moved to Ecuador Yes, you read that correctly, but these aren't any old seeds, they are instead rather special ones from South America called tagua. They are the off-white coloured seeds of six species of palm trees. They can reach up to 9cm (3.5 inches) in length and when dried become very hard indeed. So hard in fact that they are also known as ""vegetable ivory"". And like ivory, tagua can be polished and carved, and turned into ornate carvings or jewellery. From his base in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, Mr Heerma van Voss's company Naya Nayon has been exporting tagua for 16 years, and he says that sales are booming. Tagua has a very similar feel to ivory, but is a fraction of the price He now sells to 70 countries, including China, Japan and Singapore, as tagua grows in popularity as an alternative to ivory. And with China pledging to end its domestic trade in elephant tusks by the end of this year, Mr van Voss is hopeful that demand is going to jump even further. Using tagua as a substitute for ivory is nothing new. Indeed exports to Europe began in the 19th Century in order to meet the demand for an ivory-like raw material. This was used to produce ornamental items such as buttons, chess pieces, and decorative handles for canes. In fact, the scientific name for the six species of palm trees that produce tagua is Phytelephas, which means elephant plant, a nod to the ivory-like quality of the seeds. The white flesh of the tagua seed becomes exceptionally hard once it dried However, tagua fell into obscurity, so much so that Mr Heerma van Voss had never heard of it when he first visited Ecuador in 2000. Very much liking the country he decided to stay and set up a business, launching Naya Nayon to make and export wooden furniture. Then a year later he had a phone call. ""In the beginning of 2001, a France-based British lady contacted me if I could supply hand carved tagua figurines,"" he says. The seeds are harvested from six species of palm trees ""Anyhow, you listen to clients to make a company work. So I did it, and I started to like the tagua and slowly it took off. ""I always joke that I am a forced ecologist, but I actually really like this product."" Tagua seeds - which have a brown outer husk - can be dried in the air, or in an oven Mr Heerma van Voss now sells $200,000 (Â£160,000) worth of tagua per year that he buys from farmers. He and his four members of staff dry and slice the seeds ready to be turned into jewellery, with France being his largest market. The sliced tagua typically retails for $30 a kg, while the raw seeds sell for $6 a kg. By contrast, a kilogramme of ivory is worth as much as $1,100 in China. While Mr Heerma van Voss is preparing for a big upturn in exports to China, tagua does face two hurdles in the country. The seeds can be dyed into any colour required by a jeweller Firstly, even the longest tagua seeds are much shorter than the average elephant tusk, which limits the size of the ornaments that can be made from the material. And secondly, it lacks ivory's exclusivity. Hongxiang Huang, a Chinese journalist and anti-ivory campaigner, explains: ""As people become wealthier they want to buy luxury items, and ivory is one of the many things that people desire. This is the situation in China."" For buyers wanting an alternative to elephant ivory that still comes from a mammal but is ethically sourced, the answer comes from under the frozen Siberian tundra in the north east of Russia. It may sound bizarre, but the tusks from woolly mammoths that died tens of thousands of years ago are mined on a regular basis. While official figures are not available, an estimated 60 tonnes of mammoth ivory is harvested each year. Mammoth tusks can be used as a substitute for elephant ivory Mammoth ivory sold for an average $350 a kg in 2014, according to the charity Save the Elephants. This is about a third of the price of elephant ivory, but giant mammoth tusks in good condition can fetch far more. John Frederick Walker, an expert on ivory, says: ""Master carvers tend to prefer elephant ivory because fresh elephant ivory is easier to carve. ""But in fact, you can make wonderful things from mammoth ivory."" Yet with tagua far easier to get hold of than mammoth ivory, and considerably cheaper, it is the South American seeds that is increasingly being used by jewellers, and not the Siberian tusks. Demand for tagua in China is expected to rise after the ivory ban comes into place Marion Andron is co-owner of French jewellers Nodova, which sold more than 300,000 euros ($320,000; Â£256,000) of tagua jewellery last year. Ms Andron, 27, travels to Ecuador twice a year to oversee the production of the tagua that is done by seven local women at a cooperative. While Nodova's largest markets are France and the UK, it sells to stores across Asia and Ms Andron says that the forthcoming blanket ban on ivory sales in China offers a huge opportunity. ""I think tagua has helped diminish the demand for animal ivory, and I honestly don't think someone today can be ignorant about the slaughter of elephants with all the media coverage,"" she says.

Spain's female bodyguards who protect abused women,"Two bodyguards keep a close eye on a victim of domestic violence in the centre of Bilbao When Ana reported her male former partner for an assault at her home in Spain she thought she would be protected. In fact she ended up living as a prisoner alone in her own house, afraid to go out in case she was confronted by her aggressor once more. ""I was living in terror. The only thing the police gave me was a special kind of telephone to call if he turned up. But I didn't feel safe."" Ana went online to contact women's support groups and was put in touch with Carolina, a former police bodyguard now using her skills and training to keep women safe from violent men. Carolina had guarded public figures in the years before Basque separatist group Eta declared a halt to its bombing and assassination campaign in 2011. She launched private association Edemm in response to cases just like Ana's. Women who had gone to the police but were left unprotected by the judicial system. Some were murdered by husbands or former partners. Edemm describes itself as a Basque association for investigating men who mistreat women The organisation offers 24-hour protection free of charge, helping vulnerable women to shake off the paralysing effects of fear and to face the world. ""We are talking to the Basque regional authorities and political parties. I want this to become standard, to be rolled out across the country and we are training more female bodyguards for this work,"" she explains. Carolina lived with Ana for two weeks before the assault trial last year and remains on hand for moments when she needs company. ""I was wasting away and totally depressed,"" says Ana. ""I stayed in bed, I had stopped eating, lost 12 kilos and couldn't go out to work. Every time I heard a car outside, I felt panic. I did not go outside even to walk the dogs. ""She came and listened and said she was going to be with me. I wanted to hug her there and then but I thought it might not be ethical. ""I began to cook again, something simple like an omelette. She opened the windows and the blinds. She listened to me and I felt better every day. I could sleep properly again as I knew she was a professional bodyguard and I was protected."" A widow living on the outskirts of a village in Spain's Basque Country, Ana started what turned out to be a toxic relationship in early 2015. ""Now I know he was a classic abuser,"" she says. She describes being humiliated in front of her friends and psychological attacks that undermined her confidence. ""He would say that it was my awful character that had killed my husband, and that I was ugly."" The psychological abuse became so bad at times that she called the police four times during the 18-month relationship. But she was told that she could only get help and protection if she formally reported her partner for an offence. Eventually she ended the relationship in September 2016 when she caught him chatting with other women online. But, she says, he would not accept it. ""He kept calling, sending WhatsApp messages and SMS, some of which tried to be loving and others threatening, saying: 'I am coming to see you; you'd better be nice.' He used to spend hours outside my house, with me inside with the lights off and the blinds pulled down."" One night in mid-November, Ana relented and let her former partner in after he had been kicking at the door. ""He said he wanted to talk and would leave afterwards. I heard him out and said nothing had changed for me. I got him as far as the doorway and he struck me across the face with his hand.""

When she came to, Ana took the step of calling the police. But her problems got worse. At a preliminary hearing the day after the assault she was given a seat close to her former partner who, she says, tried to intimidate her. A social worker sent to visit her listened to her story and said they had both behaved like ""a pair of 15-year-olds"". Most of Edemm's bodyguards are women but it also employs men Ana reckons she has had to repeat her version of events six times to the various legal and judicial authorities before the trial found her abuser guilty only of ""harassment"", for which he was sentenced to 20 days of community service. A six-month restraining order was imposed on him but Ana says it still has not been confirmed by the court bureaucracy and is therefore not effective. ""Luckily, I always have this woman I can call. Had I known her before, I wouldn't have spent so many nights stuck in my house while this man was prowling outside."" 2004: Spain introduces new law in response to alarm over number of women murdered by partners and ex-partners; 72 women Harsher sentences for men found guilty of domestic violence Specific courts set up to handle cases faster and in a less threatening environment Over a decade, 289,000 abusive partners were sentenced, 96% of whom were men.

Why Sangin's fall to the Taliban matters,"Afghan forces have been under intense pressure from the Taliban in Helmand The Taliban's capture of the strategically-located Sangin, once considered the deadliest battlefield for US and British troops in Afghanistan, will increase the group's mobility in the north of the province and give it control of an important supply line with the provincial capital Lashkar Gah The Taliban has already captured a few of the 14 districts of Helmand, which borders Pakistan. According to some estimates, the insurgent group now controls more than half of the province, which produces the bulk of Afghanistan's lucrative opium crop. Reports say that the Afghan security forces pulled out overnight from the district headquarters and the main bazaar, after the Taliban launched a major attack. Afghan Taliban capture crucial town of Sangin World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new ""Great Game"" Mistrust and fear in battle for Helmand The Taliban insurgents had been trying to capture the Sangin headquarters for two years. The Afghan soldiers and police who had been fighting hard to repel the repeated attacks by Taliban fighters, at times complained about not receiving reinforcements and being short of ammunition and food. The fall of Sangin, one of the most heavily-populated districts in Helmand, also indicates the Taliban's growing strength in the south, and has a symbolic significance for the US-Nato led mission in Afghanistan. Sangin district was perhaps the most dangerous and deadliest for all sides involved in the war in Afghanistan. Both the US and UK lost more soldiers in Sangin than in any of around 400 other districts in Afghanistan. Ofthe 456 British lives lost in Afghanistan since 2001, most of them - more than 100 - were killed in Sangin over a period of four years. British forces were deployed in Helmand province in 2006 to secure it and prepare the ground for good governance and reconstruction. Although some progress was made by the more than 10,000 British troops based there, the fighting soon intensified, resulting in the death of many Afghan and British forces as well as civilians. British troops pulled out of Sangin in 2010 By 2009, the then Afghan president Hamid Karzai and American officials expressed dissatisfaction with the British performance. In 2010, thousands of US Marines were deployed to replace British troops and responsibility for security was transferred from the UK to the US in several areas of Helmand, including Sangin, Nawa, Garmsir, Marjah, Khanshin and Nawzad. Within the first 90 days of their deployment, around 20 US Marines were killed in Sangin. Since responsibility for security was handed over from international forces to the Afghan government in 2014, hundreds of Afghan forces have lost their lives defending Sangin. The fight to capture Sangin also took the lives of more Taliban fighters than any other battle for territory in Afghanistan. Afghan forces say they have made a tactical retreat from the centre of Sangin, which has been fiercely fought over for more than a decade. The Taliban's capture of Sangin will also have a destabilising effect on neighbouring Kandahar, a province of huge strategic and political significance, and whose capital is Afghanistan's second-largest town. The fall of Sangin is an indication that this year's fighting season might be even tougher as the group is planning to push even harder to expand its footprint throughout the country. The Taliban now controls more territory than at any point since the US-led invasion in 2001 which toppled its regime. Helmand governor Mirza Khan Rahimi had insisted that the Taliban would be beaten back The loss of Sangin underlines the challenge facing the Afghan government and its Western allies, who, according to US military officials are in a ""stalemate"" with the Taliban. The new US President Donald Trump has yet to announce his Afghanistan strategy, but it is likely to involve sending a few thousand more troops to help the approximately 13,000 personnel from Nato allies and partner countries currently based in the country. There are two possibilities now. The Afghan forces, with the help of US Special Forces and aerial bombing, might try to recapture the district as seen in some other parts of the country. Or the government will leave it to the Taliban, as they have done in a few other districts in Helmand, and focus on defending Lashkar Gah.

Is it safe to drink Fanta and Sprite in Nigeria?,"A recent court case in Nigeria has highlighted concerns that locally made soft drinks may be considered unsafe for human consumption elsewhere, as Ijeoma Ndukwe explains. There has been uproar in Nigeria after it emerged that the company that manufactures Fanta and Sprite, the Nigeria Bottling Company (NBC), has been ordered by a court to place warning labels on its products, stating that they are unsafe when consumed alongside vitamin C. The drinks are said by critics to contain high levels of the preservative benzoic acid and the colouring sunset yellow. NBC is challenging the ruling. The case has caused deepening concern in a country where Fanta, Sprite and Coca-Cola are probably the most widely consumed soft drinks. Barbara Ukpabi owns a grill restaurant which serves local food in Oniru, Lagos. She says she might stop buying Fanta and Sprite for the restaurant and also has concerns about giving the drinks to her children. ""I was thinking of reducing how much I drink of it. I'll be thinking of drinking less of it or going to other substitutes like juice."" Although like many Nigerians, the habit is hard to break. ""I just had my lunch and I had Coke and water."" Security guard John Uloko didn't see the reports about the soft drinks in the newspapers but heard about it via WhatsApp and hasn't drunk any since. The ruling was the result of a nine-year-long court battle initiated by Nigerian businessman Fijabi Adebo. John Uloko has stopped drinking Fanta and Sprite In 2007, Mr Adebo shipped Nigerian-made Fanta and Sprite to the UK to sell at his chain of shops in Manchester. His shipment was confiscated by UK customs, originally because of concerns about the authenticity of the beverages. But when the UK health authorities tested the products, they were declared unsafe for human consumption and destroyed. Mr Adebo sued NBC, Coca-Cola's franchise owner in Nigeria, which had sold him the products. They had refused to take financial responsibility for the incident. He later extended the case to include the food standards agency Nafdac, on the grounds that it had allegedly not performed its duty. Last month - nearly 10 years after he filed his case - a Lagos high court ruled against Nafdac and ordered the Nigerian Bottling Company to place written warnings on its Fanta and Sprite bottles.As NBC is appealing, the labels have not yet been added to the bottles. Mr Adebo told the BBC: ""Initially they were flexing their muscles, which dragged [out] the process. I went to court to compel Nafdac to do its duty. The warnings have not yet appeared as the ruling is being challenged ""We shouldn't have a product that is considered substandard in Europe."" His viewpoint is echoed by many, angered that products considered unsafe for consumption in the UK are legal in Nigeria. The case has prompted discussions about accepted standards in the country. Although benzoic acid is widely used as an antibacterial and antifungal preservative in acidic foods and beverages to extend their shelf life, studies have shown that the chemical can cause health problems in certain circumstances. A scientist based in Nigeria, who has dealings with Nafdac and asked to remain anonymous, says some human toxicity studies have shown that benzoic acid may react with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in soft drinks, formingbenzene,external. ""While benzoic acid itself is relatively non-toxic, when benzene is formed in the presence of ascorbic acid in foods it is particularly dangerous, as benzene is widely known to be toxic and linked to many forms of cancer. These include leukaemia and other cancers of the blood,"" the scientist said. The secretary-general of the Nigerian Medical Association says it is impossible to make a judgement about acceptable levels of benzoic acid without conducting a local study looking at health implications over a long period of time. Soft drinks may need more preservative in hotter countries Dr Yusuf Sununu Tanko says there are a number of examples where evaluations are different between countries because of differences in physical constitution, diet and environment. ""Each country has its own acceptable value of what is considered normal for what is fit for human consumption,"" he says. Nigeria's health ministrypublished a statement in response to the public outcry,external, reassuring Nigerians that the drinks are safe for human consumption. However, the ministry advises that medicines are taken with water to help ""prevent unexpected drug-food interactions"". Although the government has not spoken of enforcement, it ""encourages"" all bottling companies to include advisory warnings on all relevant products. The Nigerian Bottling Company has appealed against the court ruling.It says,externalthe levels of benzoic acid in its soft drinks are ""well within the levels approved"" by both the national regulator and Codex Alimentarius, an international food standards body. The company also says the ingredient levels set by countries for their food and beverages are influenced by factors such as climate, with drinks in hotter countries needing higher levels of preservative. It also says there was ""no proven case of negligence"" or finding that the company had breached its duty of care to consumers. The government's Consumer Protection Council has formally requested documents from the Nigerian Bottling Company ahead of an independent inquiry. With an appeal in motion and a government inquiry under way, this case is far from over. Can Nigeria clean up its dirty air?

'Defeat laced with promise for England',"This video can not be played Southgate 'very pleased' despite defeat Gareth Southgate's first game as permanent England manager, following a four-game spell in interim charge, ended in defeat - but it was a loss with honour here in Germany. The 46-year-old is charged with shaping the new era that was meant to be Sam Allardyce's province, but which ended after one World Cup qualifying win in Slovakia when the now Crystal Palace manager wascaught in a newspaper sting. Southgate ended his run in temporary charge undefeated, but this was the start of the serious business as he prepares his plans to take England to the World Cup in Russia next year. So what can be taken from the1-0 lossin Dortmund's magnificent Signal Iduna Park before Sunday's World Cup qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley? Gareth Southgate played 57 times for England Southgate has cut an impressive figure in his early days as England manager, and certainly here in Germany. He was calm and measured throughout, firm in what he demanded in his pre-match media briefing in Essen andcautiously optimistic post-matchin Dortmund. His insistence England must""get off the island""in a football context struck a chord, and it is clear he wants to embrace tactical flexibility and the factors that have made so-called rivals so much more successful. He experimented with a three-man defensive system England last used in defeat by Croatia in October 2006, a 2-0 loss that exposed the first cracks in the Steve McClaren regime. Southgate chanced his arm in circumstances that suited experimentation - this was effectively a testimonial for Germany striker Lukas Podolski, who scored the winner on a night when he was lavishly feted before, during and after (seemingly endlessly) by the home fans. And, while placing it in this context, it worked well enough and integrated the excellent Michael Keane to such an extent it certainly gave Southgate food for thought. To add extra lustre to this new era of open, non-island thought from Southgate and the Football Association, it was announced before kick-off thata memorandum of understanding has been signedwith the DFB, German football's governing body, to share ideas about coaching, youth development and administration. It was signed by FA chairman Greg Clarke and chief executive Martin Glenn in Dortmund and will run for two years, with DFB president Reinhard Grindel saying: ""Both parties have a tremendous amount of expertise and it only makes sense to connect and share this knowledge."" Cynics may suggest World Cup holders Germany's record of regular success, consistent excellence and history of developing world-class young players makes this potentially a very one-sided arrangement. What is does mean is the FA and Southgate flew out of Germany with tangible evidence of the determination to embrace a wider culture and a performance that at least illustrated the new manager's willingness to carry it through. Michael Keane (number four) impressed on his England debut And so he would, say those used to the years of under-achievement, unfulfilled promise and now the acceptance of England as a strictly second-tier football power following the embarrassment of defeat by Iceland in the last 16 at Euro 2016 that led toRoy Hodgson's resignationas manager. The debacle of Allardyce's 67-day reign only increased the feeling that England, as a football nation, was born under a bad sign. Southgate has to start somewhere and, even though this was his first defeat, he was well within his rights to suggest there were at least some shoots of recovery. He proved he is prepared to extend his net beyond the established order with the selection of Burnley's Keane, who did so well in testing circumstances, and West Bromwich Albion's Jake Livermore, who may not have been as eye-catching but did himself no harm. England's performance must be framed by the fact they were playing a second-string Germany who were effectively staging a testimonial for Podolski and rarely went through the gears - but it was still a display laced with promise. Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli confirmed he has all the tools to be an international player while Liverpool's Adam Lallana demonstrated the energy and creation that now makes him an automatic choice for England. Yes, England lost, but there was enough to suggest Southgate and his players deserved a break from negative reflection on this 90 minutes. Nathan Redmond made his England debut in Dortmund England were missing key players who will improve them, and give Southgate even further room for optimism. Tottenham strikerHarry Kane was a very obvious absenteefrom the squad to face Germany and Lithuania, perhaps more significantly than England's all-time record goalscorer Wayne Rooney, with the sense growing that the Manchester United man's international career is more or less over. Kane, sidelined with an ankle injury, has 19 Premier League goals this season and, while he has had a dip in form at international level, the 23-year-old has the quality to be a centrepiece for Southgate for years to come. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will add his growing authority to midfield when fit, while Tottenham's Danny Rose has matured at left-back. Elsewhere, Manchester United teenager Marcus Rashford, who featured briefly in Dortmund, is a shining light for the future in attack while Southampton's James Ward-Prowse and Nathan Redmond got a taste of the action on their debuts on Wednesday. John Stones only emerged in the final seconds but most shrewd judges see the Manchester City defender, still only 22, as a fixture in England's defence for years to come. Everton's Ross Barkley is in the form of his life at 23 after some big-stick cajoling from manager Ronald Koeman, and even 22-year-old Raheem Sterling's fiercest critics accept he is improving under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. It is the hope that has made life such a misery for England before - but Southgate was right to fly out of Dortmund in optimistic mood. Germany fans paid tribute to 'Poldi' before Wednesday's match Podolski scored his 49th goal for Germany, in his 130th and last appearance. This whole night was dedicated to this hugely popular and fun-loving 31-year-old. He gave a speech before the game that delayed the kick-off as a mosaic was formed in his honour at one end of the ground and, after scoring the winner, he departed to a standing ovation and the music from Gladiator. At the final whistle, he was joined by his Germany team-mates in a celebration of his career before embarking on a lap of honour that seemed to end when only stewards and those others in place to keep order were left. Podolski's farewell was loud, long, heartfelt and a tribute to a player who served his country so well, including inGermany's World Cup win in 2014. It was brilliantly stage-managed to pay full tribute - so will Rooney get something along similar lines from the FA and England? His England career may yet be over. Who knows? But, if he comes back, can he expect the Podolski treatment? After all, Manchester United's all-time record goalscorer has a better record than Podolski. He is also 31, and his 53 goals in 119 games for England mean he has eclipsed the great Sir Bobby Charlton for club and country. Rooney, out injured, was restricted to sending a""good luck"",externalmessage to his England colleagues, and he has been given no guarantees by Southgate either as player or captain. Germany and the DFB gave Podolski the most spectacular send-off, and he left the field to a prolonged standing ovation. But will Rooney get the same treatment, or even the chance to say goodbye, after an England career that stretches back to his debut against Australia aged just 17 years and 111 days?

What's at stake for Trump in healthcare vote?,"This video can not be played Will Trump seal the healthcare deal? It's time for Donald Trump, the man who bills himself as the consummate dealmaker, to flex his negotiating muscle - or else. The American Health Care Act, which rolls back portions of the Obamacare medical insurance reforms, is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives on Friday. The bill was initially scheduled to go before the House on Thursday, but was delayed amid concerns it would not garner enough votes. Even with the delay, it remains far from certain that there are the 215 votes necessary for passage.  Vote counts are like party RSVPs. You never know how many people will show up until well after the food is set out and the wine has been uncorked. What is certain, however, is that the stakes in this legislative showdown couldn't be higher as the White House has insisted the House press ahead with a vote. Republicans have spent the past seven years railing against Barack Obama's healthcare reforms, and if they fail to take the first legislative step toward repeal on Friday it will be a major setback for both the Republican congressional leadership and the president, who has put his reputation as a skilled negotiator on the line. In Washington, power begets power. Successfully wielding it makes you stronger, while failure reveals weakness and engenders future failure. A loss on Friday would force Congress to restart the entire healthcare repeal process - or, as White House officials threatened on Thursday night, abandon the efforts entirely. A return to the drawing board would delay work on the rest of their legislative agenda, including tax reform - a heavy political lift on its own - and an infrastructure bill. A full abandonment would embolden Trump critics on the left and the right in future legislative battles. The Republicans had set out an ambitious schedule for passage of the healthcare bill, with a Senate vote expected as early as next week. Any delay will probably push a final bill, if it can be achieved, well past the Easter congressional recess. This video can not be played What's in the Republican healthcare bill? Trump health bill: Winners and losers Will Trumpcare replace Obamacare? Is Obamacare more popular than ever? Concerns about complications resulting  from the bill's failure are likely not among the top concerns of rank-and-file Republicans in the House, who find themselves in a tricky position. Several conservative groups are putting this bill in an unwelcome spotlight, taking note of how lawmakers vote for their end-of-year legislative scorecards. The anti-abortion Right to Life will give positive marks for a yes vote, as will the evangelical Faith and Freedom Coalition. Grassroots conservative groups Americans for Prosperity and the Heritage Action Fund, on the other hand, have said they will make no a ""key vote,external"". In other words, House Republicans are going to hurt themselves one way or another. They face the unpleasant task of determining the course of least pain. Mr Ryan has been doing what he can to sweeten the pot for disgruntled legislators - although that has often resulted in the bill being stretched in different directions, like so much legislative taffy. How far can the speaker pull it before it breaks? Conservatives have been offered a rollback of federal mandates for ""essential coverage"" all health insurance plans must provide, the ability to add work requirements for the able-bodied poor on Medicaid and the ability for states to receive Medicaid money in block grants to do with as they please. A 64-year-old lung cancer survivor in West Virginia Moderates were given the promise of $75bn to help older low-income individuals pay insurance premiums and more funds to help states pay for coverage requirements they may wish to impose in place of the repealed federal guidelines. Despite all the drama, as far as bars for presidential success go, the House vote is a relatively low one. The speaker and his leadership team wield extraordinary power to shape the rules of debate in their favour and the amount of pressure they can bring to bear on individual members is great. If indeed the number of probable Republican ""no"" votes that need to be flipped can be counted on one's fingers, Mr Trump and Mr Ryan have a reasonable shot at pushing the bill across the finish line, although there may be some tense moments. There's also the possibility that if, as the hour of the vote approaches, its prospects appear to dim, uneasy House members will rush to the exits. While failure here would be a disaster for the White House, exposing the president as a paper tiger and the speaker as being at the mercy of his rebellious caucus, a victory only clears the way for tougher challenges in the days to come. The efforts to appease hard-line conservatives in the House will probably rankle Republican moderates in the Senate, some of whom - such as Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska - are already on the record saying the original Medicaid cuts were too steep. A handful of hard-line conservatives have also voiced their opposition. With only a two-vote majority in that chamber, three Republican defections will sink the bill (and that number drops to two if Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson, a reliable yes vote, can't quickly recover from back surgery). Senate passage, which looks tenuous at best, would then probably be followed by an attempt to reconcile major differences in the House and Senate bills, and then another round of votes in both chambers to approve the resulting compromises. After that, congressional leadership promises another piece of legislation with more substantive changes to the US healthcare system, such as paring back mandatory insurance coverage guidelines and allowing individuals to purchase from out-of-state insurance providers. Those measure will require 60 votes in the Senate to break a near-certain Democratic filibuster. In other words, it won't get any easier from here.

What to look out for in 2017,"It promises to be a vital season for Ferrari, Liberty Media, Red Bull, Mercedes and McLaren It is all change in Formula 1 in 2017. The cars are different - faster, better-looking and much more demanding. There are new driver line-ups - and new drivers. The sport has new owners, with big plans for the future. And it looks like Mercedes might not find things as easy as they have in recent years. So let's ponder what will be the main issues of the year. Ferrari: going like stink - instead of just stinking Ferrari look like they might just have designed a properly competitive car. Not before time, it should be said - it would be the first in nine years. The SF17 not only features obvious innovations after years of Ferrari being behind the curve in Formula 1 design, butin testing it has been going like stink. It is not the first time that a Ferrari has looked quick in pre-season. Usually, they have then fallen away when the competition proper started. But this year it appears to be different. No matter who you talk to, or how you do the numbers, the Ferrari looks genuinely quick. So much so that Lewis Hamilton said they were ""possibly the favourites"". The difference between this and last year's cars Ferrari have flattered to deceive so many times in recent years - their inability to produce a car that could compete with the best drove Fernando Alonso to distraction so much that he took the otherwise inexplicable decision to join McLaren-Honda. Inevitably, then, many in F1 are having difficulty believing that this time it could be real. Melbourne and the rest of the season may yet prove it not to be, but right now it looks like it is. And if Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen are genuinely in contention it will be something to see. At the same time, Vettel's contract runs out this year. Will he sign another? Or might he be tempted away by Mercedes? Stability has rarely been a Maranello strong point. On paper Hamilton is the boss in this pairing - but Bottas has had his bullish moments behind the wheel Lewis Hamilton has a new team-mate this year after Nico Rosberg decidedthe only way was downfollowing his title win in 2016. The latest man set the task of competing with the fastest driver in the world is Finland's Valtteri Bottas. Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff prised the 27-year-old out of Williams - at the cost of a lot of money among other things - because he saw him as the closest he could get to a like-for-like replacement for Rosberg. That means someone quick enough to keep Hamilton on his toes, and a team player who will not rock the boat. But three years alongside Felipe Massa at Williams have proved little about Bottas' ultimate ability to compete at the very top of F1. Bottas comfortably beat the Brazilian - but his superiority over Massa was nowhere near as great as was Alonso's when they were team-mates at Ferrari. Which doesn't necessarily tell you anything, but might. So will Bottas be another Rosberg - quick and dependable, talented enough to run Hamilton close but only good enough to beat him occasionally? Or another Heikki Kovalainen, Hamilton's McLaren team-mate in 2008 and 2009 - decently talented but hardly ever anywhere near Hamilton's level? Or better than both of them? If he's Rosberg, things at Mercedes will continue much as they have for the last few years - and Bottas will almost certainly be retained for 2018. If he's Kovalainen, the atmosphere in the team will be a lot more comfortable than it has been, but Mercedes might find Hamilton even more 'superstar-y' than he can already be from time to time - and Wolff will be looking for a new driver. And if he's better than both, things could get really interesting, really quickly. As much as Red Bull want to have the fastest car in 2017, it would bring their two super-talented drivers head to head - and not in a good way... Daniel Ricciardo v Max Verstappen was already a compelling watch in 2016, and it is only likely to get better this year. There is more hype around 19-year-old Verstappen than any young driver since Hamilton. And by and large he has lived up to it. A maiden winin his debut race for Red Bull last May was pretty spectacular - even if he was helped by the team inadvertently strategising Ricciardo out of the way. But even that paled into insignificance compared with his stunning drive in the wet in Brazil, a performance that drew legitimate comparisons with Ayrton Senna. The fly in the Verstappen ointment, though, was that over the season Ricciardo was the more impressive performer. He out-qualified Verstappen more often than not, and he out-scored him comfortably, too. In fact, Ricciardo was arguably the best driver on the grid last year. But neither that nor a controversy over his defensive driving tactics did anything visibly to dent Verstappen's sky-high self-confidence, and the Dutchman did seem to develop a momentum in the latter stages of the year, more frequently out-qualifying Ricciardo as the races went by. Ricciardo is a potential champion in his own right, but if Verstappen is to live up to expectations, he will have to start establishing himself as the faster and better driver this season. Verstappen will be as determined to do that as the feisty Ricciardo is to stop it - and don't be fooled by the Australian's sunny demeanour; he is as hard as nails underneath the smile. If Red Bull are contenders for regular wins - as many expect them to be - this one could go nuclear. Vandoorne enjoys another outing in the new McLaren If they repeat the form showed in pre-season testing, McLaren-Honda will be struggling to get off the back of the grid in Australia this weekend. That's with one of the cars being driven by Fernando Alonso, one of the greatest Formula 1 drivers of all time; and the other by a novice who shows every promise of being a star himself, Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne. The McLaren chassis does not appear to be anything special - although it is hard to tell, because the fundamental reason for this is the catastrophic performance of Honda's redesigned engine. After two difficult seasons since the start of their relationship with McLaren, Honda has effectively built a Mercedes engine this year, in the sense of copying their design philosophy. The problem is it doesn't go like one. In fact, it hardly goes at all. Will Honda have solved in the two weeks since the last test problems that stopped the car running more than 11 laps at a time, and left it nearly 30km/h slower than the best on the straights? Unlikely. Can they, ever? That's the bigger question. BBC Sport revealed last week that McLaren have already sounded out Mercedes about a future engine supply if the Honda relationship cannot be made to work. That will have come as a shock to Honda, but the question is, how do they respond? If there is as little evidence this year as there has been in the last two that the Japanese giant knows how to make a competitive F1 engine, then the writing could be on the wall. Alonso's future is also bound up on this. The Spaniard's contract with McLaren runs out this season, and he has already indicated that the new cars are enough of a step forward in terms of challenge for him to want to stick around. But if McLaren cannot find a decent engine, he will be looking for a new employer. Even if it is not immediately obvious who that could be. He's unlikely to want to return to Ferrari - and they may not want him back, although if Vettel left that could change things. Red Bull is a non-starter. One suspects Alonso might have Wolff on speed dial. Carey comes in to run F1 at a time when it is bringing back some of the historic features which made it great - such as fatter tyres, fierce cars... and moustaches One of the big questions heading into 2017 is how the new cars work, both in terms of challenging the drivers and improving the spectacle, and how the races might change. Hot on its heels is whennew owners Libertywill start to make changes and what they will be. Some of this is known - Liberty have made it clear they want to make a bigger promotional impact with grands prix themselves. Beyond that, the shape of the calendar will change sooner or later. Liberty is keen to establish new races in the Americas - north and south - and Asia. And less enamoured of what might be called 'propaganda' races such as Azerbaijan, where a grand prix is held in a country for no obvious reason other than to give its regime a cloak of respectability. Equally, former Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn has been charged with making the sport ""purer and simpler"". The controversial DRS overtaking aid is in his sights. But he will be looking far and wide - at how to change the design of the cars to make racing closely more feasible; at what the engine formula should be post-2020. While all this is going on, Liberty has to begin negotiations with the teams over new contracts - all but one of them are committed to F1 only as far as 2020. Up for discussion? A more equitable balance of payments. Ferrari's $100m bonus for, well, being Ferrari. And the political and decision-making structure of the sport itself. It's going to be an interesting year, all in all. Meanwhile - at the shops...

Trump Jr berates Khan after London attack,"Donald Trump Jr is now executive director of The Trump Organization President Donald Trump's son has come under fire for criticising London's mayor, shortly after a terror attack on the UK capital killed three people. Donald Trump Jrtweeted an article,externalwritten last year, in which Sadiq Khan said terror vigilance had become ""part and parcel"" of life in a global city. Mr Trump quoted the headline and tweeted: ""You have to be kidding me?!"" He angered many Britons who accused him of exploiting the tragedy and implying the quotes were made after the attack. Dozens were hurt in Wednesday's attack, when an assailant drove a car through pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and then fatally knifed a police officer who tried to stop him entering the Houses of Parliament. He was then shot dead. What we know about London attack Trump challenges Khan to IQ test Watch Khan's 2016 interview in full (Evening Standard),external Two hours later, Mr Trump tweeted an article from the Independent newspaper in September 2016. In the article, Mr Khan was speaking shortly before a meeting with New York Mayor Bill De Blasio, on the day after three bombs exploded in New York City and nearby towns, wounding 29 people. The attacks had given him a sleepless night, he said, as he pondered the dangers faced by big Western cities like New York and London. ""Part and parcel of living in a great global city is you have to be prepared for these sorts of things, you have to be vigilant, you have to support the police doing an incredibly hard job, you have to support the security services,"" he said. On Wednesday, after the attack in Westminster, the mayor said that Londoners ""will never be cowed by terrorism"" and that the city stood together in the face of those seeking it harm. Mr Trump's tweet incensed many British people on Twitter, including MP Wes Streeting,who called him,externala ""disgrace"" for exploiting the tragedy. Others accused him of implying that Mr Khan's comments were made after the attack. Mr Khan, London's first Muslim mayor, has previously clashed with Mr Trump's father, in January denouncing the US president's travel ban as ""shameful and cruel"". Last year, he accused the then-candidate Trump of being ""ignorant"" about Islam. Mr Trump responded by challenging the mayor to an IQ test.

Students among injured in London attack,"Owen Lambert said he was ""battered and bruised, but doing fine"" Four students from a Lancashire university were among the 40 people injured in the Westminster attack. Edge Hill University students Owen Lambert and Travis Frain, were hit as a car drove along the pavement on Westminster Bridge as the attack began. Mr Frain is having surgery to his leg, the university said. University Pro Vice Chancellor Lynda Brady said of the remaining 12 students, three were back home and nine others were returning. They were part of a group of 13 students - with a lecturer - on a visit to the Houses of Parliament. Mr Lambert, 18, from Morecambe, is understood to have required stitches to a head wound. Two other students needed treatment for lesser injuries. Quoted inthe Lancaster Guardian,external, Mr Lambert said he was ""battered and bruised, but doing fine"". He also thanked police and hospital staff ""for helping me through this ordeal"". The students are studying at Edge Hill University on Ormskirk Dr John Cater, vice chancellor of the university, told BBC North West Tonight the students were on the first day of a two-day visit to London. They had been inside the House of Commons watching Prime Minister's Questions two hours before the attack.

Viewpoint: Life in the land of 'candle princesses',"Fair skin is more of a beauty ideal than darker skin across Asia - in Malaysia fair-skinned women are known as ""candle princesses"". Writer Eris Choo shares a frank account of growing up in a society with rigid beauty ideals. Have you ever heard of a candle princess? No, it isn't an obscure fairy tale. In Malaysia, a ""Puteri Lilin"" is someone who can't stand being in the sun for too long. Just like a candle, she'd melt from the heat. It originates from an ancient Malay folktale. The term is now used to refer to people who avoid the sun like the plague, for fear of getting darker. I've never been called one but I certainly know my fair share of candle princesses. You can spot them easily with their talismans the mini-umbrella, protector of fair-skinned girls everywhere. Outdoor sports like basketball and volleyball are taboo for them. They favour daintier indoor sports, like ping pong. I had one ""candle princess"" friend who would walk out with me, but when it came to going out in the sun, would unfurl her umbrella.  Growing up, I used to think it was funny, watching girls try to cross our school yard without even a ray of sunshine touching their skin. It stopped being funny when I found out why it was much better to be fair than dark-skinned in Malaysia. In Asia, the preference for light skin has less to do with race and more with class. Malaysia has the same prejudices as many societies around the world and just like the Evil Queen from Snow White, we are a nation obsessed with being fair-skinned. Among the Malaysian Chinese community, fair skin has long been considered ""pretty"". And I'm sure many of Malay and Indian ancestry would agree. Dark skin has historically been associated with peasants, farmers and labourers. The rich didn't have to work on the fields, and therefore, had fair skin. And the media hasn't helped, often favouring light-skinned actors with so-called ""pan-Asian looks"". Whitening creams are also often best sellers. 'Meatball Sweethearts': Shaming the fat shamers in Taiwan #unfairandlovely: Women speak out against skin lightening Being a basketball player in high school, I was quite tanned. But I remember an incident when I sauntered into class with my team mates after a gruelling game. A classmate started laughing, and called us ""Africa"". Everyone else picked up on it and started howling hysterically. We didn't stop playing because we loved basketball too much. But after that incident I began to avoid taking photographs. I felt ugly standing next to friends with ""normal""-looking skin. It also didn't help that these ideas were often reinforced among my own family. Every time I went back for family gatherings, there were only two things my relatives would comment on: if I had lost or gained weight, and whether I had gotten darker or fairer. This will be familiar to many across Asia, but even worse was that I felt validated by their ""praise"" and ashamed when I couldn't achieve those ideals. Sun bathing: probably a big taboo with candle princesses I only truly broke free from this cycle of self-loathing a few years ago by hanging out with people who were positive and encouraging. I also met someone who told me I was beautiful every day, and who really believed it. Slowly, I started believing in it too. And it's true that the term itself is not entirely a compliment: it has a tinge of scorn shot through with the awareness that a candle princess is delicate, to be taken care of, not robust. The advertising industry is part of this. A recent TV ad showed a model dodging the sunlight and then a voiceover: ""The sun can damage not just your looks and skin, but your confidence! Use X brand for fairer, healthy looking skin!"" But this is a marked improvement from older ads, which blatantly promoted having fairer skin just to look ""attractive"". The candle princesses in Malaysia are still here but there are a few, small signs that society might just be changing. Illustrations by Shing Yin.
