Nationalised energy should be on the table - Sturgeon,"This video can not be played Nationalised energy should be an option - Sturgeon Nicola Sturgeon has said renationalising energy companies should be ""on the table"" to tackle the crisis caused by rising power costs. Scotland's first minister warned a ""looming disaster"" was set to get worse if the next household energy price cap rise comes into effect in October. Ms Sturgeon said Ofgem's next increase, to be announced on Friday, should not be allowed to go ahead. The UK government said struggling households will receive some support. Cost of living: Help is coming, says Kwasi Kwarteng Nicola Sturgeon to convene summit on energy costs How high will my energy bill go? Energy bills forecast to hit over Â£4,200 a year Last week the Scottish government estimated 36% of homes will be in fuel poverty. It is defined as the cost of heating a home being more than 10% of household income, after tax and housing costs have been deducted. Based on an Ofgem price cap of Â£2,800, by October the status would apply to 906,000 of all households across Scotland. Ms Sturgeon is to convene a summit this week with energy companies on improving advice and support for people struggling with energy bills. Scotland's major energy suppliers, including Scottish Power, OVO Energy, Centrica, Octopus and E.ON, will attend, as well as industry bodies and anti-poverty groups such as the Poverty Alliance and Energy Action Scotland. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland: ""I want us to come together to call on the UK government to take the action only it can take. ""There is a looming disaster that is already unfolding but it is going to get worse. ""This is going to cause destitution and devastation, this will cause loss of life if real action is not taken to stem this crisis."" She called for a cancellation of the next increase in the energy price cap, and for the financial support already offered by the UK government to be doubled. Ms Sturgeon added: ""This further increase in people's energy bills can't be allowed to go ahead because it is making it impossible for people to provide the basics for themselves and their families, but it is also continuing to fuel inflation, which, of course, is causing the problem in the first place."" The first minister said renationalisation of energy companies ""should be on the table"", but Scotland did not have the power to do that. Ms Sturgeon said she had argued for these powers to lie with the Scottish government but they needed to ""focus on reality"" as it stands now and push the UK government to act. She said: ""Let's focus on getting them to exercise the powers they have campaigned to keep in their hands rather than constantly deflect the questions to a government that doesn't hold these powers."" Boris Johnson hasagreed to talksbetween the UK and devolved governments over the cost of living crisis but no date has been set for the discussions. Meanwhile, UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said households struggling with the rising cost of living in the UK wouldreceive some help this winter. Mr Kwarteng, an ally of Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss who has been linked to the chancellor position, has not yet outlined how the government intends to support people. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,externalhe insisted Ms Truss' pledges to reverse an increase to National Insurance and introduce a temporary moratorium on energy levies were examples of her willingness to ""look at what more can be done"". The cost-of-living crisis has been driven by a series of issues, including inflation outstripping wage increases and record energy bills due to a surge in wholesale gas prices. Customers have been warned to expect annual household energy bills to reach more than Â£3,500 after October. Nationalise the energy companies: it's a slogan that is proving attractive to the public as they watch bills soar. And First Minister Nicola Sturgeon thinks it should be at least ""considered"" at Westminster, where they have the powers to make it happen. The first minister has previously engaged with the energy market. Before the current crisis, when it was felt energy retailers were over-charging, there was a high-profile conference speech pledge to set up a Scottish government-owned supplier. But as other suppliers went bust, that idea has been ditched. With 30 fewer retail suppliers than last year, and more concentration on the big five suppliers, what would public ownership mean, and how might it work? First, that retail sector of the market is only one part of the energy industry - the vast profits are being made by companies, or bits of firms, that drill and produce oil and gas and there are some big margins for those who do the refining. Retail is seen as the terrain where government could step in and replace private companies, perhaps with regional suppliers, such as we used to have until the 1980s. Those advocating public ownership say the UK government could buy out shareholders, through legislation. They would have to pay a fair market rate. If they don't, and simply seize the assets, that would surely skewer private investment in the economy more widely. Read more from Douglas here. Energy consultancy Auxilione used Friday's gas prices to suggest typical household energy bills in the UK could hit as much as Â£6,000 a year from April 2023. Labour has pledged to extend the oil and gas windfall tax to fund a freeze to the energy price capat its current level of Â£1,971 for six months. Stuart McIntyre, economics professor at Strathclyde University's Fraser of Allander Institute, told BBC Scotland rising energy prices was one of of the key drivers of inflation, which could exceed 13% over the next few months. ""I'd urge people to be sceptical of politicians promising quick fixes to what is a very difficult problem,"" Prof McIntyre said. ""What we need is a thoughtful, detailed redesign of energy markets, not something designed to win an election... to try and get something that will deliver more realistic and stable energy prices going forward."" Fish and chip shop owner John Pagani said energy price rises were going to ""sting hard"" The energy price cap only applies to domestic energy customers but business owners are also facing steep rises in their bills. John Pagani, who co-owns a fish and chip shop and cafe in Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, said they had been left with ""no wiggle room"" in their budget. ""We are coming to the end of our contract in about a month's time and it really is going to sting hard,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""The cheapest quote we've had is four times what we are paying now and that is going to be almost Â£5,000 a month, just for electricity."" He said profits had also been hit by VAT returning to 20% and fish prices going up, partly due to Russia's war in Ukraine. Chinese-made biodegradable packaging has also increased in price after Covid shutdowns hit manufacturing. Set up in 1967 by his parents, the business now employs 20 people but is once again relying on family to keep going. Mr Pagani said: ""This morning I was in at 06:30 and I'm working right through to 21:00 tonight. I'd rather have another member of staff in helping me but we simply cannot afford it. ""We as the the owners have to put in the extra hours and our families have to put in the extra hours because we don't get paid by the hour.""

English beach sewage not monitored properly - data,"This video can not be played Watch: Untreated sewage water released into the Sussex sea Water companies have been accused of failing to monitor sewage discharges at popular British seaside resorts. Data analysed by the Liberal Democrats found that many monitoring devices had either not been installed or do not work ""90% of the time"". The Lib Dems said the data showed a quarter of sewage discharges went unmonitored last year as a result of a lack of monitors or faults. Water firms have insisted they are committed to tackling the issue. In Seaford, East Sussex, where the beach is popular with swimmers and families, a monitor was only working a third of the time, according to a review ofdata from the Environment Agency,external. Southern Water wasforced to apologiselast week after beaches in East Sussex were closed due to untreated wastewater being released into the sea at the shoreline. Pollution warnings were put in place across more than 40 beaches and swimming spots in England and Wales after heavy rain overwhelmed sewer systems. Particular concern was raised over a handful of beaches that have bathing water status - including Littlehampton in West Sussex and Lee-on-Solent in Hampshire - where the Lib Dems said some Event Duration Monitoring (EDM) devices were not installed at all. Across Devon and Cornwall, one in eight of South West Water's sewage monitors installed at designated bathing locations were also either faulty or not installed, they said. Bathing water status is given to locations where ministers expect ""a large number of people to bathe"" based on past trends. Raw sewage was pumped into rivers and coasts around 375,000 times in 2021,down 25,000 from the previous year, according to the Environment Agency. The agency said it increased the number of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) monitored across the network from 800 in 2016 to more than 12,000 in 2020. All 15,000 will have them by the end of 2023, it added. The government previously said it wanted to reduce discharges into bathing waters by 70% by 2035, and eliminate 160,000 incidents of sewage overflows by 2040. Water minister Steve Double said earlier this week: ""We are the first government to take action to tackle sewage overflows. ""Work on tackling sewage overflows continues at pace."" Dr Imogen Napper, a postdoctoral researcher in marine pollution at the University of Plymouth, said for such goals to be met more ""investment and accountability is required from water companies to ensure this environmental disaster is not repeated"". ""The protection of our environment, and the community that enjoy it, is paramount,"" she told BBC News, adding it was ""environmental vandalism"" for raw sewage to ""enter our environment due to [companies] cutting corners and a lack of appropriate infrastructure"". When all monitors were considered - not just those in spots with bathing status - the Lib Dem analysis found that the water company with the worst record was Anglian Water, which had less than half (49%) its sewage discharges measured due to a faulty monitor or the fact one was never installed. This was followed by South West Water (30%) and Severn Trent Water (29%). Stanley Johnson, the prime minister's father, blamed his son's administration for the sewage problem, saying it should have been pressed harder. Linking the problem to Brexit, he said Britain's beaches got a ""clean up"" after joining the European Union in 1973. Without the ""EU push"", he added, the UK faces a ""very dangerous and difficult situation"". Both Anglian Water and Southern Water told BBC News work had already been done to improve the issue. ""All but three of the places designated for bathing in our region are rated as good or excellent for bathing water quality, and all have EDM monitors installed on them,"" an Anglian Water spokeswoman said. She added the company planned to have devices installed ""across all CSOs by the end of 2023"". Sewage hits dozens of UK beaches after heavy rain Tory MPs defend votes after uproar over sewage plan Yorkshire Water fined Â£1.6m for sewage pollution At Southern, a spokesman said the company has monitors on ""87.8% of our storm overflows, giving us the ability to report pollutions more accurately"". He added: ""This covers 959 of our 974 overflows - one of the highest levels in the industry. ""We have committed to Â£145m of investment to drive down pollutions by 2025."" Lib Dem MP Tim Farron, the party's environment spokesperson, described a ""national scandal"" in which water companies could be guilty of ""gross negligence by failing to install sewage monitors"". Meanwhile, a spokesman for water regulator Ofwat said it was currently investigating ""all wastewater companies"" in England and Wales due to ""concerns"" over how they ""manage their treatment works"". Cases are currently open in relation to six of them, he told BBC News, adding: ""Where we find issues, we will act"". Tory MPslast year defended themselvesafter 256 voted with the government to reject an attempt by the House of Lords to bolster the Environment Bill. Peers wanted to force water companies and the government to demonstrate progressive reductions in discharges of untreated sewage and make it standard for them to ""take all reasonable steps"" to avoid using combined sewer overflows. Some MPs said the proposed amendment was unnecessary, whileothers argueddumping sewage into open water was better than it coming into people's homes or businesses.

Singapore to end ban on gay sex,"This video can not be played Watch: The moment Singaporeans learn gay sex ban will end Singapore will repeal a law that bans gay sex, effectively making it legal to be homosexual in the city-state. The decision, announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on national TV, comes after years of fierce debate. LGBT activists in Singapore have hailed the move as ""a win for humanity"". The city-state is known for its conservative values, but in recent years an increasing number of people have called for the colonial-era 377A law to be abolished. Singapore is the latest place in Asia to move on LGBT rights, after India, Taiwan and Thailand. The government's previous stance was to keep 377A - which bans sex between men - but it also promised not to enforce the law in an effort to appease both sides. But on Sunday night, Mr Lee said they would abolish the law as he believed ""this is the right thing to do, and something that most Singaporeans will accept"". He noted that ""gay people are now better accepted"" and scrapping 377A would bring the country's laws in line with ""current social mores, and I hope, provide some relief to gay Singaporeans"". ""We finally did it, and we're ecstatic that this discriminatory, antiquated law is finally going to be off the books. There's a sense that maybe it took a little too long, but it had to happen, you know. Today we are very, very happy,"" gay activist Johnson Ong told the BBC. A coalition of LGBT rights groups called it a ""hard-won victory and a triumph of love over fear"", adding it was the first step towards full equality. But they also expressed concern over another announcement Mr Lee made in the same speech. He had said the government would ensure better legal protection for the definition of marriage as one between a man and a woman. This would effectively make it harder for gay marriage to be legalised. He said Singapore remains a traditional society with many keen on maintaining family and social norms. LGBT activists called this ""disappointing"" and warned that it would only further entrench discrimination in society. Meanwhile Protect Singapore, a conservative group, said they were ""deeply disappointed"" that the repeal was going ahead without assurance of ""comprehensive safeguards"". They called for the definition of heterosexual marriage to be fully enshrined in the constitution, as well as laws banning ""LGBT promotion"" to children. Singapore inherited 377A from the British and chose to retain it after independence in 1965. Though the law technically criminalises sex between men, it is effectively seen as a ban on homosexuality. As it has not been actively enforced in recent years, a thriving and increasingly visible LGBT scene has developed in Singapore, including gay nightclubs. But LGBT activists have long called for 377A to be scrapped, saying the law perpetuates social stigma against gay people, goes against Singapore's constitution which forbids discrimination, and has trickled down to influence other aspects of life. For instance, any content deemed as ""promoting homosexuality"" can be banned from broadcast in Singapore, and TV shows and movies have in the past been censored. The law is also at odds with Singapore's image as an open, diverse global financial hub and multinational companies based in the state have said it wouldhinder their efforts to attract talent. While many in Singapore still support retaining 377A, in recent years the call for its abolition has grown stronger, withsurveys showing growing support for LGBT rights,external. At the same time both LGBT activists and conservatives - many of whom come from religious groups - have mobilised on both sides of the issue. Protests and political gatherings are strictly regulated in Singapore, but every year LGBT activists hold the island's biggest civil society rally - known as Pink Dot - which draws tens of thousands of participants. Meanwhile, conservatives have organised social media campaigns and events calling for the preservation of traditional values, and some churches have promoted controversial gay conversion programmes. On Sunday, Mr Lee appealed to both camps for understanding. In his National Day Rally speech - Singapore's equivalent of a State of the Union address - he said: ""All groups should exercise restraint, because that is the only way we can move forward as a nation together."" LGBT activists in Singapore have consistently called for 377A's repeal Singapore is not the only former colony with a version of 377 - the law continues to exist in many parts of Asia, Africa and Oceania. It was introduced by the colonial British government in India in the 19th Century, and forbade ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal"". It soon spread outside of India as the British used the Indian Penal Code as the basis for criminal law codes in other territories they controlled. Several former British colonies such as Kenya, Malaysia and Myanmar still have some version of 377. The British law that left an anti-LGBTQ legacy in Asia Where it's illegal to be gay In 2018, India's Supreme Court abolished 377 in a historic verdict, prompting hopes among activists that other former colonies would eventually follow suit. In recent years, other parts of Asia have also moved to legalise gay marriage. Taiwan became the first place to do so in 2019, and in June Thailand approved draft legislation allowing same-sex unions.

Do new school uniform rules save parents money?,"Shoana Qureshi-Khan reckons she has spent more than Â£300 this summer on school clothes for her two sons A new law to protect parents in England from unnecessary school uniform costs comes into effect from September 2022. State schools will be forced to remove unnecessary branded items from their uniform requirements, allowing parents to shop around or hand clothes down more easily. However, Shoana Qureshi-Khan is one mother who has not seen the price of school clothes come down. She has still had to fork out for a number of items of clothing bearing the school logo for her sons aged 11 and 13. ""The school blazer alone costs between Â£45 to Â£60,"" she said. ""It's just a phenomenal amount that you just don't prepare for."" The boys are in the same secondary school and can pass on some items, but Shoana still reckons she has spent more than Â£300 kitting them out this summer. ""It is just crazy if I'm honest. I suppose I can understand one logo so the kids feel part of the school family, but it's just so unnecessary,"" she said. ""I can get something else from the supermarket for a few pounds. It's just not fair on hard-working families and pushes the equality gap further."" Shoana's story will ring true for hundreds of other parents. An issue for some is that September's new rules come with a loophole. It means schools which need to secure a new uniform contract with a supplier have until December 2022 to put that in place. They then have until the start of the September 2023 school year to introduce those garments. The new legislation requires branding to be kept to a minimum, but does not ban it, so some children will continue to wear some items with school logos, for example blazers. This video can not be played Emma Prosser, founder of the Uniform Project Nottingham, says that this summer has seen a âmassive increase in usersâ For those parents who struggle to afford school uniforms some help is available, from people like Emma Prosser who runs the Uniform Project Nottingham. She started off facilitating uniform swaps between the parents of children attending two primary schools. But demand has grown so much that she now has a uniform bank available to the parents of pupils at 19 schools across Nottinghamshire, where those who need it can access free uniforms. We met her surrounded by piles of jumpers, pinafores and donated warm coats. ""You have three types of parents,"" she said. ""Those who like to buy new, and like brands. Those who really can't afford it and really need the help. And also a growing number of those with a decent income but just don't see any sense in buying new. Buying second-hand is so much greener."" Now, Emma partners with local food banks to offer items of uniform alongside food staples and she tells us she's never been busier. But the logos place a limit on how easily good clothes can be shared. ""You have got to cater to your parental community,"" Emma said. ""You're not doing that if you're insisting on having logos and expecting everyone to have a spare Â£300 for each child they have."" While we were at the Uniform Project, a mum of four came in. She was emotional and did not want to give her name, but was relieved to receive free jumpers, cardigans, trousers, shirts and skirts for her family. ""I've been panicking,"" she admitted. ""To kit out my son in secondary, it'll cost me Â£98 because he has to have logo-ed everything except shirts,"" she tells us. ""When you're spending as much on one uniform as you do on a big shop, it's difficult. It's really hit us hard this year."" The Children's Society said it expected the average cost of school uniform this year to be Â£315 per primary pupil and Â£337 per secondary pupil, unchanged from 2020. But the charity, which helped push through the new legislation, believes it should empower parents to push back when uniforms feel too much. Chief executive Mark Russell said: ""If parents think that the school uniform policy hasn't changed in their local school, they should contact the headteacher, they should contact the governing body."" ""Failing that, if they are still not satisfied, they should contact their local MP or the Department for Education itself. The department will then contact the school and require them to implement the law."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""School uniform must never be a burden for parents or a barrier to pupils accessing education."" The new law coming into effect next month should help families to keep down costs, they added. ""We know schools and families are facing increased cost pressures more broadly, which is why this government is providing over Â£37bn to help households with the greatest need and supporting families through the Household Support Fund."" Unlike many other products at the moment, school uniforms have not gone up much in price this year. The difference is that for an increasing number of families, the ability to make a big one-off payment at the start of the academic year has become much harder to achieve. The new guidelines are supposed to help with that but there are a lot of grey areas, with parents and schools likely to have differing opinions of what might be considered ""necessary"" or ""reasonable"". Parents who don't think their school is complying with the new guidance are being told to approach the school's governors in the first instance. That's not an easy step to take, but the hope when this legislation received cross-party support was that a gentle reminder from parents that schools must comply with the new guidelines will be enough to bring most uniform policies down in price.

Dock workers striking for first time in 30 years,"Some of those striking were at the picket line early on Sunday morning Dock workers at the UK's largest container port have gone on strike for the first time in 30 years. About 1,900 members of the Unite union at Felixstowe in Suffolk are walking out for eight days in a dispute over pay. Unite said members rejected a 7% pay offer from the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company, which it said was below the rate of inflation. A port spokesman said the strike was ""disappointing"". A picket line formed early on Sunday as the strike began, and the union said it would be manned until 22:00 on each day of the walkout. Miles Hubbard, from Unite's regional office, told BBC: ""Very few people reported for work this morning. ""The picket line has been in place since 6am and we're getting great support from the public."" About 2,550 people work at the Port of Felixstowe - the country's busiest port, handling about 48% of the UK's container trade. Striking workers include crane drivers, machine operators and stevedores who load and unload ships. Strike at key UK port to cost 'stack of money' Port spokesman Paul Davey said the average pay for workers at Felixstowe was Â£43,000, and employees had been offered a 7% rise plus a single payment of Â£500. He said the offer represented an increase of between 8.1% and 9.6%, depending upon the category of worker at the port, at a time when the average pay increase in the country was 5%. ""We've got a shrinking economy, we're going into recession... I think that's a very fair offer indeed,"" he said. Speaking to theBBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme, he added the strikes were part of Unite's ""national agenda"". ""It serves their purpose well to have a strike here at Felixstowe... I know many of them [workers] feel they're being used as pawns in this game."" A deserted Port of Felixstowe on Sunday Freight transport body Logistics UK said it was ""not expecting massive disruption"" from the walkout. A spokesperson for the trade association told the BBC: ""Felixstowe is not a 'just-in-time' delivery port - everything coming in is scheduled well in advance. ""If it [the strike] goes on for longer than eight days then those using the port will be looking at alternative routes, but at the moment there is plenty of stock in the supply chain.

""So there will be disruptions, but the importance here is to ensure that it is limited only for eight days as they say. ""Prolonging this might mean we might have to divert where goods go, but infrastructure might not be able to cope."" Marc Ashdown, BBC business correspondent ""Don't ask for a pay rise."" That was the message from the governor of the Bank of England in the spring. Andrew Bailey feared the more money workers manage to squeeze out of employers, the higher inflation could spiral. Since then it has risen from 7% to just over 10% and is predicted to peak at as high as 13% over the coming year. That is why unions at the Port of Felixstowe say a 7% pay deal is not good enough for workers who are struggling with rising bills at home. And that is the conundrum facing both the bank and the incoming prime minister. How to get inflation under control while helping people with rocketing energy bills, increases in food and fuel prices, and rising mortgage and rent costs? It is an especially tricky puzzle, given that some of the factors currently driving inflation - the war in Ukraine, soaring wholesale gas prices and a general global downturn - are difficult to influence. But until the tide is turned and the cost-of-living starts to recede rather than rise, it will also be difficult to convince workers not to push for higher wage settlements. And dock workers at Felixstowe may not be the last workforce we see taking to picket lines. This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC spoke to Robert Morton from the union Unite and Paul Davey from the port Some businesses have expressed concern about the action. Adam Searle, managing director of haulage firm CP Transport, said if his firm did not move any containers this week it could stand to lose Â£60,000-Â£70,000. He said: ""Throughout Suffolk the bill could run into the millions and throughout the country a lot more. ""It's not going to affect food supply chains because all the fresh produce is already in stock, but it will affect the supply chain in terms of furniture, fences and random bits and bobs."" Derek Hailstone, co-owner of Mick's Cycles in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, said the strike had ""the potential to affect us as most of our stock comes into the UK through Felixstowe"". Derek Hailstone said his business was reliant on Felixstowe And Haulage company Turners of Soham in Cambridgeshire, which moves about 500 containers out of the port every day, said the walkout could cause problems. ""About 30% of our business is at Felixstowe, so it's going to have a huge impact,"" said Paul Day, managing director. Explaining the reasons for the action, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""Felixstowe docks is enormously profitable."" Together with its parent company, CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd, they could ""give Felixstowe workers a decent pay raise"", she said. ""It's clear both companies have prioritised delivering multi-million pound profits and dividends rather than paying their workers a decent wage."" Robert Morton, Unite national officer, also told the BBC: ""The people in Felixstowe aren't particularly militant and that's been shown by the fact there hasn't been a dispute for 30 years. But people are angry now a company who made Â£240m over the last two years are unwilling to share it with them."" He said dock workers were going to be paid Â£370 per week with strike pay. ""Our members are understanding of what they will lose, but they're looking at what they can gain as well."" Felixstowe is one of the largest container ports in Europe Meanwhile, the port said its staff union, which represents about 500 clerical and engineering employees, had ""voted to accept the same pay offer that Unite has refused to put to its members"". Unite said it had balloted the dock workers, not the clerical groups represented by the Port of Felixstowe staff union. Referring to the staff who had accepted the offer, a Unite spokesperson said: ""This group of members have the right to accept the offer from the company but Unite's dockers want to press for 10%.""

Britain win relay gold after Wightman takes silver,"This video can not be played Great Britain win men's 4x100m relay gold Great Britain's men's 4x100m team defended their title at the European Championships, after Jake Wightman had to settle for silver in a close finish to the men's 800m final in Munich. The men's quartet ran a championship record 37.67 seconds to beat France and Poland to gold. However, the women's team were unable to finish after dropping their baton. Gold for hosts Germany in the women's 4x100m meant they edged Britain in the final medal table. Germany finished on 26 golds - two more than Britain - as both nations ended with 60 medals at the end of a thrilling 11 days of competition across nine sports. In athletics, Britain finished with 20 medals - more than any other nation - with their six golds second to Germany (seven). In 20182, they won 18 medals, including seven golds. Great Britain win 60 medals to finish second in Munich Britain's 1500m world champion Wightman missed out on 800m gold to Spain's Mariano Garcia by just 0.06secs. The 28-year-old clocked a season's best one minute 44.91 seconds in the two-lap race, as Ireland's Mark English clinched bronze. This video can not be played Wightman takes silver in men's 800m The European silver completed a sweep of major medals this summer for Wightman, who also won Commonwealth 1500m bronze. ""I felt I was in the right place and I was just willing him [Garcia] to come back. I didn't quite have enough to get it at the end,"" Wightman told BBC Sport. ""I really went into this thinking I could win, but coming away with silver is a really nice way to end my season."" Britain lined up as defending champions in both the men's and women's 4x100m events - but the two teams had varying fortunes at the Olympiastadion. The men's quartet, which won world bronze behind Canada and the USA at the World Championships in July, stormed to victory as Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake brought the team home following legs by Jeremiah Azu, Zharnel Hughes and Jona Efoloko. ""Its a great feeling to come out with the gold,"" said Mitchell-Blake. ""To come out of it with the championship record is a bonus. It's been a true team effort."" The women's team had run the fastest time in qualifying - with only Spain also managing to clock under 43 seconds - as they looked to bounce back from their disappointment at the worlds. Germany top the final medal table with two golds more than Great Britain, as both nations finish on 60 medals Their medal hopes were ended in Eugene after Dina Asher-Smith pulled up with injury. Set to race the final leg on Sunday, Asher-Smith replaced Bianca Williams for the final, joining Asha Philip, Imani Lansiquot and Ashleigh Nelson. But Philip was unable to hand the baton over to second-leg runner Lansiquot, as Germany took the title in 42.34 ahead of Poland and Italy. ""This team is really consistent and so I'm really shocked about what happened out there,"" said Philip. ""I can't get my head around it just yet. We wanted to defend our title but things just didn't go my way in that race."" Asher-Smith said: ""We're such a strong squad, we know what we're capable of and we have a phenomenal time in us. ""Unfortunately this is why the relay is one of everyone's favourite races - there are so many factors to get right. Things do happen, it's unfortunate but it's OK, we will just grow from it."" Speaking on BBC TV, British sprinter Richard Kilty said: ""Britain should be dominating absolutely every European Championships in the 4x100m. We have the talent, we have big investment. ""Mistakes do happen and the girls will learn from it. I'm glad this has happened now and not next year or going into the Olympics, because that team is definitely a constant medal-winning quartet."" Jake Wightman could not quite catch Mariano Garcia in the final sprint In July, Wightman became the first Briton to win the men's 1500m world title since Steve Cram in 1983. However, he admitted he struggled to refocus following that success and said he was ""relieved"" to earn bronze for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in early August. Despite initially planning to go for three major 1500m medals this summer, he subsequently chose to switch to the 800m in Munich as a way to ""refresh"". The Briton ran a smart race on Sunday and was well positioned at the start of the final straight, but he was unable to overhaul Garcia in the closing stages. ""I really wanted to add the European 800m title to my world 1500m title and I felt in the shape to do it,"" Wightman added. ""The toughest bit [of the season] was after winning the 1500m at the Worlds. I'm pleased with how I managed to come back and I'm still running well. ""It's something that I can reflect on at the end of the season and be proud of - that I got something from each of these championships."" Britain'sBen Pattison, who won Commonwealth Games 800m bronze for England earlier this month, finished sixth in Munich in 1:45.63. In the women's 100m hurdles final,Cindy Semberclipped the second hurdle as she finished outside the medal positions. The Commonwealth bronze medallist started as favourite, with the quickest time of the field this season, but crossed the line eighth. Poland's Pia Skrzyszowska won the title in 12.53 seconds, Hungary's Luca Kozak took silver and Switzerland's Ditaji Kambundji earned bronze. In the men's 10,000m final, Britain'sEmile Cairessfinished 11th in 28:07.37, one place ahead of compatriot and World Indoors 3,000m bronze medallistMarc Scott(28:07.72). Meanwhile,Morgan Lakefinished tied seventh in the women's high jump final with a clearance of 1.90m.

"Help is coming with cost of living, says ministerKwasi Kwarteng, an ally of Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss, says the Treasury is ""working on options"".UK Politics","Households struggling with the rising cost of living in the UK will receive some help this winter, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said. The cabinet minister, who is a key ally of Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss, claimed the Treasury was ""working on options for the new prime minister"". But he fell short of outlining how the government intends to support people. Since declaring his support of Ms Truss, Mr Kwarteng has been linked to the chancellor position. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,external, he said he understood the ""deep anxiety"" price rises were causing, and acknowledged the ""millions of families [who] will be concerned about how they are going make ends meet"". ""But I want to reassure the British people that help is coming,"" Mr Kwarteng wrote. He went on to insist that Ms Truss ""will do all she can to help households across Britain"" if selected to become party leader and prime minister. He insisted Ms Truss' pledges to reverse an increase to National Insurance and introduce a temporary moratorium on energy levies were examples of her willingness to ""look at what more can be done"". In aninterview with the Sun on Sunday,external, Ms Truss also suggested families and businesses would be offered some kind of help with soaring bills under her - but she too gave little detail. She said every government ""has to look at making sure life is affordable for people"" and she is looking at help ""across the board"". The paper also reports,externalthat, under plans drawn up by the Treasury, doctors would be able to write prescriptions to give people money off their energy bills. Under the proposal, GPs would hold a patient consultation and verify they need help, before writing a prescription. Money would then either be given in cash or as a voucher. In a fortnight, we'll find out who is the UK's next prime minister. The cost of living will dominate the early days of Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak's government. Kwasi Kwarteng is a close ally of Ms Truss - and seen by many as the most likely choice for chancellor in a Truss government. He isn't providing new details of what she'd do today - he argues the new PM will need the full facts before making their decision. But Mr Kwarteng is seeking to provide some assurance: help will be on its way and the next No 10 operation will be able to hit the ground running. Some of Mr Sunak's allies question whether Ms Truss will be able to afford both her expensive tax cutting policy and a significant assistance programme to help with rising energy bills. Mr Sunak has provided a few more details of his intentions; pledging to cut VAT on energy bills and target extra help at those who need it most. But we won't know for sure what either plan means until one of them becomes prime minister in two weeks' time. The cost-of-living crisis has been driven by a series of issues, including inflation outstripping wage increases and record energy bills due to a surge in wholesale gas prices. Anew price cap- determining the maximum suppliers can charge customers for energy usage in England, Scotland and Wales - is due to be announced at the end of this month. It will come into effect in October - and customers have been warned to expect annual bills to reach more than Â£3,500. Energy consultancy Auxilione used Friday's wholesale gas prices to suggest typical household energy bills in the UK could hit as much as Â£6,000 a year next April. Mr Kwarteng gave no detail about the government's apparent plans to help households and businesses with soaring prices. Instead, he said this would be made clear when the new prime minister takes office. As one of Ms Truss' earliest backers, it is widely thought Mr Kwarteng will be handed one of the more senior cabinet positions, should she win. Reports have suggested he could become the next chancellor, but Ms Truss' campaign team insist no decisions have been made yet. How high will my energy bill go? Why inflation is worse for some people than others Energy bills could go up before October price rise The leadership race between Ms Truss and former chancellor Rishi Sunak will conclude on 5 September, with a winner announced and their top teams to follow soon after. At that point, the UK's new leader will have the ""full information and analysis"" to work up the ""best package measures that will help deal with"" cost of living issues, Mr Kwarteng wrote. He said energy independence will be key for Ms Truss, promising more nuclear power stations, offshore wind and a lifting of the ban on fracking in areas where there is local consent. Mr Kwarteng, an opponent of windfall taxes, added: ""Rather than slapping a punitive windfall tax, as Rishi Sunak has done, we need to incentivise investment in domestic oil and gas for our own energy security. ""I appreciate windfall taxes are sometimes popular. But popularity won't keep the lights on."" Labour has pledged to extend the oil and gas windfall tax to fund a freeze to the energy price capat its current level of Â£1,971 for six months.

Strike begins at UK's biggest container port,"Some of those striking were at the picket line early on Sunday morning Dock workers at the UK's largest container port have gone on strike for the first time in 30 years. About 1,900 members of the Unite union at Felixstowe in Suffolk are walking out for eight days in a dispute over pay. Unite said members rejected a 7% pay offer from the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company, which it said was below the rate of inflation. A port spokesman said the strike was ""disappointing"". A picket line formed early on Sunday as the strike began, and the union said it would be manned until 22:00 on each day of the walkout. Miles Hubbard, from Unite's regional office, told BBC: ""Very few people reported for work this morning.

Nationalised energy should be an option - Sturgeon,"This video can not be played Nationalised energy should be an option - Sturgeon Nicola Sturgeon has said renationalising energy companies should be ""on the table"" to tackle the crisis caused by rising power costs. Scotland's first minister warned a ""looming disaster"" was set to get worse if the next household energy price cap rise comes into effect in October. Ms Sturgeon said Ofgem's next increase, to be announced on Friday, should not be allowed to go ahead. The UK government said struggling households will receive some support.

Energy bills forecast to hit over Â£4,200 a year Last week the Scottish government estimated 36% of homes will be in fuel poverty. It is defined as the cost of heating a home being more than 10% of household income, after tax and housing costs have been deducted. Based on an Ofgem price cap of Â£2,800, by October the status would apply to 906,000 of all households across Scotland. Ms Sturgeon is to convene a summit this week with energy companies on improving advice and support for people struggling with energy bills. Scotland's major energy suppliers, including Scottish Power, OVO Energy, Centrica, Octopus and E.ON, will attend, as well as industry bodies and anti-poverty groups such as the Poverty Alliance and Energy Action Scotland. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland: ""I want us to come together to call on the UK government to take the action only it can take. ""There is a looming disaster that is already unfolding but it is going to get worse. ""This is going to cause destitution and devastation, this will cause loss of life if real action is not taken to stem this crisis."" She called for a cancellation of the next increase in the energy price cap, and for the financial support already offered by the UK government to be doubled. Ms Sturgeon added: ""This further increase in people's energy bills can't be allowed to go ahead because it is making it impossible for people to provide the basics for themselves and their families, but it is also continuing to fuel inflation, which, of course, is causing the problem in the first place."" The first minister said renationalisation of energy companies ""should be on the table"", but Scotland did not have the power to do that. Ms Sturgeon said she had argued for these powers to lie with the Scottish government but they needed to ""focus on reality"" as it stands now and push the UK government to act. She said: ""Let's focus on getting them to exercise the powers they have campaigned to keep in their hands rather than constantly deflect the questions to a government that doesn't hold these powers."" Boris Johnson hasagreed to talksbetween the UK and devolved governments over the cost of living crisis but no date has been set for the discussions. Meanwhile, UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said households struggling with the rising cost of living in the UK wouldreceive some help this winter. Mr Kwarteng, an ally of Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss who has been linked to the chancellor position, has not yet outlined how the government intends to support people. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,externalhe insisted Ms Truss' pledges to reverse an increase to National Insurance and introduce a temporary moratorium on energy levies were examples of her willingness to ""look at what more can be done"". The cost-of-living crisis has been driven by a series of issues, including inflation outstripping wage increases and record energy bills due to a surge in wholesale gas prices. Customers have been warned to expect annual household energy bills to reach more than Â£3,500 after October. Nationalise the energy companies: it's a slogan that is proving attractive to the public as they watch bills soar. And First Minister Nicola Sturgeon thinks it should be at least ""considered"" at Westminster, where they have the powers to make it happen. The first minister has previously engaged with the energy market. Before the current crisis, when it was felt energy retailers were over-charging, there was a high-profile conference speech pledge to set up a Scottish government-owned supplier. But as other suppliers went bust, that idea has been ditched. With 30 fewer retail suppliers than last year, and more concentration on the big five suppliers, what would public ownership mean, and how might it work? First, that retail sector of the market is only one part of the energy industry - the vast profits are being made by companies, or bits of firms, that drill and produce oil and gas and there are some big margins for those who do the refining. Retail is seen as the terrain where government could step in and replace private companies, perhaps with regional suppliers, such as we used to have until the 1980s. Those advocating public ownership say the UK government could buy out shareholders, through legislation. They would have to pay a fair market rate. If they don't, and simply seize the assets, that would surely skewer private investment in the economy more widely. Read more from Douglas here. Energy consultancy Auxilione used Friday's gas prices to suggest typical household energy bills in the UK could hit as much as Â£6,000 a year from April 2023. Labour has pledged to extend the oil and gas windfall tax to fund a freeze to the energy price capat its current level of Â£1,971 for six months. Stuart McIntyre, economics professor at Strathclyde University's Fraser of Allander Institute, told BBC Scotland rising energy prices was one of of the key drivers of inflation, which could exceed 13% over the next few months. ""I'd urge people to be sceptical of politicians promising quick fixes to what is a very difficult problem,"" Prof McIntyre said. ""What we need is a thoughtful, detailed redesign of energy markets, not something designed to win an election... to try and get something that will deliver more realistic and stable energy prices going forward."" Fish and chip shop owner John Pagani said energy price rises were going to ""sting hard"" The energy price cap only applies to domestic energy customers but business owners are also facing steep rises in their bills. John Pagani, who co-owns a fish and chip shop and cafe in Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, said they had been left with ""no wiggle room"" in their budget. ""We are coming to the end of our contract in about a month's time and it really is going to sting hard,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""The cheapest quote we've had is four times what we are paying now and that is going to be almost Â£5,000 a month, just for electricity."" He said profits had also been hit by VAT returning to 20% and fish prices going up, partly due to Russia's war in Ukraine. Chinese-made biodegradable packaging has also increased in price after Covid shutdowns hit manufacturing. Set up in 1967 by his parents, the business now employs 20 people but is once again relying on family to keep going. Mr Pagani said: ""This morning I was in at 06:30 and I'm working right through to 21:00 tonight. I'd rather have another member of staff in helping me but we simply cannot afford it. ""We as the the owners have to put in the extra hours and our families have to put in the extra hours because we don't get paid by the hour.""

"Barristers voting on all-out strike callThe industrial action, which follows weeks of walkouts in England and Wales, would start on 5 September.UK","Lawyers outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London on 4 July as they strike in a dispute over pay Barristers are voting on proposals for an all-out strike next month as part of an ongoing row with the government over pay and legal aid cuts. The indefinite, uninterrupted strike - which comesafter weeks of walkouts- would start on 5 September. The ballot closes at midnight on Sunday and the result is expected on Monday. More than 6,000 court hearings have been disrupted in England and Wales as a result of the walkouts by members of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA). The CBA is asking for a 25% rise in pay for legal aid work, representing people who could not otherwise afford lawyers. Criminal barristers are due to receive a 15% fee rise from the end of September, with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) saying the increase would see the average barrister earn about Â£7,000 more annually. But members of the CBA have rejected the government's pay offer, saying it would not kick in immediately or apply to existing cases. Barristers walk out of courts over pay Barristers to strike every other week from August Victim's father backs barristers' strike action During the first 19 days of industrial action between 27 June and 5 August, 6,235 court cases were disrupted, including 1,415 trials, across England and Wales, according to MoJ data. The CBA said the walkouts have had a ""devastating impact on the ability of our Crown Courts to function with any semblance of normality"". It added that ""the continuing refusal of the justice secretary to negotiate a fair settlement with criminal barristers comes at a very heavy price"", measured both by the financial waste of courtrooms sitting idle and by the impact on complainants, defendants and witnesses. The CBA said members had indicated that there ""should be no pausing or halting of the ongoing programme of strike action"". ""Given the expectation that the ongoing strike action will inevitably lead to the progressive incapacitation of court business, there is no doubt that resolving this dispute will be the critical priority of any incoming justice secretary,"" the CBA added. An MoJ spokesman said: ""The only outcome of escalating strike action is further distress for victims forced to wait longer for justice."" The MoJ added that backdating pay would require a ""fundamental change"" in how fees are paid. ""That reform would cost a disproportionate amount of taxpayers' money and would take longer to implement, meaning barristers would have to wait longer for payment,"" a spokesperson said.

Port strike to cost 'stack of money',"The Port of Felixstowe is the UK's largest container port Workers in Felixstowe, Suffolk, are striking in a row about their pay, with eight days of industrial action at the UK's largest container port. What could it mean for those reliant on goods coming in to the port? About 2,550 people work at the Port of Felixstowe, which is the UK's biggest container port, handling 48% of container trade. About 1,900 Unite members walked out from 07:00 BST for eight days, after rejecting a 7% pay offer from Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company, which operates the port. The offer also includes a one-off Â£500 payment. Unite says the pay offer is ""significantly below"" the rate of inflation but the port insists it is a ""very respectable offer"". Which workers are allowed to go on strike? Paul Day, manager of Turners (Soham), says the strike will be very costly for his haulage company ""About 30% of our business is at Felixstowe, so it's going to have a huge impact,"" says Paul Day, managing director of haulage company Turners (Soham). The Cambridgeshire company moves about 500 containers out of the port every day. ""We might be able to keep operating for two or three days but I can't see we'll be able to after that,"" he says. ""It will cost us a stack of money, but all I can do is optimise what we can do and try to minimise the damage - but the damage is coming."" Derek Hailstone, owner of Mick's Cycles in Bury St Edmunds, is concerned about the potential impact of the strikes at Felixstowe Port Derek Hailstone, co-owner of Mick's Cycles, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says the majority of his stock comes in through Felixstowe. The company has been trading in the Suffolk town since 1970. 'I want to see how big this ship is and it's huge' Felixstowe port workers to strike after talks fail Port health team finds fish tongue parasite ""The strikes have the potential to affect us, as most of our stock comes into the UK through Felixstowe,"" he says. ""A lot will depend on how much stock is already being held in Felixstowe and whether that can come out of the port."" He says the key factor for his business would be whether the shipments headed for Felixstowe can be diverted to other ports around the UK. ""If they divert to other ports, then we'll be OK,"" he says. Haydyn Rowlandson, traffic operator for Felixstowe haulage company Openultra, says customers want to know what is happening Haydyn Rowlandson, traffic operator for Openultra haulage company, based in Felixstowe, says collecting deliveries from other ports would mean additional costs for customers. ""Vessels are being diverted to ports such as Southampton but, clearly, if we have to go there, it significantly changes the rate of the job,"" he says. ""One collection would cost hundreds of pounds more as there is extra wear and tear, the additional fuel and driver hours."" But the looming strike is already having an effect on business. ""We have had to stand vehicles down, we have had to stand drivers down and the workload has been minimal in comparison with the last few weeks,"" he says. ""Customers are ringing us up on a daily basis and asking if we know what is happening. ""They're taking a hit, we are taking a hit - and the country is taking a hit, too."" Delays could impact on the consumer, an expert warns James Hookham, director of Global Shippers Forum, says: ""We are just entering peak season for consumer goods movements in UK international trade and transport. ""From now on, ships will be arriving from the Far East in increasing numbers, with containers of goods destined for retail outlets and online distribution centres to be ready for the three peaks in retail sales - Halloween (half-term holidays), Black Friday (last weekend in November) and Christmas."" He says a prolonged strike ""has the potential to disrupt the UK's consumer supply chains at a critical period"". ""These containers are moving aboard some of the biggest ships in the world - think Ever Given - and are moving in such numbers and frequency that other routes or transport modes (overland by rail from China to Europe, or by air cargo) simply don't have the capacity to handle these numbers, at such short notice,"" he says. ""Consumer prices are already rising due to the dramatic increases in shipping rates experienced since mid-2020. ""Further disruption in the UK will add to these cost pressures, although temporary unavailability of some goods may be the first noticeable effect to consumers."" Unite's general secretary Sharon Graham says the port workforce deserves ""a fair day's pay"" Unite says eight days of strike action at the port will run until 29 August. Its general secretary Sharon Graham says: ""Felixstowe docks is enormously profitable. The latest figures show that in 2020 it made Â£61m in profits. Its parent company, CK Hutchison Holding Ltd, is so wealthy that, in the same year, it handed out Â£99m to its shareholders. ""So they can give Felixstowe workers a decent pay raise. So they should do so. It's clear both companies have prioritised delivering multi-million pound profits and dividends rather than paying their workers a decent wage."" She says the union is ""entirely focused on enhancing its members' jobs, pay and conditions and it will be giving the workers at Felixstowe its complete support until this dispute is resolved and a decent pay increase is secured"". The port handles about 48% of the UK container trade ""I think we've made a very respectable offer,"" says Paul Davey, spokesman for the port. ""The 7% plus Â£500 means this year it's an increase of between 8.1% and 9.6% depending upon the category of worker at the port, and I think at a time when the average pay increase in the country is 5% - we've got a shrinking economy, we're going into recession - as a country I think that's a very fair offer indeed. ""Unite head office have refused the pay deal on behalf of their employees locally. We know a lot of the employees locally would be quite happy to accept that."" The Bank of England has warned the UK willfall into recession in the final three months of this yearwhen inflation is set to hit more than 13%. He says some shipping companies have brought forward shipment dates while others have delayed them to avoid the strike period. He adds: ""It will have an impact - it won't be catastrophic. ""It's not great news for the logistics and the supply chain but they will work around it. There won't be shortages of goods or anything like that.""

Over-50s turn to house-shares to beat rising rents,"Karen has been housesharing for five years The rising cost of renting and buying a house has led to more over-50s looking for house and flat-shares, according to property-sharing websites. It's something that is normally associated with younger people but what is it like sharing when you're over 50? Karen Miles, 66, moved into a 13-person house five years ago to save money. She was previously living in a one-bedroom flat just outside Eastbourne but struggled to cover her bills alongside rent of around Â£560 a month. Now she pays Â£500 a month for a room, excluding bills, in a shared house in the town. Her housemates are a mix of ages, ranging from early-20s to early-50s. While she gets on with everyone, they don't tend to socialise together and Karen, who works part-time as a housekeeper, said sharing with younger people can pose problems. 'Spending lockdown with my 88-year-old flatmate' Shortage of homes to rent leads to bidding wars She has previously had issues with some flatmates being noisy and the shared kitchen and bathroom can get dirty quickly. However, she said there were also benefits of having other people around to chat to. ""If I moved in somewhere on my own, I think I probably would feel a bit lonely,"" she added. Karen has tried to look for a one-bedroom flat to rent but with prices increasing she has struggled to find something affordable. She would also like to share with friends but said it can be difficult for older people to find someone of a similar age to rent with. ""My friends have got husbands and family so it's hard,"" she said. Leading flat-sharing site SpareRoom said it had seen a 239% increase in 55 to 64-year-olds looking for house-shares since 2011 and a 114% increase for the 45-to-54 age group. However people aged 25 to 34 years old still make up the majority of sharers. SpareRoom communications director Matt Hutchinson said the primary reason more older people were house-sharing was affordability. He told BBC News the increased cost of renting and buying a home meant more people were sharing for longer and becoming ""lifetime renters"", while people who had come out of long-term relationships and might originally have bought or rented a one-bedroom flat were now ""priced out"". Mr Hutchinson said he expected the trend to continue as housing and other costs increased further. Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown,said official figures also suggest renters are getting older,external. She added that figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest the cost of living crisis is felt more by renters than homeowners,external, as they spend a greater proportion of their income on housing. They are also more exposed to rent increases as many mortgage-holders are on fixed rates. Rental prices in the UK have been increasing steadily since Covid restrictions were eased in the summer of 2021,according to the ONS,external. High demand has contributed to rental prices increasing by 3.2% in the 12 months to July - the largest annual growth rate since January 2016. For April to June,property website Rightmove found average asking rents outside London hit a record Â£1,126 per month,external- up 11.8% on the same period last year. Cohabitas, a website which advertises house-shares for people over-40, also said it had seen increased demand from older age groups since it was founded in 2016. Over the past six months, it said it had seen a 44% increase in users compared to the same period last year. For 55 to 64-year-olds the increase was 51%, while for 45 to 54-year-olds it was 35%. Co-founder Eva Orasch said the long-term trends driving the increase in sharing among older age groups were the UK's ageing population and increased house prices. In the short-term, she said the rising cost of living and the pandemic were also contributing, with some people no longer wanting to live alone after lockdown. In a 2021 survey of more than 1,500 users, the website found 45% of respondents had chosen to share for purely financial reasons, while 48% were sharing for both financial and social reasons. Susan used to live on her own but has started housesharing to save money Susan Laybourn, 58, also started house-sharing to save money in March 2020. Most recently she has been sharing with a live-in landlady who is a similar age to her, as well as a man in his 20s, in Trefnant, north Wales. After getting a job in the area, Susan, who works as a locum podiatrist for the NHS, could not find anywhere affordable to rent on her own. Many houses in the area are let as holiday homes and Susan said demand for rented properties already outstripped supply. ""At one point, I did consider just trying to find somewhere on my own and there was a couple of flats going in Rhyl, which is nearby,"" she said. ""But by the time I rang up to inquire about them they said 'oh, sorry, they're already gone'."" She added that not having a permanent job and often needing a shorter-term rental contract because of this also counted against her when trying to find somewhere to rent. Young people living in tents due to house prices Rental costs jump as workers return to the office Ideally, Susan said she would prefer to live alone or with just one other person her own age - and she could afford to do so - but it was much cheaper to share. Her current room is Â£400 a month including bills. ""If I could find anywhere here on my own I'd probably be paying at least Â£200 more just for the rent, and then you've got bills on top,"" she said. ""And when you hear about energy bills are going to go through the roof and everything, I think I'm glad I'm not private renting [on my own] because I feel like I'd just be wasting money, when I could be saving it."" She would also like to buy her own flat in the future but believes her age and lack of permanent job means she would not be able to get a mortgage. Susan said she did enjoy having company, especially when moving to a new area, and she gets on well with her live-in landlady. However, she said it can be hard to find someone her own age to share with as there is still a stigma associated with older people house-sharing. In the past she said she felt ""almost ashamed"" that she was not able to rent her own place. ""I've kind of come to terms with it now and try to see the positives in it, rather than the negatives.""

Strike set to begin at UK's biggest container port,"Some of those striking were at the picket line early on Sunday morning Dock workers at the UK's largest container port have gone on strike for the first time in 30 years. About 1,900 members of the Unite union at Felixstowe in Suffolk are walking out for eight days in a dispute over pay. Unite said members rejected a 7% pay offer from the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company, which it said was below the rate of inflation. A port spokesman said the strike was ""disappointing"". A picket line formed early on Sunday as the strike began, and the union said it would be manned until 22:00 on each day of the walkout. Miles Hubbard, from Unite's regional office, told BBC: ""Very few people reported for work this morning. ""The picket line has been in place since 6am and we're getting great support from the public."" About 2,550 people work at the Port of Felixstowe - the country's busiest port, handling about 48% of the UK's container trade. Striking workers include crane drivers, machine operators and stevedores who load and unload ships. Strike at key UK port to cost 'stack of money' Port spokesman Paul Davey said the average pay for workers at Felixstowe was Â£43,000, and employees had been offered a 7% rise plus a single payment of Â£500. He said the offer represented an increase of between 8.1% and 9.6%, depending upon the category of worker at the port, at a time when the average pay increase in the country was 5%. ""We've got a shrinking economy, we're going into recession... I think that's a very fair offer indeed,"" he said. Speaking to theBBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme, he added the strikes were part of Unite's ""national agenda"". ""It serves their purpose well to have a strike here at Felixstowe... I know many of them [workers] feel they're being used as pawns in this game."" A deserted Port of Felixstowe on Sunday Freight transport body Logistics UK said it was ""not expecting massive disruption"" from the walkout. A spokesperson for the trade association told the BBC: ""Felixstowe is not a 'just-in-time' delivery port - everything coming in is scheduled well in advance. ""If it [the strike] goes on for longer than eight days then those using the port will be looking at alternative routes, but at the moment there is plenty of stock in the supply chain. Others have already been planning alternative routes - we're not expecting panic."" The spokesperson added: ""As an industry, we are incredibly flexible and have been working for a while to put these goods into alternative ports if they have to be."" Major shipping group Maersk warned,externalthat it expected the strike to cause serious disruption with some vessels significantly delayed. Dr Kamran Mahroof, associate professor in supply chain analytics at the University of Bradford, told the BBC: ""Although a lot of the goods that pass through this particular port might be your fridges and laptops, there will be a lot of frozen goods foods that might also be passing through this channel. ""So there will be disruptions, but the importance here is to ensure that it is limited only for eight days as they say. ""Prolonging this might mean we might have to divert where goods go, but infrastructure might not be able to cope."" Marc Ashdown, BBC business correspondent ""Don't ask for a pay rise."" That was the message from the governor of the Bank of England in the spring. Andrew Bailey feared the more money workers manage to squeeze out of employers, the higher inflation could spiral. Since then it has risen from 7% to just over 10% and is predicted to peak at as high as 13% over the coming year. That is why unions at the Port of Felixstowe say a 7% pay deal is not good enough for workers who are struggling with rising bills at home. And that is the conundrum facing both the bank and the incoming prime minister. How to get inflation under control while helping people with rocketing energy bills, increases in food and fuel prices, and rising mortgage and rent costs? It is an especially tricky puzzle, given that some of the factors currently driving inflation - the war in Ukraine, soaring wholesale gas prices and a general global downturn - are difficult to influence. But until the tide is turned and the cost-of-living starts to recede rather than rise, it will also be difficult to convince workers not to push for higher wage settlements. And dock workers at Felixstowe may not be the last workforce we see taking to picket lines. This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC spoke to Robert Morton from the union Unite and Paul Davey from the port Some businesses have expressed concern about the action. Adam Searle, managing director of haulage firm CP Transport, said if his firm did not move any containers this week it could stand to lose Â£60,000-Â£70,000. He said: ""Throughout Suffolk the bill could run into the millions and throughout the country a lot more. ""It's not going to affect food supply chains because all the fresh produce is already in stock, but it will affect the supply chain in terms of furniture, fences and random bits and bobs."" Derek Hailstone, co-owner of Mick's Cycles in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, said the strike had ""the potential to affect us as most of our stock comes into the UK through Felixstowe"". Derek Hailstone said his business was reliant on Felixstowe And Haulage company Turners of Soham in Cambridgeshire, which moves about 500 containers out of the port every day, said the walkout could cause problems. ""About 30% of our business is at Felixstowe, so it's going to have a huge impact,"" said Paul Day, managing director. Explaining the reasons for the action, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""Felixstowe docks is enormously profitable."" Together with its parent company, CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd, they could ""give Felixstowe workers a decent pay raise"", she said. ""It's clear both companies have prioritised delivering multi-million pound profits and dividends rather than paying their workers a decent wage."" Robert Morton, Unite national officer, also told the BBC: ""The people in Felixstowe aren't particularly militant and that's been shown by the fact there hasn't been a dispute for 30 years. But people are angry now a company who made Â£240m over the last two years are unwilling to share it with them."" He said dock workers were going to be paid Â£370 per week with strike pay. ""Our members are understanding of what they will lose, but they're looking at what they can gain as well."" Felixstowe is one of the largest container ports in Europe Meanwhile, the port said its staff union, which represents about 500 clerical and engineering employees, had ""voted to accept the same pay offer that Unite has refused to put to its members"". Unite said it had balloted the dock workers, not the clerical groups represented by the Port of Felixstowe staff union. Referring to the staff who had accepted the offer, a Unite spokesperson said: ""This group of members have the right to accept the offer from the company but Unite's dockers want to press for 10%."" Strike action at the port is expected to last until Monday 29 August. How is your business being affected by the Felixstowe strike? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.
