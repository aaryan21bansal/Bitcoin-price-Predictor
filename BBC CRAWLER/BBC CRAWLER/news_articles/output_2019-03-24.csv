"In pictures: Life after the ArmyThe 'controlled chaos' of raising sextuplets'A leader with love on full display'Don't worry, Lorraine Kelly isn't being fake","Photographer Ed Gold interviewed soldiers who served in Afghanistan and asked them about their experiences of adjusting to civilian life. Soldiers Callum Wright, Scott Meenagh, Geoff Dunn, Dan Eccles and Terry Jones all served in the Parachute Regiment, known as the Paras. Ed worked with the Paras as a photojournalist in the UK and in Afghanistan, taking thousands of images of army life. The photos shown here document the Para soldiers between July 2010 and July 2011 and when he caught up with them again in  2018 after they left the Army. Callum Wright, 29, followed in the footsteps of three generations of his family and joined the Army, when he was 19. Initially, Callum wanted to be a tank transporter like his two older brothers but then decided he would rather be in the ""nitty gritty"" of combat and to push himself further. He chose the Parachute Regiment, despite the high failure rate. Out of 72 people in his intake group, he was one of only 10 who made it through to becoming part of the elite airborne infantry regiment. Callum did one tour of Afghanistan. But after returning to the UK, he felt restless in the Army. ""When I got back, I got bored,"" he says. ""It was the same mundane [work] day in, day out. ""For me, when I knew the Afghan [tour] was coming up and when I was out there, I felt that I mattered and I was doing something that mattered. ""But that feeling disappeared when we were back in the barracks."" After being unable to transfer to the unit that his brothers were in, Callum decided to leave the Army and start a new chapter in his life with his wife. He became a personal trainer and also worked in a whisky distillery. But civilian life didn't suit Callum for long and, after 14 months, he returned to the Army, as a tank transporter. ""That feeling, 'I have more to give,' came back, almost like a regret that I had left,"" he says. But after another two years in the Army, Callum had a change of heart again. ""I was doing 17 hours a day and was tired all of the time,"" he says. He became an apprentice at a butcher's. ""I love it - and that's me."" ""I love working with my hands, like when you're taking all the meat off the bone, it [appeals to] the caveman in me."" But Callum still remembers his Army days fondly. ""I miss the blokes,"" he says, ""everyone was going through the same, just close friends. The biggest thing I miss is the sense that you matter. ""When you're in the Army, you wear a uniform and you are this presence  - you are visibly serving. But when you leave, you don't matter. You are just the same as everyone else on the street."" Now, Callum is making new plans again. He has started training to be a technician with the Scottish Ambulance Service. Scotty Meenagh, 28, had always wanted to belong to the Paras. ""If you are part of the airborne, there is nobody else to look up to. You're the best soldier,"" he says. ""They've been famous throughout history. I grew up being inspired by the Paras in the Falklands War. It was a unit that could complete impossible tasks that no other unit in the army could do at that time."" Scotty signed up to the military at 15, joining the Army Foundation College in Harrogate. However, 18 months into his training, he was injured and discharged. He rejoined at the age of 19 and started training at the Para Depot. After 46 weeks of training, he qualified and did a tour of Afghanistan in 2010. Scotty was ""Vallon man"", which means he searched the route ahead of the patrol, including using a metal detector, to make sure it was safe. He was also a medic. ""Your mates are relying on you to protect them,"" he says. ""You're not focusing so much on the combat role, so my weapon would be slung over my back and I'd be relying on a soldier behind me for my protection."" On 25 January 2011, Scotty was injured by a bomb that also killed one of his comrades. The injury meant that Scotty became a double amputee. Recalling his rehabilitation, he says: ""You go through so many different states, it's hard to believe you were in that position - it's a strange start of coping mechanisms. ""When you think back to such tough times, you remove the person from it."" Scotty says he now puts all his energy into sport. ""After being wounded, you need to try different things to rediscover your purpose. I found that sport enabled me to get out of bed every morning."" In 2014, Scotty turned his attention to cross-country skiing, after seeing it at the Paralympics in Sochi, in Russia. He went on to race on the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup circuit and, in 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, became the first British sit-skier to race at the Paralympics. He is currently training for the 2022 Beijing Paralympics, and he's also about to get married and ""make a family"" for himself. ""My fiancee and I have got a house and are living a nice normal life."" Geoff Dunn's family tradition of serving in the military stretches back as far as the colonial wars of the 19th Century. Geoff, 48, joined the Paras when he was 17, believing them to be the pinnacle of the infantry. He went on tours in Northern Ireland and Africa. But after he got married, he felt he needed to choose between the military or his family, having seen a number of friends divorce. After leaving the Army, he took up a couple of civilian jobs before eventually settling in a role as a response officer with the police. Over time, he moved in to firearms policing. After 15 years in the police force, Geoff felt the call to once again ""do his bit"" in the Paras, motivated by the 2009 British operation in Afghanistan and the people he knew who had been killed or injured. ""To be totally truthful, [I wanted] to test myself. It really did feel like a call to arms,"" he says. ""It wasn't a light decision to go, as I had a wife and two teenage sons."" He knew that after being out of the Paras for so long, he would have to start from the bottom again. Aged 40, Geoff passed the recruitment physical test. This included a 10-mile run carrying approximately 40lb (18kg) of kit, which he finished in less than two hours. He was quickly accepted back into the Paras. After a tour in Afghanistan, Geoff left the Army and eventually went into private protection, protecting maritime workers in the Indian Ocean. However, he says a family death made him reassess the amount of time he was spending away from home. He went to work for the Civil Nuclear Constabulary as a firearms instructor, among other duties. But after three years, a former boss asked him if he wanted to return to the police force. ""I've always thought you have one life and that it is very limiting if you tie yourself to one thing,"" he says. ""However, if you enjoy it, then get good at it."" From a young age, Dan Eccles wanted a challenge. ""I've always known about the Paras,"" the 26-year-old says. ""I had a little recruitment book that inspired me. I was hooked and wanted a slice of it."" At 17, Dan went to the Catterick Para Depot. It was the hardest thing he's ever done, he says, physically and mentally. After passing his training, he went to Afghanistan. Serving there was the reason he had signed up, he says. But Dan found that returning to the UK and settling into civilian life outside of the Army was not so straightforward. ""When you come back, it's hard to adjust,"" he says. ""You spend six or seven months fully switched on and you're always looking at every single person, [thinking] 'What are they doing? Are they carrying weapons? Who are they speaking to? ""So when you come back, it's very confusing. You can't switch your brain off. I didn't really get that much help. I struggled for a few years."" Dan took a welding course, funding it himself by working in a retail stockroom. But three years in he became depressed. ""I missed the excitement [of the Army]. Being in the stock room was very mundane."" But his perseverance paid off, with his training leading to a welding job, making metal appliances for kitchens in restaurants, cafes and hotels. Dan's other passion in civilian life has been powerlifting, a hobby he started before he left the Army. ""I was so short and skinny and tiny,"" he says. ""I wasn't interested in looking ripped. I just wanted to eat a lot of food and get very strong."" Terry Jones, 29, joined the Army to get out of his local Welsh town. He enrolled in the Paras when he was 17. He served for nearly 10 years and completed two Afghan tours, including the tour known as Herrick 8 in 2008. He says of this tour: ""It was horrendous. It had the worst death rate since World War Two for the Paras."" On his second Afghan tour, in 2011, Terry was hurt trying to help his injured comrade Scott. He sustained a head injury and was put into an induced coma for 10 days. He lost 70% of the vision in his left eye and was medically discharged in 2014. ""I miss the lads, the banter and how close you are down there,"" he says. ""You look out for each together. Everybody has got each other's back."" After leaving the Paras, Terry worked as a lorry driver and then in a furniture shop. He later became the owner a PVC plastics company that made items such as bouncy castles - but since leaving the business, he has focused on looking after his family. ""Right now is the happiest I've ever been,"" he says. ""I spend a lot of time with my kids, on bike rides and taking them on holiday."" Photos and interviews byEd Gold,external.

"The 'controlled chaos' of raising sextuplets'A leader with love on full display'Don't worry, Lorraine Kelly isn't being fake","Lauren Perkins gave birth to sextuplets in 2012 A woman in Houston has given birth to sextuplets in under 10 minutes. So what lies ahead when she brings her six newborns home? They say it takes a village to raise a child, however, they don't say what it takes to raise sextuplets. While becoming a parent can be a scary and worrying time for anyone, what is it like to raise six babies all at once? We spoke to two families raising children born in multiple births to find out. Lauren Perkins said she was in ""complete shock"" and ""overwhelmed"" when she found out that she would be giving birth to sextuplets. ""I knew we needed a support system, because there was no way we were going to pull this off by ourselves,"" she told the BBC. Luckily for Lauren, her community stepped in after her family grew by six overnight. ""We would not have survived the first year without them,"" she says. Lauren and her husband Dave at the Texas Children's Pavilion for Women in 2012 The Perkins sextuplets came home from the hospital one at a time, which Lauren says helped her adjust. ""The sixth baby to come home was Leah, who has previous developmental problems, and that was a bit overwhelming."" Danish MP told baby 'not welcome' in parliament chamber Bronchiolitis: 'I thought it was just a cold at first' 'Tiniest baby boy' ever sent home leaves Tokyo hospital With six babies to feed, bathe and clothe, Lauren developed a tight schedule. ""I would make up bottles each night for the next 24 hours and set them in the fridge with labels on so everyone knew which baby they were for and at what time."" Because of the different nutritional needs of the sextuplets, the family were using four different types of formula milk at one point. She also developed a shift system so that those volunteering to help could have the biggest impact. ""Friends would sign up to come and do feeding shifts in the middle of the night, they would help with giving the babies baths and doing laundry. ""We wouldn't have made it without that generosity,"" Lauren reflects. ""They brought us dinner for an entire year!"" There are many factors that lead to multiple pregnancy, including a family history of twins, falling pregnant over the age of thirty, or having previous pregnancies. African-American women are more likely to have twins than any other group, while white women, especially those over age of 35, are most likely to give birth to triplets or more. Reproductive technologies have greatly increased the multiple birth rate in recent years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) and other techniques that help couples conceive often use ovulation-stimulating medications to produce multiple eggs. These are then fertilised in the laboratory and returned to the uterus to develop. According to the Centres of Disease Control and prevention,external""more than three-quarters of triplets and higher order multiples in the United States resulted from conception assisted by fertility treatments"". The number of women giving birth to multiples in the US rose 76% from 1980 to 2009, but still only accounts for3.5% of all births,external. In 2017,there were only 31 babies born in the US,externalas part of quintuplets or a higher-order multiple. Like twins, other multiples can be identical (where one egg splits into two or more embryos), or fraternal (when more than one egg is fertilised). Medical complications becomeincreasingly likely with each additional foetus,externalin a multiple pregnancy, and can result in serious health problems. While the Perkins' loved ones donated their time, many also donated essential supplies. Lauren says that her family went through ""astronomically expensive"" formula milk at a rapid rate, and relied heavily on second-hand clothes. ""Several friends threw baby showers and we always asked for diapers. Every birthday, we asked for diapers and clothes for the babies."" In the end, Lauren didn't have to buy nappies for the first two years, after making a concerted effort to limit the number of changes. The Perkins sextuplets on their first birthday As the children grew, the challenges changed. ""Potty training was a complete nightmare,"" Lauren remembers. ""There are just so many to keep an eye on, and you have to watch them so closely when potty training. There were a few accidents, but we did it in the end!"" Lauren explains that as the sextuplets became more independent, her support system dwindled. ""As they grew up, logistics got easier. It has become a sort of controlled chaos. It's noisy, a lot of people and stuff, but it's this weird system that just works."" The Perkins sextuplets are almost aged seven now, and Lauren says she goes through the ""normal phases of parenthood"" like anyone else. ""It's just different because I do everything at once, which makes me glad and sad. ""I know I have to soak in all the cute kids stuff as much as possible because I'm not doing it again. I'll never get a first walk or first day at school again. It's just parenthood concentrated."" Amy and Chad Kempel waited until after their quintuplets were born to throw a baby shower or paint the nursery. The couple had previously lost twins through miscarriage and didn't feel able to prepare in the same way. ""It was devastating, and it was a long road to having the quintuplets,"" Chad says. However, last year they brought home five healthy babies. ""What are we going to do now?"" Amy asked herself. One of the first hurdles was feeding. ""To cut down on the amount of time we spent feeding we decided to feed them all at the same time, all at once,"" Chad says. Using a number of pillows, careful balancing and dexterity, the couple developed a system to bottle feed all five children simultaneously. The quintuplets all sleep in the same room and began sleeping through the night at six months. ""When they get a bit older and can keep each other awake, that might change,"" Amy says. The Kempels have two older daughters, but Amy notes the experience of raising five premature babies simultaneously was ""very different"". ""Initially bonding was very difficult for me,"" Amy says. ""They were in the hospital for a long time, and in incubators. ""Not being able to hold them and take them home was hard."" Chad and Amy say that they had braced themselves for the babies to have ""major health issues or disabilities"". However, after the initial medical intervention, Amy says the first year of the babies' lives has been ""uneventful in a good way"". While being at times ""very challenging"", the couple conclude things are ""going well"".

"'A leader with love on full display'Don't worry, Lorraine Kelly isn't being fake","Jacinda Ardern met with victims, and other members of the community, in Christchurch the day after the attack On a calm Friday lunchtime, people gathered for prayers at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. Minutes later, a young man walked up to the door brandishing an assault rifle. Despite having his weapon on aggressively clear display, he was greeted by one of the worshippers - an elderly Afghan man - with the words ""Hello, brother"". Then the gunman opened fire. The pain of the massacre reverberated not just across New Zealand, but also around the world. It seemed to signal that, almost everywhere, something had changed. Andbecause of the ubiquity of social media, people were able to view live footage of a self-proclaimed white supremacist murdering 50 people in a place of worship. Jacinda Ardern calls for a global anti-racism fight Ardern vows never to say the Christchurch gunman's name First victims' funerals held for refugee father and son The main suspect is Australian, and the victims were from a number of different countries including India, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan and Somalia. So when Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern appeared behind a podium to deliver a statement a few hours after the attack, it wasn't just New Zealand who listened to what she had to say. ""It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack."" By so swiftly and decisively describing the shooting as a ""terrorist attack"", Ms Ardern seemed to show an awareness and consideration of the fact that many people feel officials are reluctant to use this word when an attacker is white, even if that attack is politically motivated. Her acknowledgement of the fear and sorrow of the Muslim community didn't end there, either. She hugged the victims in Christchurch, wearing a black headscarf as a simple show of respect; she gave people the unifying cry ""They are us""; and addressing parliament for the first time a few days later, she made a small but bold statement by opening her remarks with the Islamic greeting ""As-Salaam Alaikum"". But she's combined this show of empathy with promises of concrete legislative and cultural change. A few hours after the attack, she announced a clampdown on the country's lax gun laws ""within 10 days"", and speaking to the BBC's Clive Myrie she promised to ""weed out"" racism both in New Zealand and globally. ""We cannot think about this in terms of boundaries,"" she insisted. This video can not be played ""We cannot think about this in terms of boundaries"" From that first address, observers all over the world have been praising her for her leadership. ""Martin Luther King said genuine leaders did not search for consensus but moulded it,"" Suzanne Moore wrote in the British paper The Guardian: ""Ardern has moulded a different consensus, demonstrating action, care, unity,external. Terrorism sees difference and wants to annihilate it. Ardern sees difference and wants to respect it, embrace it and connect with it."" The Washington Post's Ishaan Tharoor wrote that ""Ardern has become the face of her nation's sorrow and grief, and its resolve,external"". Annabel Crabb wrote on the ABC Australia website that ""having been confronted with the worst news a leader can receive...Ms Ardern has yet to put a foot wrong,external"". Grace Back put it simply in Marie Claire Australia: ""This is what a leader looks like,external.""

Mohammad Faisal, from Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said thatMs Ardern ""has won the hearts of Pakistanis"",external, while the King Center - a memorial to Martin Luther King in the US - tweeted that""there's a leader with love on full display in New Zealand"",external. Closer to home, in New Zealand, BBC News correspondent Hywel Griffith says he has ""heard her words - 'we are one, they are us' - spoken back to me by the families of victims here in Christchurch"". EvenJudith Collins, from the opposition National Party, told parliament that the prime minister had been ""outstanding"",external. Ms Ardern delivers a press conference in the week after the attack Colin James, a political analyst in New Zealand, tells BBC News that having spent ""quite a bit of time"" with Ms Arden, he's not surprised by the praise she's now getting. ""She was firm, sombre, positive and in charge,"" he said. ""And this is something I've said often - there's not a nasty cell in her body, but she's not a pushover. It's an unusual combination."" When she first started campaigning in 2017, she was regularly compared to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the French President Emmanuel Macron. It made some sense; all three seemed progressive, ambitious, and young - Ms Ardern was 37 when she took office. There was so much hype around her that it was termed ""Jacindamania,external"", and led some to worry that she would turn out to be all style and no substance. The child, the father, the aspiring footballer 'This mosque was precious to us': A city in shock 'I lost a best friend' While the comparisons have continued, they are only to show how exemplary Ms Ardern has become.Sushil Aaron wrote in the New York Times,externalthat she ""is emerging as the definitive progressive antithesis to the crowded field of right-wing strongmen... whose careers thrive on illiberal, anti-Muslim rhetoric"". One clear example of this is her request of President Donald Trump, who asked her what support the US could provide. ""Sympathy and love for all Muslim communities,"" she replied. Another is her simple description of Australian Senator Fraser Anning's comments blaming the attack on immigration: ""A disgrace."" She has spent the last week comforting members of the Muslim community in New Zealand, including this worshipper at a mosque in Wellington And the images of a sincere Ms Ardern comforting victims the day after the attack have been contrasted with politically similar leaders, too.Al Jazeera journalist Sana Saeed,externalsaid she ""can't recall Trudeau showing this depth of humanity for the victims of the Quebec mosque massacre"" in 2017, adding that former US President Barack Obama didn't visit the victims of the Oak Creek Gurdwara shooting in Wisconsin in 2012 (then-First Lady Michelle Obama went instead). Last year, a widow of a shooting victimeven called Mr Trudeau ""a piece of"" something unpleasant over the phone,external, because he hadn't paid his condolences in person while he was in the city. ""Often people have dismissed her as being attractive and saying the right things,"" Mr James explains. ""But there's much more to her than that - and she's demonstrated that in the last few days to such an extent that far fewer people can hold that view now.""

"Don't worry, Lorraine Kelly isn't being fake","""Lorraine Kelly is one of the most ruthless people you'll meet in the business,""joked,externalPiers Morgan on Good Morning Britain last week. ""Don't be fooled by that halo. To warm herself up for her show, she literally murders kittens and puppies."" Morgan's joke, which he made the day afterKelly's win at the TRIC Awards,external, was funny precisely because it was the opposite of the Lorraine millions of viewers know and love. In fact, her warm, likeable TV persona is the very reason so many of us were fascinated by a tax ruling involving Kelly on Wednesday. As part of a dispute with HMRC,Judge Jennifer Dean ruledthat Kelly is playing a particularversionof herself on air, which means she could be considered a ""theatrical artist"". ""She may not like the guest she interviews, she may not like the food she eats, she may not like the film she viewed - but that is where the performance lies,"" Judge Dean said in the ruling. So has Lorraine Kelly, a gold-standard national treasure, been fooling us all? Michael Ball presenting Lorraine Kelly with her TRIC Award earlier this month Is she, in fact, a horrible person, who has gone through life being secretly nasty to everyone, just faking being nice for the one hour she's on air every day? Not quite. This whole case boils down to something much more boring - basic tax law. For various reasons which we'll get to in a minute, Kelly has argued she should effectively be considered a freelancer rather than a direct employee of ITV. But part of the judge's ruling picked up on the point that she is more of a performer than a standard employee. That has raised issues about the personas that celebrities create when facing the public. Andrew H Walker's series of portraits explored the idea of the multiple personas of celebrities like Elisabeth Moss ""Lorraine's value to ITV lies in the image that she's created and her emotional appeal with audiences, and that brand value can easily be taken to other channels,"" says Jeetendr Sehdev, celebrity branding expert and author of The Kim Kardashian Principle. ""I think viewers are aware that you know there is a potential image and persona that celebrities are selling, and I think that that's OK. I don't think people have much of a problem with that as long as that image and persona is authentic."" Photographer Andrew H Walker explored this very theme in a series of portraits taken in 2016. At the Toronto Film Festival that year, he asked some of the stars in attendance if he could photograph them - twice. In one shot, he'd ask them to pose as a way they would act in front of the public, while the other would reveal a side we don't normally see. ""I was really curious with actors, because they have... a public persona that they put out there, and they also have their private self,""Walker told Mashable,external. ""There's this whole other layer of themselves as people. I found that really, really intriguing."" Double Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali showed a more serious side in his portrait The issue of public personas often crops up in the world of hip-hop, where many rappers are reliant on portraying a tough, gangster image. Earlier this year, it was revealed rapper 21 Savage, whose brand and lyrics centre on the years he spent growing up in Atlanta,had actually been born in the UK, where he lived for the early part of his life. Last year, when Tekashi 6ix9ine was indicted on six counts including firearms and racketeering charges,his attorney argued,externalthat the fact the rapper was ""an entertainer who portrays a 'gangster image' to promote his music does not make him a member of an enterprise"". Do such cases make their music less authentic? Does it matter? (And did you ever think you'd read an article that compared Lorraine Kelly with 21 Savage?) Issues about 21 Savage's public persona came up after he was arrested by US immigration officials But unlike actors, musicians or authors, who have the option to hide themselves behind their art, TV presenters in particular are reliant on their own personalities for their jobs. It's usually necessary for them to come across as warm, likeable, sympathetic and entertaining all at once. ""I'm an actor, playing the part of a presenter,""Matt LeBlanc told BBC News last year. ""So is it really me you see on Top Gear? Probably not. ""It's the me that suits the film we're making. It's the me that suits the studio portion in front of the crowd. That's what an actor does, you try to mould yourself to fit the needs of the piece."" As an actor by trade, LeBlanc's case is obviously different to Kelly's, but to some extent, all TV presenters have to do a bit of this kind of acting. In Kelly's case, her warm persona has endeared her to viewers for decades - and seen her achieve immense success. Just this week, she was given the outstanding contribution to British television prizeat the RTS Awards. Matt LeBlanc has spoken about the different personalities he adopts on Top Gear We all arguably have multiple versions of ourselves which we present in different situations. You'd behave differently at work to how you would on a night out, for example. And in many sectors, doing so doesn't affect our employment. But Sedhev says it's slightly different when it comes to high profile figures. ""The value of brands now are infiltrating all areas - from business to healthcare to technology,"" he explains. ""We see that with CEOs, whether it's Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg - these are different types of leaders. They are a brand, first and foremost, that stands for something and there's an enormous amount of value in that. ""I can see a lot of analogies between digital influencers, these new types of celebrities, and what has happened with Lorraine. It's interesting now how the worlds are beginning to merge."" However, Rahul Batra, managing partner at Hudson McKenzie, specialists in media and entertainment law, says the Lorraine Kelly ruling has little to do with the issue of public personas which has been picked up on by news outlets. ""Where the ruling talks about Lorraine Kelly being a brand, that's not to do with media law, but tax law,"" he tells BBC News. Kelly's employment status, he explains, is important only because it impacts on how much tax she is due to pay. Given that she also presents TV programmes for the BBC and releases her own fitness DVDs, it would be wrong to say she is a standard employee of ITV. ""Suppose Lorraine Kelly earns a million pounds a year, and she has an agent who takes Â£200,000. That Â£200,000 is tax deductible, so she'd only be liable to pay tax on Â£800,000,"" Mr Batra says. ""But if you're an employee, then everything is tax deducted at source from the employer itself. That's what this argument is all about."" He adds that, because of IR35, the UK's anti-avoidance tax legislation, this is something that occurs in every industry - not just in the celebrity world. ""It happens a lot with IT contractors... in fact, anybody who's a contractor in the UK gets muddled up in an HMRC inquiry at some point in time,"" he says. ""Because HMRC would try to say 'you're an employee', and the contractor would say, 'No, I'm not an employee. I have set up my own limited company and I'm providing services to other people as well'.""

Key lines from Barr summary,"Attorney general William Barr was tasked with summarising the Mueller report for Congress Two days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller filed the report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to the attorney general, William Barr provided a four-page summary to Congress and the public. Mr Barr writes that the special counsel's 22-month inquiry involved 40 government investigators issuing more than 2,800 subpoenas and 500 search warrants questioning around 500 witnesses. What was the end result? Here are some key lines from the attorney general's letter and what they mean. ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities"" Most of Mr Barr's letter to Congress summarising the special counsel's investigation was in the attorney general's own words. In this instance, however, he chose to directly quote Mr Mueller's report. He clearly didn't want any misunderstanding about the investigation's conclusions. When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mr Mueller as special counsel, he instructed the former FBI director to look for ""any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump"". On Sunday, in those 23 words, the special counsel provided his answer. Some will point to the words ""did not establish"" in that sentence and note that it doesn't mean the investigation found no evidence at all or that ""collusion"" didn't actually take place. Perhaps it isn't the ""complete and total exoneration"" that Mr Trump is claiming. When it comes to the language used in these type of investigations, however, it's as close as it going to get. ""As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign."" After outlining the special counsel's conclusions that the Russian government attempted to interfere with the 2016 election through social media disinformation and hacking the computers and emails of Democratic Party officials, Mr Barr again says there was no evidence of conspiracy or coordination - with a twist. There were ""multiple offers"" of Russian help to the Trump campaign This is probably a reference to the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr, senior campaign officials and Russians with ties to the Kremlin. It also might include Russian contacts by more tangential campaign aides such as George Papadopoulos and Carter Page or, perhaps, former Trump adviser Roger Stone's attempts to contact Wikileaks to find out about hacked Democratic emails. The details aren't provided, but the gist of what Mr Barr is saying is that while there was Russian outreach, there is no evidence that anyone from the Trump campaign took the bait. ""The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was only one component of Mr Mueller's special counsel work. He also looked into whether the president violated the law by obstructing the investigation. And instead of making a prosecutorial judgement, the former FBI director punted. ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime,""it also does not exonerate him,"" wrote Mr Barr, quoting the report. Noting ""difficult issues"" involved in the determination of the president's conduct, Mr Mueller presents both sides of the argument for charging the president with the crime of obstruction of justices. He then leaves it up to the attorney general to make the call. ""In cataloguing the President's actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent ..."" With the ball firmly in his court, Mr Barr - nominated to the job of attorney general by Mr Trump in December - decided Mr Trump would not be charged with obstruction of justice. Central to the attorney general's conclusion was the fact that the special counsel found no ""underlying crime"" of conspiracy with the Russians to interfere with the 2016 election. There has been an ongoing debate in legal circles on whether obstruction of justice can take place without evidence of a crime to investigate, and Mr Barr comes down solidly, if not entirely, on the ""no"" side. While Mr Trump made plenty of public statements that could be construed as an attempt to influence the investigation, it appears Mr Barr concluded that they were not done with ""corrupt intent"". The attorney general made sure to note that this decision was made in consultation with Mr Rosenstein, who had appointed Mr Mueller back in 2017, as well as other Justice Department lawyers. This was a judgement call - and Mr Barr will take heat for it from the president's critics. He clearly wanted to make sure he wasn't alone in the spotlight. ""My goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel's report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations and Departmental policies."" Now the waiting resumes. Mr Barr insists he will release as much of the report as he can, given rules that limit the disclosure of grand jury activities and information that could impact upon ongoing criminal proceedings. Democrats will be interested in learning of any more details unearthed in the Russia investigation, even if Mr Mueller did not conclude that there was sufficient evidence to prove conspiracy or coordination. In addition, they will want to see the pro-and-con arguments the special counsel made as it weighed charging Mr Trump with obstruction of justice. That's when the second-guessing of Mr Barr's decision will begin in earnest. All this, however, is going to take time. Meanwhile, Republicans - from the president down - will use Mr Barr's summary to argue that all the investigations into the president's conduct are baseless and should be abandoned. ""This should be a lesson to my Democrat colleagues that chasing imagined scandals and following a partisan investigatory agenda will not result in any meaningful change for the country,""writes Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy,external. There are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. Those inquiries will continue unabated. On Sunday, however, Mr Trump's side landed a powerful talking point to use in the political warfare to come.

'Best day of Trump presidency',"What was that film called? As Good As It Gets? That's how Donald Trump must feel now that the attorney general has published his four-page summary of the Mueller report. It is impossible to over-emphasise the significance of what has been said. If the Democrats want to remove this president from the White House, it's going to have to be via the ballot box in November 2020, and not before. The cloud that has been over the president for 22 months has gone, the weight that has sat on his shoulders has been lifted. This is without doubt the best day that Donald Trump has had since his inauguration in January 2017. So let's go through it. The Mueller investigation came in two parts - firstly, the question of whether there had been collusion between his campaign and the Russians. On that there is 100% exoneration. Special Counsel Robert Mueller found that his campaign did not conspire or coordinate with Russia. That issue is put to bed. On the question of obstruction of justice there is a bit of ambiguity. Mr Mueller has a very interesting sentence: ""While the report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" But that has been looked at by the attorney general and William Barr reaches this conclusion: ""Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offence."" This video can not be played Mueller report a ""complete exoneration"", says US President Trump So in the eyes of the AG, Trump is in the clear there too. That area of ambiguity is what the Democrats are going to focus upon. And here again, I am going to try to break this down into two parts. The first legal, the second political. Legally, the House Judiciary Committee will want to get its hands on the full Mueller report. They will want to see why Robert Mueller felt he couldn't exonerate the president on obstruction of justice. And remember, obstruction of justice is one of the so-called ""high crimes and misdemeanours"" that can lead to impeachment. There will be an endless back and forth over that. And I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if the subpoenas start to fly. Committees have the right to call people and papers. They are bound to flex their muscles as much as they can. They want to play this long. They want to damage the president. To prosecute the president for obstruction of justice there would have needed to be evidence of intent to obstruct. So even though the president fired former FBI chief James Comey and unleashed regular torrents of abuse on Twitter about the investigation, if his only motivation for those acts was to vent his spleen rather than break the law, then he's done nothing wrong legally. Key lines from Barr summary Trump 'did not conspire with Russia' There is, of course, separately, a series of other criminal investigations going on into different aspects of the Trump Organization - the foundation, the inauguration committee, even the way the Trump Organization might have inflated or deflated insurance values on how much properties are worth. They will run their course. But make no mistake the greatest single piece of jeopardy came from the verdict of the Mueller report, and the interpretation that it amounts to a ""not guilty"" is an enormous fillip to Donald Trump. Now let's consider the political. This video can not be played Jon Sopel: 'The headline is the president is in the clear' It seems to me that while it is totally understandable that the Democrats are going to plug away - and in some ways it would be an abdication for an opposition party not to, and they may well do the president further damage - the risk associated with this course of action is bigger than any opportunity it presents. Public opinion is going to watch the network news bulletins tonight, look at the news websites after this exhausting 22 month process, and think ""OK, that's it. Move on."" How many ordinary people (a phrase I hate, but forgive me) would read the entire Mueller report with its endless appendices, even if it was released in total? I suspect not that many. And we all have busy lives and limited attention spans. The most successful politicians acknowledge that. A significant part of the voting population is just going to think ""Thank goodness that's over."" The danger for Democrats is exactly the same as Republicans faced over the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Despite his perjury and lies, President Clinton left office in 2000 with incredibly high approval ratings. Follow reaction as it comes in The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Why? Well, partly the economy was soaring. But also Democrats were repulsed by what they saw as political game playing by Republicans who were perceived to be putting their own political interests ahead of the country. And the feeling was - to use a word that Donald Trump is fond of - that the Republican Party was conducting a witch-hunt. Senior Democrats in Congress have always been aware of going down the impeachment route. But now they need to consider the risks of giving the appearance of being more interested and focused on bringing down the president than in the issues of ordinary people - health, work, salaries, college fees, schooling, the opioid epidemic etc. Donald Trump is, as I write this, aboard Air Force One on his way back to Washington. If he wasn't teetotal, I feel sure he would be uncorking the champagne. Maybe he'll have a celebratory Diet Coke with an extra cube of ice. He always said it was a hoax and a witch-hunt. And not surprisingly he says he has been totally vindicated. Shifting that narrative, much as the Democrats will try, is going to be immensely difficult.

Who's who in the drama?,"It was more gripping than any box set we could get our hands on. Over two years, the investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, delivered daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. In the end, 35 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered. This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?! It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season. Who was he?Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher,here's his life story. Key plot lineAs Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said. The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know? Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called ""a complete and total exoneration"". But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension. Who was he?He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine. Key plot lineHe was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker. Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while. He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later). After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison. In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Read more:The man who helped Trump win Who was he?The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians. Key plot lineDonald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is. The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton. This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting? What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought. Read more:Trump Jr's habit for making headlines DonaldTrumpconfounded his critics by winningthe presidency.But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix. The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come. Who was he?The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI. Key plot lineFlynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only ""simple things""). The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. At the end of Season Three, in December 2017,Flynn pleaded guiltyto making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed. With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle. Read more:Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn? Who was he?Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 wasthe Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot lineKislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots. The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place. Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a ""top spy and recruiter of spies"". Who was he?Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years. Key plot lineSessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings. When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation. That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign. That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist. Read more:An attorney general dogged by scandal This was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling. Who was she?A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an ""informant"" for Russia's prosecutor general. Key plot lineHers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign. While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges. That meeting would never have happened without... Who were they?Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough tosend each other birthday messages,external. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow. Key plot lineAgain in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting. An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the ""crown prosecutor"" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton. Are you keeping up? Read more:The tough-talking networker Who was he?He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot lineWhen Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House. Read more:Who is Rod Rosenstein? Who was he?Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard. Key plot lineAmid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him. In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave. Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose. Read more:The son-in-law with Trump's ear Who was he?A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric. Key plot lineRob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov. Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Read more:The Music Man with a love for hats Who was he?At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story. Key plot lineHe first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him. Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point. Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused. Read more:The FBI director who took centre stage Who was he?A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation. Key plot lineIn late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so. Read more:Why Papadopoulos case matters Who was he?The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands. Key plot lineSome characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as ""special counsel"" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI. There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office. There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series. After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four.The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...? Who was he?OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. Key plot lineA little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US. In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume. Read more:Seven key takeaways from indictment Who was he?The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him. Key plot lineCohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth. When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York. Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence. Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress. The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell. Who was he?A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: ""One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action."" Key plot lineStone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back. Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public. After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia. All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a ""witch-hunt"" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were ""a steaming plate of bull"".

Trump-Russia saga in 350 words,"It's the story that has dominated Donald Trump's presidency. But it's complicated. Let's take a step back. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Mr Trump. A special counsel looked into whether anyone from his campaign colluded in the effort. After two years, we have a 448-page report in which the special counsel finds no evidence the campaign conspired with Russia. No, Robert Mueller also looked at 10 instances where the president obstructed justice. But he was unable to decide whether they amounted to a crime. His report also found that the Russian government did interfere in the election. Not really. We found out he tried to fire Mr Mueller. He had called it a witch hunt from the start. No. It was conducted by the hugely respected Mr Mueller, a Republican who used to run the FBI. There were several meetings between senior members of Mr Trump's team with Russian officials. Several meetings were not initially disclosed. Ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador to the US before Mr Trump took office. The president's son, Donald Jr, met a Russian lawyer who said she had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton during the campaign. He brought charges against several of Mr Trump's inner circle. Ex-adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released emails belonging to Democratic officials that had allegedly been hacked by Russians. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion and received a 36-month prison sentence. And former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to the FBI about his work in Ukraine, according to special counsel Robert Mueller, with whom he had been co-operating. Manafort has been jailed for bank fraud. Since he fired the man leading one of the investigations, ex-FBI Director James Comey, there were questions about whether he obstructed justice.

"Thailand pro-military party takes leadPalang Pracha Rath Party gains more than seven million votes, preliminary election results show.Asia","More than 50 million people were eligible to vote in Sunday's poll Two rival camps contesting Thailand's first election since the military coup in 2014 have both said they are trying to form a coalition government. Early results give the pro-military Palang Pracha Rath Party (PPRP) a larger share of the popular vote. At the same time, the main opposition Pheu Thai party currently has the biggest number of seats in parliament. But there are growing complaints about irregularities during Sunday's poll and a vote count marred by confusion. The Electoral Commission (EC) is also facing strong criticism for its decision to delay publishing the full results without providing any explanation. A guide to Thailand's post-coup election Voting in Thailand's hybrid democracy Thailand's complicated electoral system allocates some parliamentary seats according to the number of votes received. Critics say electoral law changes introduced by the military in 2017 are primarily designed to keep pro-military forces in power. On Monday, the EC announced that Pheu Thai, the party linked to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, had won 137 seats in the 500-strong lower chamber of parliament. The PPRP, which supports Thailand's current leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha, was in the second place with 97 seats. Several other parties were getting between 30 and 39 seats each. But the winners of 150 seats were still unclear, the EC said. At the same time, the commission earlier said that with more than 90% of ballots counted, the PPRP had gained 7.6m of the popular vote. That is half a million more than Pheu Thai. Amid confusion over a vote count, the EC was expected to clarify the preliminary results at a news conference on Monday. But the EC instead again delayed announcing the preliminary figures. It also said there would be no official results until 9 May. General Prayuth Chan-ocha voted in Bangkok on Sunday More than 50 million people were eligible to vote in a much-delayed election, the first since Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha led the coup that ousted Mr Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, five years ago. But the reported turnout was unexpectedly low, at just 64%. Many questioned this figure as well as discrepancies in the vote count numbers. ""It's right that we should call it a rigged election,"" Mr Thaksin told AFP news agency. ""Everyone know(s) in Thailand, everyone internationally that observed the election in Thailand, knows that there is irregularity."" Speaking to journalists, the EC's secretary-general, Charungvith Phumma, blamed ""human error"", saying the people who put the numbers of votes in were just regular people. The EC later said that media had misreported the data it was giving them, and that its servers had suffered from unspecified hacking attacks. Analysis by BBC's Nick Beake in Bangkok What's your definition of an election winner? Answers on a polling card, please. Is it the party with the most votes across the whole country or the party with the most seats in parliament? In Thailand, where power can be seized at gunpoint, this is not so much a constitutional technicality but a matter of manoeuvring and momentum. After repeatedly promising - and then delaying - a national vote, the military junta finally granted a ballot only once it had successfully manipulated the electoral system in its favour. Many foresaw a General Prayuth victory as being hollow and illegitimate - achieved through the backing of a handpicked, new senate. But the coup leader can now point to the way the pro-military Palang Pracha Rath Party apparently hoovered up the majority of votes cast as a clear democratic mandate. The opposition Pheu Thai does not see it that way. It feels its own achievement - gaining the biggest share of parliamentary seats - should be rewarded fairly by being allowed to form a coalition of anti-military parties. The military introduced a new constitution in 2017which opponents say is designed to keep pro-military forces in power. Thailand's electorate only votes for the 500-seat lower house of parliament. The members of the 250-seat upper house are appointed by the military. But it's the combined votes from both houses that will select the future prime minister. The vote has been seen primarily as a contest between pro-military parties and allies of Mr Thaksin. He was ousted in a coup in 2006 and lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a conviction for abuse of power. But he still has a significant following, largely among rural and less affluent voters. At the time of the 2014 coup, the military said it wanted to restore order and stability and put a stop to the street protests which have broken out repeatedly over the years. But the junta has been accused of taking an authoritarian approach to power, strictly controlling the media and arbitrarily using laws like lese majeste - which prohibits any criticism of the monarchy - to silence opponents.

Huge fossil discovery made in China,"Scientists say the fossils have been ""exquisitely"" preserved Scientists say they have discovered a ""stunning"" trove of thousands of fossils on a river bank in China. The fossils are estimated to be about 518 million years old, and are particularly unusual because the soft body tissue of many creatures, including their skin, eyes, and internal organs, have been ""exquisitely"" well preserved. Palaeontologists have called the findings ""mind-blowing"" - especially because more than half the fossils are previously undiscovered species. The fossils, known as the Qingjiang biota, were collected near Danshui river in Hubei province. Fossils of soft-bodied creatures like jellyfish are extremely rare More than 20,000 specimens were collected, and a total of 4,351 have been analysed so far, including worms, jellyfish, sea anemones and algae. They will become a ""very important source in the study of the early origins of creatures"", one of the fieldwork leaders, Prof Xingliang Zhang from China's Northwest University, told the BBC. Details of the findings were published in the journal Science,externalon Friday. The creatures were rapidly buried by mudflows and sediment The discovery is particularly remarkable because ""the majority of creatures are soft-bodied organisms like jellyfish and worms that normally stand no chance of becoming fossilised"", Prof Robert Gaines, a geologist who also took part in the study, said in an email to the BBC. The majority of fossils tend to be of hard-bodied animals, as harder substances, like bones, are less likely to rot and decompose. The Qingjiang biota must have been ""rapidly buried in sediment"" due to a storm, in order for soft tissues to be so well preserved, Prof Zhang says. China fossil tells new supercontinent story Sea reptile one of the largest animals ever Naraoiids, a type of soft-shelled arthropod, were found at the site Scientists are especially excited by the jellyfish and sea anemone fossils, which Prof Gaines describes as ""unlike anything I have ever seen. Their sheer abundance and their diversity of forms is stunning"". Meanwhile, Prof Allison Daley, a palaeontologist who was not part of the study but wrote an accompanying analysis in Science,told BBC's Science in Action programme the find was one of the most significant in the last 100 years. ""It blew my mind - as a palaeontologist I never thought I'd get to witness the discovery of such an incredible site. ""For the first time we're seeing preservation of jellyfish - [when] you think of jellyfish today, they're so soft-bodied, so delicate, but they're preserved unbelievably well at this site."" An artist's impression of some of the species The research team are now documenting the remaining specimens, and conducting more drilling in the region to find out more about the ancient local ecosystem, and the fossilisation process. Prof Zhang says he looks forward to studying ""all these new species - I'm always excited when we get something new"". The research team says this is just the beginning of their work The fossils are from the Cambrian period, which began 541 million years ago and saw a rapid increase in animal diversity on Earth. Prof Gaines hopes his work will also strike a chord with modern readers. ""Biotic diversity today is something that we take for granted, even though there are indications that extinction rates are sharply increasing. ""Yet most of the major animal lineages were established in a singular event in the history of life, the Cambrian explosion,  the likes of which have never been seen before or after. It also reminds us of our deep kinship to all living animals."" China fossil tells new supercontinent story Does Jurassic Park make scientific sense?

Horsebox driver stranded at high tide,"The driver had tried to cross an hour after the safe crossing time had ended A horsebox driver became stranded when he attempted to cross a causeway at high tide. The man had to be rescued when the van became submerged on the Holy Island road, which is under water twice a day. He managed to escape and reach a refuge box. It is thought he did not realise it was unsafe to cross because he spoke little English. Ian Clayton, from Seahouses RNLI, said: ""We suspect that language problems may have contributed to this incident."" He added that despite the language difficulty they were able to establish no animals were inside the horsebox at the time. The man managed to make his way to a refuge box, seen here during low tide The rescue happened just after 15:00 GMT on Saturday. Safe crossing times to the island - also known as Lindisfarne - on Saturday were 08:20 until 13:50 and it was unsafe to cross until 20:50. Northumberland County Council installed warning signs at either end of the mile-long causeway in 2012 in a bid to cut the number of strandings. They display a message to check the tide tables followed by the safe crossing times.

Harry Potter proposal proves a winner,"Nia said she loved Marc Traenor's work A pair of Harry Potter fans are celebrating getting engaged in an unusual - and very public - way. After pictures of a piece of beach art circulated on social media on Saturday, there was speculation about who Ben and Nia were - and whether she said ""yes"". Ben Griffiths surprised his girlfriend Nia Roderick by commissioning Welsh sand artist Marc Traenor to draw his proposal on Tenby's north beach. It turns out Nia did say yes - although she had to look closely to spot it. That is because the proposal, which read ""Nia, will you marry me?"" in Welsh, was a small part of a much bigger Harry Potter-themed coat of arms. It took three hours for sand artist Marc Traenor to complete the piece on Tenby's north beach, which reads, in Welsh: ""Nia, will you marry me?"" ""It was such a surprise because we're not romantic at all like that,"" said Nia, who is originally from Bridgend. The couple, from Talbot Green in Rhondda Cynon Taf, were staying in Tenby with family at the time and decided to go for a walk with the dog. Singapore otters photobomb UK couple's marriage proposal Wife carrying race: Winners in proposal joy on finish line Are public proposals really such a great idea? ""We had gone to a pub for a drink when suddenly Ben said he didn't feel very well, and that he needed to go out and get some fresh air,"" she explained. Little did she know what her partner had planned, although she did recognise artist Mr Traenor, who was drawing in the sand. Ben and Nia met while working together at Aberthaw Power Station in the Vale of Glamorgan She said: ""I got excited, because I love his work, and the picture contained some elements from the Harry Potter books. ""I was standing there looking at the man doing his job and I told Ben, 'Look. There are two letters in the picture; B and N'; and suddenly Ben tapped me on my shoulder and asked me to turn round. ""There he was, down on one knee, and that was when I realised he had organised all of this. And of course I said, 'yes'."" The couple said they had yet to decide on a date for their wedding.

Trump 'did not conspire with Russia',"This video can not be played Mueller report: One summary, two interpretations US President Donald Trump's campaign did not conspire with Russia during the 2016 election, a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report says. The allegation clouded the first two years of Mr Trump's presidency and his allies see the report's finding as a boost to his re-election chances. But Attorney General William Barr's summary is inconclusive as to whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Opposition Democrats are demanding full access to Mr Mueller's report. Having repeatedly described the inquiry as a witch hunt, Mr Trump said it was an ""illegal takedown that failed"". Despite the inconclusiveness of the report regarding allegations he obstructed justice, the president said it constituted ""complete and total exoneration"". Allow Twitter content?

The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Mueller report: Key lines from Barr summary Read Barr's full summary of the report The report was the culmination of two years of investigation by Mr Mueller which saw some of the president's closest former aides prosecuted and, in some cases, imprisoned, although not on charges related to the alleged Russian collusion. ""The special counsel did not find that any US person or Trump campaign official conspired or knowingly co-ordinated with Russia,"" Mr Barr writes. On the issue of whether justice was obstructed, Mr Mueller's report says: ""While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" In his summary, Mr Barr said the report ""ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment"".

America's most mysterious public figure Mr Barr ends his letter by saying further extracts from the report will be released but notes that some of the material is subject to justice department restrictions. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has been sharply critical of the president in the past, tweeted that it wasa ""great day for President Trump and his team"",external. ""The cloud hanging over President Trump has been removed by this report,"" he said. ""Great job by Mr. Mueller and his team to thoroughly examine all things Russia,"" he added.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has taken almost two years ""They'll never get you because they'll never 'get' you."" Mr Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said the report had been better than he had expected while Republican Senator Mitt Romney welcomed the ""good news"", tweeting that it was now ""time for the country to move forward"". Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement thatMr Barr's letter ""raises as many questions as it answers"",externaland called for access to the full report. ""For the president to say he is completely exonerated directly contradicts the words of Mr Mueller and is not to be taken with any degree of credibility,"" the statement said. Congressman Jerry Nadler, the Democratic Chair of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, emphasised that Mr Trump had not been cleared of obstructing justice. ""Barr says that the president may have acted to obstruct justice, but that for an obstruction conviction, 'the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct'."" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate's Judiciary Committee, said that while there was a lack of evidence to support ""a prosecutable criminal conspiracy"", questions remained over whether Mr Trump had been compromised.

The release of the report's key findings on Sunday could mark the start of a lengthy battle to see the entire Mueller report made public. Whenever further details are handed to Congress, Democrats may mount legal challenges if it is anything less than the entire report. Jerry Nadler said he would ask Mr Barr to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee ""in the near future"",externalover ""very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department"". About a dozen other investigations are continuing into Mr Trump's activities. These include a federal inquiry in New York into possible election law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses, and possible misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee. Congress is also continuing its own inquiries, mostly in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Attorney General Barr summarises, mostly in his own words, the conclusions of the special counsel's investigation. In one key line, however, he directly quotes the report. ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or co-ordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" There, in Robert Mueller's own words, is the end result of nearly two years of work, 2,800 subpoenas, hundreds of search warrants and countless hours of interviews. There were ""multiple offers"" of help from ""Russian-affiliated individuals"" to the Trump campaign, but they never took the bait. There was, as Donald Trump might say, ""no collusion"". At least, no evidence of it was unearthed. The obstruction of justice component is a murkier matter. The decision of whether to charge Mr Trump with interference with the various investigations wasn't Mr Mueller's. Saying it involved ""difficult issues"", the former FBI director punted. Instead, Mr Barr - in consultation with Department of Justice staff - decided not to prosecute, in part because there was no apparent underlying crime to obstruct. Make no mistake, today was a very good day for Mr Trump. While a bevy of inquiries into his presidency will grind on, the shadow of Mr Mueller's investigation - hovering over the White House since May 2017 - has been lifted.

What are indicative votes?,"MPs have decided to try to break the Brexit deadlock by holding a series of ""indicative votes"". But what does it mean? Indicative votes are where MPs vote on a series of options designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority. In the case of Brexit, supporters of indicative votes believe it could provide a way out of the current political stalemate. Usually the government has control over what happens day-to-day in Parliament, but on Monday evening MPs backed a proposal by a cross-party group of MPs, including Labour's Hilary Benn and Conservative Sir Oliver Letwin, to take control of the timetable. Under the cross-party plan, MPs can put forward their preferred Brexit plans this evening to Speaker John Bercow. Tomorrow he will select all or some of these options for debate. MPs may be asked to consider whether any plan agreed by Parliament should be put back to the public in another referendum, or whether the UK should stop Brexit altogether byrevoking its notification of Article 50. Following a debate on the various options, at 7pm the Commons will be suspended for 30 minutes so MPs can vote on the each plan. During the indicative votes, MPs will enter one of the division lobbies - the corridors in the House of Commons where votes are normally counted - and will receive a paper ballot. They can vote ""yes"" or ""no"" on as many options as they are prepared to support. The results will be announced by the Speaker later that evening. After the results are in and options are narrowed, a second round of voting could also take place next Monday to find a single preference. It is unclear if the voting system will remain the same for this. Among the possible ideas are: Leavingwithout a deal ACanada-style free-trade agreementbacked by some Brexiteers Acustoms union planfavoured by Labour A ""softer"" Brexit,sometimes called Common Market 2.0, which would keep the UK in the EU single market as well as the customs union Usually, MPs are instructed to vote with their party line (a process known as ""whipping"") and they can face repercussions if they don't. But with indicative votes, MPs might be allowed ""free votes"" - where they can choose to vote as they wish - meaning the final outcome could be substantially different. Government ministers have indicated free votes are likely. Any decision taken by indicative votes would not compel the government into pursuing that course of action, but would show what Parliament wants and where the most votes lie. However, there is always a risk that either no single Brexit option secures a majority, or more than one does. If this happens then Parliament would still find itself deadlocked over Brexit. If certain options such as Norway plusor another referendum are chosen and enacted by the government, it would require a longer extension to Article 50. The Prime Minister Theresa May has also warned that the votes could lead to an outcome which the EU would not agree to. Yes. One occasion indicative votes were used was in 2003 when MPs were presented with seven different options on how to reform the House of Lords. It produced exactly the deadlock some fear would be the case over Brexit as nothing was able to secure a majority. This meant reforms were not passed and the status quo prevailed. MPs have had a number of opportunities to vote on different ways forward, and, as Mrs May has pointed out, they have ""equally been rejected"". But these were all ""whipped"" votes and each proposal was taken in isolation, rather than side by side. How could another referendum work? Can the UK revoke Brexit? What is the Norway plus option?

Varadkar will 'work with whoever is PM',"The Irish prime minister has said he believes Theresa May can deliver on Brexit, adding that British-Irish working relations are not dependent on Mrs May alone. It follows newspaper reports that British cabinet members are plotting to oust Mrs Mayas prime minister. Senior ministers have dismissed all such suggestions. Speaking to Irish National Broadcaster RTÃ, Leo Varadkar said he would work with ""whoever the prime minister is"". Ministers tipped to replace PM rally round Brexit pushed back by at least two weeks Varadkar warns of year-long Brexit delay Theresa May has come under growing pressure to quit following a week in which she wasforced to ask the European Union for an extension to Article 50and criticised forblaming the delay to Brexit on MPs. The withdrawal agreement she negotiated with the EU has been rejected twice in the House of Commons. On Friday, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) warned that Brexit could be delayedif British MPs decide they want the government to radically change its policy. However on Sunday, he said he believes that Theresa May can deliver Brexit by 12 April. Theresa May has faced growing criticism in recent weeks Mr Varadkar outlined that since the Brexit referendum, his government had working relations with their British counterparts at all levels - not just prime ministerial. ""We've made sure over the last two years we have very good links not just at prime minister-level and taoiseach-level, but also between Phillip Hammond and Pascal Donohoe, between Simon Coveney and David Lidington and so on,"" he said. ""Whoever is prime minister we will work with them. ""It didn't have to be this bad, I think what's happened is the UK is now consumed with Brexit."" He added: ""Even after they leave, assuming they leave with a Withdrawal Agreement, they will spend two or three years consumed about what the future relationship is going to be like. ""It's important that we make sure we're not consumed by Brexit and we're not defined by it. ""So my job as taoiseach is to ensure we limit any damage to Ireland as a consequence of Brexit.""

Kenyan science teacher wins global prizeA science teacher who gives most of his salary to support poor pupils wins the Global Teacher Prize.Business,"Brother Peter Tabichi has been praised as an ""exceptional teacher"" who gives away most of his salary A science teacher from rural Kenya, who gives away most of his salary to support poorer pupils, has won a $1m prize (Â£760,000) for the world's best teacher. Peter Tabichi, a member of the Franciscan religious order, won the 2019 Global Teacher Prize. Brother Peter has been praised for his achievements in a deprived school with crowded classes and few text books. He wants pupils to see ""science is the way to go"" for their futures. The award, announced in a ceremony in Dubai, recognises the ""exceptional"" teacher's commitment to pupils in a remote part of Kenya's Rift Valley. He gives away 80% of his pay to support pupils, at the Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School in Pwani Village, Nakuru, who otherwise could not afford uniforms or books. ""It's not all about money,"" says Brother Peter, whose pupils are almost all from very disadvantaged families. Many are orphaned or have lost a parent. The 36-year-old teacher wants to raise aspirations and to promote the cause of science, not just in Kenya but across Africa. On winning the prize, Brother Peter hailed the potential of Africa's young population. ""As a teacher working on the front line I have seen the promise of its young people - their curiosity, talent, their intelligence, their belief. ""Africa's young people will no longer be held back by low expectations. Africa will produce scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs whose names will be one day famous in every corner of the world. And girls will be a huge part of this story."" Many pupils walk more than four miles to reach the school, in Kenya's Rift Valley The award, in a competition run by the Varkey Foundation, has seen him beating 10,000 other nominations from 179 countries. He is a Franciscan friar, a member of the Catholic religious order founded by St Francis of Assisi in the 13th Century. Brother Peter says there are ""challenges with a lack of facilities"" at his school, including not enough books or teachers. Classes meant to have 35 to 40 pupils are taught in groups of 70 or 80, which, he says, means overcrowded classrooms and problems for teachers. The lack of a reliable internet connection means he has to travel to a cyber-cafe to download resources for his science lessons. And many of the pupils walk more than four miles (6km) on bad roads to reach the school. But Brother Peter says he is determined to give them a chance to learn about science and to raise their horizons. His pupils have been successful in national and international science competitions, including an award from the Royal Society of Chemistry in the UK. The judges said that his work at the school had ""dramatically improved his pupils' achievement"", with many more now going on to college or university, despite resources at the schools being ""severely constrained"". Brother Peter says part of the challenge has been to persuade the local community to recognise the value of education, visiting families whose children are at risk of dropping out of school. He tries to change the minds of families who expect their daughters to get married at an early age - encouraging them to keep their girls in school. ""This is Africa's time,"" said the prize-winning teacher, Brother Peter Tabichi Brother Peter said the award was an optimistic sign. ""It's morning in Africa. The skies are clear. The day is young and there is a blank page waiting to be written. This is Africa's time,"" he said. Brother Peter was congratulated by Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta. ""Peter - your story is the story of Africa, a young continent bursting with talent. Your students have shown that they can compete amongst the best in the world in science, technology and all fields of human endeavour,"" said the Kenyan president. The competition is intended to raise the status of the teaching profession. Last year's winner was anart teacher from north London, Andria Zafirakou, and among this year'stop 10 finalists has been Andrew Moffat, a Birmingham head teacher at the centre of a row with parents about lessons on LGBT rights. The founder of the prize, Sunny Varkey, says he hopes Brother Peter's story ""will inspire those looking to enter the teaching profession and shine a powerful spotlight on the incredible work teachers do all over Kenya and throughout the world every day"". ""The thousands of nominations and applications we received from every corner of the planet is testimony to the achievements of teachers and the enormous impact they have on all of our lives,"" he says.

A very good day for Trump,"Attorney general William Barr was tasked with summarising the Mueller report for Congress Two days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller filed the report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to the attorney general, William Barr provided a four-page summary to Congress and the public. Mr Barr writes that the special counsel's 22-month inquiry involved 40 government investigators issuing more than 2,800 subpoenas and 500 search warrants questioning around 500 witnesses. What was the end result? Here are some key lines from the attorney general's letter and what they mean. ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities"" Most of Mr Barr's letter to Congress summarising the special counsel's investigation was in the attorney general's own words. In this instance, however, he chose to directly quote Mr Mueller's report. He clearly didn't want any misunderstanding about the investigation's conclusions. When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mr Mueller as special counsel, he instructed the former FBI director to look for ""any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump"". On Sunday, in those 23 words, the special counsel provided his answer. Some will point to the words ""did not establish"" in that sentence and note that it doesn't mean the investigation found no evidence at all or that ""collusion"" didn't actually take place. Perhaps it isn't the ""complete and total exoneration"" that Mr Trump is claiming. When it comes to the language used in these type of investigations, however, it's as close as it going to get. ""As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign."" After outlining the special counsel's conclusions that the Russian government attempted to interfere with the 2016 election through social media disinformation and hacking the computers and emails of Democratic Party officials, Mr Barr again says there was no evidence of conspiracy or coordination - with a twist. There were ""multiple offers"" of Russian help to the Trump campaign This is probably a reference to the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr, senior campaign officials and Russians with ties to the Kremlin. It also might include Russian contacts by more tangential campaign aides such as George Papadopoulos and Carter Page or, perhaps, former Trump adviser Roger Stone's attempts to contact Wikileaks to find out about hacked Democratic emails. The details aren't provided, but the gist of what Mr Barr is saying is that while there was Russian outreach, there is no evidence that anyone from the Trump campaign took the bait. ""The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was only one component of Mr Mueller's special counsel work. He also looked into whether the president violated the law by obstructing the investigation. And instead of making a prosecutorial judgement, the former FBI director punted. ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime,""it also does not exonerate him,"" wrote Mr Barr, quoting the report. Noting ""difficult issues"" involved in the determination of the president's conduct, Mr Mueller presents both sides of the argument for charging the president with the crime of obstruction of justices. He then leaves it up to the attorney general to make the call. ""In cataloguing the President's actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent ..."" With the ball firmly in his court, Mr Barr - nominated to the job of attorney general by Mr Trump in December - decided Mr Trump would not be charged with obstruction of justice. Central to the attorney general's conclusion was the fact that the special counsel found no ""underlying crime"" of conspiracy with the Russians to interfere with the 2016 election. There has been an ongoing debate in legal circles on whether obstruction of justice can take place without evidence of a crime to investigate, and Mr Barr comes down solidly, if not entirely, on the ""no"" side. While Mr Trump made plenty of public statements that could be construed as an attempt to influence the investigation, it appears Mr Barr concluded that they were not done with ""corrupt intent"". The attorney general made sure to note that this decision was made in consultation with Mr Rosenstein, who had appointed Mr Mueller back in 2017, as well as other Justice Department lawyers. This was a judgement call - and Mr Barr will take heat for it from the president's critics. He clearly wanted to make sure he wasn't alone in the spotlight. ""My goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel's report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations and Departmental policies."" Now the waiting resumes. Mr Barr insists he will release as much of the report as he can, given rules that limit the disclosure of grand jury activities and information that could impact upon ongoing criminal proceedings. Democrats will be interested in learning of any more details unearthed in the Russia investigation, even if Mr Mueller did not conclude that there was sufficient evidence to prove conspiracy or coordination. In addition, they will want to see the pro-and-con arguments the special counsel made as it weighed charging Mr Trump with obstruction of justice. That's when the second-guessing of Mr Barr's decision will begin in earnest. All this, however, is going to take time. Meanwhile, Republicans - from the president down - will use Mr Barr's summary to argue that all the investigations into the president's conduct are baseless and should be abandoned. ""This should be a lesson to my Democrat colleagues that chasing imagined scandals and following a partisan investigatory agenda will not result in any meaningful change for the country,""writes Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy,external. There are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. Those inquiries will continue unabated. On Sunday, however, Mr Trump's side landed a powerful talking point to use in the political warfare to come.

The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words,"It's the story that has dominated Donald Trump's presidency. But it's complicated. Let's take a step back. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Mr Trump. A special counsel looked into whether anyone from his campaign colluded in the effort. After two years, we have a 448-page report in which the special counsel finds no evidence the campaign conspired with Russia. No, Robert Mueller also looked at 10 instances where the president obstructed justice. But he was unable to decide whether they amounted to a crime. His report also found that the Russian government did interfere in the election. Not really. We found out he tried to fire Mr Mueller. He had called it a witch hunt from the start. No. It was conducted by the hugely respected Mr Mueller, a Republican who used to run the FBI. There were several meetings between senior members of Mr Trump's team with Russian officials. Several meetings were not initially disclosed. Ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador to the US before Mr Trump took office. The president's son, Donald Jr, met a Russian lawyer who said she had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton during the campaign. He brought charges against several of Mr Trump's inner circle. Ex-adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released emails belonging to Democratic officials that had allegedly been hacked by Russians. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion and received a 36-month prison sentence. And former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to the FBI about his work in Ukraine, according to special counsel Robert Mueller, with whom he had been co-operating. Manafort has been jailed for bank fraud. Since he fired the man leading one of the investigations, ex-FBI Director James Comey, there were questions about whether he obstructed justice.

Crites, 70, watched CNN in her living room and shouted at the screen and at
others in the room that investigators need to ""dig deeper"". But she is in the
minority in Russellville, Arkansas (pop. 29,000). Most people here say the
investigation was wrong from the beginning, and theyâre glad itâs done. âWitch
hunt,â says Walter Smith, a retired bus driver, talking about the report while
standing in a Burger King parking lot. Timothy Schroeter, a college student,
said âthe report came out correctly - that thereâs no obstruction of justiceâ
and that people should move on. Meanwhile, an unemployed warehouse worker (heâs
looking for a job and asked me not to use his name) sat in front of his
computer in McDonald's and watched Fox News: âItâs just the Democrats,â he
said, saying the report was politically motivated and adding: âNow they can
drag something else up.â Summing up the townâs majority view, he said: âItâs
just dumb.â Then he turned away from the TV and returned to a more interesting
occupation: watching YouTube videos about beehives on his laptop. Democratic House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has just told reporters that Trump is wrong, the report does not amount to an exoneration. He suggested Attorney General William Barr is biased and his conclusions on the Mueller
report raise more questions than they answer. Nadler says it is ""unconscionable"" that the president would try to spin the special counselâs findings. He says it is
imperative that the attorney general release the ""entire, unfiltered"" report. Nadler concluded the attorney
generalâs comments show Congress ""must step in to get the truth and provide full transparency"" and Barr must
testify, will subpoena him if necessary. He says: ""The president has not been exonerated by the special counsel, yet the attorney general has decided to not go further. ""We cannot simply rely on what may be a hasty partisan interpretation of the facts.""

Jon SopelBBC North America Editor What was that film called? As Good 
As It Gets? That's how Donald Trump must feel now that the attorney 
general has published his four-page summary of the Mueller report. It is impossible to over-emphasise the significance of what has been said. If
 the Democrats want to remove this president from the White House. it's 
going to have to be via the ballot box in November 2020, and not before. The cloud that has been over the president for 22 months has gone, the weight that has sat on his shoulders has been lifted. This is without doubt the best day that Donald Trump has had since his inauguration in January 2017. Read Jon's take in full The Democratic leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumerhave released a joint statement,external: âAttorney General Barrâs letter raises
as many questions as it answers. ""The fact that Special Counsel Muellerâs
report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction
of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying
documentation be made public without any further delay. ""Given Mr Barrâs public record of bias against the Special Counselâs inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (R) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter âMy
goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counselâs report as I can
consistent with applicable law, regulations and Departmental policies.â Now the
waiting resumes. Mr Barr insists he will release as much of the report as he
can, given rules that limit the disclosure of grand jury activities and
information that could impact ongoing criminal proceedings. Democrats
will be interested in learning of any more details unearthed in the Russia
investigation, even if Mr Mueller did not conclude that they were sufficient
evidence to prove conspiracy or coordination. In addition, they will want to
see the pro-and-con arguments the special counsel made for charging Mr Trump
with obstruction of justice. Thatâs
when the second-guessing of Mr Barrâs decision will begin in earnest. All
this, however, is going to take time. Meanwhile,
Republicans â from the president on down â will use Mr Barrâs summary to argue
that all the investigations into the presidentâs conduct are baseless and
should be abandoned. âThis
should be a lesson to my Democrat colleagues that chasing imagined scandals and
following a partisan investigatory agenda will not result in any meaningful
change for the country,â writes Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. There
are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trumpâs conduct and that of his
businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both
legal and political. Those inquiries will continue unabated. On
Sunday, however, Mr Trumpâs side landed a powerful talking point to use in the
political warfare to come. Here are (some of) the investigations and lawsuits the president and his organisations still face: Stormy Daniels  Inauguration funds  Trump Foundation  Trump Organization Taxes  Emoluments lawsuit  Summer Zervos defamation claim  The BBC's North America editor breaks down the findings... This video can not be played What are the implications of Mueller report? The Trump campaign has sent the following text to supporters: ""Pres Trump: NO
COLLUSION & COMPLETE EXONERATION! Dems raised millions off a lie. Now we
FIGHT BACK! Donate in the NEXT HOUR & it'll be QUADRUPLED."" Mitch McConnell welcomes the special counsel's conclusion that there was no collusion. But still no reaction from the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's the story that has dominated Donald Trump's presidency. But it's complicated. Read our 350-word summary of the Trump-Russia story here. Vicky BakerBBC News, New York Democratic presidential
candidate Kirsten Gillibrand was on a stage next to New York's Trump
International Hotel, launching her campaign shortly before the Mueller summary
was released. ""It is not often that I
agree with Richard Nixon,"" she said, pausing for a laugh. ""But he was right to
say that the American people have a right to know if their president is a crook
or not."" It got one of the biggest
cheers of her speech. However, no-one we asked - before or after - said they
had been pinning any hopes on the inquiry. ""I donât think this will
be a big voting issue,"" said Austin Bicknell, a student visiting from Seattle. ""When people follow Trump down the rabbit hole, that is when we lose. But if we
focus on healthcare, economic issues, healthcare, that is when they have a
chance of taking him out."" Kathy Rosenberg, a local
nurse, said she had already learnt enough from the investigation to be sure he
is an illegitimate leader. ""The Trump people are
going to say it is a big victory and that is very depressing,"" she predicted. ""But that is why I am here, I want see him defeated."" Many people on the ground
here echoed her wish to take on Donald Trump at the ballot boxes, rather than
through the courts. Denis Lee Owen, who works
in economic political development, looked on after as the speeches wrapped up
and a small, very vocal bunch of Trump supporters circled the barriers in Maga
hats. ""People could be
disappointed today,"" he said. ""But the Mueller inquiry is a process, not an
event."" Kirsten Gillibrand Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
French protester's family sue over injuryThe 73-year-old woman was seriously injured at a banned yellow vest protest in Nice.Europe,"GeneviÃ¨ve Legay apparently fell and hit her head on a metal post during a police charge The family of a 73-year-old French woman injured in a police charge at a protest are taking legal action. GeneviÃ¨ve Legay fell and hit her head on a metal post during the banned ""yellow vest"" demonstration in Nice. The incident, captured on video by demonstrators and journalists, is being investigated. Ms Legay, who sustained skull fractures and bleeding next to the brain, is reported to be in a stable condition in intensive care. Ms Legay, a spokeswoman for the local arm of an anti-globalisation NGO, had come to defend the right to demonstrate, her daughter said. Protests had been banned in a large part of of the southern city's centre. The activist's family plan to file a complaint for wilful violence by armed persons holding public authority on a vulnerable person, their lawyer said. The Nice public prosecutor has opened an investigation to determine the origin of her injuries. Soldiers were deployed for the first time during Saturday's protests to back up police and help maintain security. Protesters had been banned in the centres of many large French cities. But there has been widespread criticism of anti-terrorist forces being used to control crowds, with politicians from across the political spectrum voicing concerns. Some 40,000 protested on Saturday across France, an increase from 32,000 protesters last weekend, the interior minister said. After last week's riots, which resulted in more than 120 arrests, French President Emmanuel Macron had vowed ""tough"" action. Saturday's protests were largely peaceful and did not match the scale of those on 16 March, when boutiques and buildings in Paris along the Champs-ElysÃ©es were vandalised.  Clashes also took place in cities including Lille, Lyon, Nantes, Toulouse and Montpellier. French frustrations boil over in angry debates Anti-Semitism beneath the yellow vests? The story of the yellow vests Who are the yellow vests? The ""yellow vests"" (""gilets jaunes"") started protesting in November, initially because of fuel tax rises. The movement soon evolved into a broader rebellion against perceived elitism, for which activists blame Mr Macron. Concessions were offered to protesters late last year as the movement was picking up speed - including â¬10bn (Â£8.5bn; $11bn) designed to raise incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners. But this has not put an end to the discontent. For the past month, the president has toured France, listening to local mayors and citizens as part of his ""grand dÃ©bat"" - or big national debate.

US Congress given Mueller report findingsThe attorney general submits key conclusions from the report into alleged Russian election meddling.US & Canada,"Attorney General William Barr (R) will decide how much of the Mueller report to share with Congress US congressional leaders have been given conclusions from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The long-awaited report was submitted on Friday to Attorney General William Barr, who pored over the document before handing a summary to Congress. The report is the culmination of two years of investigation by Mr Mueller. A justice department official has said it does not call for new charges. In the course of their investigation, Mr Mueller and his team have already charged 34 people - including six former Trump aides and a dozen Russians - as well as three companies. None of those charges directly related to the allegations of collusion between the campaign and Moscow - allegations that President Trump has always denied. President Trump has spent the weekend at his Florida resort What might 'Mueller report' look like? Trump Russia: The saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Mr Mueller reportedly also examined another question: whether Mr Trump committed obstruction of justice in an effort to curtail an FBI investigation into connections between his campaign and Russians. It is not yet known how much of the report - if any - will be made available to the public. It is not clear how much information is being shared with Congress. Mr Barr, who was appointed by Mr Trump, told congressional leaders on Friday that he was ""committed to as much transparency as possible."" The president has spent the weekend at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. He has been uncharacteristically silent on social media - posting no remarks on the report. The president has in the past repeatedly lashed out at the special counsel investigation, branding it a ""witch hunt"". Who is special counsel Robert Mueller? What does the special counsel do? Key questions answered in the Trump Russia probe This video can not be played How US networks reacted to Mueller news Despite all the attention is has received since it was submitted on Friday, the special counsel's investigation is not the only probe that could threaten Mr Trump's presidency. About a dozen other investigations are being run independently of Mr Mueller's office. They include a federal investigation in New York that is looking into possible election-law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses and possible misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee. Legally, the attorney general is under no obligation to release the report publicly, but during his confirmation hearings before senators Mr Barr vowed to release as much as he could. A number of senior Democrats, including presidential hopefuls Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Julian Castro, have called for the full release of the report. The House of Representatives, newly controlled by the Democratic party following last year's mid-term elections, will also continue to investigate the Trump administration and could ask Mr Mueller to testify or instruct Mr Barr to provide relevant materials.

"Mum begs thief for daughter's lock of hairKirsty Baldwin said the lock of hair was ""all we had left"" of her two-year-old daughter who died.Manchester","Ellie Louise Baldwin died suddenly six years ago from bronchial pneumonia A mother has urged a thief to return a lock of hair which she said was all she had left of her two-year-old daughter.

Streisand apologises for Jackson comments,"Barbra Streisand has said she did not mean to ""dismiss the trauma"" of the alleged victims The singer Barbra Streisand has apologised after she was criticised for sympathising with Michael Jackson over child abuse accusations against him.

Beach art proposal proves a winner,"Nia said she loved Marc Traenor's work A pair of Harry Potter fans are celebrating getting engaged in an unusual - and very public - way. After pictures of a piece of beach art circulated on social media on Saturday, there was speculation about who Ben and Nia were - and whether she said ""yes"". Ben Griffiths surprised his girlfriend Nia Roderick by commissioning Welsh sand artist Marc Traenor to draw his proposal on Tenby's north beach. It turns out Nia did say yes - although she had to look closely to spot it. That is because the proposal, which read ""Nia, will you marry me?"" in Welsh, was a small part of a much bigger Harry Potter-themed coat of arms. It took three hours for sand artist Marc Traenor to complete the piece on Tenby's north beach, which reads, in Welsh: ""Nia, will you marry me?"" ""It was such a surprise because we're not romantic at all like that,"" said Nia, who is originally from Bridgend. The couple, from Talbot Green in Rhondda Cynon Taf, were staying in Tenby with family at the time and decided to go for a walk with the dog. Singapore otters photobomb UK couple's marriage proposal Wife carrying race: Winners in proposal joy on finish line Are public proposals really such a great idea? ""We had gone to a pub for a drink when suddenly Ben said he didn't feel very well, and that he needed to go out and get some fresh air,"" she explained. Little did she know what her partner had planned, although she did recognise artist Mr Traenor, who was drawing in the sand. Ben and Nia met while working together at Aberthaw Power Station in the Vale of Glamorgan She said: ""I got excited, because I love his work, and the picture contained some elements from the Harry Potter books. ""I was standing there looking at the man doing his job and I told Ben, 'Look. There are two letters in the picture; B and N'; and suddenly Ben tapped me on my shoulder and asked me to turn round. ""There he was, down on one knee, and that was when I realised he had organised all of this. And of course I said, 'yes'."" The couple said they had yet to decide on a date for their wedding.

Scottish independence vote 'will happen'First Minister Nicola Sturgeon makes a firm prediction of another vote but says she is waiting for clarity on Brexit.Scotland politics,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has predicted that another independence referendum will take place in Scotland. But she said it was reasonable for her to wait for clarity on Brexit before setting out a firm position. Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird has, meanwhile, blamed the prime minister for the uncertainty over the UK and the EU. Conservative MP Andrew Bowie said the last thing voters want is the general election Labour would like to see. In an interview for theAndrew Marr Showon BBC One, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Another Scottish independence referendum is going to happen. ""Nothing in this life is absolutely certain but I think it's as inevitable as its possible to be. ""Before I set forward a path for Scotland I think it's reasonable for me to know what the starting point of that journey is going to be and the context in which we are going to be embarking on it. ""We need to know - and hopefully we will know this over the next few days and over the next three weeks. ""Is the UK leaving the EU? Is it leaving with a deal? Is it leaving with no deal or is it not leaving at all, perhaps looking at another referendum?"" Ms Sturgeon joined a crowd which has been estimated at over one million people on a march in London todemand a second Brexit referendum. The first minister said the handling of the Brexit process by the UK government had strengthened the case for Scottish independence. She added: ""The experience of the last, almost three years now: Scotland's vote ignored, the voice of the Scottish parliament ignored, all of the consequences that flow from Brexit completely outwith our control. ""That really does make the case for independence very very powerfully."" Speaking to theSunday Politics Scotlandprogramme, Labour's Lesley Laird said the fact that there was so little certainty over the way ahead on Brexit was down to Theresa May. ""The reason we haven't got to a position in parliament of being able to formulate a clear view,"" she said, ""is because of the way that the prime minister has handled this whole negotiation. ""She hasn't dealt with parliament, she hasn't given parliament the opportunity to have these discussions around the indicative votes."" But Labour's idea of putting the issue to voters in a general election was  strongly criticised by Andrew Bowie, who is a parliamentary private secretary to the prime minister. Speaking on the same programme, he said: ""The vast majority of people in this country, the last thing they want - contrary to the Labour Party - is another general election. ""I'm not in a position, I don't think anybody here is in a position to make a prediction on where we will be this time next week.""

But she continued: ""His sexual needs were his sexual needs, coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has.

Osprey pair seal relationship with a fish,"The male bird presented his mate with a fish soon after she arrived A pair of ospreys have been reunited at the Loch of Lowes wildlife reserve near Dunkeld in Perthshire for their fifth season together. The female osprey, Lassie, arrived at the reserve at 17:47 on Saturday. Her mate had arrived eight days earlier. Scottish Wildlife Trust staff said the male bird brought his partner a fish within half an hour of her landing. The pair have successfully fledged 10 chicks from 12 eggs since they began breeding in Perthshire in 2015. Lassie is also known by the designation LF15 while the male bird is LM12. Osprey waits for Lassie to come home Sara Rasmussen, the trust's Perthshire ranger, said: ""It's exciting to see our resident birds back together. Ospreys live completely independent lives outside of the breeding season but LM12 and LF15 have quickly re-established themselves as a pair. ""They have already made their first attempts at breeding. LF15 will begin laying eggs about ten days after the first successful mating. Ospreys have been brought back from extinction in the UK and there are believed to be more than 200 pairs breeding each summer.

MSPs' concerns over social media abuse,"Senior MSPs have raised concerns that the increasingly ""polarised"" political debate on social media is spilling over into abusive behaviour in ""real life"". Three quarters of members have had security reviews at their local offices with community police officers. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said he had recently faced ""aggressive"" people swearing at him in the street. And others have called for parties to sign up to a joint code of conduct to ensure future debate is ""respectful"". Twitter said it was working to ""improve the health of the public conversation"" and was acting to shut down abusive accounts. MSP fears for safety after online threats Female politicians speak out over Twitter abuse MP's staff member threatened at constituency office Almost every politician uses social media in some way, either to spread their political messages or to engage with constituents. While all the politicians who spoke to BBC Scotland were quick to highlight the positives of social media, they also voiced fears about the ""dark side"" of the internet endangering people's safety and putting others off getting involved in politics. Mr Mackay said he was still ""addicted"" to staying connected to social media, but said the ""hostile, aggressive, extreme"" tone of debate online was starting to spill over into real life. He said: ""You'd like to think that the people engaging in that on Twitter would never say such things to your face if you met them in the street, but even that's starting to change. ""Just recently when I was on a walkabout in my own constituency in the town centre, there were some - a minority, people that had never engaged with me before - who would just randomly swear at you or insult you as if that was somehow now normalised, acceptable, civil behaviour. Well it's not. ""There used to be a view that many things said on social media would never be said to your face, but it is now - and it's quite unpleasant, to the point of aggression."" Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said he was ""addicted"" to social media, but finds it increasingly hostile A number of politicians have voiced concerns about their safety in light of social media abuse. Tory MSP Annie Wells told the Mail on Sunday police had advised her to vary her route to work after receiving threats online. The Scottish Parliament said a total of Â£40,000 has been spent on security modifications for MSPs offices in the last 12 months - such as metal shutters on shopfronts, intercoms, strengthened front doors and counters. And a further Â£14,000 has been spent on lone worker safety devices over the last two years. Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said threatening messages online and violent acts offline were connected. She said: ""I think there's a compelling link between the prevalence of these threatening online tweets and then what you've seen in New Zealand, or on the streets of the UK with Jo Cox being murdered. ""Because what happens is, people go online, they say these things, they follow people who think like they do, they become more convinced of their own self-righteousness, they're encouraged to take it to the next level. ""That might be turning up at an office and saying out loud the things you say on the internet, and before you know it it turns into the violent extremist actions we've seen in New Zealand and the UK and right across the world."" Kezia Dugdale said there was a ""compelling link"" between online threats and violent acts Ms Dugdale has called in the police about online death threats on three occasions during her eight years as an MSP, and says she has developed ""emotional body-armour"" over the years. However, she fears there is a ""great danger"" that online bullying could ""put off a whole generation of young people"" from participating in politics. This echoed comments made by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in 2018, when she saidsocial media abuse makes her ""angry""because ""I worry it is putting the next generation of young women off politics"". Ms Dugdale said: ""The benefit of social media is that it should open up your politicians to you, to make them more accessible. But if you have a culture like this, which encourages people to say exactly what they think using whatever language they want, then you're going to going to have politicians responding in a way where they become so thick skinned they lose the ability to feel, to be emotional, to have the kind of human response you'd expect them to. ""You have to put your guard up, to protect yourself from that, and years down the line I think we might regret forcing our politicians to lack so much emotion."" Scottish Conservative MSP Rachael Hamilton - who has also had to report Twitter abuse to police - agreed that the tone of debate online was ""putting candidates off standing"" in elections. She is calling for a ""joint code of conduct"" to be agreed before the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021, so parties can agree on the need for a ""respectful dialogue"". Rachael Hamilton said the block and mute buttons had hugely improved her experience of Twitter Ms Hamilton said her experience with Twitter had improved since she learned how to block out abuse - using techniques MSPs have been sharing among themselves. She said: ""In general, now I've found the mute and block buttons that Ruth Davidson kindly introduced to me to, I've had a better experience on Twitter. ""Initially I was completely sick to the stomach. I was really upset by the whole thing. But genuinely, the techniques of dealing with it - so speaking to colleagues about it and knowing that it's not just me that's experiencing it - actually makes me feel a bit more reassured. I also find that using the mute and block buttons have worked brilliantly because I'm not exposed to it."" Mr Mackay was also enlightened on the use of the block button by a Conservative MSP - underlining that while members may debate fiercely in the Holyrood chamber, they still work together outside of it. He said: ""It was actually a hardcore Unionist Tory MSP - Adam Tomkins of all people, so we're at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of constitutional politics - that showed me how to mute people. ""That works for me, because I take some satisfaction that people are shouting into cyberspace and I'm not even seeing any insults that they make any more. So I've got Adam Tomkins to thank for that."" Twitter contends that it has ""strengthened"" its approach to abusive content, and is now acting on 10 times more abusive accounts. A spokeswoman said: ""Our priority is to improve the health of the public conversation. In 2018, we introduced more than 70 changes to product, policy and process to achieve a healthier, safer Twitter. ""We've expanded our safety policies, tightened enforcement, improved how we communicate with users, and invested in better technology to limit the spread and reach of abusive material. These actions have led to a drop in abuse reports, and we will continue building on this progress to ensure the safety of our users remains paramount.""

French protester's family sue over injury,"GeneviÃ¨ve Legay apparently fell and hit her head on a metal post during a police charge The family of a 73-year-old French woman injured in a police charge at a protest are taking legal action. GeneviÃ¨ve Legay fell and hit her head on a metal post during the banned ""yellow vest"" demonstration in Nice. The incident, captured on video by demonstrators and journalists, is being investigated. Ms Legay, who sustained skull fractures and bleeding next to the brain, is reported to be in a stable condition in intensive care. Ms Legay, a spokeswoman for the local arm of an anti-globalisation NGO, had come to defend the right to demonstrate, her daughter said. Protests had been banned in a large part of of the southern city's centre. The activist's family plan to file a complaint for wilful violence by armed persons holding public authority on a vulnerable person, their lawyer said. The Nice public prosecutor has opened an investigation to determine the origin of her injuries. Soldiers were deployed for the first time during Saturday's protests to back up police and help maintain security. Protesters had been banned in the centres of many large French cities. But there has been widespread criticism of anti-terrorist forces being used to control crowds, with politicians from across the political spectrum voicing concerns. Some 40,000 protested on Saturday across France, an increase from 32,000 protesters last weekend, the interior minister said. After last week's riots, which resulted in more than 120 arrests, French President Emmanuel Macron had vowed ""tough"" action. Saturday's protests were largely peaceful and did not match the scale of those on 16 March, when boutiques and buildings in Paris along the Champs-ElysÃ©es were vandalised.  Clashes also took place in cities including Lille, Lyon, Nantes, Toulouse and Montpellier. French frustrations boil over in angry debates Anti-Semitism beneath the yellow vests? The story of the yellow vests Who are the yellow vests? The ""yellow vests"" (""gilets jaunes"") started protesting in November, initially because of fuel tax rises. The movement soon evolved into a broader rebellion against perceived elitism, for which activists blame Mr Macron. Concessions were offered to protesters late last year as the movement was picking up speed - including â¬10bn (Â£8.5bn; $11bn) designed to raise incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners. But this has not put an end to the discontent. For the past month, the president has toured France, listening to local mayors and citizens as part of his ""grand dÃ©bat"" - or big national debate.

"Million at Brexit protest, say organisers","This video can not be played Nine minutes condense into just ninety seconds - aerial footage shows vast crowd of protesters Hundreds of thousands of people have marched in central London calling for another EU referendum, as MPs search for a way out of the Brexit impasse. Organisers of the ""Put It To The People"" campaign say more than a million people joined the march before rallying in front of Parliament. Protesters carrying EU flags and placards called for any Brexit deal be put to another public vote. On Thursday, European leaders agreed to delay the UK's departure from the EU. PM Theresa May is coming under pressure to quit after sayingshe might not put her Brexit deal to a third vote by MPs. Varadkar: 'Brexit will define UK' Brexit's fate in British hands, says Tusk Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Speakers at the rally included Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, former Tory turned independent MP Anna Soubry and former attorney general Dominic Grieve. Crowds were told the initial count showed more than a million people had turned up -putting it on a par with the biggest march of the century, the Stop the War march in 2003. This video can not be played Marchers called for a ""proper vote"" and said they'd been ""sold down the river"" There was no independent verification of the numbers but BBC correspondent Richard Lister, who was at the scene, said it was a ""very densely packed"" protest and people were still arriving in Parliament Square five hours after the march began. He said: ""The organisers say it was one million-strong, it's very hard to verify those kinds of claims but this was a very significant march, well into the hundreds of thousands."" Protesters carried a mixture of homemade and official placards Protesters marched past some of London's most famous landmarks Labour's Tom Watson told the crowd in Parliament Square that Mrs May's deal was a ""lousy"" one - whether you voted Leave or Remain. He said he had this message for her: ""I can only vote for a deal if you let the people vote on it too. Prime Minister, you've lost control of this process, you're plunging the country into chaos, let the people take control."" Ms Sturgeon said now was ""the moment of maximum opportunity""to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Katie Wright, BBC News, in Park Lane The streets around Park Lane were teeming with people hours ahead of the march's scheduled 1pm start, having come from all corners of the country - and some from further beyond. The blue and yellow of the EU was splashed all over the ever-expanding crowd, which was full of groups of families, friends, colleagues and political groups. Many people came draped in flags and carried homemade signs, featuring slogans ranging from playful - ""Never gonna give EU up"" - to political - ""Forget the Ides of March - beware the Brexit of May"". And then there were the plain angry - ""Brexit is treason"". One member of the crowd, German-born vet Chris Reichmann, described it as a ""carnival"" atmosphere - with ""lots of different nationalities"" but ""really British in a way"". And it was noisy, with some of London's most recognisable streets overflowing with people marching steadily to a soundtrack of beating drums, whistles and blaring horns. Occasionally the hordes would erupt into spontaneous cheering, as well as chants of ""What do we want? People's vote. When do we want it? Now!"" Game Of Thrones star Lena Headey, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman and Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys were among the famous names to take to the streets. Sadiq Khanjoined demonstrators at the front of the march,externalas it began, holding up a ""Put it to the People"" banner. He was flanked by Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable,who tweeted,externalthat there was a ""huge turnout of people here from all walks of life"". But veteran Conservative MP John Redwood told the BBC: ""We know that 16 million people wanted to stay in the EU, and some of those would still like to stay in the EU, and within that quite a few would like to have another go and have another referendum - but it was always a minority."" Aerial pictures taken from a helicopter showed the scale of the crowds The prime minister wrote to all MPs on Friday saying she will ditch plans to put the deal to another so-called meaningful vote on her withdrawal deal if not enough MPs support it. Unless her deal is passed by MPs, the UK will have to come up with an alternative plan or else face leaving without a deal on 12 April. Downing Street sources have denied reports inthe Times,externalnewspaper that discussions are under way about a timetable for the prime minister to step down. People gathered at Hyde Park Corner before marching towards Parliament People chanted for a ""People's Vote"" as they marched, accompanied by marching bands, whistles and cheers Meanwhile, a record-breaking online petition on Parliament's website calling for Brexit to be cancelled by revoking Article 50 has attracted more than four million signatures. As the number of signatures on the petition continued to climb, its creator Margaret Georgiadousaid she had ""received three death threats over the phone"", and a ""torrent of abuse"" via her Facebook account. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the petition could ""give oxygen"" to the campaign for another Brexit referendum. Sisters Calypso and Sophie Latham, from London ""I think a second vote might not be an entirely democratic solution because it would put into question every referendum we ever did.  But I wanted to show my anger - that I'm against xenophobic, racist and nationalistic rhetoric that is being spewed everywhere in the news to justify Brexit.""Law graduate Sophie Latham, 22 ""I was too young to vote in the last referendum. It's going to affect my career with research grants so I definitely wanted to come and protest.""Calypso Latham, 19, science student Lin and Rob Worthy from Oxford ""We've had so many opportunities growing up in the EU - freedom of travel, equal pay, sexual equality and so on. Will our kids get the same?""Lin Worthy, self-employed ""This is the first time in my life at the age of 62 that I've come to something to make a statement because I see no future for this country, for my kids or my grandkids. It's just a total mess so I thought I've got to make a stand.""Rob Worthy, 62, self-employed Simon Mead (right) with his 14-year-old daughter Aurore, from Bristol ""My partner is French, my two children are British-French, it has already caused lots of problems, having to apply for different passports has cost us lots of money. We've seen European friends leave Bristol - German and Spanish friends.""Simon Mead ""I really wanted to come because it's a big part of my future and my life.""Aurore Mead, 14 Lee and Richard, from Gloucestershire ""My costume has been deflating since I put it on at 11 this morning - which could be a metaphor for Brexit"".Lee, Gloucestershire ""I didn't get a vote but I moved to this country from Germany 20 years ago as a vet. I think it's a really silly decision. Now we've got a deal, the people should vote and see if that's really the deal the people want. I won't get a vote again but it has a massive implication on my life.Chris Reichmann, Ashford Nigel Farage said the People's Vote march in London were not the majority The march comes as the pro-Brexit March to Leave, which started in Sunderland a week ago, continues towards London. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage re-joined the March to Leave in Linby, near Nottingham, on Saturday morning telling around 200 Brexit supporters that Mrs May had reduced the nation ""to a state of humiliation"". Speaking from the top of an open-top bus, Mr Farage said those gathering for the People's Vote march in London were not the majority, before leading the marchers through the village.

Brexit petitioner gets death threats,"The petition had reached nearly 4.3 million signature by lunchtime on Saturday The woman who started the record-breaking anti-Brexit petition says she is ""shaking like a leaf"" after receiving three death threats by phone. Margaret Georgiadou, 77, began the Revoke Article 50 petition, which had topped four million signatures by Saturday morning. She said she was ""totally amazed"" it had become the most popular petition submitted to the Parliament website. But Mrs Georgiadou said the ""horrible"" phone calls left her scared and angry. The retired lecturer says she has also received abuse via her Facebook account. She said: ""I feel terrible, I feel angry with myself because I thought I was tougher than that. But I was scared."" ""I haven't even told my husband because he is very old and he would become hysterical."" Mrs Georgiadou said she created the petition to stop people ""moaning"" about how awful they thought Brexit was going to be. It has broken the record for the biggest petition on the Parliament's website, previously held by another Brexit-related petition from 2016. Allow Twitter content?

Mrs Georgiadou said she wanted to get as many people as possible to sign it - but she wasn't hoping for a government response. ""Democracy is ruled by society for society, not the majority for the majority,"" she said. ""I want it to prove it is no longer the will of the people. It was three years ago but the government has become infamous for changing their mind - so why can't the people? ""People should ask themselves, who is it that wants Brexit? It will help Putin, it will help Trumpâ¦ but will it help us? I doubt it,"" she continued. Tens of thousands on Brexit referendum march Stop Brexit petition tops 3m signatures Can the UK revoke Article 50? Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Since the success of her petition, Mrs Georgiadou has faced criticism over posts she allegedly made on social media, using threatening language about the prime minister. She said she had no memory of the posts. She said:  ""It must have been a cut and paste job. The dates were all wrong."" ""My friends thought it was funny. They have made photos of me trying to hold up a rifle with my zimmer-frame... I don't own a zimmer-frame by the way - or a rifle."" Mrs Georgiadou says she cannot attend the march for another EU referendum in London on Saturday but would welcome tributes from the demonstrators. ""I want them to sing a song for me, 'March on, march on, with hope in your heart and you'll never walk alone'."" Can the UK revoke Article 50?

"Shop worker fatally stabbed in robberyPolice described the attack as a ""violent robbery that escalated"".London","The shop worker was stabbed at a newsagents in Pinner A shop worker has been stabbed to death in a robbery at a newsagents in north-west London. It is believed the 54-year-old was attacked while opening Marsh Food and Wine in Pinner at about 06:00 GMT, the Met Police said. Detectives said the shop's till had been stolen and may have been dumped somewhere by the robber. The murder has been described as a ""tragedy"" by locals. No arrests have been made. A large part of Marsh Road is cordoned off and a forensics tent has been set up outside Costa Coffee Police said they wanted to hear from anyone who saw a black Vauxhall Astra being driven away from Marsh Road at speed. Det Ch Insp Simon Stancombe said: ""This was a violent robbery that has escalated, resulting in the murder of a man."" He urged anyone who found the till, or saw the car parked in Cecil Park before the attack, to come forward. There have been 29 deaths classed as ""homicides"" in London this year A large part of Marsh Road is cordoned off and a forensics tent has been set up outside Costa Coffee, next to the newsagents. Local business owner Peter Brook, who lives nearby, said the newsagents' employees delivered the morning papers to nearby businesses and were ""kind, polite and so committed to working in the local community"". Local people described the murder as a ""tragedy"" The 55-year-old, who has lived in Pinner for nearly two decades, added: ""People sometimes don't appreciate the people who come out at 5am to deliver a service to the local community.

Huge fossil discovery made in ChinaThe fossils found on a river bed in eastern China are estimated to be about 518 million years old.,"Scientists say the fossils have been ""exquisitely"" preserved Scientists say they have discovered a ""stunning"" trove of thousands of fossils on a river bank in China. The fossils are estimated to be about 518 million years old, and are particularly unusual because the soft body tissue of many creatures, including their skin, eyes, and internal organs, have been ""exquisitely"" well preserved. Palaeontologists have called the findings ""mind-blowing"" - especially because more than half the fossils are previously undiscovered species. The fossils, known as the Qingjiang biota, were collected near Danshui river in Hubei province. Fossils of soft-bodied creatures like jellyfish are extremely rare More than 20,000 specimens were collected, and a total of 4,351 have been analysed so far, including worms, jellyfish, sea anemones and algae. They will become a ""very important source in the study of the early origins of creatures"", one of the fieldwork leaders, Prof Xingliang Zhang from China's Northwest University, told the BBC. Details of the findings were published in the journal Science,externalon Friday. The creatures were rapidly buried by mudflows and sediment The discovery is particularly remarkable because ""the majority of creatures are soft-bodied organisms like jellyfish and worms that normally stand no chance of becoming fossilised"", Prof Robert Gaines, a geologist who also took part in the study, said in an email to the BBC. The majority of fossils tend to be of hard-bodied animals, as harder substances, like bones, are less likely to rot and decompose. The Qingjiang biota must have been ""rapidly buried in sediment"" due to a storm, in order for soft tissues to be so well preserved, Prof Zhang says. China fossil tells new supercontinent story Sea reptile one of the largest animals ever Naraoiids, a type of soft-shelled arthropod, were found at the site Scientists are especially excited by the jellyfish and sea anemone fossils, which Prof Gaines describes as ""unlike anything I have ever seen. Their sheer abundance and their diversity of forms is stunning"". Meanwhile, Prof Allison Daley, a palaeontologist who was not part of the study but wrote an accompanying analysis in Science,told BBC's Science in Action programme the find was one of the most significant in the last 100 years. ""It blew my mind - as a palaeontologist I never thought I'd get to witness the discovery of such an incredible site. ""For the first time we're seeing preservation of jellyfish - [when] you think of jellyfish today, they're so soft-bodied, so delicate, but they're preserved unbelievably well at this site."" An artist's impression of some of the species The research team are now documenting the remaining specimens, and conducting more drilling in the region to find out more about the ancient local ecosystem, and the fossilisation process. Prof Zhang says he looks forward to studying ""all these new species - I'm always excited when we get something new"". The research team says this is just the beginning of their work The fossils are from the Cambrian period, which began 541 million years ago and saw a rapid increase in animal diversity on Earth. Prof Gaines hopes his work will also strike a chord with modern readers. ""Biotic diversity today is something that we take for granted, even though there are indications that extinction rates are sharply increasing. ""Yet most of the major animal lineages were established in a singular event in the history of life, the Cambrian explosion,  the likes of which have never been seen before or after. It also reminds us of our deep kinship to all living animals."" China fossil tells new supercontinent story Does Jurassic Park make scientific sense?

Then, in the early hours of New Year's Day 2017, she got the call she was waiting for - a kidney had become available. ""It was like Christmas Day all over again for her,"" says Scot. ""I was hooking her up to the dialysis machine when the call came in. She started unhooking herself, got dressed and off she went."" Gina headed into hospital in Oxford. ""She was all ready and they said that as soon as they found a bed for her, they would begin prepping her for surgery. They kept coming in every half an hour reassuring her that everything would be fine,"" said Scot. But later that afternoon Gina got some devastating news. ""They came in and said they couldn't find a bed for her and she would have to go home."" Gina's transplant was cancelled and as far as they understood, the organ went to waste. Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it could not comment on individual cases but told 5 Live Investigates that ""decisions taken about any individual patient's care are taken in the best interests of that patient by the clinicians who are looking after them"". It added that the majority of transplants last year did not require an intensive care bed and it is used to accommodating increasing numbers of transplants. For Scot, the thought that a donated organ was not used is something he finds extremely difficult. ""I can't help but think the family who donated the kidney would be devastated just as much as I was, if not more so."" Although rare, Gina's case is not unique. Prof Nizam Mamode is chairman of the chapter of surgeons, at the British Transplantation Society. He told the programme that the transplant service is ""more than creaking"". He says availability of intensive care beds, difficulty accessing operating theatres, staff shortages and the provision of out-of-hours services are putting additional pressures on a service struggling to keep up with demand. ""I think it really is at breaking point. I don't think people can continue for much longer working on this basis and I think it really needs some urgent action. ""There's been a huge success in transplantation. The number of transplants has increased by about 50% over the last eight to 10 years, but the workload has gone up for everybody."" Prof Mamode said that the transplants team was under ""very, very significant"" stress, with surgeons regularly working extremely long shifts without a break. As of next year, adults in England will be considered potential donors unless they chose to opt out or are excluded. But an impact assessment carried out by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT)obtained by the Guardian newspaper and seen by the BBC,externalfound that the system is already under pressure. It found organ retrieval staff are experiencing ""extreme stress"". And it added that while it will take several years before the full impact of the changes will be felt, ""transplant capacity is already struggling to meet demand in some units"". A Welsh government spokesperson said there have been rare occasions when organs could not be retrieved because of lack of capacity but everything possible was done to avoid that happening. They added that they were working with NHSBT and hospitals across the UK ""to ensure opportunities for organ donation and transplantation are maximised within existing resources"". Meanwhile, the Scottish government said the capacity issues facing parts of the NHS in England are ""not replicated in Scottish transplant units"" but continues to monitor the situation closely, adding it is ""very rare in Scotland for a transplant unit to decline an organ due to capacity issues"". In Northern Ireland, people currently opt in to organ and tissue donation. Prof Mamode says the change in legislation in England is good news for patients, but capacity issues are already having an impact. ""We are aware of some cases across the country where, because of lack of capacity, an organ ends up not being transplanted because once you get to a very long time, the organ now is no longer suitable to be transplanted - that's a rare event but that has happened."" NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), which looks after transplant services across the UK, told 5 Live Investigates it was not possible to provide data on how many times an organ had not been used because of capacity issues. Scot says the fact that his wife Gina's operation did not go ahead left her ""devastated"". ""She kept it together long enough to get home and the sat down and started bawling. She thought it was going to be another four years if ever that she'd get another kidney or another chance at a kidney."" Gina did go on to have a successful transplant, but later developed an infection and died in February 2017. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the new system of consent will save hundreds of lives every year. ""We fully understand this approach will present a challenge to resources, including staffing. That's why we're investing an extra Â£34bn a year in cash terms into the NHS by 2023/24 and there will be a 12-month transition period to allow all necessary preparations to take place."" Sally Johnson, outgoing chief executive and former director of organ donation and transplantation for NHSBT, said: ""Organ donation and transplantation is a highly sensitive, challenging and intense working environment where time is critical. ""Every minute counts to ensure no donation goes to waste, which means we consistently work under pressure."" She added they expect the number of deceased organ donors and transplants to rise when the change in law comes into force, but said NHSBT is ""co-operating with all the organisations involved to make sure the necessary resources are in place to make the most of every donated organ"".

Has Banksy come to Portstewart?,"New Banksy-style street art in Portstewart is causing a stir If you squint and stand back, perhaps, it could look like a bona fide Banksy. It is a Wednesday morning on Portstewart's cliff walk and a small gathering of locals are peering at the County Londonderry town's latest piece of street art. What appeared on the back wall of the Dominican College overlooking Portstewart's rolling spiked dunes, is in the Banksy-style. It's not unlike the secretive artist's famous Slave Labour or No Ball Games. Portstewart's newest graffiti depicts a young boy crouching with his hands over his eyes. Has Banksy left his mark in Tokyo? Banksy confirmed as Welsh graffiti creator Banksy posts video of shredding stunt â¢Best of Banksy: Exhibition shows off greatest hits Is he playing hide and seek? Or is it something more sinister? Either way, this anonymous street art has people talking. Richard Stewart, owner of Molly Brown's Tea Room and Mullins Ice Cream on Portstewart's promenade, first heard about the town's new Banksy-style graffiti online. ""It started appearing on Facebook and on other social media. People were asking: 'Have you seen this?',"" he said. Richard Stewart said that people are visiting Portstewart in search of the ""Banksy"" ""There's a lot of people coming from all over Northern Ireland and even further afield,"" he said. Michael Hughes, owner of the Portstewart Galleries, said he was alerted to the new 'Banksy' when people started to appear in the gallery asking: ""Is it real?"" Mr Hughes took it upon himself to see this so-called Banksy for himself - and while he ""doesn't know whether it's a Banksy or not"" he said it's a nice piece of art regardless. Indeed, this is not the first Banksy-like street art to appear in Portstewart. Only a few metres before the cliff walk, there's another piece of a child cowering. Other social media posts of these pieces in Portstewart date back as far as 2014. Other Banksy-style street art have been spotted in Portstewart as far back as 2014 Julie-Anne Richmond, a local artist, said there aresome important signatures,externalto look out for if it was a Banksy. ""If you look at a lot of his other work it doesn't include the feet,"" she said. ""On this piece, the blacks aren't as full, perhaps. But it's similar to some of the pieces he's done of the children."" She too thinks it is a nice piece of work, even if she does not believe it is a Banksy. Banksy, the mysterious Bristol street artist, is famous for pieces such as Slave Labour (above) ""People who don't know anything about art or who haven't got an interest in art, they've heard the buzz and they want to know who Banksy is,"" she said. ""People who normally don't bother with galleries or art work are now thinking, 'I want in on this action'."" Whether or not it is a Banksy hardly matters if it brings people into the town, said Mr Stewart. ""Americans who were doing the Game of Thrones tour were close by and they searched towns in their surrounding area and the first thing that came up was 'Portstewart' and 'Banksy'. Julie-Anne Richmond said that the street art has generated interest in art in the town ""It's good for traders,"" he said. But Francis Scullion, owner of Cochrane's Footwear in Portstewart, said that while the new art has created a bit of buzz, it is hard to tell whether it brings more business to the town. Walking down the stone steps back towards the promenade, Mr Hughes said he hopes the art is maintained. ""There's a clear groundswell of opinion in the town that the council should put something over this to protect it,"" said Mr Hughes. A spokeswoman for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said that the council has ""received no correspondence in relation to this matter"". Michael Hughes said if Banksy ever comes to Portstewart that he could use his shutter to paint on If Banksy were to visit Northern Ireland, Mrs Richmond said she would be intrigued to see his take on the political situation here. ""Banksy has no fear and no qualms about speaking about his political views,"" she said. In fact, Mr Hughes said he would welcome Banksy to Portstewart himself. ""Would he please put something on the shutter of my gallery? Please feel free to use that. ""I'd get something like Â£3.4m for a shutter like that,"" he said. Has Banksy left his mark in Tokyo?

Campervan driver stranded at high tide,"The driver had tried to cross an hour after the safe crossing time had ended A horsebox driver became stranded when he attempted to cross a causeway at high tide. The man had to be rescued when the van became submerged on the Holy Island road, which is under water twice a day. He managed to escape and reach a refuge box. It is thought he did not realise it was unsafe to cross because he spoke little English. Ian Clayton, from Seahouses RNLI, said: ""We suspect that language problems may have contributed to this incident."" He added that despite the language difficulty they were able to establish no animals were inside the horsebox at the time. The man managed to make his way to a refuge box, seen here during low tide The rescue happened just after 15:00 GMT on Saturday. Safe crossing times to the island - also known as Lindisfarne - on Saturday were 08:20 until 13:50 and it was unsafe to cross until 20:50. Northumberland County Council installed warning signs at either end of the mile-long causeway in 2012 in a bid to cut the number of strandings. They display a message to check the tide tables followed by the safe crossing times.

Thailand votes in first post-coup election,"Turnout was expected to be high for this first election since 2011 Thai voters have taken part in the country's first general election since the 2014 coup. Thailand has been buffeted by political instability for years, largely a battle between supporters of the military and ousted former PM Thaksin Shinawatra. After seizing power the army promised to restore order and democracy, but has repeatedly postponed the vote. Critics say a new constitution the army introduced will ensure it remains influential whatever the outcome. More than 50 million people are eligible to vote and the authorities said turnout could be as high as 80%. More than seven million people aged between 18-26 have the right to vote for the first time and could be key to victory, so all parties have been keen to court their vote. A guide to Thailand's post-coup election Voting in Thailand's hybrid democracy The princess and Thailand's political games On the eve of the election, Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn issued a statement urging ""peace and order"" during the voting process. The statement, which was featured on national television on Saturday evening, urged voters to ""support the good people"". By Nick Beake, BBC News, Bangkok Voters in central Bangkok faced a final obstacle as they tried to cast their ballot - determined runners steaming through the park where an open-air polling station had been set up. But after waiting five years since the military coup, Thais are determined to finally have their say on their country's future - even if the electoral system has been skewed by the ruling junta to try to keep them in power. The beaming faces of the 31 different candidates here in the Klong Toey constituency look out from a big poster which provides a last-minute visual guide for those picking up their ballot papers. Really, though, this election boils down to a simple choice - do you want the army to stay in power? We meet Peerasin, 23, who is one of seven million first-time voters. He and his mum explain that they're hopeful for change but that dad is more conservative. Dad nods and smiles in agreement. Next, a family of eight arrive to cast their votes. Sisters Mai, a banker and May, who works in the pharmaceutical industry, say they don't talk politics at home. But that doesn't mean they don't have passionate opinions. So what's your message to whoever wins power, I ask. ""The country has been suffering for a long time"", Mai explains. ""But we hope this election will end peacefully and that there will be no corruption. We are hopeful."" The election is primarily a contest between pro-military parties and allies of Mr Thaksin. He was ousted in a coup in 2006 and lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a conviction for abuse of power. But he still has a significant following, largely among rural and less affluent voters. Parties loyal to Mr Thaksin have won every election since 2001, and the BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head says crippling this movement has been a central - if unofficial - objective of the military. Pheu Thai (For Thais) is the leading Thaksin-loyal party campaigning this time. General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the coup which ousted Mr Thaksin's sister Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014, has been nominated as the only prime ministerial candidate of the newly formed pro-military Palang Pracha Rath Party (PPRP). Among other prominent parties are the Democrats, led by former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, and the new Future Forward party, led by a young billionaire, Thanatorn Juangroongruangkit. This video can not be played Why young voters could be key in Thailand's election At the time of the coup, the military said it wanted to restore order and stability and prevent the street protests which have broken out repeatedly over the years. But the junta has been accused of taking an authoritarian approach to power, strictly controlling the media and arbitrarily usinglaws like lese majeste- which prohibits any criticism of the monarchy - to silence opponents. It also introduced a constitution - approved by a referendum - which its critics say is designed to ensure it remains central in Thai politics. More news from Thailand Maya Bay: The beach no-one can touch The Thai cave boys: What happened next? My life as  a 17-year-old in Bangkok The man who takes animals to funerals Voters on Sunday will be electing 500 members of the lower house of parliament. But under the constitution, a 250-seat senate has been appointed by the military. The two houses will together elect a prime minister - a candidate only needs half the votes plus one to win. So the military's preferred candidate - Gen Prayuth - would in theory only need 126 lower house votes to take office. The governing party or coalition can also appoint a non-MP as prime minister. General Prayuth Chan-ocha voted in Bangkok on Sunday The new constitution also imposes a limit on the number of seats any one party can take, regardless of the number of votes won, and any future government is constitutionally bound to follow the military's 20-year plan for Thailand. Preliminary unofficial results will emerge within hours, but correspondents say it will take some time for the future direction of Thailand to become clear, as parties negotiate deals and coalitions.

Britons tell of 'frightening' ship rescue,"This video can not be played British passenger Derek Browne: 'We were told Mayday Mayday!' British holidaymakers airlifted from a cruise ship stranded in rough seas off the Norwegian coast have described their ""frightening experience"". Derek and Esther Browne, from Hampshire, were among 200 Britons on board the MV Viking Sky when it sent a mayday call on Saturday. Helicopters and ships were called in to rescue the passengers and crew. Another passenger, George Davis, from Manchester, said it took 10 hours for him and his wife Barbara to be rescued. The vessel has since restarted three of its four engines and is moving towards the nearest port with the assistance of tugboats. This video can not be played Footage from on board showed furniture crashing and sliding as the vessel tilted Viking Cruises said in a statement,externalthat of the 1,373 people originally on board, 894 guests and crew remain on board, while the 479 who were airlifted are on shore with arrangements being made to fly them home. Twenty people suffered injuries and some remain in medical care, according to Viking Cruises. Three people were thought to be in a serious condition, local media group NRK reported. Norway cruise ship evacuated after engine problems Mr Browne told BBC Radio 5Live's Stephen Nolan show: ""We had a few people on stretchers, several with cuts, a few with broken limbs."" He said the ship had been ""rolling and rolling"" all night on Friday before losing engine power on Saturday. The ship's crew managed to anchor the ship in Hustadvika Bay, according to police in Moere og Romsdal, amid fears the vessel would run aground. Mr Browne said: ""We were going for the afternoon film show and the lights suddenly went out and then suddenly more rolling. We heard the anchor being dropped and then we were told: 'Mayday, mayday!' And the bleeps went off on the radio and that was it - we all had to evacuate."" The evacuation was hampered by the conditions, he said: ""The lifeboats couldn't function and the rescuers couldn't come out because the seas were so rough, so they sent helicopters. ""Two helicopters had to take off 930 passengers"". He said it was ""quite a frightening experience"". ""I'd never been in a helicopter before,"" he said. ""There were a lot of high winds, hovering overhead and the winchman came down and we were then collected up and so I shut my eyes as we arrived into the helicopter, and there were 15 of us for about a 20-minute ride."" By 22:40, 155 people had been brought to shore. George Davis said the ship was 'swinging everywhere' George Davis, from Manchester, told the BBC he and his wife Barbara waited 10 hours to be rescued from the ship. ""It was a very scary event"", he said, adding: ""Locals tell us they were amazed that we sailed into the teeth of a storm they knew was coming"". Speaking from a hotel in in Kristiansand, Mr Davis said: ""It was one of most frightening moments I've had, because the waves - we just sort of lost it really and couldn't quite work out where the ship was going. ""It was swinging everywhere. The wind was terrible - it was freezing cold as well"". One of the rescue ships - a freighter named Hagland Captain - also lost engine power and two helicopters were diverted to rescue its crew. Chris and Debbie O'Connor, from Kingston-Upon-Thames in London, were among those who stayed on the ship overnight. Speaking to the BBC from the ship, Mr O'Connor said the conditions outside were ""outrageous"" on Saturday, leading him to feel safer staying on the vessel. He said: ""The thought of going out in those 40 mph winds and those 30 foot waves up to a helicopter - I did not want to."" The boat is being towed to the city of Molde, on Norway's west coast, authorities said. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: ""We are in touch with Norwegian authorities and stand ready to help any British people who require our assistance"". MV Viking Sky is a Viking Ocean Cruises ship, which had its maiden voyage in 2017. Website MarineTraffic shows the vessel was en route to Stavanger from Tromso, and is drifting off the town of Farstad near Molde on the country's western coast.

Stricken Norway cruise ship heads to port,"This video can not be played Footage from on board showed furniture crashing and sliding as the vessel tilted A cruise ship that got into trouble off the Norwegian coast has arrived safely at the port of Molde after the dramatic rescue of hundreds of people. The Viking Sky lost power on Saturday and sent out a distress signal after it began drifting towards land. Almost 500 of the 1,373 people on board were airlifted off in bad weather. Three of the ship's four engines were later restarted for its trip to port. Footage from inside the vessel showed it heaving violently in rough seas. Evacuations were halted as the Viking Sky made its way to Molde on Sunday, accompanied by several tugboats. Rescuers said they were ready to resume operations if the captain deemed it necessary. The Viking sky arriving at Molde port in Norway on Sunday afternoon The vessel was able to dock safely, with ambulance staff on hand to help with any injuries The Viking Sky suffered engine failure on Saturday afternoon while en route to Stavanger from Tromso in a notoriously treacherous stretch of waters. Britons tell of 'frightening' rescue Fisherman Jan Erik Fiskerstrand, whose boat was one of the first to come to help Viking Sky, told Aftenposten newspaper, ""it was just minutes before this could have gone really wrong"". The ship could have hit the rocks ""if they had not started the engine and fastened the anchor"" he added. Five helicopters and several rescue ships were called in but poor weather meant the lifeboats were forced to turn back. The authorities decided to launch airlifts rather than leave people on board and hundreds were hoisted to safety. Among those rescued, 20 people suffered injuries. Most of the passengers are said to be British or US citizens, many of them elderly. The cruise's operator said436 guests and 458 crew remained on board.,external Derek Browne, from southern England, who was travelling with his wife Esther told the BBC the ship had been ""rolling and rolling"" all night on Friday before losing engine power on Saturday. He said being airlifted to safety was ""quite a frightening experience"". George Davis, from Manchester, said he and his wife Barbara waited 10 hours to be rescued.

One of those still on board, Lara from Birmingham in the UK, said ""the crew were magnificent and have kept the remaining passengers safe, warm and fed"". The Viking Sky is a Viking Ocean Cruises ship, which had its maiden voyage in 2017. The company said ""throughout all of this, our first priority was for the safety and wellbeing of our passengers and our crew"". Trevor English, an engineer and technical author based in Texas who has written about the workings of cruise ships, told the BBC that thousands of cruises take place each year and this type of failure - or combination of failures - is rare. ""It's important we understand that the engineering of these ships are held to high standards,"" he says, adding that while vessels such as the Viking Sky have four engines, ""it's possible for components to break that could cause the entire power system to fail"". He continues: ""What makes this event unique is the storms. In many cases, if engines are lost, they can be restored quickly with no issue. ""While one engine on the Viking Sky was soon restored, the storms made the lack of propulsion especially dire,"" Mr English says. He adds that cruises on large vessels are generally very safe, but: ""Like everything we choose to do in life, it's an evaluation of risk."" Are you in the area?

Scottish independence vote 'will happen',"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has predicted that another independence referendum will take place in Scotland. But she said it was reasonable for her to wait for clarity on Brexit before setting out a firm position. Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird has, meanwhile, blamed the prime minister for the uncertainty over the UK and the EU. Conservative MP Andrew Bowie said the last thing voters want is the general election Labour would like to see. In an interview for theAndrew Marr Showon BBC One, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Another Scottish independence referendum is going to happen. ""Nothing in this life is absolutely certain but I think it's as inevitable as its possible to be. ""Before I set forward a path for Scotland I think it's reasonable for me to know what the starting point of that journey is going to be and the context in which we are going to be embarking on it. ""We need to know - and hopefully we will know this over the next few days and over the next three weeks. ""Is the UK leaving the EU? Is it leaving with a deal? Is it leaving with no deal or is it not leaving at all, perhaps looking at another referendum?"" Ms Sturgeon joined a crowd which has been estimated at over one million people on a march in London todemand a second Brexit referendum. The first minister said the handling of the Brexit process by the UK government had strengthened the case for Scottish independence. She added: ""The experience of the last, almost three years now: Scotland's vote ignored, the voice of the Scottish parliament ignored, all of the consequences that flow from Brexit completely outwith our control. ""That really does make the case for independence very very powerfully."" Speaking to theSunday Politics Scotlandprogramme, Labour's Lesley Laird said the fact that there was so little certainty over the way ahead on Brexit was down to Theresa May. ""The reason we haven't got to a position in parliament of being able to formulate a clear view,"" she said, ""is because of the way that the prime minister has handled this whole negotiation. ""She hasn't dealt with parliament, she hasn't given parliament the opportunity to have these discussions around the indicative votes."" But Labour's idea of putting the issue to voters in a general election was  strongly criticised by Andrew Bowie, who is a parliamentary private secretary to the prime minister. Speaking on the same programme, he said: ""The vast majority of people in this country, the last thing they want - contrary to the Labour Party - is another general election. ""I'm not in a position, I don't think anybody here is in a position to make a prediction on where we will be this time next week.""

'Brexit will define UK',"Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar has said that Brexit will define the UK for the next generation. Mr Varadkar added that ""it doesn't have to define"" the Republic of Ireland. The taoiseach told delegates at the Fine Gael conference in Wexford that ""we live in extraordinary times"". ""The last two and a half years, the last two and half months, even the last two and a half days have seen many twists and turns in the Brexit saga,"" he said. ""Throughout all of it, we have stayed firm. We have held our nerve and we have stayed the course."" Reaction after EU leaders agree Brexit delay Brexit: What just happened? Brexit: EU wins itself some breathing spaceReaction after EU leaders agree Brexit delay Earlier on Saturday, the taoiseach said there were ""rough and preliminary"" plans in place to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland if there was a no deal Brexit. On Friday, Mr Varadkar saidBrexit could be delayed for another year if British MPs decide they want the government to radically change its policy. Just weeks ahead local and European elections Mr Varadkar used his speech to criticise opposition parties. He said Fianna FÃ¡il was ""a party of no ideas, no policies, no alternatives"". ""In contrast, Sinn FÃ©in is a party with plenty of ideas and policies. Bad ones,"" he said. ""And I can tell you tonight that under no circumstances will Fine Gael enter Government with Sinn FÃ©in."" Mr Varadkar added the party stands by the Good Friday Agreement and that the party supports an ""ever closer co-operation"" between north and south and east and west. He reiterated plans for a referendum in the autumn to extend voting rights in Republic of Ireland presidential elections to ""all Irish citizens no matter where they live"". ""I know that there are mixed feelings about it and it's a referendum that won't be easily won. But I am sure it's the right thing to do. ""There's no such thing as a second class Irish citizen. I believe an Irish citizen in Belfast, or Sydney or Chicago is every bit as Irish as one in Wexford or Dublin or Galway,"" he said.

Passengers airlifted from Norway cruise ship,"This video can not be played Footage from on board showed furniture crashing and sliding as the vessel tilted Rescuers have airlifted hundreds of people stranded on a cruise ship off the west coast of Norway. The Viking Sky lost power on Saturday and sent out a distress signal after it began drifting towards land. It got into trouble in a notoriously difficult stretch of waters and was reportedly minutes from striking rocks. The vessel has since restarted three of its four engines and is moving towards the nearest port with the assistance of tugboats. So far, almost 500 of the 1,373 passengers have been airlifted off the ship. Most of those on board are said to be British or US citizens. ""During the night, the sea was very rough. The boat rolled and rolled. And then we went to breakfast. And then we were going for the afternoon film show, and then the lights suddenly went out,"" said Derek Browne, from southern England, who was on board with his wife Esther. ""We were airlifted on the helicopter, which was quite a frightening experience."" Britons tell of 'frightening' rescue Another rescued passenger, Janet Jacob, told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK she had ""never seen anything so frightening"". ""I started to pray. I prayed for the safety of everyone on board,"" she said. ""The helicopter trip was terrifying."" This video can not be played British passenger Derek Browne: 'We were told Mayday Mayday!' The Viking Sky suffered engine failure on Saturday afternoon while en route to Stavanger from Tromso. Five helicopters and several rescue ships were called in for the rescue. One of the rescue ships also lost engine power and a local paper said the ""brutal"" conditions meant lifeboats were forced to turn back. Fisherman Jan Erik Fiskerstrand, whose boat was one of the first to come to help Viking Sky, told Aftenposten newspaper, ""it was just minutes before this could have gone really wrong"". The ship could have hit the rocks ""if they had not started the engine and fastened the anchor"". Olav Magne Stromsholm, who captains tourist vessels in the area, told the VG newspaper the Viking Sky had been ""near disaster"", calling the waters there a ""shipyard cemetery"". Those brought ashore are being taken to a local sports complex and accommodation had been found for them in local hotels. Seventeen people have been taken to hospital. The Viking Sky is a Viking Ocean Cruises ship, which had its maiden voyage in 2017. Are you in the area? If it's safe to share your experiences, then please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

US Congress awaits Mueller report findings,"Attorney General William Barr (R) will decide how much of the Mueller report to share with Congress US congressional leaders have been given conclusions from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The long-awaited report was submitted on Friday to Attorney General William Barr, who pored over the document before handing a summary to Congress. The report is the culmination of two years of investigation by Mr Mueller. A justice department official has said it does not call for new charges. In the course of their investigation, Mr Mueller and his team have already charged 34 people - including six former Trump aides and a dozen Russians - as well as three companies. None of those charges directly related to the allegations of collusion between the campaign and Moscow - allegations that President Trump has always denied. President Trump has spent the weekend at his Florida resort What might 'Mueller report' look like? Trump Russia: The saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Mr Mueller reportedly also examined another question: whether Mr Trump committed obstruction of justice in an effort to curtail an FBI investigation into connections between his campaign and Russians. It is not yet known how much of the report - if any - will be made available to the public. It is not clear how much information is being shared with Congress. Mr Barr, who was appointed by Mr Trump, told congressional leaders on Friday that he was ""committed to as much transparency as possible."" The president has spent the weekend at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. He has been uncharacteristically silent on social media - posting no remarks on the report. The president has in the past repeatedly lashed out at the special counsel investigation, branding it a ""witch hunt"". Who is special counsel Robert Mueller? What does the special counsel do? Key questions answered in the Trump Russia probe This video can not be played How US networks reacted to Mueller news Despite all the attention is has received since it was submitted on Friday, the special counsel's investigation is not the only probe that could threaten Mr Trump's presidency. About a dozen other investigations are being run independently of Mr Mueller's office. They include a federal investigation in New York that is looking into possible election-law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses and possible misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee. Legally, the attorney general is under no obligation to release the report publicly, but during his confirmation hearings before senators Mr Barr vowed to release as much as he could. A number of senior Democrats, including presidential hopefuls Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Julian Castro, have called for the full release of the report. The House of Representatives, newly controlled by the Democratic party following last year's mid-term elections, will also continue to investigate the Trump administration and could ask Mr Mueller to testify or instruct Mr Barr to provide relevant materials.

Trump hails fall of IS 'caliphate',"This video can not be played Kurdish TV showed the SDF raising a yellow flag on top of buildings seized from IS in Baghuz US President Donald Trump welcomed the fall of the Islamic State group's five-year ""caliphate"", but warned that the terror group remained a threat. Mr Trump's remarks came after Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) raised victory flags in the Syrian town of Baghuz, IS's last stronghold. He said the US would ""remain vigilant until [IS] is finally defeated"". Despite losing territory in Syria and Iraq, IS remains active in countries from Nigeria to the Philippines. At its height, the group controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) across Syria and Iraq. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Islamic State women defiant in face of lost caliphate Tales from inside the chaos left by IS After five years of fierce battle, though, local forces backed by world powers left IS with all but a few hundred square metres near Syria's border with Iraq. On Saturday, the long-awaited announcement came from the SDF that it had seized that last IS territory. Western leaders hailed the announcement but emphasised that IS was still a danger. ""We will remain vigilant... until it is finally defeated wherever it operates,"" Mr Trump said in a statement. French President Emmanuel Macron said ""the threat remains and the fight against terrorist groups must continue"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the ""historic milestone"" but said her government remained ""committed to eradicating [IS's] poisonous ideology"". This video can not be played BBC Arabic's Feras Kilani says that losing their last stronghold is unlikely to be the end of Islamic State. In a statement released by the White House on Saturday, Mr Trump said the US would ""continue to work with our partners and allies... to fight [IS] until it is finally defeated."" ""The United States will defend American interests whenever and wherever necessary,"" the statement read. Mr Trump described IS's loss of territory as ""evidence of its false narrative"", adding: ""They have lost all prestige and power."" He also appealed to ""all of the young people on the internet believing in [IS] propaganda"", saying: ""Think instead about having a great life."" This video can not be played IS 'remains a threat', US envoy warns The SDF alliance began its final assault on IS at the start of March, with the remaining militants holed up in the village of Baghuz in eastern Syria. The alliance was forced to slow its offensive after it emerged that a large number of civilians were also there, sheltering in buildings, tents and tunnels. Thousands of women and children, foreign nationals among them, fled the fighting and severe shortages to make their way to SDF-run camps for displaced persons. Many IS fighters have also abandoned Baghuz, but those who stayed put up fierce resistance, deploying suicide bombers and car bombs. IS grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq in the aftermath of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. It joined the rebellion against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. By 2014 it had seized swathes of land in both countries and proclaimed a ""caliphate"". IS once imposed its rule on almost eight million people, and generated billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping, using its territory as a platform to launch foreign attacks. The rise and fall of Islamic State Why is there a war in Syria? The fall of Baghuz is a major moment in the campaign against IS. The Iraqi government declared victory against the militants in 2017. But the group is far from defeated. US officials believe IS may have 15,000 to 20,000 armed adherents active in the region, many of them in sleeper cells, and that it will return to its insurgent roots while attempting to rebuild. Even as its defeat in Baghuz was imminent, IS released a defiant audio recording purportedly from its spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, asserting that the caliphate was not finished. The location of the group's overall leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is not known. But he has avoided being captured or killed, despite having fewer places to hide.

In pictures: Life after the Army,"Photographer Ed Gold interviewed soldiers who served in Afghanistan and asked them about their experiences of adjusting to civilian life. Soldiers Callum Wright, Scott Meenagh, Geoff Dunn, Dan Eccles and Terry Jones all served in the Parachute Regiment, known as the Paras. Ed worked with the Paras as a photojournalist in the UK and in Afghanistan, taking thousands of images of army life. The photos shown here document the Para soldiers between July 2010 and July 2011 and when he caught up with them again in  2018 after they left the Army. Callum Wright, 29, followed in the footsteps of three generations of his family and joined the Army, when he was 19. Initially, Callum wanted to be a tank transporter like his two older brothers but then decided he would rather be in the ""nitty gritty"" of combat and to push himself further. He chose the Parachute Regiment, despite the high failure rate. Out of 72 people in his intake group, he was one of only 10 who made it through to becoming part of the elite airborne infantry regiment. Callum did one tour of Afghanistan. But after returning to the UK, he felt restless in the Army. ""When I got back, I got bored,"" he says. ""It was the same mundane [work] day in, day out. ""For me, when I knew the Afghan [tour] was coming up and when I was out there, I felt that I mattered and I was doing something that mattered. ""But that feeling disappeared when we were back in the barracks."" After being unable to transfer to the unit that his brothers were in, Callum decided to leave the Army and start a new chapter in his life with his wife. He became a personal trainer and also worked in a whisky distillery. But civilian life didn't suit Callum for long and, after 14 months, he returned to the Army, as a tank transporter. ""That feeling, 'I have more to give,' came back, almost like a regret that I had left,"" he says. But after another two years in the Army, Callum had a change of heart again. ""I was doing 17 hours a day and was tired all of the time,"" he says. He became an apprentice at a butcher's. ""I love it - and that's me."" ""I love working with my hands, like when you're taking all the meat off the bone, it [appeals to] the caveman in me."" But Callum still remembers his Army days fondly. ""I miss the blokes,"" he says, ""everyone was going through the same, just close friends. The biggest thing I miss is the sense that you matter. ""When you're in the Army, you wear a uniform and you are this presence  - you are visibly serving. But when you leave, you don't matter. You are just the same as everyone else on the street."" Now, Callum is making new plans again. He has started training to be a technician with the Scottish Ambulance Service. Scotty Meenagh, 28, had always wanted to belong to the Paras. ""If you are part of the airborne, there is nobody else to look up to. You're the best soldier,"" he says. ""They've been famous throughout history. I grew up being inspired by the Paras in the Falklands War. It was a unit that could complete impossible tasks that no other unit in the army could do at that time."" Scotty signed up to the military at 15, joining the Army Foundation College in Harrogate. However, 18 months into his training, he was injured and discharged. He rejoined at the age of 19 and started training at the Para Depot. After 46 weeks of training, he qualified and did a tour of Afghanistan in 2010. Scotty was ""Vallon man"", which means he searched the route ahead of the patrol, including using a metal detector, to make sure it was safe. He was also a medic. ""Your mates are relying on you to protect them,"" he says. ""You're not focusing so much on the combat role, so my weapon would be slung over my back and I'd be relying on a soldier behind me for my protection."" On 25 January 2011, Scotty was injured by a bomb that also killed one of his comrades. The injury meant that Scotty became a double amputee. Recalling his rehabilitation, he says: ""You go through so many different states, it's hard to believe you were in that position - it's a strange start of coping mechanisms. ""When you think back to such tough times, you remove the person from it."" Scotty says he now puts all his energy into sport. ""After being wounded, you need to try different things to rediscover your purpose. I found that sport enabled me to get out of bed every morning."" In 2014, Scotty turned his attention to cross-country skiing, after seeing it at the Paralympics in Sochi, in Russia. He went on to race on the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup circuit and, in 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, became the first British sit-skier to race at the Paralympics. He is currently training for the 2022 Beijing Paralympics, and he's also about to get married and ""make a family"" for himself. ""My fiancee and I have got a house and are living a nice normal life."" Geoff Dunn's family tradition of serving in the military stretches back as far as the colonial wars of the 19th Century. Geoff, 48, joined the Paras when he was 17, believing them to be the pinnacle of the infantry. He went on tours in Northern Ireland and Africa. But after he got married, he felt he needed to choose between the military or his family, having seen a number of friends divorce. After leaving the Army, he took up a couple of civilian jobs before eventually settling in a role as a response officer with the police. Over time, he moved in to firearms policing. After 15 years in the police force, Geoff felt the call to once again ""do his bit"" in the Paras, motivated by the 2009 British operation in Afghanistan and the people he knew who had been killed or injured. ""To be totally truthful, [I wanted] to test myself. It really did feel like a call to arms,"" he says. ""It wasn't a light decision to go, as I had a wife and two teenage sons."" He knew that after being out of the Paras for so long, he would have to start from the bottom again. Aged 40, Geoff passed the recruitment physical test. This included a 10-mile run carrying approximately 40lb (18kg) of kit, which he finished in less than two hours. He was quickly accepted back into the Paras. After a tour in Afghanistan, Geoff left the Army and eventually went into private protection, protecting maritime workers in the Indian Ocean. However, he says a family death made him reassess the amount of time he was spending away from home. He went to work for the Civil Nuclear Constabulary as a firearms instructor, among other duties. But after three years, a former boss asked him if he wanted to return to the police force. ""I've always thought you have one life and that it is very limiting if you tie yourself to one thing,"" he says. ""However, if you enjoy it, then get good at it."" From a young age, Dan Eccles wanted a challenge. ""I've always known about the Paras,"" the 26-year-old says. ""I had a little recruitment book that inspired me. I was hooked and wanted a slice of it."" At 17, Dan went to the Catterick Para Depot. It was the hardest thing he's ever done, he says, physically and mentally. After passing his training, he went to Afghanistan. Serving there was the reason he had signed up, he says. But Dan found that returning to the UK and settling into civilian life outside of the Army was not so straightforward. ""When you come back, it's hard to adjust,"" he says. ""You spend six or seven months fully switched on and you're always looking at every single person, [thinking] 'What are they doing? Are they carrying weapons? Who are they speaking to? ""So when you come back, it's very confusing. You can't switch your brain off. I didn't really get that much help. I struggled for a few years."" Dan took a welding course, funding it himself by working in a retail stockroom. But three years in he became depressed. ""I missed the excitement [of the Army]. Being in the stock room was very mundane."" But his perseverance paid off, with his training leading to a welding job, making metal appliances for kitchens in restaurants, cafes and hotels. Dan's other passion in civilian life has been powerlifting, a hobby he started before he left the Army. ""I was so short and skinny and tiny,"" he says. ""I wasn't interested in looking ripped. I just wanted to eat a lot of food and get very strong."" Terry Jones, 29, joined the Army to get out of his local Welsh town. He enrolled in the Paras when he was 17. He served for nearly 10 years and completed two Afghan tours, including the tour known as Herrick 8 in 2008. He says of this tour: ""It was horrendous. It had the worst death rate since World War Two for the Paras."" On his second Afghan tour, in 2011, Terry was hurt trying to help his injured comrade Scott. He sustained a head injury and was put into an induced coma for 10 days. He lost 70% of the vision in his left eye and was medically discharged in 2014. ""I miss the lads, the banter and how close you are down there,"" he says. ""You look out for each together. Everybody has got each other's back."" After leaving the Paras, Terry worked as a lorry driver and then in a furniture shop. He later became the owner a PVC plastics company that made items such as bouncy castles - but since leaving the business, he has focused on looking after his family. ""Right now is the happiest I've ever been,"" he says. ""I spend a lot of time with my kids, on bike rides and taking them on holiday."" Photos and interviews byEd Gold,external.

Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition,"Questions have been asked about whether a government petition calling for Brexit to be cancelled has been swamped by bots. Bots are automated programmes which can carry out a command thousands of times. The BBC spoke to three cyber-security experts about how likely it is that a number of the 3m signatures gathered so far are not genuine. They all agreed that the petition's email validation process would be a deterrent. Each signatory has to supply a unique email address to which a verification link is sent before their signature can be accepted. UK-based signatories must also share a valid postcode. While email addresses are easy enough to set up, doing that in real time at high volume is less straightforward. Additionally, while it is possible to buy lists of email addresses stolen in various data breaches on the black market, the owner of the list would still need to access those email accounts and retrieve the validation email before being able to sign in the name of somebody else. Petition to revoke Article 50 passes 3m signatures Brexit pushed back by at least two weeks The email verification would be likely to deter bots said Lisa Forte, partner at the cyber-security firm Red-Goat. ""Any significant political decision such as this petition is highly likely to attract bots,"" she told the BBC. ""This particular petition is now employing email verification before signing, meaning it is much harder and therefore much less likely bots are being employed."" Cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont said that while it was possible that bots were involved, it would be ""a bit of a pain"" to build a sophisticated enough programme to cope with the email addresses. ""They would have to make a bot that signs up with unique email addresses, then clicks the unique link to sign,"" he said. The House of Commons declined to comment on its security checks but it did say the Government Digital Service uses ""a number of techniques"" to identify potentially fraudulent signatures and bot activity. It is not possible to use the same email address more than once to sign the petition. However, bot activity could still be used to slow down or crash the platform, meaning that people wanting to leave genuine signatures could be prevented from doing so. This is known as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. ""I'm not sure the system itself is that sophisticated - it fell over as soon as people started voting in large numbers,"" said Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University. The UK government's petition platform has crashed several times under the weight of traffic in recent days. The petition launched on 20 February, but has now gone viral. ""Is there some gaming going on? I wouldn't be at all surprised,"" he added. ""It's a petition, it's not a vote - it's not meant to be as secure as an e-voting system."" Allow Twitter content?

The 'controlled chaos' of raising sextuplets,"Lauren Perkins gave birth to sextuplets in 2012 A woman in Houston has given birth to sextuplets in under 10 minutes. So what lies ahead when she brings her six newborns home? They say it takes a village to raise a child, however, they don't say what it takes to raise sextuplets. While becoming a parent can be a scary and worrying time for anyone, what is it like to raise six babies all at once? We spoke to two families raising children born in multiple births to find out. Lauren Perkins said she was in ""complete shock"" and ""overwhelmed"" when she found out that she would be giving birth to sextuplets. ""I knew we needed a support system, because there was no way we were going to pull this off by ourselves,"" she told the BBC. Luckily for Lauren, her community stepped in after her family grew by six overnight. ""We would not have survived the first year without them,"" she says. Lauren and her husband Dave at the Texas Children's Pavilion for Women in 2012 The Perkins sextuplets came home from the hospital one at a time, which Lauren says helped her adjust. ""The sixth baby to come home was Leah, who has previous developmental problems, and that was a bit overwhelming."" Danish MP told baby 'not welcome' in parliament chamber Bronchiolitis: 'I thought it was just a cold at first' 'Tiniest baby boy' ever sent home leaves Tokyo hospital With six babies to feed, bathe and clothe, Lauren developed a tight schedule. ""I would make up bottles each night for the next 24 hours and set them in the fridge with labels on so everyone knew which baby they were for and at what time."" Because of the different nutritional needs of the sextuplets, the family were using four different types of formula milk at one point. She also developed a shift system so that those volunteering to help could have the biggest impact. ""Friends would sign up to come and do feeding shifts in the middle of the night, they would help with giving the babies baths and doing laundry. ""We wouldn't have made it without that generosity,"" Lauren reflects. ""They brought us dinner for an entire year!"" There are many factors that lead to multiple pregnancy, including a family history of twins, falling pregnant over the age of thirty, or having previous pregnancies. African-American women are more likely to have twins than any other group, while white women, especially those over age of 35, are most likely to give birth to triplets or more. Reproductive technologies have greatly increased the multiple birth rate in recent years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) and other techniques that help couples conceive often use ovulation-stimulating medications to produce multiple eggs. These are then fertilised in the laboratory and returned to the uterus to develop. According to the Centres of Disease Control and prevention,external""more than three-quarters of triplets and higher order multiples in the United States resulted from conception assisted by fertility treatments"". The number of women giving birth to multiples in the US rose 76% from 1980 to 2009, but still only accounts for3.5% of all births,external. In 2017,there were only 31 babies born in the US,externalas part of quintuplets or a higher-order multiple. Like twins, other multiples can be identical (where one egg splits into two or more embryos), or fraternal (when more than one egg is fertilised). Medical complications becomeincreasingly likely with each additional foetus,externalin a multiple pregnancy, and can result in serious health problems. While the Perkins' loved ones donated their time, many also donated essential supplies. Lauren says that her family went through ""astronomically expensive"" formula milk at a rapid rate, and relied heavily on second-hand clothes. ""Several friends threw baby showers and we always asked for diapers. Every birthday, we asked for diapers and clothes for the babies."" In the end, Lauren didn't have to buy nappies for the first two years, after making a concerted effort to limit the number of changes. The Perkins sextuplets on their first birthday As the children grew, the challenges changed. ""Potty training was a complete nightmare,"" Lauren remembers. ""There are just so many to keep an eye on, and you have to watch them so closely when potty training. There were a few accidents, but we did it in the end!"" Lauren explains that as the sextuplets became more independent, her support system dwindled. ""As they grew up, logistics got easier. It has become a sort of controlled chaos. It's noisy, a lot of people and stuff, but it's this weird system that just works."" The Perkins sextuplets are almost aged seven now, and Lauren says she goes through the ""normal phases of parenthood"" like anyone else. ""It's just different because I do everything at once, which makes me glad and sad. ""I know I have to soak in all the cute kids stuff as much as possible because I'm not doing it again. I'll never get a first walk or first day at school again. It's just parenthood concentrated."" Amy and Chad Kempel waited until after their quintuplets were born to throw a baby shower or paint the nursery. The couple had previously lost twins through miscarriage and didn't feel able to prepare in the same way. ""It was devastating, and it was a long road to having the quintuplets,"" Chad says. However, last year they brought home five healthy babies. ""What are we going to do now?"" Amy asked herself. One of the first hurdles was feeding. ""To cut down on the amount of time we spent feeding we decided to feed them all at the same time, all at once,"" Chad says. Using a number of pillows, careful balancing and dexterity, the couple developed a system to bottle feed all five children simultaneously. The quintuplets all sleep in the same room and began sleeping through the night at six months. ""When they get a bit older and can keep each other awake, that might change,"" Amy says. The Kempels have two older daughters, but Amy notes the experience of raising five premature babies simultaneously was ""very different"". ""Initially bonding was very difficult for me,"" Amy says. ""They were in the hospital for a long time, and in incubators. ""Not being able to hold them and take them home was hard."" Chad and Amy say that they had braced themselves for the babies to have ""major health issues or disabilities"". However, after the initial medical intervention, Amy says the first year of the babies' lives has been ""uneventful in a good way"". While being at times ""very challenging"", the couple conclude things are ""going well"".

Can the UK revoke Article 50?,"The Liberal Democrats have pledged to cancel Brexit without holding a further referendum if they win power at the next election. How would that work? Cancelling Brexit would involve revoking something called Article 50. Article 50 is the part of the agreement, known as the Lisbon Treaty, which sets out what happens when a country decides that it wants to leave the European Union (EU). It was triggered by Theresa May on 29 March 2017, starting a two-year countdown to leaving - although this period has now been extended twice. TheEuropean Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling last year,externalconfirmed that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission. This could be done by writing a letter to the European Council, made up of EU heads of state. The ECJ said the UK would then remain a member of the EU on the same terms - as it has now - including keeping its budget rebate (the discount applied to the UK's contributions to the EU budget). But it did set some conditions. The ruling said revocation should be ""unequivocal and unconditional"", suggesting that the UK could not simply revoke Article 50 in order to buy more time and then resubmit it at a later date. A senior lawyer at the ECJ said that ""appropriate legal instruments"" could be used if a member state tried to trigger and revoke Article 50 in order to secure a better withdrawal deal. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The Prime Minister or Parliament? The ECJ didn't give a definitive answer to this. The court ruled that: ""Revocation must be decided following a democratic process in accordance with national constitutional requirements."" The UK government has a power known as the Royal Prerogative, which allows it to do certain things including deploying armed forces, granting honours and altering international treaties without consulting Parliament. So it is possible in theory that a prime minister would be able to revoke Article 50 without giving MPs the chance to vote on it. But there are limits to that power, and those limits have been tested during the course of the Brexit process. When Prime Minister Boris Johnson used the Royal Prerogative to prorogue Parliament for an extended period, the Supreme Court ruled this use of the power unlawful. Its use to activate the two year Article 50 negotiating period was also challenged by Gina Miller at the beginning of 2017. TheSupreme Court ruled in her case,externalthat the government could not trigger the EU exit process without bringing it before Parliament. Because an act of Parliament was required to trigger Article 50, it has been suggested revoking it would also need parliamentary approval. The weight of legal opinion is that a law would have to be passed to allow the government to revoke Article 50, although some lawyers believe a letter from the prime minister would do. That's if a prime minister were to make the decision - but what if Parliament wanted to force their hand? They could potentially do this by taking control of Parliamentary business, as has happened on two occasions in the Brexit process - both times to compel the prime minister to seek an extension and stop a no-deal Brexit. In the same way, if there were a majority to do so, MPs might be able to instruct a prime minister to revoke Article 50.

'A leader with love on full display',"Jacinda Ardern met with victims, and other members of the community, in Christchurch the day after the attack On a calm Friday lunchtime, people gathered for prayers at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. Minutes later, a young man walked up to the door brandishing an assault rifle. Despite having his weapon on aggressively clear display, he was greeted by one of the worshippers - an elderly Afghan man - with the words ""Hello, brother"". Then the gunman opened fire. The pain of the massacre reverberated not just across New Zealand, but also around the world. It seemed to signal that, almost everywhere, something had changed. Andbecause of the ubiquity of social media, people were able to view live footage of a self-proclaimed white supremacist murdering 50 people in a place of worship. Jacinda Ardern calls for a global anti-racism fight Ardern vows never to say the Christchurch gunman's name First victims' funerals held for refugee father and son The main suspect is Australian, and the victims were from a number of different countries including India, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan and Somalia. So when Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern appeared behind a podium to deliver a statement a few hours after the attack, it wasn't just New Zealand who listened to what she had to say. ""It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack."" By so swiftly and decisively describing the shooting as a ""terrorist attack"", Ms Ardern seemed to show an awareness and consideration of the fact that many people feel officials are reluctant to use this word when an attacker is white, even if that attack is politically motivated. Her acknowledgement of the fear and sorrow of the Muslim community didn't end there, either. She hugged the victims in Christchurch, wearing a black headscarf as a simple show of respect; she gave people the unifying cry ""They are us""; and addressing parliament for the first time a few days later, she made a small but bold statement by opening her remarks with the Islamic greeting ""As-Salaam Alaikum"". But she's combined this show of empathy with promises of concrete legislative and cultural change. A few hours after the attack, she announced a clampdown on the country's lax gun laws ""within 10 days"", and speaking to the BBC's Clive Myrie she promised to ""weed out"" racism both in New Zealand and globally. ""We cannot think about this in terms of boundaries,"" she insisted. This video can not be played ""We cannot think about this in terms of boundaries"" From that first address, observers all over the world have been praising her for her leadership. ""Martin Luther King said genuine leaders did not search for consensus but moulded it,"" Suzanne Moore wrote in the British paper The Guardian: ""Ardern has moulded a different consensus, demonstrating action, care, unity,external. Terrorism sees difference and wants to annihilate it. Ardern sees difference and wants to respect it, embrace it and connect with it."" The Washington Post's Ishaan Tharoor wrote that ""Ardern has become the face of her nation's sorrow and grief, and its resolve,external"". Annabel Crabb wrote on the ABC Australia website that ""having been confronted with the worst news a leader can receive...Ms Ardern has yet to put a foot wrong,external"". Grace Back put it simply in Marie Claire Australia: ""This is what a leader looks like,external.""

Mohammad Faisal, from Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said thatMs Ardern ""has won the hearts of Pakistanis"",external, while the King Center - a memorial to Martin Luther King in the US - tweeted that""there's a leader with love on full display in New Zealand"",external. Closer to home, in New Zealand, BBC News correspondent Hywel Griffith says he has ""heard her words - 'we are one, they are us' - spoken back to me by the families of victims here in Christchurch"". EvenJudith Collins, from the opposition National Party, told parliament that the prime minister had been ""outstanding"",external. Ms Ardern delivers a press conference in the week after the attack Colin James, a political analyst in New Zealand, tells BBC News that having spent ""quite a bit of time"" with Ms Arden, he's not surprised by the praise she's now getting. ""She was firm, sombre, positive and in charge,"" he said. ""And this is something I've said often - there's not a nasty cell in her body, but she's not a pushover. It's an unusual combination."" When she first started campaigning in 2017, she was regularly compared to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the French President Emmanuel Macron. It made some sense; all three seemed progressive, ambitious, and young - Ms Ardern was 37 when she took office. There was so much hype around her that it was termed ""Jacindamania,external"", and led some to worry that she would turn out to be all style and no substance. The child, the father, the aspiring footballer 'This mosque was precious to us': A city in shock 'I lost a best friend' While the comparisons have continued, they are only to show how exemplary Ms Ardern has become.Sushil Aaron wrote in the New York Times,externalthat she ""is emerging as the definitive progressive antithesis to the crowded field of right-wing strongmen... whose careers thrive on illiberal, anti-Muslim rhetoric"". One clear example of this is her request of President Donald Trump, who asked her what support the US could provide. ""Sympathy and love for all Muslim communities,"" she replied. Another is her simple description of Australian Senator Fraser Anning's comments blaming the attack on immigration: ""A disgrace."" She has spent the last week comforting members of the Muslim community in New Zealand, including this worshipper at a mosque in Wellington And the images of a sincere Ms Ardern comforting victims the day after the attack have been contrasted with politically similar leaders, too.Al Jazeera journalist Sana Saeed,externalsaid she ""can't recall Trudeau showing this depth of humanity for the victims of the Quebec mosque massacre"" in 2017, adding that former US President Barack Obama didn't visit the victims of the Oak Creek Gurdwara shooting in Wisconsin in 2012 (then-First Lady Michelle Obama went instead). Last year, a widow of a shooting victimeven called Mr Trudeau ""a piece of"" something unpleasant over the phone,external, because he hadn't paid his condolences in person while he was in the city. ""Often people have dismissed her as being attractive and saying the right things,"" Mr James explains. ""But there's much more to her than that - and she's demonstrated that in the last few days to such an extent that far fewer people can hold that view now.""

Cyclone Idai death toll rises sharply,"Rescue workers wear masks as they prepare to offload bodies from a helicopter The official death toll from Cyclone Idai, which tore through southern Africa more than a week ago, rose sharply on Saturday as authorities reported scores more deaths. The number of people declared dead in Mozambique rose from 242 to 417, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said. The new figure puts the overall death toll at about 700 people across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. The toll is expected to rise further. The storm has killed at least 259 people in Zimbabwe, while in Malawi 56 people died when heavy rains hit ahead of the cyclone. But the United Nations said officials will only be able to determine the final casualty figure once the flood waters have receded. Thousands of people are still awaiting rescue from flooded areas across in southern Africa The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Saturday that the Buzi and Zambezi rivers were at risk of breaking their banks again. ""We're going to have to wait until the flood waters recede until we know the full expanse of the toll on the people of Mozambique,"" OCHA co-ordinator Sebastian Rhodes Stampa said. Cyclone Idai: What are the dangers? 'We saw 200 bodies by the roadside' Maps reveal Cyclone Idai's destruction Thousands remain trapped by the floodwaters, and many of the Mozambican government's relief centres have only just started receiving food supplies. Some 1.7 million people are said to be affected across southern Africa, with no electricity or running water in areas where homes have been swept away and roads destroyed by the floods. This video can not be played 'It has become an inland sea' On Friday, cases of cholera were recordedin Beira in central Mozambique. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned of the risk of other outbreaks, already noting an increase in malaria. Cyclone Idai made landfall near Beira, a city of 500,000 people, with 177km/h (106 mph) winds on 14 March. Aid workers are slowly delivering relief, but conditions are said to be extremely difficult, with some areas completely inaccessible and helicopters scarce. In pictures: Cyclone Idai devastation Idai and the climate connection 'My hotel haven for cyclone homeless' Aid groups said Mozambique had borne the brunt of flooding from rivers that flow downstream from neighbouring countries. Nearly 90,000 Mozambicans are thought to be sheltering in temporary sites, while thousands of others are still stranded in floodwaters, AFP news agency reported. ""We are living an unprecedented natural disaster. A disaster that only matches major disasters,"" Mr Correia said. ""Unfortunately, no-one in the region and in the world could predict a disaster of this size.""

Passengers airlifted from Norway cruise,"This video can not be played Footage from on board showed furniture crashing and sliding as the vessel tilted Rescuers have airlifted hundreds of people stranded on a cruise ship off the west coast of Norway. The Viking Sky lost power on Saturday and sent out a distress signal after it began drifting towards land. It got into trouble in a notoriously difficult stretch of waters and was reportedly minutes from striking rocks. The vessel has since restarted three of its four engines and is moving towards the nearest port with the assistance of tugboats. So far, almost 500 of the 1,373 passengers have been airlifted off the ship. Most of those on board are said to be British or US citizens. ""During the night, the sea was very rough. The boat rolled and rolled. And then we went to breakfast. And then we were going for the afternoon film show, and then the lights suddenly went out,"" said Derek Browne, from southern England, who was on board with his wife Esther. ""We were airlifted on the helicopter, which was quite a frightening experience."" Britons tell of 'frightening' rescue Another rescued passenger, Janet Jacob, told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK she had ""never seen anything so frightening"". ""I started to pray. I prayed for the safety of everyone on board,"" she said. ""The helicopter trip was terrifying."" This video can not be played British passenger Derek Browne: 'We were told Mayday Mayday!' The Viking Sky suffered engine failure on Saturday afternoon while en route to Stavanger from Tromso. Five helicopters and several rescue ships were called in for the rescue. One of the rescue ships also lost engine power and a local paper said the ""brutal"" conditions meant lifeboats were forced to turn back. Fisherman Jan Erik Fiskerstrand, whose boat was one of the first to come to help Viking Sky, told Aftenposten newspaper, ""it was just minutes before this could have gone really wrong"". The ship could have hit the rocks ""if they had not started the engine and fastened the anchor"". Olav Magne Stromsholm, who captains tourist vessels in the area, told the VG newspaper the Viking Sky had been ""near disaster"", calling the waters there a ""shipyard cemetery"". Those brought ashore are being taken to a local sports complex and accommodation had been found for them in local hotels. Seventeen people have been taken to hospital. The Viking Sky is a Viking Ocean Cruises ship, which had its maiden voyage in 2017. Are you in the area? If it's safe to share your experiences, then please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Million joined Brexit protest, organisers say","This video can not be played Nine minutes condense into just ninety seconds - aerial footage shows vast crowd of protesters Hundreds of thousands of people have marched in central London calling for another EU referendum, as MPs search for a way out of the Brexit impasse. Organisers of the ""Put It To The People"" campaign say more than a million people joined the march before rallying in front of Parliament. Protesters carrying EU flags and placards called for any Brexit deal be put to another public vote. On Thursday, European leaders agreed to delay the UK's departure from the EU. PM Theresa May is coming under pressure to quit after sayingshe might not put her Brexit deal to a third vote by MPs. Varadkar: 'Brexit will define UK' Brexit's fate in British hands, says Tusk Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Speakers at the rally included Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, former Tory turned independent MP Anna Soubry and former attorney general Dominic Grieve. Crowds were told the initial count showed more than a million people had turned up -putting it on a par with the biggest march of the century, the Stop the War march in 2003. This video can not be played Marchers called for a ""proper vote"" and said they'd been ""sold down the river"" There was no independent verification of the numbers but BBC correspondent Richard Lister, who was at the scene, said it was a ""very densely packed"" protest and people were still arriving in Parliament Square five hours after the march began. He said: ""The organisers say it was one million-strong, it's very hard to verify those kinds of claims but this was a very significant march, well into the hundreds of thousands."" Protesters carried a mixture of homemade and official placards Protesters marched past some of London's most famous landmarks Labour's Tom Watson told the crowd in Parliament Square that Mrs May's deal was a ""lousy"" one - whether you voted Leave or Remain. He said he had this message for her: ""I can only vote for a deal if you let the people vote on it too. Prime Minister, you've lost control of this process, you're plunging the country into chaos, let the people take control."" Ms Sturgeon said now was ""the moment of maximum opportunity""to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Katie Wright, BBC News, in Park Lane The streets around Park Lane were teeming with people hours ahead of the march's scheduled 1pm start, having come from all corners of the country - and some from further beyond. The blue and yellow of the EU was splashed all over the ever-expanding crowd, which was full of groups of families, friends, colleagues and political groups. Many people came draped in flags and carried homemade signs, featuring slogans ranging from playful - ""Never gonna give EU up"" - to political - ""Forget the Ides of March - beware the Brexit of May"". And then there were the plain angry - ""Brexit is treason"". One member of the crowd, German-born vet Chris Reichmann, described it as a ""carnival"" atmosphere - with ""lots of different nationalities"" but ""really British in a way"". And it was noisy, with some of London's most recognisable streets overflowing with people marching steadily to a soundtrack of beating drums, whistles and blaring horns. Occasionally the hordes would erupt into spontaneous cheering, as well as chants of ""What do we want? People's vote. When do we want it? Now!"" Game Of Thrones star Lena Headey, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman and Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys were among the famous names to take to the streets. Sadiq Khanjoined demonstrators at the front of the march,externalas it began, holding up a ""Put it to the People"" banner. He was flanked by Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable,who tweeted,externalthat there was a ""huge turnout of people here from all walks of life"". But veteran Conservative MP John Redwood told the BBC: ""We know that 16 million people wanted to stay in the EU, and some of those would still like to stay in the EU, and within that quite a few would like to have another go and have another referendum - but it was always a minority."" Aerial pictures taken from a helicopter showed the scale of the crowds The prime minister wrote to all MPs on Friday saying she will ditch plans to put the deal to another so-called meaningful vote on her withdrawal deal if not enough MPs support it. Unless her deal is passed by MPs, the UK will have to come up with an alternative plan or else face leaving without a deal on 12 April. Downing Street sources have denied reports inthe Times,externalnewspaper that discussions are under way about a timetable for the prime minister to step down. People gathered at Hyde Park Corner before marching towards Parliament People chanted for a ""People's Vote"" as they marched, accompanied by marching bands, whistles and cheers Meanwhile, a record-breaking online petition on Parliament's website calling for Brexit to be cancelled by revoking Article 50 has attracted more than four million signatures. As the number of signatures on the petition continued to climb, its creator Margaret Georgiadousaid she had ""received three death threats over the phone"", and a ""torrent of abuse"" via her Facebook account. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the petition could ""give oxygen"" to the campaign for another Brexit referendum. Sisters Calypso and Sophie Latham, from London ""I think a second vote might not be an entirely democratic solution because it would put into question every referendum we ever did.  But I wanted to show my anger - that I'm against xenophobic, racist and nationalistic rhetoric that is being spewed everywhere in the news to justify Brexit.""Law graduate Sophie Latham, 22 ""I was too young to vote in the last referendum. It's going to affect my career with research grants so I definitely wanted to come and protest.""Calypso Latham, 19, science student Lin and Rob Worthy from Oxford ""We've had so many opportunities growing up in the EU - freedom of travel, equal pay, sexual equality and so on. Will our kids get the same?""Lin Worthy, self-employed ""This is the first time in my life at the age of 62 that I've come to something to make a statement because I see no future for this country, for my kids or my grandkids. It's just a total mess so I thought I've got to make a stand.""Rob Worthy, 62, self-employed Simon Mead (right) with his 14-year-old daughter Aurore, from Bristol ""My partner is French, my two children are British-French, it has already caused lots of problems, having to apply for different passports has cost us lots of money. We've seen European friends leave Bristol - German and Spanish friends.""Simon Mead ""I really wanted to come because it's a big part of my future and my life.""Aurore Mead, 14 Lee and Richard, from Gloucestershire ""My costume has been deflating since I put it on at 11 this morning - which could be a metaphor for Brexit"".Lee, Gloucestershire ""I didn't get a vote but I moved to this country from Germany 20 years ago as a vet. I think it's a really silly decision. Now we've got a deal, the people should vote and see if that's really the deal the people want. I won't get a vote again but it has a massive implication on my life.Chris Reichmann, Ashford Nigel Farage said the People's Vote march in London were not the majority The march comes as the pro-Brexit March to Leave, which started in Sunderland a week ago, continues towards London. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage re-joined the March to Leave in Linby, near Nottingham, on Saturday morning telling around 200 Brexit supporters that Mrs May had reduced the nation ""to a state of humiliation"". Speaking from the top of an open-top bus, Mr Farage said those gathering for the People's Vote march in London were not the majority, before leading the marchers through the village.

May urged to quit to help deal pass,"This video can not be played Theresa May's de-facto deputy backs her leadership Two ministers touted as a potential caretaker PM in reports of a cabinet coup say they fully back Theresa May. Environment Secretary Michael Gove told reporters it was ""not the time to change the captain of the ship"". And the PM's de facto deputy David Lidington insisted he was ""100% behind"" Mrs May. Meanwhile, the Brexit secretary said an election will become more likely if MPs vote this week for a Brexit option the government does not want. MPs are expected to get the chance to hold a series ofso-called indicative voteson possible alternatives to Mrs May's withdrawal deal, but Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said they would ""not be binding"". He was among the Tory MPs and ministers at talks with Mrs May on Sunday at Chequers, her country retreat. Prominent Brexiteers Mr Gove, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg were also present. They discussed a range of issues, including whether there was sufficient support to hold a third vote on the prime minister's deal this week, a Downing Street spokesman said. Newspapers claim cabinet ministers are plotting a coup against the prime minister, aiming to replace her with a caretaker leader until a proper leadership contest is held later in the year. The suggestion is that Tory MPs might reluctantly back Mrs May's Brexit deal if they know she will not be in charge of the next stage of negotiations with the EU, but there are differing accounts of who the preferred candidate to replace her is. The Sunday Times reports that Mr Lidington,external, who voted Remain, is being lined up, whilethe Mail on Sunday said the Brexiteer Environment Secretary Mr Gove,externalwas the ""consensus choice"". The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg says there is ""serious manoeuvring"" going on. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The prime minister has come under growing pressure to quit following a week in whichshe was forced to ask the EU for an extension to Article 50, andcriticised for blaming the delay to Brexit on MPs. The withdrawal deal she has negotiated with the EU has been overwhelmingly rejected in the Commons twice, and it remains unclear whether she will bring it back a third time next week aftershe wrote to MPssaying she would only do so if there was ""sufficient support"". One senior backbencher told the BBC's Iain Watson that even standing aside would not be enough for her deal to be voted through, and that Mrs May might as well ""dig in"". Varadkar will 'work with whoever is PM' Million joined Brexit protest, organisers say Ministers 'divided' on Brexit votes process Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Mr Gove said he was focused on getting the maximum amount of support for the prime minister and her Brexit deal. And Mr Lidington insisted Mrs May was ""doing a fantastic job"" and he had no desire to take over from her. Chancellor Philip Hammond told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday ""changing prime ministers wouldn't help, changing the party of government wouldn't help."" He denied reports he was hoping to parachute in Mr Lidington as caretaker, adding: ""To be talking about changing the players on the board, frankly, is self-indulgent at this time."" Mr Hammond said he understood MPs were ""very frustrated"", but ""one way or another Parliament is going to have an opportunity this week to decide what it's in favour of"". Former Conservative leader and prominent Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC's Andrew Marr the disloyalty some cabinet ministers were showing to her was ""appalling"". They should be censured, sacked, or at the very least ""they should be apologising and they should shut up,"" he added. MP for Aylesbury since 1992 and now Cabinet Office Minister, David Lidington, below left, is the prime minister's right-hand man and behind-the-scenes fixer. Once private secretary to William Hague when he was Tory leader, Mr Lidington was the longest-serving Minister for Europe under David Cameron and is clearly from the Remain camp. That makes him an unacceptable replacement for Theresa May in the eyes of Brexiteers. Lidington is well-liked among fellow MPs and has an easy way with journalists, but he has attracted criticism from some quarters for his voting record, especially on LGBTQ rights. He voted against same sex marriage and to maintain a ban on the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Former journalist turned MP for Surrey Heath, Michael Gove, above right, is currently environment secretary. He's previously held the justice and education briefs. He and Boris Johnson helped lead Vote Leave to victory in the EU referendum, but Gove later ran against his former Brexit ally for the Tory leadership. He was subsequently sacked as a minister by Theresa May when she eventually won that contest. Now having worked his way back into the senior echelons of government, Mr Gove is seen as someone who could hold the Conservative Party together, and might be a candidate Remainers could stomach because he's hinted he could be open to a softer form of Brexit. Arch Brexiteers feel, though, that for that very reason he'd be an unacceptable choice. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith calls ministerial disloyalty ""appalling"" The leadership row comes ahead of a week where the PM is expected to lose further control over the Brexit process. In the coming days, as many as six other options, in addition to Mrs May's deal, could be put to indicative votes in order to see which are most popular. They are: Revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit Another referendum The PM's deal plus a customs union The PM's deal plus both a customs union and single market access A Canada-style free trade agreement Leaving the EU without a deal Mr Hammond said he would remove revoking Article 50 and a no-deal Brexit from the list, as ""both of those would have very serious and negative consequences for our country"". On the subject of a second referendum, he said: ""It is a coherent proposition and deserves to be considered, along with the other proposals."" But Mr Barclay said there was a ""crisis"" because ""Parliament is trying to take over the government"". He said if MPs vote for a Brexit outcome at odds with the Tory manifesto - for example, in favour of maintaining single market membership - ""the risk of a general election increases, because you potentially have a situation where Parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do"". Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the indicative votes must be a ""serious exercise"". He said Labour would go into the process ""in good faith"" but there needed to be ""assurance that the prime minister isn't going to use it just to frustrate the process"". Labour chairman of the Brexit scrutiny committee Hilary Benn told Sky News MPs were just doing their job by attempting to take control of the process. Monday:MPs will debate the Brexit next steps and a number of amendments - possible alternatives - to the government plan will be put to a vote. One that could well succeed calls for a series of ""indicative votes"" in the Commons, run by Parliament, to see if a majority can be found for a different Brexit model. Tuesday:Theresa May could bring her withdrawal deal back for the so-called third meaningful vote. But the government says it won't do that unless it's sure it has enough to support to win. Wednesday:This is when indicative votes would be held - we don't know yet whether MPs will be free to vote how they want or be directed along party lines. The chances of any genuine cross-party consensus being achieved are not high. Thursday:A second possible opportunity for meaningful vote three. The prime minister may hope that Brexiteers will finally decide to throw their weight behind her deal because indicative votes have shown that otherwise the UK could be heading for the sort of softer Brexit they would hate. Friday:This is written into law as the day the UK leaves the EU, although the PM has said she will pass legislation this week to remove it. The earliest Brexit is likely to happen is now 12 April.
