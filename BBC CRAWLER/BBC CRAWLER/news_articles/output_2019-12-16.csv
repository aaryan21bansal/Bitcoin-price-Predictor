Church group 'financially exploited members',"This video can not be played Conned by My Church: Young worshippers left in debt An evangelical church praised for helping ex-gang members has been accused of financially exploiting young people from its congregation. One member of charity SPAC Nation said she was persuaded to commit benefit fraud by a trustee, while another said she had a Â£5,000 loan taken out in her name without her knowledge. A former senior insider told the BBC that the church ""has to be shut down"". SPAC Nation denies the church is financially exploiting young people. The church's leader, Pastor Tobi Adegboyega, ignored BBC Panorama's request for an interview Kurtis, 23, was one of the church's trusted inner circle until his departure in January this year. He appears in a BBC Panorama investigation into SPAC Nation, which is accused of leaving young people with debts of thousands of pounds. ""Certain leaders shouldn't be around youth, they shouldn't be around anywhere where people are vulnerable,"" he said. The church's leader Pastor Tobi Adegboyega ""has to be held accountable"", Kurtis added. Kurtis was one of the church's inner circle until his departure in January Gracy was 21 when she joined SPAC in 2017. She told Panorama she was encouraged to apply for Universal Credit after her Pastor Ebo Dougan - who is also a trustee of the charity - noticed she had stopped giving money to the church. She handed over her details to Pastor Dougan and someone filled out an online application form on her behalf. She then attended a meeting at the job centre. The BBC has seen messages and documentation that confirm her version of events. Gracy's online application shows that after she left the appointment someone changed her details to show that she had two children. This made her eligible for a Â£1,200 payment. ""Even sometimes when we know things are wrong, in that moment I'm just thinking like 'OK, my father figure would not tell me to do something bad',"" she said. Gracy was told to pay Â£900 of the sum into two accounts. She kept the rest, but was later investigated by the Department for Work and Pensions, who fined her Â£600 and ordered her to repay the Â£1,200. ""I can't afford it obviously,"" she said. ""I feel heartbroken because I thought this was supposed to be a family."" Gracy said she was encouraged to apply for Universal Credit Lovis was 18 when a loan was taken out in her name and without her knowledge, she said. She was diagnosed with kidney cancer in November 2017. The illness left her unable to continue working as an assistant sous chef and she began looking for a job with less demanding hours. She was invited to an interview at a firm called Zuriel Recruitment. The agency was run by Tobi Adegboyega's second in command Samuel Akokhia, who has a conviction for attempted robbery. At the interview Lovis provided Zuriel Recruitment with personal details including a photocopy of her passport, her home address, her mobile number and bank account details. At the end of the process, her interviewer - a pastor at SPAC Nation - encouraged her to attend a service that week. ""It was a bit weird,"" she said. ""But at the end of the day it's church - so I didn't really think much of it."" Lovis started going to SPAC Nation services and several months later moved into a safe house - known as a ""TRAP house"" - run by Pastor Samuel Akokhia. In March Lovis discovered a Â£5,000 four-year loan had been taken out in her name without her knowledge. The money never reached her, instead being transferred to a company called E. R. Management Group. That company is run and owned by Emmanuel Akokhia, Samuel's brother. BBC Panorama has seen paperwork confirming the money trail. It is not known what happened to the money after it arrived in E. R. Management Group's account. Lovis confronted a senior pastor about the loan. ""They basically said the loan was for the greater good and they were going to use the money to buy a bigger TRAP house to accommodate more people,"" she said. ""And I was thinking 'that's all well and good - but why did I not know about it?'"" This video can not be played SPAC Nation has been praised for helping people to leave gangs On Friday the charities regulator revealed it had opened its own investigation into SPAC Nation's safeguarding and finances. The Charity Commission also ordered SPAC Nation to ""bank its money"". The Metropolitan Police is reviewing allegations of possible fraud and other offences before deciding whether to investigate further. SPAC Nation denies that the church's lead pastor Tobi Adegboyega is financially exploiting young people. It said the church had a ""robust complaints procedure"" and ""a well run disciplinary system"". SPAC Nation told the BBC that the church ""is not responsible what goes on inside individual leaders' or members' houses"". Tobi Adegboyega ignored BBC Panorama's request for an interview.

Trapped boy 'lucky to be alive' after roof fallFirefighters smashed through a wall to rescue the boy who was trapped between two buildings.Tees,"Firefighters smashed through this wall to rescue the boy A teenage boy is ""unbelievably lucky"" to be alive after he fell 30ft from a shopping centre roof and got trapped in a cavity between two buildings. Firefighters smashed through the wall of a shop at the Thames Centre in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, to free the 13-year-old at about 19:30 GMT. He had become trapped in the 1.6ft-wide cavity three hours earlier. The boy, who sustained a broken ankle, has been taken to Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital. Incident commander Rob Cherrie, of County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue, said the boy had been on the phone to his mother at the time of the fall. He added: ""We used cutters, grinders and hammers. Essentially you had the cladding then the plasterboard through to the breezeblocks and external bricks. ""We managed to get some oxygen down to him and reassure him. By the time we got to him he was very cold and very tired.""

Boeing to halt 737 Max production in JanuaryManufacturer says it will stop production of troubled jet involved in two deadly crashes.Business,"Boeing will temporarily halt production of its troubled 737 Max airliner in January, the manufacturer said. Production of the jet had continued despite the model being grounded for nine months after two deadly crashes. More than 300 people died when two 737 Max aircraft crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia after reported problems with a new feature. Boeing had been hoping to have the planes back in the air by the end of this year. But US regulators made it clear that they would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. Boeing is one of the largest US exporters. The company said in a statement that it would not lay off workers associated with the 737 Max, but the stoppage is likely to affect suppliers and the wider economy. What went wrong in Boeing's cockpit? US regulator knew of Boeing 737 crash risks 'I lost all my children in the Boeing plane crash' ""Safely returning the 737 Max to service is our top priority,"" the aircraft manufacturer said. ""We know that the process of approving the 737 Max's return to service, and of determining appropriate training requirements, must be extraordinarily thorough and robust, to ensure that our regulators, customers, and the flying public have confidence in the 737 Max updates."" Last week a congressional hearing was told that US aviation regulators were aware, following the first crash in Indonesia in October 2018, that there was a risk of further accidents. The Federal Aviation Authority's analysis suggested there could be more than a dozen more crashes over the lifetime of the aircraft unless changes were made to its design. This video can not be played Boeing 737 crashes: What went wrong? Despite that, the 737 Max was not grounded until after the second crash in Ethiopia in March 2019. Boeing is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes. The manufacturer said it had 400 of the 737 Max aircraft in storage and would focus on delivering those to customers. While many airlines around the world have the planes on order, delivery was halted to allow Boeing's engineers to develop software fixes. The situation surrounding the 737 Max is extraordinary. Nine months after the aircraft was grounded worldwide, it is still not clear when it will be certified to fly again. Regulators - criticised for allowing a flawed aircraft to fly in the first place - are now playing hardball. For Boeing, being forced to shut down the production line is deeply embarrassing - and likely to prove costly. But it is a huge business, and it can at least redeploy many of its workers. But if the stoppage goes on for long, suppliers could be badly hit. Boeing sits at the top of a global supply chain, ranging from major businesses to small operators. Here in the UK, for example, the company works across 65 sites, including a factory in Sheffield. But it draws on a network of some 300 suppliers. For smaller firms in particular, losing 737-related work could prove serious - hitting revenues and potentially forcing them to lay off workers as well. Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said the decision to suspend production was unprecedented and likely to have a ""massive impact on Boeing, its suppliers and the airlines"". ""It's really going to create some chaos for the airlines that are involved in this as well as the 600 or so companies that are part of the 737 Max supply chain and Boeing itself."" The suspension of the 737 Max has already cost Boeing around $9bn (Â£6.75bn). Boeing shares fell more than 4% on Monday amid speculation production would be suspended. All Boeing 737 Max planes are currently grounded The production freeze is expected to be felt across the plane's global supply chain. Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia described Boeing's options for managing the blow to its suppliers as ""bad and worse"". He said the plane maker could either allow them to take a hit, or pay them to wait for when the 737 Max is finally cleared to fly. US carriers operate the largest 737 Max fleets, though airlines around the world also use it. ""The Chinese carriers would [also] be quite badly affected. They're some of the biggest users of the Max,"" said Shukor Yusof, aviation analyst at Endau Analytics. In fact, China's three largest carrierswere among the first to press Boeing for compensationover the grounded planes. Aviation analyst Chris Tarrytold the Today programme:""The last thing any manufacturer wants is to stop the production line and it's going to take time to get it going again when the aircraft takes to the skies. ""If we look at it in terms of the volume of the impact on capacity growth in the industry, it is significant and it will take time to recover the production. Boeing's reputation will take time to recover from this as well."" US regulator knew of Boeing 737 crash risks Can China's plane maker take on Boeing? Some suppliers, such as fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet, with half of its revenue attached to it, according to Mr Aboulafia. So far, the supplier has only said it is ""working closely"" with Boeing to determine what impact the production suspension may have. The move by Boeing is unlikely to affect passengers as airlines have leased additional aircraft to replace the 737 Max. It's a different story for airlines, who have the added expense of leasing planes and managing their grounded aircraft. In July,Boeing set aside nearly $5bnto compensate those affected. However, that figure assumed that the 737 Max would fly again this year.

Pre-Christmas shopping discounts 'could hit 50%',"Sales discounts on clothing and products in the lead up to Christmas could be the biggest in almost ten years, according to one consultancy. Deloitte, which has monitored the prices of 800,000 products online and in shops since 2011, expects average discounts to hit 50% by Christmas Eve. Its forecast came as data provider Springboard said shopper numbers were lower than the same time last year. The firm said shoppers were waiting for deeper discounts before buying. ""Consumers clearly took advantage of early discounts to purchase Christmas presents, and are now waiting for discounts to deepen once again in the days immediately before Christmas as retailers do their best to shift unsold stock,"" said Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard. Black Friday brings UK retailers 'welcome' boost 'We will sit in Black Friday shopper queue for you' Deloitte said current discounts ranged from 8% to 78% with the biggest discounts on clothing, but said the coming weekend - the last before Christmas - could see ""a tipping point in promotions"". The consultancy said the price cuts had been driven by UK shops discounting earlier in the season due to Black Friday -  the day after the American holiday of Thanksgiving, when retailers drop their prices for 24 hours. The tradition has increasingly been adopted by UK retailers too. Deloitte said this had created a long run-up for pre-Christmas discounting, with prices falling steadily in the lead up to Christmas Day. ""Consumers have come to expect an increasing amount of pre-Christmas discounting. The result is a blending of promotions, one seeping into the next, and a steady price decline rather than a steep Boxing Day drop, reminiscent of Christmases past,"" said Jason Gordon, consumer analytics partner at Deloitte. Post Christmas, Deloitte is expecting deeper discounts, with average reductions of up to 54% on Boxing Day. Retail expert Natalie Berg said the current retail environment is worrying: ""This is the most important time of the year for retailers, and this is a sign of distress."" She added that retailers have become worried and started discounting earlier due to consumers buying less, and once a few big brands start discounting, it is difficult for the rest of the High Street not to join in. ""It's a combination of pent-up demand and the late timing of Black Friday being on 29 November, not 23 November,"" she told the BBC. ""Generally, there's been a lot of political and economic uncertainty this year so consumers have been quite cautious about spending. That pent-up demand has been released at Christmas, when you spend, but consumers have cottoned on to the fact that there will be pre-Christmas discounts now."" But consumers might not even have to wait for the Boxing Day sales. Deloitte predicts that many Boxing Day discounts could go live online on Christmas Day itself, and on Christmas Eve in bricks and mortar shops. ""The operational challenges that sales present in-store mean some retailers could be offering Boxing Day sale prices on Christmas Eve, for those willing to hit the shops early,"" says Mr Gordon.

Tech firms sued over DR Congo cobalt mining deaths,"Artisanal mining is common in DR Congo as people do it as a means to make a living Apple, Google, Tesla and Microsoft are among firms named in a lawsuit seeking damages over deaths and injuries of child miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The case has been filed by the International Rights Advocates on behalf of 14 Congolese families. They accuse the companies of knowing that cobalt used in their products could be linked to child labour. DR Congo produces 60% of the world's supply of cobalt. The mineral is used to produce lithium-ion batteries used to power electric cars, laptops and smartphones. However, the extraction process has been beset with concerns of illegal mining, human rights abuses and corruption. Congo student: 'I skip meals to buy online data' The precious metal sparking a new gold rush Could you cope with smartphone rationing? The lawsuit filed in the US argues that the tech companies had ""specific knowledge"" that the cobalt sourced for their products could be linked to child labour. They say the companies failed to regulate their supply chains and instead profited from exploitation. DR Congo produces more than 60% of the world's cobalt Other companies listed in the lawsuit are computer manufacturer Dell and two mining companies, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt and Glencore, who own the minefields where the Congolese families allege their children worked. Device makers face child labour claims DR Congo: Cursed by its natural wealth Glencore said in a statement,externalto the UK's Telegraph newspaper that it ""does not purchase, process or trade any artisanally mined ore"" adding that it also ""does not tolerate any form of child, forced, or compulsory labour."" The BBC has sought comment from Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. This video can not be played Why are people in mineral-rich DR Congo among the world's poorest? The court papers,external, seen by the UK's Guardian newspaper, give several examples of child miners buried alive or suffering from injuries after tunnel collapse. The 14 Congolese families want the companies to compensate them for forced labour, emotional distress and negligent supervision. In a response to the Telegraph, Microsoft said it was committed to responsible sourcing of minerals and that it investigates any violations by its suppliers and takes action. A spokesperson for Google told the BBC that the company was ""committed to sourcing all materials ethically and eliminating child mining in global supply chains"". An Apple spokesperson said the company was ""deeply committed to the responsible sourcing of materials"" and ""if a refiner is unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they will be removed from our supply chain. We've removed six cobalt refiners in 2019"". The BBC has also sought comment from Tesla.

Trapped boy 'lucky to be alive' after roof fall,"Firefighters smashed through this wall to rescue the boy A teenage boy is ""unbelievably lucky"" to be alive after he fell 30ft from a shopping centre roof and got trapped in a cavity between two buildings. Firefighters smashed through the wall of a shop at the Thames Centre in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, to free the 13-year-old at about 19:30 GMT. He had become trapped in the 1.6ft-wide cavity three hours earlier. The boy, who sustained a broken ankle, has been taken to Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital. Incident commander Rob Cherrie, of County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue, said the boy had been on the phone to his mother at the time of the fall. He added: ""We used cutters, grinders and hammers. Essentially you had the cladding then the plasterboard through to the breezeblocks and external bricks.

"Church group 'financially exploited members'A former insider tells BBC Panorama that charity SPAC Nation ""has to be shut down"".London","This video can not be played Conned by My Church: Young worshippers left in debt An evangelical church praised for helping ex-gang members has been accused of financially exploiting young people from its congregation. One member of charity SPAC Nation said she was persuaded to commit benefit fraud by a trustee, while another said she had a Â£5,000 loan taken out in her name without her knowledge. A former senior insider told the BBC that the church ""has to be shut down"". SPAC Nation denies the church is financially exploiting young people. The church's leader, Pastor Tobi Adegboyega, ignored BBC Panorama's request for an interview Kurtis, 23, was one of the church's trusted inner circle until his departure in January this year. He appears in a BBC Panorama investigation into SPAC Nation, which is accused of leaving young people with debts of thousands of pounds. ""Certain leaders shouldn't be around youth, they shouldn't be around anywhere where people are vulnerable,"" he said. The church's leader Pastor Tobi Adegboyega ""has to be held accountable"", Kurtis added. Kurtis was one of the church's inner circle until his departure in January Gracy was 21 when she joined SPAC in 2017. She told Panorama she was encouraged to apply for Universal Credit after her Pastor Ebo Dougan - who is also a trustee of the charity - noticed she had stopped giving money to the church. She handed over her details to Pastor Dougan and someone filled out an online application form on her behalf. She then attended a meeting at the job centre. The BBC has seen messages and documentation that confirm her version of events. Gracy's online application shows that after she left the appointment someone changed her details to show that she had two children. This made her eligible for a Â£1,200 payment. ""Even sometimes when we know things are wrong, in that moment I'm just thinking like 'OK, my father figure would not tell me to do something bad',"" she said. Gracy was told to pay Â£900 of the sum into two accounts. She kept the rest, but was later investigated by the Department for Work and Pensions, who fined her Â£600 and ordered her to repay the Â£1,200. ""I can't afford it obviously,"" she said. ""I feel heartbroken because I thought this was supposed to be a family."" Gracy said she was encouraged to apply for Universal Credit Lovis was 18 when a loan was taken out in her name and without her knowledge, she said. She was diagnosed with kidney cancer in November 2017. The illness left her unable to continue working as an assistant sous chef and she began looking for a job with less demanding hours. She was invited to an interview at a firm called Zuriel Recruitment. The agency was run by Tobi Adegboyega's second in command Samuel Akokhia, who has a conviction for attempted robbery. At the interview Lovis provided Zuriel Recruitment with personal details including a photocopy of her passport, her home address, her mobile number and bank account details. At the end of the process, her interviewer - a pastor at SPAC Nation - encouraged her to attend a service that week. ""It was a bit weird,"" she said. ""But at the end of the day it's church - so I didn't really think much of it."" Lovis started going to SPAC Nation services and several months later moved into a safe house - known as a ""TRAP house"" - run by Pastor Samuel Akokhia. In March Lovis discovered a Â£5,000 four-year loan had been taken out in her name without her knowledge. The money never reached her, instead being transferred to a company called E. R. Management Group. That company is run and owned by Emmanuel Akokhia, Samuel's brother. BBC Panorama has seen paperwork confirming the money trail. It is not known what happened to the money after it arrived in E. R. Management Group's account. Lovis confronted a senior pastor about the loan. ""They basically said the loan was for the greater good and they were going to use the money to buy a bigger TRAP house to accommodate more people,"" she said. ""And I was thinking 'that's all well and good - but why did I not know about it?'"" This video can not be played SPAC Nation has been praised for helping people to leave gangs On Friday the charities regulator revealed it had opened its own investigation into SPAC Nation's safeguarding and finances. The Charity Commission also ordered SPAC Nation to ""bank its money"". The Metropolitan Police is reviewing allegations of possible fraud and other offences before deciding whether to investigate further. SPAC Nation denies that the church's lead pastor Tobi Adegboyega is financially exploiting young people. It said the church had a ""robust complaints procedure"" and ""a well run disciplinary system"". SPAC Nation told the BBC that the church ""is not responsible what goes on inside individual leaders' or members' houses"". Tobi Adegboyega ignored BBC Panorama's request for an interview.

"Welsh Government cash boost in budgetEvery department from health to housing, transport and education will see funding go up from April.WalesComments","Every Welsh Government department will see an increase in funding from next April. It is the first time in a decade that has happened, and followsthe announcement of Â£600m extra from the UK government earlier this year. But finance minister Rebecca Evans said funding remains below 2010 levels. As part of the plans the Welsh NHS will receive around Â£340m extra from April, while council funding will rise by 4.3%. The latter is the first significant increase in council funding for 12 years, according to the Welsh Local Government Association. Ministers in Cardiff have revealed their Â£20bn draft budget for the next financial year, 2020-21. It includes what is described as ""significant funding"" for low carbon transport and housing in the first Welsh Budget since it declared a climate emergency earlier this year. There will be Â£4.5m for a National Forest, planned to extend the full length of the country, and Â£25m of capital funding to develop near-zero carbon homes. There will also be Â£30m for electric buses and refuse vehicles. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said: ""This draft budget delivers on our promises to the people of Wales and invests for the future of our planet."" Expenditure in the main areas from the Welsh Government budget over the last four years Annual spending on services funded by the health and social services department will increase from Â£8bn to Â£8.366bn by April next year. Local councils are being given Â£4.474bn to spend on day-to-day services - including schools and social care - an above-inflation increase of 4.3%. Individual increases in central funding range from 3% for Monmouthshire to 5.4% for Newport, to which local authorities will add their own revenue from council tax, charges for services and other income. Local government is under pressure because of rising wage and pension bills. Most of the political representatives in the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said the council settlement was positive. Rhondda Cynon Taf leader Andrew Morgan, who has just taken over as WLGA leader as well, said: ""I welcome this exceptionally good finance settlement. ""I am pleased that our positive engagement with the Welsh Government has paid dividends for our services, for our workforce, and for our residents."" However Peter Fox, the Conservative leader of Monmouthshire County Council, said it was disappointing. ""The UK Government gave sufficient resource to the Welsh Government to do significantly better than this and they have failed local government in Wales again,"" he said. Mr Fox called the difference between his council's 3% rise and the 5.4% for Newport ""ridiculous"". Cash for education - which includes higher and further education but excludes most school spending - will rise by 3.7% to Â£1.56bn. Total spending on environment, energy and rural affairs rises by 2.5% to Â£216m. However the main pot of cash for running Natural Resources Wales - the country's environmental regulator and Wales' biggest quango - is staying about the same at Â£69m. Money for the Welsh Government's central administration is rising by 8.3% to Â£357m - mostly accounted for by more money on Brexit staff. Much of the reason the Welsh Government has had more money to give to its main departments is thanks to Chancellor Sajid Javid announcing in September that he was increasing public spending. Wales' share of that amounted to a very welcome Â£600m. On one hand, the Welsh Government is pleased to have it, but at the same time it argues that had the spending kept up with inflation during the past 10 years it would have had an extra Â£300m to spend. Health spending continues to take up about half of overall Welsh Government spending. The finance minister described the 4% increase as inflation busting. That it may be, but it is generally recognised the NHS doesn't just have to cope with price rises, but also increasing pressure on its services from an aging population and more people living with long-term conditions such as diabetes. The budget reflects a growing emphasis on us all living healthier lives - encouraging walking and cycling and eating more healthily. In other words, the government is using its money to try to encourage behaviour change rather than just trying to treat problems when they occur. The harsh reality that climate change is affecting many different aspects of our life is reflected in the budget with money for a wide variety of measures - from a national forest, initiatives to improve air and water quality and measures to protect communities against flooding. Campaigners in both health and the environment are likely to argue that these measures are not enough to cope with growing pressures. The Welsh Government's Welsh Language budget remains static at Â£20.9m. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg - the Welsh Language Society - said it amounted to a real terms cut. Tamsin Davies from Cymdeithas yr Iaith said: ""Such cuts cannot be justified. The Welsh Government has more than one billion extra pounds for next year so, at the very least, we would expect them to increase Welsh language budgets in line with inflation."" Capital spending on infrastructure and other major projects will rise from Â£1.7bn to Â£2.3bn between 2019 and next April. This includes Â£785m for the economy and transport, which the Welsh Government says has risen by 29%, and Â£735m for housing and local government - up by 38%. The latter includes an extra Â£35m on social housing grants. Ms Evans said that ""despite a decade of austerity, we have consistently prioritised our NHS"". ""Even though our like-for-like funding remains below 2010 levels, this Budget strives for a greener, equal and prosperous Wales."" Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Nick Ramsay said the budget was a ""missed opportunity"". He said: ""Welsh Conservatives welcome the considerable sums of money now coming to Wales as a result of the spending decisions of the UK Government. ""We now need a budget that delivers a dynamic, forward-thinking, and agile Wales but this budget falls sadly short."" Plaid Cymru said the budget ""delivers only in its lack of ambition"" and claimed councils were still not getting the funding they needed. Economy spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Twenty years of Labour rule in Wales has shown us that more money for our NHS doesn't in itself mean better services. ""What we need to see from this Labour government is a strategic plan on how this extra funding will be spent on preventative measures instead of the continued mismanagement of our NHS and health boards that are still in special measures.""

The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, waves as his party colleagues gather behind him outside Parliament The SNP made strong gains in the election last week, gaining 13 seats to give them 48 out of Scotland's 59 MPs Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Boris Johnson is promising to do all sorts of trade deals
after Brexit, including one with the United States. But most pressing of all is
sorting out a new relationship with the European Union, by far the UKâs largest
trading partner. The prime minister has promised to do that by the end of
next year, which is a very ambitious timetable for negotiating and ratifying a
trade agreement of such size and complexity. The negotiations will take place
during the post-Brexit transition period, when the UK will remain in the EUâs
customs union and single market. And Mr Johnson has guaranteed that the
transition will not be extended beyond December 2020 â hence the tight
deadlines. Expect to hear a lot about a basic ""zero tariffs zero
quotas"" trade deal, which could in theory be done quite quickly, as long as the prime minister agreed to the EUâs terms -  to align with rules made in
Brussels on social and environmental policy and on things like state aid for
business. If Mr Johnson wants to diverge from those rules, as he insists, an
agreement becomes more difficult. And even if such a deal were to be done, it would cover only
goods and not services, which form a larger part of the UK economy. It would
also not provide the completely frictionless trade that many companies that do
business with Europe rely on at the moment. So when the prime minister comes to focus on the detail of
his trade policy, he has some big choices to make. He may find he canât have
his cake and eat it. In an unexpected turn for a political live page, football legend Brian Clough is trending on Twitter... because a lot of people think he looks strikingly similar to the newly appointed Welsh Secretary Simon Hart. Clough, who died in 2004, managed Hartlepool, Derby, Brighton, Leeds and Nottingham Forest. He also won the league cup four times. Allow Twitter content?

109 new Tory MPs ""from every part of the United Kingdom"" in
Westminster Hall, he thanked them for their ""incredible achievement""
in changing the political map of the country. He pledged to deliver for all people and change the country for the better, telling his new colleagues: ""We must repay the trust of the electorate, that's what we're going

new Welsh Secretary, Simon Hart, has said it's great to have the opportunity to
serve in cabinet. Speaking
as he left the Cabinet Office this evening, he said: ""It's
great to have this opportunity. I've
got my orders and I'm going to try and do it as best I can."" Nicky Morgan's reappointment to her cabinet position comes despite her decision to stand down as an MP. She will instead become a peer, as convention dictates that government ministers must be a member of one of the Houses of Parliament. Ms Morgan resigned as an MP when the election was called, citing the abuse she faced and the ""clear impact"" her role had on her family. As a Remain supporter, there had been speculation she disagreed with Boris Johnson's Brexit stance, but she told BBC Radio Leicester she wanted to make clear she was not standing down ""for any reasons of disagreement with the prime minister or the direction of the government at all"". She continued to campaign for her party throughout the campaign. Ms Morgan was first made Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport when Mr Johnson became prime minister in July. Read more about today's minor cabinet reshuffle. Simon Hart, the new Welsh Secretary, succeeds Alun Cairns, who resigned at the start of the campaign amid arow over what he knew about an aide's role in the collapse of a rape trial. The Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP is being promoted from a junior ministerial post in the Cabinet Office. Mr Hart came to Parliament with a background in rural affairs as chief executive of the Countryside Alliance and a former master of the South Pembrokeshire Hunt. A chartered surveyor by profession, he served on the backbenches until July when Boris Johnson took power and appointed him as a junior minister at the Cabinet Office. Read more from BBC Wales. Nicky Morgan has been confirmed as Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. She will be made a Tory peer. The British and Irish governments will work ânight and dayâ
over the next few weeks to restore devolution, Tanaiste Simon Coveney has
said. The Irish deputy prime minister was speakingafter a meeting with Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith at Stormont. Fresh efforts are being made to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly, with
the five main parties engaged in new talks. The Northern Ireland Assembly has been inactive since January 2017,when its two biggest parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, split in a bitter row. Mr Coveney said there would be âintensiveâ discussions
between the five parties over the course of this week. He will hold his own meetings with them on
Monday night and Tuesday, ahead of a roundtable discussion scheduled for Wednesday. He said the two governments did not âwant to bounceâ the
parties into an agreement â but said they had been discussing the same issues
for many months now. âThis is not about trying to force the parties into a space
they donât want to move into,â he added. âBut weâve had a reality check with the nursesâ strike, and
I think itâs a reminder to everyone that now is the time to get this done.â Nurses in Northern Ireland have beenstriking for their pay to be bought into line with that of their colleagues in the rest of the UK. And here it is. Conservative MP Simon Hart is the new Secretary of State for
Wales. The post was left vacant after the resignation of Alun Cairns at the start of the election campaign. Mr Hart tried to rubbish rumours of his imminent appointment earlier, but it turns out they were true. BBC Wales Parliamentary correspondent tweets...

the chief whip. Leaving Downing St this evening, MP Mark Francois said: ""We were talking about some of the arrangements for later in

"Tech firms sued over DR Congo cobalt mining deathsA lawsuit accuses Apple, Google, Tesla, Microsoft and others of using cobalt mined by child labour.Africa","Artisanal mining is common in DR Congo as people do it as a means to make a living Apple, Google, Tesla and Microsoft are among firms named in a lawsuit seeking damages over deaths and injuries of child miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The case has been filed by the International Rights Advocates on behalf of 14 Congolese families. They accuse the companies of knowing that cobalt used in their products could be linked to child labour. DR Congo produces 60% of the world's supply of cobalt. The mineral is used to produce lithium-ion batteries used to power electric cars, laptops and smartphones. However, the extraction process has been beset with concerns of illegal mining, human rights abuses and corruption. Congo student: 'I skip meals to buy online data' The precious metal sparking a new gold rush Could you cope with smartphone rationing? The lawsuit filed in the US argues that the tech companies had ""specific knowledge"" that the cobalt sourced for their products could be linked to child labour. They say the companies failed to regulate their supply chains and instead profited from exploitation. DR Congo produces more than 60% of the world's cobalt Other companies listed in the lawsuit are computer manufacturer Dell and two mining companies, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt and Glencore, who own the minefields where the Congolese families allege their children worked. Device makers face child labour claims DR Congo: Cursed by its natural wealth Glencore said in a statement,externalto the UK's Telegraph newspaper that it ""does not purchase, process or trade any artisanally mined ore"" adding that it also ""does not tolerate any form of child, forced, or compulsory labour."" The BBC has sought comment from Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. This video can not be played Why are people in mineral-rich DR Congo among the world's poorest? The court papers,external, seen by the UK's Guardian newspaper, give several examples of child miners buried alive or suffering from injuries after tunnel collapse. The 14 Congolese families want the companies to compensate them for forced labour, emotional distress and negligent supervision. In a response to the Telegraph, Microsoft said it was committed to responsible sourcing of minerals and that it investigates any violations by its suppliers and takes action. A spokesperson for Google told the BBC that the company was ""committed to sourcing all materials ethically and eliminating child mining in global supply chains"". An Apple spokesperson said the company was ""deeply committed to the responsible sourcing of materials"" and ""if a refiner is unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they will be removed from our supply chain. We've removed six cobalt refiners in 2019"". The BBC has also sought comment from Tesla.

Rail services cancelled as new timetable starts,"Cancellations and delays have led to overcrowding on trains and at stations such as Manchester Victoria Rail commuters in the north of England have been hit by cancellations and delays as new winter timetables were launched. Northern had cancelled 19 trains by 10:00 GMT and 31 were delayed, which it said was down to ""operational issues"" rather than the timetable change. Transpennine Express also cancelled 29 services on Monday morning. The issues largely affected commuters in Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. Transpennine Express services hit included those linking Manchester Airport with Edinburgh and Newcastle, and trains from Liverpool Lime Street to Scarborough. The firm's managing director Leo Goodwin said he was ""really sorry"" for the disruption to customers at such a busy time of year. He said: ""Due to a number of issues with crew training caused by the late delivery of some of our new trains, along with a maintenance backlog and some infrastructure issues we have had to implement a temporary timetable, cancelling some journeys along one of our routes."" Northern services which were affected were between Blackpool North and Manchester Airport, from Leeds to York and Sheffield, and Darlington to Saltburn. A spokesperson for the rail firm said: ""Very few of our services have seen any changes as a result of the timetable coming in. ""The small number of delays and cancellations are due to operational issues including driver sickness, signalling failure and train faults."" Many services were cancelled and delayed around the north of England Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said rail issues had ""gone on far too long"" and called for Northern to be stripped of its franchise. ""If the government is serious about supporting the north, then it needs to show it by acting this week to sort out our failing rail services,"" he said. ""As a first step, it should strip Northern of its franchise. That would send a clear signal to all rail operators - notably Transpennine Express - that we will not accept a second-class rail service for people in the North. ""If Transpennine Express fail to respond to that message, they should be next."" The National Rail timetable is changed in May and December each year. In the west of England, passengers using Great Western Railway (GWR) services were also hit withcancellations and delays between Reading and London Paddington, due to a fault with the signalling system at Maidenhead. A new, super-fast GWR service from Bristol to London, due to leave at 08:53 GMT, was among the cancellations. Transpennine Express also cancelled 29 of its services on Monday morning Northern had said the new timetable would see 50 new trains being introduced across its services. In October, fewer than half of Northern rail services ran on time, the firm's figures showed. Cancellations were also at their highest level since July and August. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire New timetables and trains for Northern passengers Northern rail could be nationalised The operator had said the changes in its new winter timetable would focus on ""reliability and stability"" and add to the services each week. Commuters shared train travel issues on social media on Monday, as the hashtag #northernfail was trending. Keri Lewis Brown shared an image of a departures board which read a service to Blackpool North had been cancelled ""due to a train stopping in the wrong position"". Allow Twitter content?

Why in God's name would you cancel a peak commuter train?!?!""

MPs' vote on Brexit bill planned for Friday,"The government plans to ask MPs to vote on Boris Johnson's Brexit bill on Friday, Downing Street has said. The PM's spokesman said the government planned to start the process in Parliament before Christmas in the ""proper constitutional way"". The Withdrawal Agreement Bill is the legislation that will enable Brexit to happen - the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January. It comes as the PM prepares to address his new MPs in Westminster. Many of the 109 new Conservative MPs won in areas traditionally held by Labour in Thursday's election,which saw the party gain an 80-seat majority. Mr Johnson is also carrying out a mini cabinet reshuffle, namingSimon Hart as Welsh Secretary. It marks a big promotion for the 56-year-old MP for for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, who was previously a junior minister in the Cabinet Office. The prime minister has also cleared a parliamentary report into alleged Russian interference in UK democracy for publication. LIVE: New government begins first week All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? The Queen will formally open Parliament on Thursday when she sets out the government's legislative programme. The prime minister's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""We plan to start the process [of the withdrawal agreement bill] before Christmas and will do so in the proper constitutional way in discussion with the Speaker."" The Speaker - Lindsay Hoyle was elected to the role last month - is in charge of proceedings in the Commons. Asked if the legislation would be identical to that introduced in the last Parliament, the spokesman said: ""You will have to wait for it to be published but it will reflect the agreement that we made with the EU on our withdrawal."" This video can not be played Take a behind the scenes tour of Parliament to find out what it's be like to be new member The bill is expected to pass through Parliament in time to meet Boris Johnson's promise for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. Mr Johnson then has to negotiate a new trade agreement with the EU and have it ratified before the end of the post-Brexit transition period that ends on 31 December 2020. He has repeatedly said that the transition period will not be extended. The Queen's Speech is also expected to include legislation linked to pledges made during the election campaign - most notably a guarantee on NHS funding. The prime minister's spokesman also said Mr Johnson had ""carefully considered"" the report from the Commons Intelligence and Security Committeeinto alleged Russian interference in UK democracy. ""He is content publication would not prejudice the functions of those bodies that safeguard our national security,"" the spokesman said. ""Publication will be a matter for the new ISC in due course."" During the election campaign, critics said Downing Street was stalling on its release until after the election. The report includes evidence from UK intelligence services concerning Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. Elsewhere, Downing Street added that the prime minister had spoken to US President Donald Trump, who congratulated him on the election result. They discussed the ""huge importance"" of the UK-US relationship and looked forward to ""continued close co-operation"" on issues such as security and the negotiation of an ""ambitious free trade agreement"". Elsewhere, moves to get the Northern Ireland government at Stormont up and running again are also expected, withtalks resumingon Monday. New Conservative MPs have been posting pictures of themselves on their first day including the members for Bishop Auckland and Stoke-on-Trent North - Dehenna Davison and Jonathan Gullis.

WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external Meanwhile, the fallout from Labour's defeat continues. Labour's general secretary says party officials are likely to meet early in the new year to agree the timetable for replacing Jeremy Corbyn as leader. Mr Corbyn wants the process to begin ""swiftly"", Jennie Formby said, so his successor can be in place by the end of March. She has written to members of Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) recommending a provisional date of 6 January for the meeting, with the process beginning the following day. Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour leadership takes blame over election result Both Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell said on Sunday that they took the blame for Labour's ""catastrophic"" defeat in Thursday's election. Speaking to the Today programme, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald accused the BBC of having ""played your part"" in Mr Corbyn's defeat and said the corporation needed to ""have a look in the mirror"". Meanwhile, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock told BBC Politics Live there were three reasons his party lost the election, including ""weak and incompetent leadership"", a decision to back a second EU referendum that ""massively alienated millions in Leave-voting seats"" and a ""Christmas wish list"" manifesto. Mr Kinnock added: ""A one-more-heave candidate for Corbynism is not the right way for our party to go, we need to send a very clear signal we are turning the page."" The race for their replacements has already begun, with Wigan MP Lisa Nandy saying for the first time she was ""seriously thinking about"" running. Other possible contenders are shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, Jess Phillips, who is an outspoken critic of Jeremy Corbyn, and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. A new intake of 47 SNP MPs will also be taking their seats on Tuesday. LeaderNicola Sturgeon has insisted this number gives her a mandate for a second referendum on Scottish independence- something the prime minster has told her he remains opposed to. She said the Conservatives, who lost seven of their 13 seats in Scotland, had been ""defeated comprehensively"" and that the new MPs would continue to press for independence. Tuesday Proceedings begin when MPs gather for their first duty: to elect the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who replaced John Bercow in November. Technically, MPs can hold a vote on this motion but this has never happened in practice. Later in the day, the Speaker will begin the process of swearing in MPs, who are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process. Thursday The state opening of Parliament. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which usually takes days. Friday Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. The government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that will implement Brexit - to Parliament. MPs in the previous Parliament backed Boris Johnson's bill at its first stage butrejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three daysin order to leave the EU by the then 31 October Brexit deadline. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated.

Johnson fills gaps in government mini-reshuffle,"Simon Hart said he had been given an amazing opportunity Boris Johnson is carrying out a limited reshuffle of his government after urging newly elected Tory MPs to ""change our country for the better"". Simon Hart has been named as Welsh secretary, replacing Alun Cairns, who quit at the start of the election. And Nicky Morgan stays as culture secretary, despite standing down as an MP. She is taking a peerage and will sit as a cabinet minister in the Lords. Opposition parties said she had been ""rewarded for political sycophancy"". But Ms Morgan, who will be in charge of broadband and media policy, suggested she might only be in the role for a few weeks - pending what are expected to be far-reaching changes to the PM's top team after the UK has left the EU on 31 January.

There has been unconfirmed speculation that the PM is contemplating a much bigger shake-up in February, including changes to a number of departments, including the Department for Exiting the European Union, the Home Office and Department for International Development. Ms Morgan took many by surprise when she announced that she would not be standing as MP for Loughborough at the election. Nicky Morgan stood down as MP for Loughborough at the general election However, the former education secretary - who cited the abuse that female MPs had received as one of the reasons for her standing down - was one of Mr Johnson's most visible backers during the campaign, prompting speculation she intended to remain in public life. And the news that she has accepted a life peerage and will remain in cabinet has attracted criticism. Liberal Democrat culture spokeswoman Layla Moran said only an elected Upper Chamber would stop ""this kind of sycophancy being rewarded"" while Labour's Jo Stevens said the appointment was ""absolutely disgraceful"".

WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external Downing Street has said the government plans to ask the new Parliament to have its first debate and vote on the PM's withdrawal agreement - the legislation needed to ratify Brexit - on Friday. A spokesman said it planned to start the process of getting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through Parliament in the ""proper constitutional way"". With a Commons majority of 80, the PM is expected to get the bill into law with few changes in time for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. Before that, the PM will set out his legislative plans for the year ahead in a Queen's Speech on Thursday. Tuesday Proceedings begin when MPs gather for their first duty: to elect the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who replaced John Bercow in November. Technically, MPs can hold a vote on this motion but this has never happened in practice. Later in the day, the Speaker will begin the process of swearing in MPs, who are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process. Thursday The state opening of Parliament. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which usually takes days. Friday Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. The government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that will implement Brexit - to Parliament. MPs in the previous Parliament backed Mr Johnson's bill at its first stage but rejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three days in order to leave the EU by the then Brexit deadline of 31 October. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated. What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?

Election in maps and charts,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a majority of 80 seats. They have made gains in Labour heartlands across northern England and Wales. The SNP have made gains across Scotland. Labour have had their worst return of seats in any general election since 1935. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats now have more female than male MPs. The interactive map below shows all the seats that have changed from one party to another. Select the ""results"" tab to see what has happened in the rest of the UK. If you can't see the map click here.,external The Conservatives increased their vote share in many areas that voted Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. By contrast they lost votes in strong Remain constituencies such as those in Scotland and London. But Labour lost votes in both strong Remain and strong Leave areas. Strong Leave and strong Remain constituencies are those where an estimated 60% or more of the electorate voted for that option at the EU referendum. These estimates of constituency Brexit votes were modelled by Professor Chris Hanretty, as the 2016 referendum result was only recorded by local authority and not by Westminster constituency. The Conservatives were clear winners in constituencies estimated to have voted majority Leave in 2016. They won almost three quarters of all these seats. By contrast, there was no clear winner among Remain backing constituencies, with a crowded field of parties all winning substantial numbers of seats. Labour did best of all those parties but only took 40% of the constituencies that backed Remain. Labour also straddled the Brexit divide taking a roughly equal number of Leave (106) and Remain (96) seats. Most other parties had a clearer Brexit divide. Overall, the Conservatives broke new ground, moving into many traditional Labour heartlands. In 2017, Labour held 72 of the 100 constituencies with the most working class households (defined asC2DE,externalusing data from the 2011 census). In 2019, this figure fell to 53 and the Conservatives increased their share from 13 to 31. The nations and regions In every nation and region of Britain, the scale of Labour's losses outweighed any gains made by the Conservatives. The Conservatives did lose votes in the south of England and Scotland, but these were balanced by gains in the rest of England and Wales. The Lib Dems increased their share of the vote across the UK, but failed to translate these gains into more seats. In Scotland, the SNP made 14 gains, and lost just one seat, while the Conservatives lost seven and Labour lost six seats. In Wales, the Conservatives gained six seats and Labour lost six, mostly in the north east. Overall, Labour's share of the vote was down to 41% from 49% in 2017. The Conservatives polled consistently well across England and most of Wales, reflecting their overall 44% share of the UK vote. You can use the interactive map below to show the vote share for other parties as well as the turnout. Labour's strength was concentrated in London and areas around cities in south Wales, the North East and North West. At 32%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election. Overall, they lost 60 seats and gained only one,Putney,externalin London. A total of 220 female MPs have been elected. This is 12 more than the previous high of 208 in 2017. For the first time, both the Liberal Democrats and Labour have more women MPs than men. Of Labour's 202 MPs (excluding Speaker Lindsay Hoyle), 104 are women and of the Liberal Democrats' 11 MPs, seven are women. Turnout, on what was a cold and damp polling day, was 67.3%. slightly lower than the last election in June 2017.

Labour leadership battle begins,"Brave infantrymen in the muddy trenches of the Great War would hurl themselves onto the barbed wire to allow their comrades to march over their backs and advance towards the guns of the enemy. Can you imagine doing that? No, me neither. It's maybe no easier to see why there's already a line of Labour politicians preparing to join the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson's 80-strong House of Commons majority by any normal standard could be big enough to repel Labour's next advance in five years. It's reasonable to imagine that another leader could come and go before Labour recaptures the territory it has lost, assuming it ever does. Whoever wins the coming leadership contest will first have to triumph in the struggle to map Labour's course through the field of battle; to decide how deep a shade of red the party's battle flag should be (just to torture the metaphor a little more). Labour leadership takes blame over election result Corbyn 'sorry' over Labour's heavy election defeat The Labour leader's closest allies are now busy making the case that Corbynism must survive Corbyn. When I spoke to his former chief cheerleader Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the giant trade union Unite, he told me the fudged message on Brexit - which he attributed, by the way, to Remainers not Leavers, and to the way Mr Corbyn had allowed himself to be pushed into promising a second referendum - had cost votes. The party leadership had been tainted by it. But the radical left-wing policies had been ""popular"" and need not change. Mr Corbyn himself arguedin an article in the Observer newspaper,externalthat he was ""proud we won the arguments"", which begs the obvious question: if this election showed Labour had won the arguments, what would losing the arguments have looked like? Mr McCluskey told me on my BBC Radio 5 Live programme Pienaar's Politics: ""All of Labour's policies were extremely popular. The problem is that, yes, when they were put together, there was a question of credulity - could Labour really deliver all of this. ""As regards Jeremy, yes, there's no doubt that it became an issue on the doorstep because of course, for the last four years, every single day, he has been attacked massively in a way that no politicians have by the media. ""The media, especially the right-wing media, wanted the election to be about Brexit. If I have to say this a thousand timesâ¦ Brexit was the reason for this defeat."" Meanwhile, Labour comrades, including freshly defeated former MPs, say Labour pushed policies on tax, spending and public ownership that some found implausible. Caroline Flint, ejected by the voters of Don Valley, told Sky News the answer could not be ""Corbyn without a beard"". For good measure, Ms Flint landed her Labour Remainer colleague and likely leadership contender, Emily Thornberry, in it knee-deep. She said the shadow foreign secretary had told a fellow MP she was ""glad my constituents aren't as stupid as yours."" Ms Thornberry has since dismissed the anecdote as a ""complete and utter lie"", and has instructed solicitors over the comments. Just as well. Otherwise her prospects in the leadership race might easily have grown as dim as she now denies characterising Leave voters. Caroline Flint took on Jeremy Corbyn and Emily Thornberry on Sunday morning So who will run? Rebecca Long-Bailey was the first name Mr McCluskey mentioned when I asked him to state his preference. The Corbynista shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, has said he'd like to be elected her deputy. It's not clear though that she's keen to run, let alone, one imagines, play the role of Labour's bridge-across-the-barbed-wire. Lisa Nandy hasn't, at the time of writing, declared her candidacy, but she surely will - having told the BBC's Andrew Marr ""seriously thinking about it"". So will Sir Keir Starmer, the great hope of many pro-European centrists. It was telling that John McDonnell told Marr it was time for a ""non-London MP"" to become leader, which appeared to rule out Sir Keir and Ms Thornberry, at least in his view. The shadow chancellor also told Marr: ""If anyone's to blame, it's me. Full stop."" That sounded big of him. Except, of course, that he gave up on his own hopes of becoming leader some time ago, and still means to have some influence in installing the next one. As for Jess Phillips, the combative, charismatic wild card in the race when she joins it, Mr McDonnell volunteered that he would ""prefer someone elseâ¦ someone who actually has been really solidly involved in the development of our existing policy"". He wasn't, of course, sticking around with the aim of helping to install a suitable successor. ""We're not into that sort of conniving politics of the past,"" he said, which will reassure those who want a change of political direction. Unless it doesn't.

Vast pro-Indian 'propaganda' network exposed,"A global network of pro-Indian fake websites and think-tanks is aimed at influencing decision-making in Europe, researchers say. The co-ordinated network of 265 sites operates across 65 countries, according to a report byEU Disinfo Lab,external, a Brussels-based NGO. The researchers traced the websites to an Indian company, Srivastava Group. The network was also found to involve groups responsible for anti-Pakistan lobbying events in Europe. There's no evidence it is linked to India's government. But researchers believe the network's purpose is to disseminate propaganda against India's neighbour and rival Pakistan. Both countries have long sought to control the narrative against each other. The websites sprinkled anti-Pakistan content amongst stories about world news and sport ""More than the fake media outlets alone, it is their combination with the fake NGOs that's really worrying because it provides a mirage of online and grassroots support to a cause. That's exactly where the disinformation lies,"" Alexandre Alaphilippe, executive director of EU Disinfo Lab, told the BBC. EU Disinfo Lab's investigation started by looking at EP Today, a website which claimed to be an online magazine for the European Parliament in Brussels. In October, the European Union's disinformation task forcerevealed,externalthat EP Today had been re-publishing a large amount of news directly from Russia Today and Voice of America. Some suspected Russian interference, but EU Disinfo Lab, which is an independent NGO, traced the servers behind the website to Srivastava Group. The researchers then uncovered a vast network of English language fake sites serving India's lobbying interests. EU Disinfo Lab uses skulls and cross bones to represent ""zombie"" sites, green aliens for made-up names and blue ghosts are misleading titles Many of the fake websites use names of defunct newspapers to provide a veneer of credibility. EU Disinfo Lab have dubbed these ""zombie"" sites, because the names were resurrected from dead media outlets. For example, one of the sites is called Manchester Times. Its ""About Us"" section uses text copied from a Wikipedia entry about a newspaper with the same name. But it omits an important part of the Wikipedia description, which states: ""The newspaper's last issue appeared on 22 July 1922."" It also fails to declare the website's links to Indian interests. This and other sites look like local news outlets, but are secretly controlled by servers linked to the Srivastava Group Six of the sites use misleading names, like ""Times of Los Angeles"" instead of the better known ""Los Angeles Times"". The websites all copy syndicated content from news organisations to make them look like real news sites. They then plant anti-Pakistan stories and opinion pieces from employees of NGOs linked to the network to serve India's lobbying interests, researchers found. The Times of Geneva is one of the most sophisticated websites in the network, and creates a lot of video content. Its activities appear to target decision makers at the UN. The website hasn't been updated since 19 November, a few days after EU Disinfo Lab first announced its discovery of the network. The BBC tried calling the phone number on the Times of Geneva's website, but it has been cut off. Its YouTube channel has been disabled and its Twitter account suspended. Interviews with lobbyists, MEPs and representatives of NGOs critical of Pakistan appeared on Times of Geneva's YouTube channel Mr Alaphilippe believes the network was created to influence international institutions and elected representatives. ""We think the main goal was to be able to reach policymakers in Brussels and Geneva, without being able to trace back to those behind the manipulative network. And this worked!"" he told the BBC. ""MEPs [Members of the European Parliament] have engaged directly with this network on a multitude of levels, whether that's been through writing op-eds for their media, participating in overseas trips and press conferences, or by speaking in the European Parliament on behalf of the cause."" Ray Serrato, an open source investigator with a focus on disinformation, noted how little social media traction the network generated. In an email to the BBC, he says what struck him was that ""somebody went to pains to set up hundreds of inauthentic sites to bolster coverage of issues aligned with India's interests, and then used (unwitting?) European MPs to lend legitimacy to some of those sites"". ""The real-life implications are that officials can be hand-fed and regurgitate specific talking points, completely unaware about how they got them."" The EU Disinfo Lab report highlights various organisations which appear to be closely connected, which have been organising ""protests and conferences every year during UN Human Rights Council sessions"". They focus on campaigns to criticise Pakistan for the state of minorities and persecuted groups in the country. One group identified in the network, the European Organisation for Pakistani Minorities (EOPM), organised a protest in front of the UN in 2016, and a conference held in the United Nations Human Rights Council. EOPM put posters in Geneva which contained the message ""Save the Minorities in Pakistan"" In 2017 posters with the message ""Free Balochistan"" and other slogans supporting minorities in Pakistan appeared on streets in Geneva, resulting in Pakistani authorities summoning the Swiss Ambassador to demand the removal of the posters. The EU Disinfo Lab report highlights that this year, a campaign was launched in front of the United Nations office in Geneva about Balochistan. The protest used the hashtag #PakistanStopGenocide, with speeches made by various individuals named in the report. It was extensively covered in media outlets in the network, such as the Times of Geneva. India has also been on the receiving end of critical outdoor advertising in Europe. Earlier this year, during the Cricket World Cup in England, banners were seen flying over the stadium during India's match against Sri Lanka at Headingley, Leeds, with messages such as ""Justice for Kashmir"" and ""India Stop Genocide and Free Kashmir"". Planes flew over 2019 Cricket World Cup matches towing both anti-Pakistan and anti-India slogans Animosity between Pakistan and India has resulted in three all-out wars, and numerous skirmishes across the border, the most recent of which took place in February this year. The battle to construct an effective narrative and gain international support has long been fought online as well as offline. Ten years ago, a now-dormant Pakistani blog, CafÃ© Pyala, unearthed a network of publications that were hawkishly pro-Pakistan and virulently anti-India. It found a similar modus operandi, where the news outlets ""reference and promote each other constantly"", with misleading names such as ""Times of Bombay, The Delhi Times, and Dacca Times"". Unlike its anti-Indian predecessor, the anti-Pakistan network revealed by EU Disinfo Lab has a strong presence in European cities such as Brussels, Geneva and Strasbourg, co-ordinating demonstrations and a social media campaign. Through shared phone numbers and an office address in Brussels, as well as shared web servers, EU Disinfo Lab found Srivastava Group to be at the heart of the network. Srivastava Group is an Indian holding company which declares on its website that it has ""interests in Natural resources, Clean energy, Airspace, Consulting services, Healthcare, Print Media and Publishing"". One of Srivastava Group's subsidiaries, the International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies (IINS), sponsoreda controversial visit to Indian-administered Kashmirfor right-wing MEPs in October. Srivastava Group's headquarters appeared unoccupied The IINS is based at the same address in Delhi as Srivastava Group and an obscure media outlet called New Delhi Times. Outrage over right-wing Euro-MPs' visit to Kashmir Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it Kashmir users kicked off WhatsApp BBC News Hindi reporter Kirti Dubey visited the address and was told by a security guard there was no office in the building. A neighbour who had lived in the area for 40 years told her he had never seen anyone in the house. Srivastava Group did not respond to the BBC's attempts to request comment by phone and email. When Indian media reported the publication of EU Disinfo Lab's initial findings in November, the New Delhi Times' editor in chief Ankit Srivastava tweeted that Pakistan's intelligence services were trying to tarnish him, although he provided no evidence.

Madi Sharma has been identified by EU Disinfo Lab as central to the disinformation network. She has written for EP Today and the New Delhi Times as their ""EU correspondent"". It was Madi Sharma who sent MEPs invitations for the controversial trip to Kashmir. She signed the invitation letters as the Founder and CEO of the Women's Economic and Social Think Tank (WESTT) and said the trip would be sponsored by the IINS. EU Disinfo Lab found that WESTT shares some staff with EP Today and had quoted and republished content from New Delhi Times and the Times of Geneva. Madi Sharma, far right, posed for pictures with Indian PM Narendra Modi during the MEPs' controversial Kashmir trip Madi Sharma, who also goes by the name Madhu Sharma, is a British member of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC). She was nominated for the committee by the UK Government and has been an EESC Member since 2002. She paints herself as a successful entrepreneur, but according to the UK's Companies House website, her sole directorship in the UK is with Madi Limited, and the company is dormant. Her book Madi - No Excuses has its own website which asks: ""Have you heard about the phenomena known as the 'Madi Effect'?"" Ankit Srivastava of the New Delhi Times is also vice chairman of the Srivastava Group - and he is likely to have heard of the 'Madi Effect' because he has written her a glowing testimonial on her website. ""You know all of us at Srivastava Group and New Delhi Times appreciate you and all your work in the promotion of entrepreneurship, human rights and towards empowering others from all nations,"" he writes, adding: ""Of course we particularly appreciate your support toward India."" This support for India and involvement in such a network of websites could be perceived as a conflict of interest for an EESC member like Madi Sharma. She did not respond to the BBC's attempts to contact her. On her website, Madi Sharma says: ""I am the representative of my brand - a registered trade mark - because if Versace and Gucci could do it, so could I!"" The committee's members are drawn from economic and social interest groups in Europe to represent the views of civil society to European institutions, including the European Parliament. In a statement to the BBC, the EESC emphasised the independence of its members. ""The EESC does not engage in image building activities for governments and is independent from any government. [EESC Members] are to be completely independent in the performance of their duties, in the Union's general interest."" Asked what standards are expected of members, and whether lobbying on behalf of countries outside the EU is allowed, the EESC shared its new code of conduct with the BBC. It requires ""integrity, openness, diligence, honesty, accountability and respect for the Committee's reputation"" and avoidance of conflicts of interest. Members do not have to sign the new code of conduct until October next year though. ""An advisory committee on the conduct of members is currently being set up and is currently working on its rules of procedure and working methods. To our knowledge Ms Sharma has not signed the new code of conduct."" The BBC tried to contact Madi Sharma and Ankit Srivastava directly and through their respective organisations, WESTT and Srivastava Group, but they did not respond.

More House of Fraser stores to closeSports Direct says it will be closing 'unprofitable' House of Fraser stores in the next 12 months.BusinessComments,"This video can not be played Sports Direct's financial director Chris Wootton says reforming business rates is ""critical"". More House of Fraser department stores will be closing in 2020, Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has warned. Mr Ashley - whose business bought the department stores a year ago - said that while some stores were not paying rent they were still ""unsustainable"". ""We are doing as much as we can to realistically save as many jobs and stores as possible,"" said Mr Ashley. Shares in Sports Direct ended the day 30% higher after it reported a rise pre-tax half year profits to Â£193.4m. Sports Direct shareholders met on Monday and voted to change the retailer's corporate name to Frasers Group, as part of plans to move upmarket and away from sports. Animal rights activists gathered outside the meeting, campaigning for House of Fraser to renew its ban on animal fur products. Apart from the sportswear retailer and House of Fraser, the group also owns designer fashion brand Flannels, video game shop chain Game Digital, clothing retailer Jack Wills, cycle retailer Evans Cycles and online furniture shop Sofa.com. Animal rights protesters campaigning outside the Sports Direct shareholder meeting The move comes after House of Fraser customers discovered that the retailerwas back to selling fur products in November, after pledging not to use it in 2017. In its latest results, the retailer also reiteratedthat a â¬674m (Â£605m) bill from Belgium's tax authoritywould not lead to ""material liabilities"" and said it would find a resolution soon. Mr Ashley used the results statement for the six months to 27 September to set out a number of reasons for the problems at House of Fraser, including ""serious under-investment"" in stores and appropriate support services. Mr Ashley said: ""We are continuing to review the longer-term portfolio and would expect the number of retained stores to continue to reduce in the next 12 months"". When House of Fraser went into administration, it had 59 stores, two warehouses and employed almost 16,000 staff. It has been reported that seven of those stores have been closed.

Pre-Christmas shopping discounts 'could hit 50%'Discounting by retailers in the run-up to Christmas is predicted to reach record heights in 2019.Business,"Sales discounts on clothing and products in the lead up to Christmas could be the biggest in almost ten years, according to one consultancy. Deloitte, which has monitored the prices of 800,000 products online and in shops since 2011, expects average discounts to hit 50% by Christmas Eve. Its forecast came as data provider Springboard said shopper numbers were lower than the same time last year. The firm said shoppers were waiting for deeper discounts before buying. ""Consumers clearly took advantage of early discounts to purchase Christmas presents, and are now waiting for discounts to deepen once again in the days immediately before Christmas as retailers do their best to shift unsold stock,"" said Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard. Black Friday brings UK retailers 'welcome' boost 'We will sit in Black Friday shopper queue for you' Deloitte said current discounts ranged from 8% to 78% with the biggest discounts on clothing, but said the coming weekend - the last before Christmas - could see ""a tipping point in promotions"". The consultancy said the price cuts had been driven by UK shops discounting earlier in the season due to Black Friday -  the day after the American holiday of Thanksgiving, when retailers drop their prices for 24 hours. The tradition has increasingly been adopted by UK retailers too. Deloitte said this had created a long run-up for pre-Christmas discounting, with prices falling steadily in the lead up to Christmas Day. ""Consumers have come to expect an increasing amount of pre-Christmas discounting. The result is a blending of promotions, one seeping into the next, and a steady price decline rather than a steep Boxing Day drop, reminiscent of Christmases past,"" said Jason Gordon, consumer analytics partner at Deloitte. Post Christmas, Deloitte is expecting deeper discounts, with average reductions of up to 54% on Boxing Day. Retail expert Natalie Berg said the current retail environment is worrying: ""This is the most important time of the year for retailers, and this is a sign of distress."" She added that retailers have become worried and started discounting earlier due to consumers buying less, and once a few big brands start discounting, it is difficult for the rest of the High Street not to join in. ""It's a combination of pent-up demand and the late timing of Black Friday being on 29 November, not 23 November,"" she told the BBC. ""Generally, there's been a lot of political and economic uncertainty this year so consumers have been quite cautious about spending. That pent-up demand has been released at Christmas, when you spend, but consumers have cottoned on to the fact that there will be pre-Christmas discounts now."" But consumers might not even have to wait for the Boxing Day sales. Deloitte predicts that many Boxing Day discounts could go live online on Christmas Day itself, and on Christmas Eve in bricks and mortar shops. ""The operational challenges that sales present in-store mean some retailers could be offering Boxing Day sale prices on Christmas Eve, for those willing to hit the shops early,"" says Mr Gordon.

Huge commercial buildings fire causes disruption,"This video can not be played Fire crews tackle commercial premise blaze in Glasgow Roads remain closed after a major blaze ""devastated"" shops and restaurants in Glasgow's southside. About 60 firefighters and 12 appliances tackled the fire in Seaward Street, in the Kinning Park area, after the alarm was raised just after 03:30. At the height of the fire a huge plume of smoke could be seen from across the River Clyde. Seaward Street was closed to traffic between Paisley Road West and the M8 eastbound off-slip to Scotland Street. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said there were no reported casualties. The traffic disruption hit drivers both during the morning and evening rush hours. Garry Mackay, area commander at the fire service, said the ""challenging"" fire had been contained by crews. BBC journalist Linda Sinclair said the roof of the large building had collapsed. There are fears the front of the building might also give way. The affected properties on Seaward Street include a furniture and flooring showroom, a locksmith, a function suite and a Middle Eastern restaurant. In a Facebook post, Modish Furnishing said: ""A fire tore through the buildings on our street in Kinning Park in the early hours of this morning. Unfortunately our showroom has been devastated."" The Dojo, a martial arts centre on Seaward Lane, is one of the buildings closed by the fire. Instructor Mike McCusker tweeted: ""Although the Hokushin Honbu Dojo is untouched by this incident the road remains closed and we will not have access today. We should be back to normal tomorrow."" Mr MacKay said: ""This was a complex and challenging incident with significant fire spread and crews worked hard to prevent further spread to neighbouring properties. ""We are now confident we have contained the blaze and are scaling back our response."" He said the fire service was working with police to manage traffic. Allow Twitter content?

Hallmark apologises for pulling same-sex ads,"The chief executive of Hallmark Cards has apologised for its decision to withdraw television advertisements featuring same-sex couples. The company's cable network pulled the ads for wedding registry and planning site Zola under pressure from the conservative group One Million Moms. The decision drew criticism on social media and calls for a boycott. Hallmark said it would reinstate the adverts and attempt to re-establish its partnership with Zola. ""We are truly sorry  for the hurt and disappointment this has caused,"" Hallmark's president and chief executive Mike Perry said. In a statement posted to its website, Hallmark said it would ""be working with [advocacy group] Glaad to better represent the LGBTQ community across our portfolio of brands."" The original decision to withdraw the adverts drew criticism from a number of high-profile gay figures, including Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

The Netflix US Twitter account also criticised the decision, as did California Governor Gavin Newsom. The #BoycottHallmarkChannel hashtag, which was launched by Glaad, featured in over 16,000 tweets as of Sunday afternoon. Saturday Night Live performed a skit which mocked Hallmark's decision, concluding with the line: ""This is Emily Cringle for Hallmark, reminding you to stay straight out there."" The original decision to withdraw the advert was prompted by complaints from a conservative activist group. One Million Moms is an online project of the American Family Association, which is a long-time opponent of gay rights. One Million Moms said it had personally spoken to Bill Abbott, who's the chief executive of Hallmark's parent company Crown Family Networks. According to the site, Mr Abbott told them Hallmark had withdrawn the commercial and the advertisement aired in error. Crown Media notified Zola that four of its ads would no longer be airing, with the explanation that Crown Media is ""not allowed to accept creatives that are deemed controversial"".

Water firms hit by toughest crackdown in 30 years,"Water firms in England and Wales are facing the toughest restrictions on investor payouts since privatisation 30 years ago, the regulator has said. Ofwat also said water firms would have to cut the average customer bill by Â£50 over the next five years. It is also forcing firms to invest billions of pounds to improve their performance and reduce leaks. Chief executive Rachel Fletcher said she was ""firing the starting gun on the transformation of the water industry"". ""Now water companies need to crack on, turn this into a reality and transform their performance for everyone,"" she added. Water companies listed on the stock market - such as United Utilities and Severn Trent -  initially fell, but later traded higher. Ofwat wants water companies to spend more on tackling leaks There has been widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of many water companies over the past few years. Criticism has centred around some high profile pollution incidents as well as leaks, water quality and high bills. In January, a review of water companies' business plans found only three out of 17 water firms in England and Wales were of an acceptable standard. Ofwat's five-year assessment, which comes into effect on 1 April 2020, has been hammered out over the course of this year. Thedraft determinations,externalwere set out in July. But the latest announcement includes a tougher stance on the return on capital - a measure of the returns that can be paid to investors - in part because of lower interest rates which makes it cheaper for companies to borrow to invest. Labour's threat to renationalise the water companies had rather overshadowed another looming issue for them - a regulator that had had enough of having sand kicked in its face, and had decided to get tough. Ofwat's plan to cut bills over the five years from 2020 to 2025 has its roots in water companies' own decision to load up with debt, pay generous dividends to shareholders (often via tax havens) and their failure to  deliver service of a sufficiently high quality. Despite water companies' protestations that service levels have continued to improve, public anger has grown. Thames Water, the largest of the water and sewage companies in England and Wales, was the focal point - it was fined Â£1.4m for a serious leak of raw sewage in 2017 - as was Southern Water, which deliberately misreported monitoring failures at its sewage treatment plants. An analysis for the Financial Times suggests that since privatisation the companies have taken on a combined Â£51bn in debt, and paid out Â£56bn in dividends. The question now is whether the companies whose spending plans have not been cleared by Ofwat will appeal. They have two months to do so. 'Penny drop' ""This is the lowest allowed return on capital since privatisation 30 years ago but is consistent with market expectations for returns in 2020-25,"" Ofwat said. Ms Fletcher said in an interview with the Today Programme that it would now be harder for companies to pay shareholders dividends. ""We are seeing increasingly the penny drop with companies, some announcing they expect no dividend in the next five years."" 'Tough review' She said firms had the option of appealing to the Competition and Markets Authority over the price targets. As it is cheaper for these companies to borrow, bills should come down, she said. The Thames Tideway tunnel is being built in London as part of an overhaul of its sewage systems ""We've said all along this was going to be a tough review,"" she said. ""We think this is the greenest package ever for water companies."" Population growth and climate change will be the big challenges for them in the long term, she added. Water companies will be able to increase their returns to investors if they meet customer service target and increase their investment. ""Where a company outperforms our allowed costs or expected service levels it should earn a higher equity return; where a company underperforms our allowed costs or expected service levels it should earn a lower return,"" Ofwat said. In response the regulator drew up plans outlined in draft form in July which it said would mean ""better services, a healthier natural environment and lower bills"". Water UK, the industry trade body, said companies would now work through the details of the ""tough price review"". ""Today's announcement is a highly important one as the industry looks to deliver for customers and for the environment, today and in the future, said Christine McGourty, Water UK's chief executive, said. Office of Water Services is the government regulator tasked with overseeing the privatised water market in England and Wales. Scotland has its own separate regulator, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland.

Johnson to welcome new MPs to Westminster,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson will address his new intake of Conservative MPs later as they arrive in Westminster to take their seats in Parliament. Many of the 109 new MPs won in areas traditionally held by Labour in Thursday's election,which saw the Conservatives gain an 80-seat majority. Their first job will be to vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill that the PM intends to bring back before Christmas. Mr Johnson is also expected to carry out a mini cabinet reshuffle. He needs to fill posts made vacant by those who stood down ahead of the general election, including the culture and Welsh secretary posts. This video can not be played Take a behind the scenes tour of Parliament to find out what it's be like to be new member The Queen will formally open Parliament on Thursday when she sets out the government's legislative programme. It is thought the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) on leaving the EU could be put before MPs as early as Friday. All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? Ahead of Mr Johnson's private speech to the new MPs, a Number 10 source said: ""The PM has been very clear that we have a responsibility to deliver a better future for our country and that we must repay the public's trust by getting Brexit done. ""That's why the first piece of legislation new MPs will vote on will be the Withdrawal Agreement Bill."" With the large majority, the bill is expected to pass through Parliament in time to meet Boris Johnson's promise for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. Mr Johnson then has to negotiate a new trade agreement with the EU and have it ratified before the end of the post-Brexit transition period that ends on 31 December 2020. He has repeatedly said that the transition period will not be extended. The Queen's speech is also expected to include legislation linked to pledges made during the election campaign - most notably a guarantee on NHS funding. Moves to get the Northern Ireland government at Stormont up and running again are also expected, withtalks resumingon Monday. New Conservative MPs have been posting pictures of themselves on their first day including the members for Bishop Auckland and Stoke-on-Trent North - Dehenna Davison and Jonathan Gullis.

WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external Meanwhile, the fallout from Labour's defeat continues. Labour's general secretary says party officials are likely to meet early in the new year to agree the timetable for replacing Jeremy Corbyn as leader. Mr Corbyn wants the process to begin ""swiftly"", Jennie Formby said, so his successor can be in place by the end of March. She has written to members of Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) recommending a provisional date of 6 January for the meeting, with the process beginning the following day. Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour leadership takes blame over election result Both Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell said on Sunday that they took the blame for Labour's ""catastrophic"" defeat in Thursday's election. Mr Corbyn said he was ""sorry that we came up short"",external, while Mr McDonnell told the BBC he ""owns this disaster"". Labour figures disagree over the reasons for the defeat. Mr McDonnell said the main issue was Brexit and the ""media portrayal"" of Mr Corbyn. Speaking to the Today programme, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald accused the BBC of having ""played your part"" in Mr Corbyn's defeat and said the corporation needed to ""have a look in the mirror"". Meanwhile, MP Stephen Kinnock told BBC Breakfast the main problems were ""weak and incompetent leadership"" as well as the decision to support another Brexit referendum and a ""Christmas wishlist"" manifesto. The race for their replacements has already begun, with Wigan MP Lisa Nandy saying for the first time she was ""seriously thinking about"" running. Other possible contenders are shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, Jess Phillips, who is an outspoken critic of Jeremy Corbyn, and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. A new intake of 47 SNP MPs will also be taking their seats on Tuesday. LeaderNicola Sturgeon has insisted this number gives her a mandate for a second referendum on Scottish independence- something the prime minster has told her he remains opposed to. She said the Conservatives, who lost seven of their 13 seats in Scotland, had been ""defeated comprehensively"" and that the new MPs would continue to press for independence. Tuesday Proceedings begin when MPs gather for their first duty: to elect the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who replaced John Bercow in November. Technically, MPs can hold a vote on this motion but this has never happened in practice. Later in the day, the Speaker will begin the process of swearing in MPs, who are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process. Thursday The state opening of Parliament. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which usually takes days. Friday Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. This may be interrupted for a second reading debate on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. MPs in the previous Parliament backed Boris Johnson's bill at its first stage butrejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three daysin order to leave the EU by the then 31 October Brexit deadline. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated.

Johnson's Brexit bill planned for Friday,"The government plans to ask MPs to vote on Boris Johnson's Brexit bill on Friday, Downing Street has said. The PM's spokesman said the government planned to start the process in Parliament before Christmas in the ""proper constitutional way"". The Withdrawal Agreement Bill is the legislation that will enable Brexit to happen - the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January. It comes as the PM prepares to address his new MPs in Westminster. Many of the 109 new Conservative MPs won in areas traditionally held by Labour in Thursday's election,which saw the party gain an 80-seat majority. Mr Johnson is also carrying out a mini cabinet reshuffle, namingSimon Hart as Welsh Secretary. It marks a big promotion for the 56-year-old MP for for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, who was previously a junior minister in the Cabinet Office. The prime minister has also cleared a parliamentary report into alleged Russian interference in UK democracy for publication. LIVE: New government begins first week All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? The Queen will formally open Parliament on Thursday when she sets out the government's legislative programme. The prime minister's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""We plan to start the process [of the withdrawal agreement bill] before Christmas and will do so in the proper constitutional way in discussion with the Speaker."" The Speaker - Lindsay Hoyle was elected to the role last month - is in charge of proceedings in the Commons. Asked if the legislation would be identical to that introduced in the last Parliament, the spokesman said: ""You will have to wait for it to be published but it will reflect the agreement that we made with the EU on our withdrawal."" This video can not be played Take a behind the scenes tour of Parliament to find out what it's be like to be new member The bill is expected to pass through Parliament in time to meet Boris Johnson's promise for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. Mr Johnson then has to negotiate a new trade agreement with the EU and have it ratified before the end of the post-Brexit transition period that ends on 31 December 2020. He has repeatedly said that the transition period will not be extended. The Queen's Speech is also expected to include legislation linked to pledges made during the election campaign - most notably a guarantee on NHS funding. The prime minister's spokesman also said Mr Johnson had ""carefully considered"" the report from the Commons Intelligence and Security Committeeinto alleged Russian interference in UK democracy. ""He is content publication would not prejudice the functions of those bodies that safeguard our national security,"" the spokesman said. ""Publication will be a matter for the new ISC in due course."" During the election campaign, critics said Downing Street was stalling on its release until after the election. The report includes evidence from UK intelligence services concerning Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. Elsewhere, Downing Street added that the prime minister had spoken to US President Donald Trump, who congratulated him on the election result. They discussed the ""huge importance"" of the UK-US relationship and looked forward to ""continued close co-operation"" on issues such as security and the negotiation of an ""ambitious free trade agreement"". Elsewhere, moves to get the Northern Ireland government at Stormont up and running again are also expected, withtalks resumingon Monday. New Conservative MPs have been posting pictures of themselves on their first day including the members for Bishop Auckland and Stoke-on-Trent North - Dehenna Davison and Jonathan Gullis.

SCROLL AND SEE:The results that sealed it,external ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW:The night's key points MAPS AND CHARTS:The election in graphics,external BREXIT:What happens now? WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external Meanwhile, the fallout from Labour's defeat continues. Labour's general secretary says party officials are likely to meet early in the new year to agree the timetable for replacing Jeremy Corbyn as leader. Mr Corbyn wants the process to begin ""swiftly"", Jennie Formby said, so his successor can be in place by the end of March. She has written to members of Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) recommending a provisional date of 6 January for the meeting, with the process beginning the following day. Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour leadership takes blame over election result Both Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell said on Sunday that they took the blame for Labour's ""catastrophic"" defeat in Thursday's election. Speaking to the Today programme, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald accused the BBC of having ""played your part"" in Mr Corbyn's defeat and said the corporation needed to ""have a look in the mirror"". Meanwhile, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock told BBC Politics Live there were three reasons his party lost the election, including ""weak and incompetent leadership"", a decision to back a second EU referendum that ""massively alienated millions in Leave-voting seats"" and a ""Christmas wish list"" manifesto. Mr Kinnock added: ""A one-more-heave candidate for Corbynism is not the right way for our party to go, we need to send a very clear signal we are turning the page."" The race for their replacements has already begun, with Wigan MP Lisa Nandy saying for the first time she was ""seriously thinking about"" running. Other possible contenders are shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, Jess Phillips, who is an outspoken critic of Jeremy Corbyn, and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. A new intake of 47 SNP MPs will also be taking their seats on Tuesday. LeaderNicola Sturgeon has insisted this number gives her a mandate for a second referendum on Scottish independence- something the prime minster has told her he remains opposed to. She said the Conservatives, who lost seven of their 13 seats in Scotland, had been ""defeated comprehensively"" and that the new MPs would continue to press for independence. Tuesday Proceedings begin when MPs gather for their first duty: to elect the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who replaced John Bercow in November. Technically, MPs can hold a vote on this motion but this has never happened in practice. Later in the day, the Speaker will begin the process of swearing in MPs, who are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process. Thursday The state opening of Parliament. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which usually takes days. Friday Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. The government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that will implement Brexit - to Parliament. MPs in the previous Parliament backed Boris Johnson's bill at its first stage butrejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three daysin order to leave the EU by the then 31 October Brexit deadline. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated.

"Northern cancels services as new timetable startsThe rail operator had said 50 new trains would be introduced, but is reporting a shortage of drivers.","Cancellations and delays have led to overcrowding on trains and at stations such as Manchester Victoria Rail commuters in the north of England have been hit by cancellations and delays as new winter timetables were launched. Northern had cancelled 19 trains by 10:00 GMT and 31 were delayed, which it said was down to ""operational issues"" rather than the timetable change. Transpennine Express also cancelled 29 services on Monday morning. The issues largely affected commuters in Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. Transpennine Express services hit included those linking Manchester Airport with Edinburgh and Newcastle, and trains from Liverpool Lime Street to Scarborough. The firm's managing director Leo Goodwin said he was ""really sorry"" for the disruption to customers at such a busy time of year. He said: ""Due to a number of issues with crew training caused by the late delivery of some of our new trains, along with a maintenance backlog and some infrastructure issues we have had to implement a temporary timetable, cancelling some journeys along one of our routes."" Northern services which were affected were between Blackpool North and Manchester Airport, from Leeds to York and Sheffield, and Darlington to Saltburn. A spokesperson for the rail firm said: ""Very few of our services have seen any changes as a result of the timetable coming in. ""The small number of delays and cancellations are due to operational issues including driver sickness, signalling failure and train faults."" Many services were cancelled and delayed around the north of England Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said rail issues had ""gone on far too long"" and called for Northern to be stripped of its franchise. ""If the government is serious about supporting the north, then it needs to show it by acting this week to sort out our failing rail services,"" he said. ""As a first step, it should strip Northern of its franchise. That would send a clear signal to all rail operators - notably Transpennine Express - that we will not accept a second-class rail service for people in the North. ""If Transpennine Express fail to respond to that message, they should be next."" The National Rail timetable is changed in May and December each year. In the west of England, passengers using Great Western Railway (GWR) services were also hit withcancellations and delays between Reading and London Paddington, due to a fault with the signalling system at Maidenhead. A new, super-fast GWR service from Bristol to London, due to leave at 08:53 GMT, was among the cancellations. Transpennine Express also cancelled 29 of its services on Monday morning Northern had said the new timetable would see 50 new trains being introduced across its services. In October, fewer than half of Northern rail services ran on time, the firm's figures showed. Cancellations were also at their highest level since July and August. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire New timetables and trains for Northern passengers Northern rail could be nationalised The operator had said the changes in its new winter timetable would focus on ""reliability and stability"" and add to the services each week. Commuters shared train travel issues on social media on Monday, as the hashtag #northernfail was trending. Keri Lewis Brown shared an image of a departures board which read a service to Blackpool North had been cancelled ""due to a train stopping in the wrong position"". Allow Twitter content?

Ben Simmonds wrote on Facebook: ""So Northern have gone ahead and cancelled the 7:53 from Sowerby Bridge to York in the new timetable (despite promising not to) which means the 7:58 to Leeds will now have triple the normal passenger count. Why in God's name would you cancel a peak commuter train?!?!"" Transpennine is running a pre-planned temporary reduced timetable on some routes as a maintenance backlog and infrastructure problems have delayed staff training on new trains. Its managing director Mr Goodwin said as new trains were introduced improvements to services would be made. Sophie Lichfieldtweeted,externalthat commuting between Liverpool and Manchester was ""near impossible"" due to the cancellations and delays. While another, Pippa Jackson,tweeted,external: ""8.17 to Dewsbury cancelled. Having to wait nearly an hour for the next one. No lunch for me today then. Or I don't get home till 7pm.

One passenger, posting on Twitter with the username leylandski,wrote,external: ""Every day you get worse. Now you've cancelled both my train to and from work until Jan? Why? They were during peak time, this is totally unacceptable."" Anthony Smith, chief executive of watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""Passengers don't care what causes the disruption - they just want things running again as soon as possible, and plenty of visible staff on hand to help them in the meantime.

The 105.3 litre bottle of 14-year-old Tomintoul is nearly 1.5m (4.9ft) tall, weighs more than 180kg (396lbs) and would serve up about 5,250 drams. The bottle was part of an online Christmas auction which ended at 20:00 on Sunday. The giant Speyside bottle holds 150 standard bottles of whisky and holds a 20cm (7.8in) cork. The bottle was filled at the Tomintoul Distillery in August 2009 by a team of 14 people. It left the Highland village for the first time since it was created to go on display at the the Scotch Whisky Experience in Edinburgh in 2012 when it was worth about Â£5,000. Graham Crane, director and co-founder of auctioneers Just Whisky, said ahead of the sale: ""Every now and then the opportunity to purchase a truly unique bottle of whisky occurs - this is one of those times. ""We're delighted to be auctioning this supersized bottle this month and hope that the lucky buyer has either an appropriate sized stocking for Christmas if it's a gift, or is planning a memorable Hogmanay celebration to welcome in 2020.""

Huge industrial estate fire causes disruption,"This video can not be played Fire crews tackle commercial premise blaze in Glasgow Roads remain closed after a major blaze ""devastated"" shops and restaurants in Glasgow's southside. About 60 firefighters and 12 appliances tackled the fire in Seaward Street, in the Kinning Park area, after the alarm was raised just after 03:30. At the height of the fire a huge plume of smoke could be seen from across the River Clyde. Seaward Street was closed to traffic between Paisley Road West and the M8 eastbound off-slip to Scotland Street. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said there were no reported casualties. The traffic disruption hit drivers both during the morning and evening rush hours. Garry Mackay, area commander at the fire service, said the ""challenging"" fire had been contained by crews. BBC journalist Linda Sinclair said the roof of the large building had collapsed. There are fears the front of the building might also give way. The affected properties on Seaward Street include a furniture and flooring showroom, a locksmith, a function suite and a Middle Eastern restaurant. In a Facebook post, Modish Furnishing said: ""A fire tore through the buildings on our street in Kinning Park in the early hours of this morning. Unfortunately our showroom has been devastated."" The Dojo, a martial arts centre on Seaward Lane, is one of the buildings closed by the fire. Instructor Mike McCusker tweeted: ""Although the Hokushin Honbu Dojo is untouched by this incident the road remains closed and we will not have access today. We should be back to normal tomorrow."" Mr MacKay said: ""This was a complex and challenging incident with significant fire spread and crews worked hard to prevent further spread to neighbouring properties. ""We are now confident we have contained the blaze and are scaling back our response."" He said the fire service was working with police to manage traffic. Allow Twitter content?

"Hallmark apologises for pulling same-sex adsThe company withdrew the adverts under pressure from conservatives, then reversed its decision.","The chief executive of Hallmark Cards has apologised for its decision to withdraw television advertisements featuring same-sex couples. The company's cable network pulled the ads for wedding registry and planning site Zola under pressure from the conservative group One Million Moms. The decision drew criticism on social media and calls for a boycott. Hallmark said it would reinstate the adverts and attempt to re-establish its partnership with Zola. ""We are truly sorry  for the hurt and disappointment this has caused,"" Hallmark's president and chief executive Mike Perry said. In a statement posted to its website, Hallmark said it would ""be working with [advocacy group] Glaad to better represent the LGBTQ community across our portfolio of brands."" The original decision to withdraw the adverts drew criticism from a number of high-profile gay figures, including Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

The Netflix US Twitter account also criticised the decision, as did California Governor Gavin Newsom. The #BoycottHallmarkChannel hashtag, which was launched by Glaad, featured in over 16,000 tweets as of Sunday afternoon. Saturday Night Live performed a skit which mocked Hallmark's decision, concluding with the line: ""This is Emily Cringle for Hallmark, reminding you to stay straight out there."" The original decision to withdraw the advert was prompted by complaints from a conservative activist group. One Million Moms is an online project of the American Family Association, which is a long-time opponent of gay rights. One Million Moms said it had personally spoken to Bill Abbott, who's the chief executive of Hallmark's parent company Crown Family Networks. According to the site, Mr Abbott told them Hallmark had withdrawn the commercial and the advertisement aired in error. Crown Media notified Zola that four of its ads would no longer be airing, with the explanation that Crown Media is ""not allowed to accept creatives that are deemed controversial"".

qualification to the Champions League. ""It is not easy, but the young players will have a
great experience and hopefully they get a good result. We do not want to focus
on one competition and we want to reach as far as we can."" On potential January signings:""It depends on the January

Mike Ashley warns House of Fraser stores to closeSports Direct says it will be closing 'unprofitable' House of Fraser stores in the next 12 months.Business,"This video can not be played Sports Direct's financial director Chris Wootton says reforming business rates is ""critical"". More House of Fraser department stores will be closing in 2020, Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has warned. Mr Ashley - whose business bought the department stores a year ago - said that while some stores were not paying rent they were still ""unsustainable"". ""We are doing as much as we can to realistically save as many jobs and stores as possible,"" said Mr Ashley. Shares in Sports Direct ended the day 30% higher after it reported a rise pre-tax half year profits to Â£193.4m. Sports Direct shareholders met on Monday and voted to change the retailer's corporate name to Frasers Group, as part of plans to move upmarket and away from sports. Animal rights activists gathered outside the meeting, campaigning for House of Fraser to renew its ban on animal fur products. Apart from the sportswear retailer and House of Fraser, the group also owns designer fashion brand Flannels, video game shop chain Game Digital, clothing retailer Jack Wills, cycle retailer Evans Cycles and online furniture shop Sofa.com. Animal rights protesters campaigning outside the Sports Direct shareholder meeting The move comes after House of Fraser customers discovered that the retailerwas back to selling fur products in November, after pledging not to use it in 2017. In its latest results, the retailer also reiteratedthat a â¬674m (Â£605m) bill from Belgium's tax authoritywould not lead to ""material liabilities"" and said it would find a resolution soon. Mr Ashley used the results statement for the six months to 27 September to set out a number of reasons for the problems at House of Fraser, including ""serious under-investment"" in stores and appropriate support services. Mr Ashley said: ""We are continuing to review the longer-term portfolio and would expect the number of retained stores to continue to reduce in the next 12 months"". When House of Fraser went into administration, it had 59 stores, two warehouses and employed almost 16,000 staff. It has been reported that seven of those stores have been closed.

Water bills to be cut by Â£50 in industry crackdown,"Water firms in England and Wales are facing the toughest restrictions on investor payouts since privatisation 30 years ago, the regulator has said. Ofwat also said water firms would have to cut the average customer bill by Â£50 over the next five years. It is also forcing firms to invest billions of pounds to improve their performance and reduce leaks. Chief executive Rachel Fletcher said she was ""firing the starting gun on the transformation of the water industry"". ""Now water companies need to crack on, turn this into a reality and transform their performance for everyone,"" she added. Water companies listed on the stock market - such as United Utilities and Severn Trent -  initially fell, but later traded higher. Ofwat wants water companies to spend more on tackling leaks There has been widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of many water companies over the past few years. Criticism has centred around some high profile pollution incidents as well as leaks, water quality and high bills. In January, a review of water companies' business plans found only three out of 17 water firms in England and Wales were of an acceptable standard. Ofwat's five-year assessment, which comes into effect on 1 April 2020, has been hammered out over the course of this year. Thedraft determinations,externalwere set out in July. But the latest announcement includes a tougher stance on the return on capital - a measure of the returns that can be paid to investors - in part because of lower interest rates which makes it cheaper for companies to borrow to invest. Labour's threat to renationalise the water companies had rather overshadowed another looming issue for them - a regulator that had had enough of having sand kicked in its face, and had decided to get tough. Ofwat's plan to cut bills over the five years from 2020 to 2025 has its roots in water companies' own decision to load up with debt, pay generous dividends to shareholders (often via tax havens) and their failure to  deliver service of a sufficiently high quality. Despite water companies' protestations that service levels have continued to improve, public anger has grown. Thames Water, the largest of the water and sewage companies in England and Wales, was the focal point - it was fined Â£1.4m for a serious leak of raw sewage in 2017 - as was Southern Water, which deliberately misreported monitoring failures at its sewage treatment plants. An analysis for the Financial Times suggests that since privatisation the companies have taken on a combined Â£51bn in debt, and paid out Â£56bn in dividends. The question now is whether the companies whose spending plans have not been cleared by Ofwat will appeal. They have two months to do so. 'Penny drop' ""This is the lowest allowed return on capital since privatisation 30 years ago but is consistent with market expectations for returns in 2020-25,"" Ofwat said. Ms Fletcher said in an interview with the Today Programme that it would now be harder for companies to pay shareholders dividends. ""We are seeing increasingly the penny drop with companies, some announcing they expect no dividend in the next five years."" 'Tough review' She said firms had the option of appealing to the Competition and Markets Authority over the price targets. As it is cheaper for these companies to borrow, bills should come down, she said. The Thames Tideway tunnel is being built in London as part of an overhaul of its sewage systems ""We've said all along this was going to be a tough review,"" she said. ""We think this is the greenest package ever for water companies."" Population growth and climate change will be the big challenges for them in the long term, she added. Water companies will be able to increase their returns to investors if they meet customer service target and increase their investment. ""Where a company outperforms our allowed costs or expected service levels it should earn a higher equity return; where a company underperforms our allowed costs or expected service levels it should earn a lower return,"" Ofwat said. In response the regulator drew up plans outlined in draft form in July which it said would mean ""better services, a healthier natural environment and lower bills"". Water UK, the industry trade body, said companies would now work through the details of the ""tough price review"". ""Today's announcement is a highly important one as the industry looks to deliver for customers and for the environment, today and in the future, said Christine McGourty, Water UK's chief executive, said. Office of Water Services is the government regulator tasked with overseeing the privatised water market in England and Wales. Scotland has its own separate regulator, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland. Ofwat monitors the market to see if it needs to intervene to protect customers and to set limits on the price they're asked to pay.

Poorest countries face both over and under-eating,"A third of the poorest countries in the world are dealing with high levels of obesity as well as under-nourishment, which leaves people too thin, according to a report in The Lancet. It says the problem is caused by global access to ultra-processed foods, and people exercising less. The authors are calling for changes to the ""modern food system"" which they believe to be driving it. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia are most affected. The report,externalestimates that nearly 2.3 billion children and adults on the planet are overweight, and more than 150 million children have stunted growth. And many low and middle-income countries are facing these two issues at once - known as the 'double burden of malnutrition'. This means that 20% of people are overweight, 30% of children under four are not growing properly, and 20% of women are classified as thin. The places where too many are fat and too many are thin Ultra-processed foods 'make you eat more' Meat, veg, nuts - a diet designed to feed 10bn Ultra-processed foods 'linked to cancer' Communities and families can be affected by both forms of malnutrition, as well as individual people at different points in their lives, the report says. According to the report, 45 out of 123 countries were affected by the burden in the 1990s, and 48 out of 126 countries in the 2010s. By the 2010s, 14 countries with some of the lowest incomes in the world had developed this 'double problem' since the 1990s. The report authors say action should be taken by governments, the United Nations and academics to address the problem, and it points the finger at changing diets. The way people eat, drink and move is changing. Increasing numbers of supermarkets, easy availability of less nutritious food, as well as a decrease in physical activity, are leading to more people becoming overweight. And these changes are affecting low and middle-income countries, as well as high-income ones. Although stunted growth of children in many countries is becoming less frequent, eating ultra-processed foods early in life is linked to poor growth. ""We are facing a new nutrition reality,"" says lead author Dr Francesco Branca, director of the department of nutrition for health and development at the World Health Organization. ""We can no longer characterise countries as low-income and undernourished, or high-income and only concerned with obesity. ""All forms of malnutrition have a common denominator - food systems that fail to provide all people with healthy, safe, affordable, and sustainable diets."" Dr Branca said changing this needed changes in food systems - from production and processing, through trade and distribution, pricing, marketing, and labelling, to consumption and waste. ""All relevant policies and investments must be radically re-examined,"" he said. According to the report, it contains: lots of fruits and vegetables, wholegrains, fibre, nuts, and seeds modest amounts of animal source foods minimal amounts of processed meats minimal amounts of food and beverages high in energy and added sugar, saturated fat, trans fat and salt High-quality diets reduce the risk of malnutrition by encouraging healthy growth, development, and the body's protection against diseases throughout life.

Water bills to be cut by Â£50 in industry crackdownWater bills will come down after 1 April 2020 after the regulator set out new pricing rules.Business,"Water firms in England and Wales are facing the toughest restrictions on investor payouts since privatisation 30 years ago, the regulator has said. Ofwat also said water firms would have to cut the average customer bill by Â£50 over the next five years. It is also forcing firms to invest billions of pounds to improve their performance and reduce leaks. Chief executive Rachel Fletcher said she was ""firing the starting gun on the transformation of the water industry"". ""Now water companies need to crack on, turn this into a reality and transform their performance for everyone,"" she added. Water companies listed on the stock market - such as United Utilities and Severn Trent -  initially fell, but later traded higher. Ofwat wants water companies to spend more on tackling leaks There has been widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of many water companies over the past few years. Criticism has centred around some high profile pollution incidents as well as leaks, water quality and high bills. In January, a review of water companies' business plans found only three out of 17 water firms in England and Wales were of an acceptable standard. Ofwat's five-year assessment, which comes into effect on 1 April 2020, has been hammered out over the course of this year. Thedraft determinations,externalwere set out in July. But the latest announcement includes a tougher stance on the return on capital - a measure of the returns that can be paid to investors - in part because of lower interest rates which makes it cheaper for companies to borrow to invest. Labour's threat to renationalise the water companies had rather overshadowed another looming issue for them - a regulator that had had enough of having sand kicked in its face, and had decided to get tough. Ofwat's plan to cut bills over the five years from 2020 to 2025 has its roots in water companies' own decision to load up with debt, pay generous dividends to shareholders (often via tax havens) and their failure to  deliver service of a sufficiently high quality. Despite water companies' protestations that service levels have continued to improve, public anger has grown. Thames Water, the largest of the water and sewage companies in England and Wales, was the focal point - it was fined Â£1.4m for a serious leak of raw sewage in 2017 - as was Southern Water, which deliberately misreported monitoring failures at its sewage treatment plants. An analysis for the Financial Times suggests that since privatisation the companies have taken on a combined Â£51bn in debt, and paid out Â£56bn in dividends. The question now is whether the companies whose spending plans have not been cleared by Ofwat will appeal. They have two months to do so. 'Penny drop' ""This is the lowest allowed return on capital since privatisation 30 years ago but is consistent with market expectations for returns in 2020-25,"" Ofwat said. Ms Fletcher said in an interview with the Today Programme that it would now be harder for companies to pay shareholders dividends. ""We are seeing increasingly the penny drop with companies, some announcing they expect no dividend in the next five years."" 'Tough review' She said firms had the option of appealing to the Competition and Markets Authority over the price targets. As it is cheaper for these companies to borrow, bills should come down, she said. The Thames Tideway tunnel is being built in London as part of an overhaul of its sewage systems ""We've said all along this was going to be a tough review,"" she said. ""We think this is the greenest package ever for water companies."" Population growth and climate change will be the big challenges for them in the long term, she added. Water companies will be able to increase their returns to investors if they meet customer service target and increase their investment. ""Where a company outperforms our allowed costs or expected service levels it should earn a higher equity return; where a company underperforms our allowed costs or expected service levels it should earn a lower return,"" Ofwat said. In response the regulator drew up plans outlined in draft form in July which it said would mean ""better services, a healthier natural environment and lower bills"". Water UK, the industry trade body, said companies would now work through the details of the ""tough price review"". ""Today's announcement is a highly important one as the industry looks to deliver for customers and for the environment, today and in the future, said Christine McGourty, Water UK's chief executive, said. Office of Water Services is the government regulator tasked with overseeing the privatised water market in England and Wales. Scotland has its own separate regulator, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland. Ofwat monitors the market to see if it needs to intervene to protect customers and to set limits on the price they're asked to pay.

""My mother knew what she was doing with it,"" he said. ""She realised that it was very important when you grow up - especially in the life that we grew up - that you realise that life happens beyond palace walls, and that you see real people struggling with real issues."" He added that his mother ""liked to challenge the social norms about charities and about disadvantages and vulnerable people"". Asked whether he speaks to his children about such issues, he told how Prince George, six, and Charlotte, four, would quiz him about the world on the way to school in south-west London. He said: ""Absolutely, and on the school run - I know it sounds a little bit contrite - but on the school run already, bear in mind six and four (George and Charlotte's age), whenever we see someone who is sleeping rough on the street I talk about it and I point it out and I explain.""

In one scene, Kate serves non-alcoholic cocktails to people at a dry bar in Liverpool which has been set up by the charity Action on Addiction. ""It reminded me of my university days when I did a bit of waitressing,"" she said. Asked by Berry whether she was any good, the duchess replied: ""No - I was terrible.""

NI political parties set to resume Stormont talks,"Northern Ireland has had no devolved government since January 2017 Now is the moment to restore devolution in Northern Ireland, Julian Smith has said. The Northern Ireland secretary was speaking after talks aimed at restoring the assembly began on Monday. The Northern Ireland Assembly has been inactive since January 2017,when its two biggest parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, split in a bitter row. Mr Smith said the biggest issue in the negotiations should be dealing with the current crisis in the health sector. He met the leaders of Northern Ireland's five biggest parties. Meanwhile, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Simon Byrne, wrote to the leaders on Monday calling on them to agree on how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles and requesting support to hire more officers. Varadkar and Johnson pledge to restore Stormont Consequences of not restoring Stormont 'profound' Naomi Long met Julian Smith at Stormont House The British and Irish governments will work ""night and day"" over the next few weeks to restore devolution, said the TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney. The Irish deputy PM was speaking after a meeting with the NI Secretary Julian Smith at Stormont. Mr Coveney said there would be ""intensive"" discussions between the parties over the course of this week. He will hold his own meetings with the five parties on Monday night and Tuesday, ahead of a roundtable scheduled for Wednesday. He said the two governments did not ""want to bounce"" the parties into an agreement - but said they had been discussing the same issues for many months now. ""This is not about trying to force the parties into a space they don't want to move into,"" he added. ""But we've had a reality check with the nurses' strike, and I think it's a reminder to everyone that now is the time to get this done."" Round-table talks are set to happen later in the week which will involve the parties, Mr Smith and Mr Coveney. Several rounds of talks to restore the executive have ended in failure, with the two parties unable to resolve differences over issues such as the Irish language or how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. In the general election last Thursday both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in saw their share of the vote fall. Mr Smith said the results had given the five parties ""serious issues"" to reflect on - but maintained he is obliged to call a fresh assembly election if a deal is not reached by 13 January. The Sinn FÃ©in team speak to the media after fresh talks at Stormont on Monday Speaking after meeting Mr Smith, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said their discussion was ""constructive and positive"" but she added her party would not go back into an assembly that was ""a stop-start mess"". Mrs Long also said there was a draft document regarding a deal but that it is not complete. She said discussions between the parties over the next week would seek to build on it. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the general election result showed people were ""sick of the Stormont standoff"". After meeting Mr Smith, he said the British and Irish governments should, in the next couple of days, publish a document detailing what has been agreed so far. ""They should force the parties to say yes or no,"" he added. Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said he did not believe a deal was likely before Christmas. He called for reforms to be made, and said the ""core issues which undermined devolution previously"" must be addressed. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said she hoped there would be an assembly up and running at the beginning of the year. She added that all politicians had to take responsibility for the lack of devolution. Arlene Foster was first minister before the assembly collapsed Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said the Stormont talks process was at a ""crucial and pivotal moment"". She said the talks needed to be about resolution and delivery, but that Sinn FÃ©in had also asked for a ""big cash injection"" for public services. She did not say how much exactly the party had asked for, or what the government's response was. She also said her party would not be drawn into publicly discussing negotiating red lines - but would enter into the talks with goodwill. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter One by one the parties emerged optimistic from talks, claiming a deal is possible. The general election results have changed the mood, and Julian Smith maintains if power sharing is not restored by 13 January, a fresh assembly election will be called. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are unlikely to relish that prospect, and seem to be softening their respective negotiating stances. Alliance and the SDLP say they do not fear another election while the Ulster Unionists wants direct rule, if a deal isn't reached soon. The five parties will hold a roundtable meeting with the British and Irish governments on Wednesday, but so far it seems unlikely that a pre-Christmas compromise is on the cards. During a phone call on Friday evening, Mr Johnson and Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said they would work closely with the Northern Ireland parties to help bring back devolution. What is the Withdrawal Agreement? The prime minister made clear in the phone call his top priority was the restoration of a functioning executive as soon as possible.

'Opportunity lost' as longest climate talks endExhausted delegates reach agreement on the key question of ambition with tricky issues postponed.Science & Environment,"Some of the difficult issues proved impossible to resolve in Madrid The longest United Nations climate talks on record have finally ended in Madrid with a compromise deal. Exhausted delegates reached agreement on the key question of increasing the global response to curbing carbon. All countries will need to put new climate pledges on the table by the time of the next major conference in Glasgow next year. Divisions over other questions - including carbon markets - were delayed until the next gathering. After two extra days and nights of negotiations, delegates finally agreed a deal that will see new, improved carbon cutting plans on the table by the time of the Glasgow conference next year. Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' Methane pulse detected from South Sudan wetlands Reaction to the deal All parties will need to address the gap between what the science says is necessary to avoid dangerous climate change, and the current state of play which would see the world go past this threshold in the 2030s. Supported by the European Union and small island states, the push for higher ambition was opposed by a range of countries including the US, Brazil, India and China. However a compromise was agreed with the richer nations having to show that they have kept their promises on climate change in the years before 2020. Next year's big climate conference will be held in Glasgow, Scotland - and that heaps enormous pressure on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He's already been warned by environmentalists that he will be ""humiliated"" if he tries to lead other nations whilst the UK is still failing to meet its own medium-term climate targets. The UK's climate advisers warn that tens of millions of homes must be insulated. Other experts say Mr Johnson's Â£28.8bn road-building plans are not compatible with eliminating CO2 emissions. They say even fully electric cars won't solve the problem completely - and urge the government to help people walk and cycle to benefit their health and the environment. They also say expanding aviation will increase emissions. Mr Johnson's Brexit decisions will play a part too. The US won't discuss climate change in any trade deal. Meanwhile the EU is putting a border tax on countries that don't cut greenhouse gases. It will be impossible to please both. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was disappointed by the result. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,"" he said, quoted by AFP. 'Another year of failure' Meanwhile, Laurence Tubiana from the European Climate Foundation, and an architect of the Paris agreement, described the result as ""really a mixed bag, and a far cry from what science tells us is needed."" ""Major players who needed to deliver in Madrid did not live up to expectations, but thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries, we obtained the best possible outcome, against the will of big polluters."" Decisions on other issues including the thorny question of carbon markets have been delayed until Glasgow. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA This aspect of the deal was welcomed by campaigners. ""Thankfully the weak rules on a market based mechanism, promoted by Brazil and Australia, that would have undermined efforts to reduce emissions has been shelved and the fight on that can continue next year at COP26 in Glasgow,"" said Mohamed Adow, with the group Power Shift Africa. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Many of those in attendance were unhappy with the overall package, feeling it did not reflect the urgency of the science. Spain's acting Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera said the mandate was clear. ""Countries have to present more ambitious NDCs [nationally determined contributions] in 2020 than what we have today because it is important to address science and the demands of people, as well as commit ourselves to do more and faster."" However, negotiators will be satisfied to have kept the process alive after these difficult and complex talks in Madrid. The world is now nearly one degree Celsius warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The 20 warmest years on record have all occurred in the past 22 years,external, with the years from 2015-2018 making up the top four. The WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise by 3-5C by the end of this century. A threshold of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policy makers have argued thatkeeping temperature rise to within 1.5C is a safer limit for the world. But an IPCC report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target wouldrequire ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". There are varying degrees of uncertainty about the scale of potential impacts. But the changes could drive freshwater shortages, bring sweeping changes to our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms, heat waves and droughts. Even if we cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically now, scientists say the effects will continue because parts of the climate system, particularly large bodies of water and ice, can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. It also takes greenhouse gases decades to be removed from the atmosphere.

A constituency that changed its mindWill UK provide light bulb moment for US Democrats?What's it like to lose your seat as an MP?Who will be Labour's next leader?,"Once, you would have got long odds on the first Conservative election win coming from Blyth Valley in Northumberland. As a former mining community, it hardly seemed natural Tory territory. But mental health care assistant Ian Levy overcame a Labour majority of almost 8,000 to secure it. In his victory speech, he pledged to bring investment and change to the community as soon as he arrived in Westminster. So what do Mr Levy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson need to deliver to ensure that promise to the people of Blyth Valley means something? Unemployment in Blyth Valley is above the national average. That is typical of many communities in the North East that are still wrestling with the impact of industrial decline. It's a community proud of its mining heritage, but the days when coal was king are slipping into memory.The town council says that in 1961,externalBlyth was one of the busiest ports in England, shipping more than six million tonnes of coal. But ""the late 1960s had seen a rapid decline in the traditionally male-dominated heavy industries"".  Â£520.40average weekly wage, compared to Â£587 for whole of the UK 4.9%Northumberland's unemployment rate. Great Britain's is 4.1% 1 in 5work in manufacturing, compared to fewer than 1 in 10 in GB Â£145,000average Blyth house price. It's Â£235,000 in England/Wales. Instead its seafront now faces a cluster of offshore wind turbines, and it has ambitions to service a new generation of turbines in the North Sea. Its port also remains an important employer, and manufacturing a significant part of the economy. And some new industries are moving in. Sir Paul McCartney's former wife Heather Mills is planning to build a vegan food factory there. But like many communities of its size, Blyth has a struggling town centre â though it is in the running for money from the government's Future High Street Fund. Perhaps the new MP and Mr Johnson will need to deliver more jobs - and better paid ones - to ensure local people have money to spend there. At the moment many of the constituents commute into Tyneside for work and leisure. And Brexit could pose a challenge. Economic studies suggest the exporting North East economy has most to lose from leaving the European Union in terms of lower economic growth. The constituency did vote for Brexit though, with more than 6 in 10 backing leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum. How the Blyth Valley vote divided up Blyth lost its railway station in 1964 in the Beeching cuts. Trains still pass through the town, but they are only carrying freight at the moment. Voters, then, might have been attracted by the Conservative election pledge to look at reversing some of those 1960s cuts. The Tories have promised a Â£500m Beeching reversal fund, and have mentioned the return of passenger services to Blyth as one of the projects which could win support from that fund. But the estimated cost of Â£99m to return services to the Ashington, Blyth and Tyne line has yet to be committed. That leaves many locals relying on buses, so they will also want to see the prime minister deliver on promised investment into the network. The local health trust that covers the constituency outperforms much of England, though in the most recent figures it still missed A&E and cancer targets. It performed well though when it came to meeting mental health targets. The Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has been rated as ""outstanding"" by the Care Quality Commission. And this is one community where Boris Johnson might not have to deliver a new hospital. A new purpose-built emergency care hospital opened in Cramlington in the constituency in 2015. It was the first of its kind, and has been seen as a model of how hospitals should operate. Although the constituency as a whole is about average for life expectancy, it has an above average number of over-65s - an ageing population that will want to see the government come up with a solution to social care funding. Check your local NHS performance with our tracker The North East of England has some of the best performing primary schools, but some of the worst performing secondary schools. But actually Blyth Valley has a better educational record than much of the region. Although achievement was slightly below average at primary level, secondary standards are above average. It is one of the few parts of the country where at least some students are in a three-tier schooling system, with First, Middle and High Schools. You can bet the schools though will want to see more funding delivered by the prime minister and their new MP. The local further education college will also hope Mr Johnson makes good on promises to put money into a sector which suffered a funding squeeze under David Cameron and Theresa May. Northumbria Police has suffered some of the worst funding cuts - in fact itschief constable described them as the worst in the country in 2018,external. The force has lost more than 1,000 officers since 2010 and had to dip into its financial reserves to avoid deeper cuts. Part of the problem was a narrow base for council tax - meaning cuts from central government were not replaced by local funds. Mr Johnson has already committed to increasing the number of police. The Home Office expect 185 extra officers to be recruited in the Northumbria force area by 2021, but that does not replace all those that have been lost. The prime minister and new MP will be under pressure to show they will go further in a community which is in the top 10% of the country when it comes to crime. Immigration into the area is negligible. Figures aren't available purely for Blyth Valley, but from mid 2016-2017, it is estimated that the short-term international migration flow to the entire Northumberland region was made up of just 47 people. Given the county's population is over 300,000, this is not a community struggling to cope with the weight of inward migration. Blyth Valley is also an overwhelmingly white constituency.  60.5%voted for Brexit, compared with the UK average of 51.9% 97.7%were born in the UK compared to 87.3% average (2011 census) 42%are aged 50+, compared with 37% of the UK population 5% of live birthsin 2018 were to non-UK mothers. England's average is 29.1% That does not mean voters are not concerned about immigration into the UK more widely. But in a region with skill shortages, some employers will be keen to retain access to workers from overseas â and the PM will have to balance those two competing demands.

""We had a re-count where the results changed twice, but I conceded on the third re-count, congratulated my opponent and went home.

General election 2019: Animated tour in 10 stops,"Scroll to take a guided tour of the UK's results to find out how Boris Johnson gained the largest Conservative majority since the 1980s, while Labour took its lowest number of seats since 1935. (1/10)The Conservatives won 365 seats, giving Boris Johnson a majority of 80. Their 44% share of the vote was the highest since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. So how did this happen? (2/10)Right at the beginning of the night it was clear something unusual had happened. The third seat to declare,Blyth Valley, had been Labour for nearly 70 years and was predicted to stay that way. Labour lost here by 712 votes. (3/10)This story was repeated again and again, as Labour's ""Red Wall"" in the North crumbled. Labour's vote share reduced by 13% in the North East and 10% in Yorkshire & Humber. Many of these seats voted strongly to leave the EU. (4/10)Many northern Conservative wins were due more to a reduced Labour vote than a large boost for the Tories. However, inWakefield, which had been Labour since 1932, the Tories won a majority of over 3,000. (5/10)By around 02:00 GMT the Conservatives started to win seats in Wales, taking six from Labour in total. Plaid Cymru held on to their four seats, but a Remain pact with the Greens and Liberal Democrats failed to create a breakthrough. (6/10)The Liberal Democrats had hoped to win back seats in the South West that they lost to the Tories in 2015.

Labour leadership takes blame over election result,"This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""This is on me. I own this disaster"" Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have apologised over Labour's ""catastrophic"" defeat in Thursday's election, which saw them lose 59 seats. Mr Corbynsaid he was ""sorry that we came up short"",,externalwhile Mr McDonnell told the BBC he ""owns this disaster"". The leader and shadow chancellor said they would step down in the new year. The race for their replacements has already begun, with Wigan MP Lisa Nandy saying for the first time she was ""seriously thinking about"" running. Labour Party officials have suggested that Jeremy Corbyn's successor will be in place by the end of March. Jennie Formby, the party's general secretary, has written to the National Executive Committee recommending the contest starts on January 7. Labour suffered its worst election result since 1935 on Thursday and saw its vote share fall by eight points. The Conservatives won a Commons majority of 80 - the party's biggest election win for 30 years - sweeping aside Labour in its traditional heartlands. LIVE: Latest reaction to Tory election win Let the Labour leadership battle commence Does Labour need a new direction after Corbyn? Who will be Labour's next leader? Mr Corbyn apologised to Labour supporters in two articles in the Sunday papers, calling it a ""body blow for everyone who so desperately needs real change in our country"". Writing an open letter in the Sunday Mirror, he said he took his ""responsibility"" for the result, but insisted he remained ""proud"" of the party's campaign. Hedoubled down in the Observer,,externalsaying his own election campaign had successfully re-set the terms of debate and his manifesto would be seen as ""historically important"". Mr Corbyn penned two articles in the Sunday papers But Mr McDonnell has argued ""it's on me"" as he apologised for the performance, on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The shadow chancellor said he was sorry for ""not being able to articulate"" the party's campaign message ahead of the poll. However, he also blamed the ""media portrayal"" of Mr Corbyn, saying ""of course the system will throw the kitchen sink at you"" if you challenge it. SCROLL AND SEE:The results that sealed it,external ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW:The night's key points MAPS AND CHARTS:The election in graphics,external BREXIT:What happens now? WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external Former Labour MP Caroline Flint - who lost her seat on Thursday - placed much of the blame at the leadership's door. She also criticised the party's position on Brexit for leaving some voters behind, telling Sky's Sophy Ridge that ""ardent Remainers"", such as shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, ""contributed to sacrificing"" seats. Caroline Flint is a longstanding critic of Jeremy Corbyn She accused Ms Thornberry of telling one of her colleagues from a Brexit-backing area: ""I'm glad my constituents aren't as stupid as yours."" Ms Thornberry said the accusation was ""a total and utter lie"".  She added: I have never said this to anyone, nor anything like it, and I hope needless to say, it is not something I would ever think."" She has now instructed solicitors over Ms Flint's comments. Ms Flint added: ""I don't believe anybody who have been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is credible to be leader. I don't think they can win back these seats."" Instead, she said Ms Nandy and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey were ""worth looking at"". This video can not be played Lisa Nandy ""seriously thinking"" about Labour leadership bid Ms Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr she was considering a leadership bid after the ""most shattering"" defeat for Labour. ""In towns like mine, the earth was quaking as the entire Labour base crumble beneath our feet,"" she added. Ms Nandy made a number of proposals - including moving the party's headquarters out of London - to help ""rebuild that coalition"" between ""the Lewishams and the Leighs"", and to regain a Labour Party that ""speaks for both"". A number of other candidates are expected to join the race, including Salford and Eccles MP Ms Long-Bailey and Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips. Ms Phillipswrote in the Observer an appeal to people,externalto join Labour to change it, arguing too many working-class people do not believe the party is better than the Tories. Jess Phillips (l) and Rebecca Long-Bailey (r) could throw their hats in the ring to be the next Labour leader Asked about the contenders, Mr McDonnell said he would ""prefer others"" to Ms Phillips, naming Ms Long-Bailey, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner and shadow women's and equalities minister Dawn Butler as possibilities. He said Ms Phillips was ""really talented"", but added: ""I want someone who actually has been really solidly involved in the development of existing policy - that's why Becky and Angie and Dawn and others have been so good."" Mr McDonnell said it ""should be a woman leader next"" and was ""most probably time for a non-metropolitan"" leader, adding: ""I think it is time for a non-London MP, we need a northern voice as much as possible."" Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon also backed Ms Long-Bailey and said he was considering running to be her deputy. ""Colleagues have approached me about that,"" he told Sky. Analysis by John Pienaar, BBC deputy political editor Brave infantrymen in the muddy trenches of the Great War would hurl themselves onto the barbed wire to allow their comrades to march over their backs and advance towards the guns of the enemy. Can you imagine doing that? No, me neither. It's maybe no easier to see why there's already a line of Labour politicians preparing to join the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson's 80-strong House of Commons majority by any normal standard could be big enough to repel Labour's next advance in five years. It's reasonable to imagine that another leader could come and go before Labour recaptures the territory it has lost, assuming it ever does. Whoever wins the coming leadership contest will first have to triumph in the struggle to map Labour's course through the field of battle; to decide how deep a shade of red the party's battle flag should be (just to torture the metaphor a little more). Read more from John here. Meanwhile, the Conservatives are preparing for the first week of their new government. Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, told Andrew Marr it was their ""intention"" to bring back Boris Johnson's Brexit bill to Parliament ""before Christmas"" - although he would not confirm the date. ""As soon as possible would be perfect,"" he said. ""But obviously those conversations are happening between the relevant parties and the House authorities as we speak."" MPs will return to Westminster on Tuesday and begin the process of swearing in, before the Queen formally opens Parliament on Thursday. Mr Johnson's Queen's Speech will include a commitment by the party to put its NHS spending plan into law as a symbol of commitment to the health service. Downing Street has confirmed there will be a review of Whitehall departments - and the Sunday papers report that the prime minister will work over Christmas on plans to merge and split different government offices. The Sunday Telegraph says the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings is preparingan overhaul of the civil service,externalto ensure it delivers on Mr Johnson's agenda. But Mr Gove said the government would not grant Scotland another referendum on independence, despite the success of the SNP in Thursday's election. The party, which campaigns for an independent Scotland, won 48 seats - up from 35 - and its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said she had ""earned the right to pursue the plan"" for another vote. Ms Sturgeon, who is also First Minister of Scotland, said: ""They will rage against reality for as long as they can but Scotland has chosen a very different kind of future than most of the rest of the UK, and they can't stand in the way of the will of the Scottish people. ""Fundamentally democracy has to be offered and respected."" Meanwhile, the Sunday Times claims up to a third of cabinet ministersface the sack in February,external, Whitehall departments could be abolished and civil servants replaced by external experts. It's also been confirmed that the government has ordered a review to consider decriminalising non-payment of the BBC licence fee - which costs Â£154.50 annually. The earliest the State Opening of Parliament could be is Monday Tuesday Proceedings begin when MPs gather for their first duty: to elect the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who replaced John Bercow in November. Technically, MPs can hold a vote on this motion but this has never happened in practice. Later in the day, the Speaker will begin the process of swearing in MPs, who are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process. Thursday This is the earliest possible day for Parliament's State Opening. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which takes days. Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. This may be interrupted for a second reading debate on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. MPs previously backed Boris Johnson's bill at its first stage butrejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three daysin order to leave the EU by the previous 31 October Brexit deadline. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated.
