"UK pulling out of EU sat-nav projectBritain will no longer seek access to the EU's answer to GPS for defence, after a row with Brussels.UK","Mr Gyimah said he would be voting against Mrs May's Brexit deal A minister has resigned saying a row over involvement in the EU's Galileo satellite-navigation system shows the UK will be ""hammered"" in negotiations over a Brexit deal. Science and universities minister Sam Gyimah quit after Mrs May said the UK was pulling out of Galileo. The UK wanted to stay part of it but the EU said it would be banned from extra-secure elements of the project. Mr Gyimah said it was a foretaste of the ""brutal negotiations"" to come. He's the 10th member of government to resign over the agreement, which he dismissed as a ""deal in name only"". He said he intended to vote against the deal negotiated with Brussels, and called for another referendum. The UK's interests ""will be repeatedly and permanently hammered by the EU27 for many years to come"", Mr Gyimah said in aFacebook post setting out his reasons for resigning,external. However, prominent Brexiteer and cabinet minister Michael Gove has defended Mrs May's plan,writing in the Daily Mail that leaving the EU is under ""great threat"" if the deal is rejected by MPs,external. Japan's prime minister told Mrs May to avoid a no-deal Brexit Meanwhile, Mrs May is in Argentina, where she met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for talks on the fringes of the G20 summit on Saturday. He asked her to avoid a no-deal Brexit -  major Japanese companies such as Nissan and Honda are concerned about the possible impact on their supply chains across Europe. She told him she was confident Japanese businesses in the UK would continue to trade well with the EU. Mrs May also held talks with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Galileo is the EU's upcoming version of the US's GPS, which is used by millions of people around the world, and will be used by EU governments, citizens, military and industry. Brussels has said that, as a result of Brexit, the UK will not be allowed immediate access to part of the system intended for use by government agencies, the armed forces and emergency responders once it comes online in 2020. But the UK, which has invested â¬1.4bn (Â£1.24bn) in the project, says access is vital to its military and security interests. Brexit: A really simple guide What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? A dilemma for the People's Vote campaign Mr Gyimah told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""What has happened with Galileo is a foretaste of the brutal negotiations we will go through that will weaken our national interests, make us poorer and less secure."" Mrs May has now said the British army will not use Galileo and the UK will instead explore options to build its own satellite-navigation system -having already set aside Â£92mto look at how it can be done. ""I cannot let our armed services depend on a system we cannot be sure of,"" Mrs May said. ""That would not be in our national interest."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor As Theresa May was sitting down to at a glittering evening with her fellow world leaders at the G20, news broke that Sam Gyimah had just become the latest minister to quit over Brexit. He had a specific reason to leave. But it is his overall verdict on Mrs May's Brexit compromise that will really hurt. There is some comfort overnight for Mrs May from Michael Gove, who as one of the leading voices in the Leave campaign is, belatedly perhaps, urging his Brexiteer colleagues to get onboard. But this latest resignation is another sign of how hard it will be for the prime minister to pass the vote that could define her future. Read more from Laura here Mr Gyimah, who voted for Remain in the referendum, said it was the right decision for Mrs May to leave the Galileo project, saying the negotiations had been ""stacked against us from the very beginning"". The MP for East Surrey said that, as minister with the responsibility for space technology, he had seen ""the EU stack the deck against us time and time again"". The European Union has put together Galileo as its own network of satellites He told Today: ""Looking at the deal in detail, we don't actually have a deal. We have a deal in name only. ""We have given up our voice, our veto and our vote. Our interests will be hammered because we will have no leverage."" He urged Mrs May not to rule out another referendum if she loses the 11 December vote. ""If Parliament was in deadlock, Theresa May could get herself out of that deadlock by backing a second referendum,"" he said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was ""another very dangerous moment"" for the prime minister - as she is not just losing another vote, but also because others may share his concerns and choose to quit too. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said he was ""very sad"" to see Mr Gyimah leave the government and that he had been ""a very good minister"". ""All of my colleagues are going to have to make their own judgment about what they think about this deal,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said that Mrs May's deal should not be compared with an idealised version of Brexit. Former Tory cabinet minister and campaigner for a second referendum Justine Greening said Mr Gyimah was a ""highly respected and capable minister"" and praised him for not ruling out another vote. And the Lib Dem's education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said Mr Gyimah had ""seen at close quarters the devastating effect this botched Brexit will have on these important sectors"" and that his exit showed the government was ""falling apart"". Matt Waddup, of the University and College Union, said his resignation showed there were clear concerns about the impact of Brexit on research and innovation and higher and further education. ""Those concerns are shared by our members in colleges and universities who have clearly signalled that they want a referendum on any final deal,"" he added. Galileo satellites are now launching on Europe's premier rocket, the Ariane 5 Many people's sat-navs and mobile location services currently run on a US military-based system called GPS - global positioning system - which uses satellites to pinpoint our locations. China and Russia also have satellite-navigation positioning systems. In 1999, the European Union embarked on a plan to put together its own network of satellites, called Galileo, so it was not reliant on the US, Russian and Chinese systems. The first satellites were put into orbit in 2013 and it is planned to be fully operational in 2020 with 30 satellites orbiting earth. UK companies have built components for Galileo and one of the project's two Galileo Security Monitoring Centres was based in the UK, in Swanwick. The site is now being relocated to Spain. The government said there should be no noticeable impact for the public from withdrawing from the project, as devices that already use Galileo, such as smartphones, will carry on doing so. It says UK industry has earned about â¬1.15bn (Â£1.02bn) from the project but, when the BBC asked if any more money would be given back, a spokesman said the project was ""part of the withdrawal agreement"" and the UK had reached ""a fair financial settlement with the EU"".

"Microsoft beats Apple for biggest market capMicrosoft has reclaimed the title of world's most valuable company, overtaking Apple.Business","Bill Gates founded Microsoft. The firm's fortunes have rebounded in recent years Microsoft has unseated Apple to rank as the world's most valuable listed company, reclaiming the number one spot after more than 15 years. The software giant ended Friday with a market value of more than $851bn (Â£668bn) compared with Apple's $847bn. The two firms have been vying for top place all week, with Apple remaining ahead at the end of each trading day. But the iPhone maker, which has seen its share price plunge in recent weeks, finally lost its lead. On Friday, Microsoft shares gained more than 0.6% to close at $110.89, while Apple shares finished at $178.60, down about 0.5%. Apple's shares have fallen almost 25% since October - more steeply than the market overall - amid concerns about slowing smart phone demand and the possibility of additional US tariffs on Chinese-made goods. The sell-off has erased more than $200bn from the firm's market value, which is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of traded shares cited in the firms' most recent quarterly reports. Four reasons that Apple shares have been falling Why tech is taking a hammering By many measures - including annual revenue and profit - Apple remains the bigger company. For now, however, investors are betting that Microsoft's prospects are brighter. The firm's cloud services unit, which sells to other businesses, has driven the firm's growth in recent years. Apple, by contrast, depends on consumer spending, which investors are worried could slow. Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said Microsoft is poised for significant growth, as more companies sign up for the firm's cloud products. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella is well-positioned to ""further transform [Microsoft] into a cloud behemoth over the coming years,"" he wrote in a research note. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has focused on cloud services Microsoft flourished in the 1990s and ranked as the world's most valuable company in the early 2000s. But the firm took a hit after a landmark anti-trust case and fell farther out of favour as mobile phones emerged to challenge desktop computers. In 2010,Apple overtook Microsoft as the most valuable technology firm. The iPhone maker unseated Exxon Mobil for the overall number one spot for the first time in 2011, and has held the title largely uninterrupted since. It became the first trillion dollar company in the US this summer, but lost that distinction this autumn as its share price started to plunge. What's gone wrong for Apple?

May not ruling out second MPs' Brexit vote,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""It's our duty to deliver Brexit for the British people"" Theresa May has refused to rule out another Commons vote on her Brexit deal if MPs reject it the first time. The PM said she thought she could win the vote on 11 December despite dozens of Tory MPs being against the deal. In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, she urged MPs to ""deliver on the vote of the referendum"". EU Council President Donald Tusk warned if MPs rejected the deal, the UK would face a choice between leaving without a deal or not leaving at all. Under Commons rules, the prime minister is not meant to ask MPs the same question twice - she would have to change the contents of her deal. Alternatively, if enough MPs indicate they have changed their minds after voting the deal down, it could be held again, but it would be up to the Speaker to decide whether to allow that. Brexit: A really simple guide A dilemma for the People's Vote campaign Labour gets behind bid to stop 'no-deal' What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Pressed by Laura Kuenssberg on whether she would attempt to hold another vote, Mrs May - who is in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for a G20 summit of world leaders - said: ""I'm focused on the vote that is taking place on 11 December and I want everybody who's going to participate, all members of Parliament, to focus on what this vote does."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he did not now expect any Labour MPs to vote for Mrs May's deal, telling Talk Radio he thinks the party will ""hold together"". The Labour leadership has said it is ready to support a cross-party amendment to the vote that would explicitly rule out a no-deal. The amendment would not be binding but it would be hard for the PM to ignore it, if it is passed by Parliament. European Council President Donald Tusk, meanwhile, has stressed that the deal the EU struck with Theresa May was the ""only possible one"". He said: ""If this deal is rejected in the Commons, we are left with, as was stressed a few weeks ago from Prime Minister May, an alternative - no deal or no Brexit at all."" But a senior UK official said: ""Right from the very outset, Donald Tusk has not hidden the fact that he finds (Brexit) a moment of sadness for himself and for the EU. ""But the prime minister has always been very clear to President Tusk that we are leaving on 29 March next year."" The BBC's Europe Editor Katya Adler What is the EU up to while a fevered UK Parliament burns with questions and throbs with Brexit conspiracy theories? Well, the EU is watching and waiting. Arms folded. ""It's groundhog day in this negotiation process,"" an EU diplomat told me. ""We (the EU) are again on the outside, watching the UK debate with itself, unsure of what direction to head in. They voted to leave. We've even got an exit deal on the table now but still the UK is undecided."" Read Katya's full blog Margaret Beckett is one of three former foreign secretaries urging another referendum It is widely expected that MPs will reject the EU withdrawal agreement and blueprint for a future trade deal agreed with the EU. In anticipation of this happening, some MPs are trying to mobilise support for the so-called ""Norway Plus"" option, which they claim could win support across the House of Commons. Under their plan,external, the current withdrawal agreement would be honoured but the UK would seek to rejoin the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which it belonged to before entering the European Economic Community in 1973 - on an indefinite basis. Russia-Ukraine crisis clouds G20 summit Nine Tory tribes May needs to convince If Efta's existing members - Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland - agreed, it would allow the UK to retain membership of the customs union and full access to the single market. Advocates of the plan say the UK would still be outside the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy - but it would also mean continued free movement of people. Mrs May said this kind of deal would not fulfil the referendum pledge to take back control of the UK's borders, laws and money. Meanwhile three former Labour foreign secretaries have warned of the damage to British influence around the world if the UK leaves the EU. David Miliband, Jack Straw and Margaret Becketttold the Financial Times,externalthey all backed the People's Vote campaign for another referendum. Although Labour is still committed to keeping all options open, Mr McDonnell said if it came to another referendum, it would be ""difficult to see"" an option to remain not being included on the ballot paper. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the public mood was changing In a speech in Bristol, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox argued that while the deal will not please everyone, critics ""are yet to face up to"" the ""tough choices"" she had to make. He told the BBC the PM was ""changing the public mood"" and while different approaches would give the UK a freer hand to strike other trade deals, they would come with a ""price"" in terms of reduced access to EU markets. The Financial Times says,externalMrs May is enlisting the support of senior Brexiteers such as Michael Gove and Geoffrey Cox to try to sell her controversial Irish ""backstop"" plan to sceptical Tory MPs. Mr Fox said he was not ""enthusiastic"" about the backstop, which could see the UK enter a customs partnership with the EU until its future relationship is sorted out and without the unilateral right to pull out. But he insisted the chance of the backstop, described as an ""insurance policy"" by Mrs May, actually coming into force was slight as it was just as ""unpalatable"" to other EU members, including the Republic of Ireland. And Treasury Minister Liz Truss, who is backing Mrs May to get the agreement through Parliament, suggested parts of it could be renegotiated after the UK left the EU.

Police face down mob of 100 teenagers,"This video can not be played Stanley town centre mob of youths attacks officers Up to 100 teenagers surrounded police in a town centre before a mob attacked officers during an ""appalling"" disturbance. Fireworks and bricks were launched and a community officer was punched in the face in Stanley, County Durham. Police have since launched a text alerts service to inform parents of local disorder, urging them to ""take responsibility"" for their children. It is hoped they will be encouraged to collect teenagers from disturbances. Officers were called out to reports of a ""vulnerable female"" at the bus station in the town on the night of 3 November. They were bombarded by the youths upon arrival, then set upon by about 20 hoodie-wearing youngsters in an attack captured on the officers' body cams. Sgt Dave Clarke said his officers had been forced to use pepper spray after tensions ""escalated"" when some teenagers had objected to being told what to do. ""You had a group of six to 10 boys wanting to show off in front of their friends, and that developed into kicks, karate kicks, punching and people jumping around sparring,"" he said. ""After at least 10 warnings, the officers used the pepper spray."" The police team targeting knife crime Tasers plea after police officer assaults Police injured in attack 'involving 50 youths' Bricks and fireworks were thrown at officers In the wake of the attack, the force launched its Be Informed text alert service, to which parents can opt-in to be told whenever there is disorder in the town. Any parent who believes their child may be in the vicinity can go and collect them, police said. Sgt Emma Kay, from Durham Constabulary, said: ""Parents were asked to come and review the footage from the officers' body cams that night and they all agreed the behaviour of the children was appalling. ""While there is a hardcore group of individuals involved in this incident, there are many more people stood on the sidelines, young people who are going to affect their life chances by continuing to engage in this type of behaviour. ""We are asking for parents to step up to the plate, take responsibility for your children. ""Do you know where they are, or are they going to bring trouble to your door?""

Owl phobia woman wins damages from GP,"A judge ruled Sally Brayshaw was entitled to more than Â£12,700 compensation from Dr Thomas O'Brien A woman who developed a crippling fear of owls after religious grooming by her doctor has won a damages claim. Sally Brayshaw, 54, was taken to religious meetings and told the devil was ""having a real go"" at her by GP Thomas O'Brien. She claimed the locum doctor, a Pentecostal Christian, suggested she was possessed by demons and advised her not to see a psychiatrist. A High Court judge ruled she was entitled to more than Â£12,700. Mrs Brayshaw, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was in pain following an operation when she went to see Dr O'Brien in August 2012. At a previous hearing, her lawyers told the court the GP ""commended to her a way of healing without medication"". Over the next six months Dr O'Brien engaged Mrs Brayshaw in a number of religious activities, taking her to services, giving her religious gifts and setting her television to the Gospel channel to ""soak"" her in religious content. On one occasion, Mrs Brayshaw said she was taken to a meeting where a preacher spoke of sacrificing an owl. The hearing was told Mrs Brayshaw developed a fear of owls after being taken to a meeting where a preacher spoke about sacrificing a bird This left her so terrified of the birds she could no longer look at a picture of one without becoming terrified. Mr Justice Martin Spencer said it was ""foreseeable"" Mrs Brayshaw might ""react adversely"", adding: ""By reason of his zealous promotion of the religious aspects, [Dr O'Brien] became blind to the medical aspects and thereby caused or contributed to the deterioration in the claimant's mental health."" Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Dr O'Brien took no part in the case and his whereabouts are unknown. He was investigated by the General Medical Council (GMC) andstruck off in 2015. The judge rejected Mrs Brayshaw's claim against the partners of Apsley Surgery, in Stoke-on-Trent, where Mr O'Brien worked as a locum.

"Girl, 4, saves mum with 999 call","This video can not be played Kaitlyn Wright, 4, called 999 when her mum was taken ill A four-year-old girl has been praised for her actions in calling for an ambulance when her mum was taken ill. Kaitlyn Wright from Askerswell, Dorset, dialled 999 earlier this month when she was at home with her mother Charlene, who began having a seizure. South Western Ambulance Service (SWAS) said she showed ""wisdom beyond her years"" in talking to the call handler and explaining her mum's condition. Paramedics were dispatched and Mrs Wright recovered. The ambulance service has released a recording of the call in which Kaitlyn is heard saying ""Mummy is having a fit and I need to look after her."" A spokesperson said she ""showed extraordinary bravery, presence of mind and wisdom beyond her years"". Snow leopard shot dead after escaping Father Christmas 'must be a man' Lorry sheds load of beer on slip road Kaitlyn visited the SWAS's 999 control centre near Bristol earlier when she was formally commended for her actions. Mrs Wright described her daughter as her ""little guardian angel"". ""I just remember Kaitlyn's dad bringing her back to the house and asking if I needed shopping and he went off. The next thing I know the paramedic is looking at me. ""I have regular seizures so all three children know exactly what to do, we've been very thorough with it."" Kaitlyn's father, Simon Wright, said: ""Just teaching her to press the three little buttons, and the green one, and asking for help - it's saved Charlene's life and if she hadn't done that we might not be sitting here today. It's amazing."" Mrs Wright added: ""My first thought was, 'I'm safe with all three of my children'. It's probably one of the best feelings in the world. ""It's quite scary when you're not well, and you're vulnerable, but I know she can save my life. ""She saved me, basically, because anything could have happened while no-one was there."" Jess Hodkinson, who answered the 999 call, said she was ""impressed"" with Kaitlyn. ""I was quite surprised because she had such a tiny voice, so I knew it was a young child but she was really brave, she answered my questions clearly and with confidence and she knew exactly what to do in an emergency.""

Madrid bans old cars to cut pollution,"The measures in Spain's capital prioritise cyclists and pedestrians ahead of motorists Spanish authorities have introduced new driving restrictions in the centre of the country's capital, Madrid, aimed at reducing air pollution by up to 40%. The tough measures mean motorists will have to test their vehicles' emissions, with the oldest and most polluting vehicles banned from the city centre. Drivers entering the controlled zone in breach of the rules will ultimately have to pay a fine of â¬90 (Â£80). The move is also to help reduce noise and encourage more cycling in the city. Madrid City Council estimates that the project, which was launched on Friday and labelled Madrid Central, will affect about 20% of the cars that enter the city centre. The new rules imposed on Madrid's busy city centre form part of a plan by Spanish authorities to create a cleaner environment by prioritising cyclists, pedestrians, and the use of public transport. Restrictions for those entering the designated low emission zone vary depending on the type of vehicle and its ""label"", which is issued following emissions tests. For example, hybrid cars with an ""eco label"" are permitted to drive freely in the centre and use public or designated car parks with no time restrictions. Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? Air pollution: Half a million early deaths in Europe However, diesel vehicles produced prior to 2006 and petrol vehicles prior to 2000 will not receive a label and can only enter the zone if they are registered in advance and have access to private parking. From 2020, these vehicles will not be permitted to enter the emissions zone. Meanwhile, residents who live within the controlled zone can drive freely at any time once registered, but can only park on their own street. The Madrid Central area, which is marked with red lines on road surfaces and signs displaying red circles at the point of entry, is being policed with surveillance cameras. Motorists pass red road markings and a sign that reads: ""Madrid Central"" Concerns about the impact of exhaust pollutants emitted from older vehicles and diesel engines have risen in recent years. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that millions of deaths around the world every year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution. Diesel engines contribute to the problem in two key ways - through the production of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Very fine soot PM can penetrate the lungs and can contribute to cardiovascular illness and death. Back in 2016, the mayor of Madrid, Manuela Carmena, said the issue needed to be addressed urgently in order to improve the health of ""our children, our grandparents and our neighbours"". Madrid is not the only capital city to focus on improving its air quality. Paris, Mexico City and Athens have all pledged to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025. Measures implemented by other cities include: Paris Banning cars built prior to 1997 from entering the city centre during weekdays between 08:00 and 20:00 An additional ban on all diesel vehicles registered before 2001 A strategy to phase out older vehicles and remove all diesels from the centre, while offering generous subsidies for other forms of transport Plan to pedestrianise the city centre Stockholm Introduced a congestion charge for vehicles entering the centre Set up a park-and-ride bus service to encourage drivers to leave their vehicles on the outskirts Adopted an Urban Mobility Strategy initiative, investing in public transport systems buses, trams and the subway London Introduced a congestion charge for many vehicles entering the city centre Established a 24-hour low emission zone targeting diesel vehicles throughout the Greater London area To introduce an ""ultra-low emission zone"" promoting tighter exhaust emission standards in the city centre from April 2019 Set up ""Cycle Superhighways"" to make it safer to cycle throughout the city How can cities tackle air pollution? Paris mayor plans to pedestrianise city centre Things Indians do to beat pollution Reality Check: Do clean air zones work?

Largest Alaskan city rocked by big quake,"This video can not be played 7.0 magnitude earthquake strikes Alaska A major 7.0 magnitude earthquake has struck Alaska, causing people to run from buildings and briefly prompting a tsunami alert for coastal areas. The quake was centred about seven miles (11km) north of Anchorage, the largest city in the state, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). A series of aftershocks was recorded following the initial shock, which had a depth of 40.9km, the USGS said. Around 300,000 people live in Anchorage with 100,000 in the surrounding area. The earthquake was reported at 08.29 local time (17.29 GMT), the USGS added. One of the more powerful aftershocks that followed minutes later had a magnitude of 5.7. So far, officials have registered 40 aftershocks: 10 with magnitudes above 4.0 and three with magnitudes above 5.0, the Alaska Earthquake Center reported. ""The aftershocks are nerve-wracking, but we want to stress that they are what we would expect for an earthquake like this,"" the centre said in a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

Hotel data hack hits 500 million guests,"Sheraton is one of Marriott's brands The records of 500 million customers of the hotel group Marriott International have been involved in a data breach. The hotel chain said the guest reservation database of its Starwood division had been compromised by an unauthorised party. It said an internal investigation found an attacker had been able to access the Starwood network since 2014. The company said it would notify customers whose records were in the database. Marriott International bought Starwood in 2016, creating the largest hotel chain in the world with more than 5,800 properties. Starwood's hotel brands include W Hotels, Sheraton, Le MÃ©ridien and Four Points by Sheraton. Marriott-branded hotels use a separate reservation system on a different network. Marriott said it was alerted by an internal security tool that somebody was attempting to access the Starwood database. After investigating, it discovered that an ""unauthorised party had copied and encrypted information"". It said it believed its database contained records of up to 500 million customers. For about 327 million guests, the information included ""some combination"" of: name address phone number email address passport number account information date of birth gender arrival and departure information It said some records also included encrypted payment card information, but it could not rule out the possibility that the encryption keys had also been stolen. ""We deeply regret this incident happened,"" the company said in a statement. ""Marriott reported this incident to law enforcement and continues to support their investigation.  The company has already begun notifying regulatory authorities."" The company has set up awebsite,externalto give affected customers more information. It will also offer customers in the US and some other countries a year-long subscription to a fraud-detecting service. In a statement, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office said: ""We have received a data breach report from Marriott involving its Starwood Hotels and will be making enquiries. If anyone has concerns about how their data has been handled they can report these concerns to us."" The Marriott group said it would contact affected customers whose email addresses were in the Starwood reservation database. The database contained details of reservations made on or before 10 September 2018. The company has set up a dedicatedhelp website,externalfor those affected and is also operating a free helpline. For UK customers the number is 0808 189 1065. Marriott is not certain whether the attackers were able to obtain payment information, so be aware of any suspicious transactions on your account. Also be aware that scammers may be sending out mass emails pretending to represent the Marriott group. The company says it will not include attachments in its notification emails and will not ask for personal information over email. If in doubt, call the helpline. The company is offering affected customers a year-long subscription to a fraud-checking service. by Chris Fox, technology reporter It's not the biggest data breach we've ever seen (that dubious honour goes to Yahoo!) but it's certainly up there with some of the worst. Not only were up to 500 million customer records accessed and potentially copied, but the attackers had had unauthorised access since 2014. And even though payment card information was encrypted, the company thinks the key may have been stolen too. The UK's data regulator has confirmed it is investigating, and so the threat of a whoppingGDPR penaltylooms. Although the Marriott group's headquarters are in the US, it has to comply with the EU's GDPR rules when dealing with citizens in the EU. The way it has disclosed this breach, notified customers and offered fraud-checking services will certainly help its cause. But the ICO and other international regulators may rule the company has been too slow to act. As always with a big data breach, be aware that scammers may send out emails claiming to be from the Marriott group. The hotel chain says it will not send any notification emails with attachments, and will not request any information from its customers by email. Cyber-attack!

Search on hold after car washes up on beach,"Susan and James Kenneavy have not been seen at home or been in contact with family The search has been suspended for a couple whose car was found washed-up on a beach in the south of Scotland amid bad weather. James and Susan Kenneavy's empty Ford Kuga was found by workmen clearing debris on Drummore beach, near Stranraer, at about 07:30 on Thursday. The discovery followed heavy rain and flooding on Drummore coastal road on Wednesday. The search has been halted but should resume on Saturday morning. The air, sea and land search operation will resume on Saturday A police spokesman asked for the public's help to trace the couple and discover the movements of their grey Ford Kuga - registration SJ15UKX. He added that the couple, thought to be in their 70s, had not been seen at home in Drummore and had not been in contact with family. Insp Duncan Cameron told the BBC weather conditions in the area had been ""extremely challenging"", with heavy wind and rain. ""A lot of the roadways around that area had been closed due to concerns about the weather,"" he said. He said the coastguard, lifeboats and mountain rescue teams had been involved in the search which has now been suspended until Saturday morning. ""At the minute our efforts are very much focused on tracing Mr and Mrs Kenneavy,"" he said. ""We are concerned for their well-being given the passage of time since their car was discovered. ""However, all our efforts are focused on tracing them - hopefully safe and well. ""We have got as much resource dedicated to that effort as we possibly can."" Drummore villager Edward Beck, who has known Mr Kenneavy for more than 30 years, described his friend as a ""diamond"". ""No matter what he was going through he would always smile and laugh - very witty and full of humour,"" he said. ""A really nice little fellow. I love him to bits, he is just great."" He said he believed the couple were originally from the East Kilbride area but had lived in Dumfries and Galloway for decades. A search into the night on Thursday failed to find any trace of Mr and Mrs Kenneavy Mr Beck told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programmethat local people had been aware of weather warnings from the Met Office and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. He also described how conditions along the coastal route could be extremely treacherous and said large storm waves could affect the main road into the village. He added: ""You can be driving through three, four feet of water and a lot of cars can suck water into the engine and you can get stranded. That part [of the road] actually looks like it's in the sea if you hit it at the right time."" A spokesman for HM Coastguard said they had been contacted by police just after 15:30 on Thursday requesting assistance in the search for the couple. He added: ""The HM Coastguard Search and Rescue Helicopter based at Prestwick, Drummore, Stranraer and Portpatrick coastguard rescue teams and lifeboats from Stranraer and Portpatrick were all sent to assist.""

Trump defends Russia business links,"Donald Trump is currently in Argentina for the G20 summit Donald Trump has defended the business dealings he had with Russia before becoming president, again calling current investigations a ""witch hunt"". On Thursday his ex-lawyer admitted lying to Congress about a property deal Mr Trump was planning in Moscow. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump said the deals were ""very legal"", he put up ""zero money"" and abandoned the project. A special counsel is investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election and whether Mr Trump colluded with it. What (else) we've just learnt about Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's pit bull Ukraine 'paid Trump lawyer for talks',external No hard evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Kremlin has so far been produced and the president has continually railed against the investigation. Mr Trump is currently in Argentina for the G20 summit and has called off a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing Moscow's seizure of three Ukrainian ships and their crews. The president was continuing a defence that had begun on Thursday after ex-lawyer Michael Cohen had admitted one count of lying to Congress. Cohen said he had submitted a false written statement about a Trump Organization plan to build a skyscraper in the Russian capital. Allow Twitter content?

Simply put, Cohen admitted that negotiations over the project had continued far deeper into 2016, the election year, than he had told Congress and that his contacts with Mr Trump had been far more extensive. On Friday, Mr Trump tweeted: ""Oh, I get it! I am a very good developer, happily living my life, when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). This video can not be played Donald Trump dismissed Michael Cohen as a ""weak person"" and a liar ""Against all odds, I decide to run for President & continue to run my business - very legal & very cool, talked about it on the campaign trail... Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia. Put up zero money, zero guarantees and didn't do the project. Witch Hunt!"" On Thursday, Mr Trump had called Cohen ""a weak person and not a very smart person"". ""He's got himself a big prison sentence. And he's trying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up this story."" He added: ""He's lying about a project that everybody knew about. I mean, we were very open with it."" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Friday called the collusion investigation the ""Russian witch hunt hoax"", adding: ""Unfortunately, it probably does undermine our relationship with Russia."" Until his latest admission Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for the president, was more of a peripheral figure in the investigation into Russian collusion that is being overseen by special counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Mueller has already brought criminal charges against a series of former Trump aides and associates, including Mr Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Russian individuals and entities. This video can not be played The BBC's Anthony Zurcher analyses Mr Trump's response The main thrust has been whether Russian agents sought to undermine the campaign of Hillary Clinton and whether the Trump team played any part. Cohen's testimony has highlighted the president's business empire and the extent of its Russian links. Mr Trump has continued to insist he had no financial ties to Russia. Mr Trump has now himself provided written testimony to Mr Mueller and it is now sure to be cross-referenced with Cohen's latest admission. Cohen has already pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges, including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington Donald Trump's lawyers say that his written testimony to the Mueller investigation regarding his real estate dealings in Moscow essentially matches up with what Cohen is now telling the special prosecutor's office. If they didn't - or there is concrete evidence any of the president's other sworn written statements are untrue - that could be legal trouble for the president. Exactly what kind of trouble, however, is an open question. Lying to federal investigators is a crime to which several Trump associates have already admitted guilt. There's an ongoing debate, however, about whether a president can be prosecuted for such transgressions while in office. At the very least, if there is evidence that Mr Trump lied under oath, Mr Mueller could present the findings to Congress, which could then use them as grounds for impeachment proceedings.

Rifts laid bare as G20 summit opens,"This video can not be played Putin and the Saudi crown prince ""high five"" in Buenos Aires World leaders have held the opening session of their annual G20 summit, with any number of disputes and disagreements on the table. Host president, Argentina's Mauricio Macri, said the solution was ""dialogue, dialogue and dialogue"" and called for a clear message of shared responsibility. But US President Donald Trump has already cancelled meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. And huge differences remain on climate change, trade and the Khashoggi affair. The G20, made up of 19 of the world's most industrialised nations plus the EU, accounts for 85% of the world's economic output and two-thirds of the world's population. In pictures: World leaders gather Trump's trade war: Stakes are high at G20 Merkel's travel nightmare Its meetings, which began in 2008, are an opportunity for members to develop global policies tackling major issues - but many of the key decisions will be made in one-on-one encounters. There is massive security for the summit in Buenos Aires, with a bank holiday declared for Friday and the city's main business district shut down. Protesters angry at the money spent on the summit while Argentina struggles through tough austerity demonstrated outside the meeting. Analysis by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Meeting world leaders at the G20 summit was a test for Mohammed bin Salman to see who would snub him. He is the only Arab leader in the G20 and already stood out in his traditional dress amid a sea of suits. And at times he looked uncertain, even nervous. Some of his counterparts shared a word or two but few went out of their way to shake his hand. So the optics of the summit, to use the diplomatic jargon, were not that great for MBS. Read on The world leaders were all called on to the stage and assumed their position for the traditional family photograph. The G20 photo ahead of Friday's plenary session Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stood on the outside of the photo, far away from Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This is the crown prince's first major diplomatic test since the murder in Turkey of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a key critic of the government. Saudi Arabia has blamed ""rogue agents"" but suspicion has fallen on the prince for ordering the killing. After the photo was taken, the crown prince did manage a hearty exchange with Mr Putin. French President Emmanuel Macron held a five-minute exchange with the crown prince during which, a French official said, Mr Macron had conveyed ""very firm"" messages over the Khashoggi affair. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Mr Trump had a ""friendly meeting"" with the crown prince, Saudi media said, although the president later said there had been ""no discussion"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May also met the crown prince. A Downing Street spokesman said the PM had ""stressed the importance of ensuring that those responsible for the appalling murder of Jamal Khashoggi are held to account"" and that ""such a deplorable incident"" should not happen again. In addition Mrs May held a 15-minute meeting to discuss trade with Mr Macri. Their two nations have long disputed sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. Mr Macri's opening address to the summit admitted there would be issues of disagreement that needed to be managed. This video can not be played So how does a G20 summit work? He called for consensus on sustainable development, the future of work, food supply, climate change and international trade, adding: ""I am an optimist"". There are certain to be plenty of bilateral, trilateral or even larger get-togethers, although the one that will not be taking place is the highest-profile. Mr Trump said he would not meet Mr Putinbecause three Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors seized by Russia in the Black Sea near Crimea had not been returned. ""We don't like what happened. Nobody does,"" he said on Friday. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow regretted the decision. But he said: ""If this is so, the president will have a couple of extra hours in the programme for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has blamed the crisis ""entirely"" on Russia and said she would raise the issue with Mr Putin. The second-highest profile meeting will also involve Mr Trump. He will have dinner on Saturday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The key issue there will be the nations' trade tariffs dispute. The US has hit a total of $250bn (Â£196bn) of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. China said consensus was increasing on a deal but that differences remained. After earlier indicating pessimism on an agreement, Mr Trump said: ""They want to and we'd like to. There are some good signs. We'll see what happens."" Mr Putin has also weighed in, with a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump's America First policy. The Russian president condemned ""dishonest competition"" along with ""vicious"" sanctions and protectionist measures. The Brics group, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, issued a statement saying protectionism ran counter to the ""spirit and rules of the World Trade Organization"". Ahead of the summit's official startMr Trump signed a trade deal with the Mexican and Canadian leaders. Mr Trump described the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - which replaces the Nafta free trade deal - as ""probably the greatest trade deal ever"". ""All of our countries will benefit greatly,"" he said. European diplomats told Associated Press there has been tough haggling over a final statement. Argentine officials indicated differences on trade could be overcome. However, that will still leave the obstacle of climate change. This video can not be played Why have thousands of demonstrators been marching against the G20 summit in Buenos Aires? Mr Trump has not hidden his objection to collective action on the issue. UN chief Antonio Guterres said in Buenos Aires that ""this is a make-it-or-break-it moment"" on the issue. President Macron was quoted by AFP news agency as saying he would refuse to sign a trade deal with South America's Mercosur bloc if Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro withdrew from the Paris climate accord.

Adler: Will the EU renegotiate?,"This video can not be played Theresa May: I'm focused on the Commons vote What is the EU up to while a fevered UK Parliament burns with questions and throbs with Brexit conspiracy theories? Will the divorce deal agreed between EU leaders and Theresa May pass through the House of Commons on 11 December, or not? Well, the EU has a couple of other preoccupations on its plate. Mere distractions such as the fate of the euro currency, the potential for wider impact of the Eurosceptic Italian government and how to handle fake news. But when it comes to Brexit, the EU is watching and waiting. Arms folded. ""It's groundhog day in this negotiation process,"" an EU diplomat told me. ""We (the EU) are again on the outside, watching the UK debate with itself, unsure of what direction to head in. They voted to leave. We've even got an exit deal on the table now but still the UK is undecided."" EU leaders aren't panicking. They believe either: the divorce deal (officially known as the withdrawal agreement) will pass through the House of Commons the UK will end up opting for a closer relationship with the EU than the one currently envisaged the UK will decide to stay in the EU after all. The sense in the EU is that option 1 is the most likely, even if there have to be two votes in the House of Commons to get the deal passed. A no-deal scenario remains possible, of course, but the EU doesn't think most UK MPs will allow that happen. Even a ""managed"" no deal with bare-bones, time-limited agreements in place with EU countries - to allow planes to keep flying and recognising UK trader or transport licences - would not prevent the high cost and the chaos of no deal. UK voters would be angry and would punish their MPs at the next election so they won't risk it, is the prevailing thinking in Brussels right now. Maybe the EU doesn't understand to what extent UK politics are on a knife-edge. Number crunching: Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal? Nine Tory Brexit tribes May must convince Labour gets behind bid to stop 'no-deal' But this absence of EU angst means, while MPs are all a-fluster, European hearts are hardening as regards offering the UK any more ""sweeteners"" to accept the negotiated divorce deal. France's President Macron has the ear of Jean-Claude Juncker as Theresa May walks past at the G20 summit Conveniently, there's an EU summit just after the 11 December vote in Parliament. If the withdrawal agreement is rejected in the House of Commons, but not by a painfully large number of votes, Theresa May will likely ask EU leaders for ""clarification"" on the Brexit deal - which is political code for some extra help. Read more from Katya:Nineteen months of wrangling - and that's just a taster The EU is prepared to offer her something anodyne - assurance in the form of written declarations that can be added to the deal on difficult issues like the Irish border. The EU could underline, for example, that neither the EU nor UK intends to trigger the much-contested customs partnership outlined in the Irish border guarantee - if another means can be found to protect the border, e.g. a sophisticated EU-UK trade deal. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) It would be even more valuable for Theresa May if EU leaders would undertake not to use the ""threat"" of triggering or prolonging the Irish backstop scenario to exact concessions from the UK in a future trade deal. French President Emmanuel Macron recently set off alarm bells in the UK when he implied that the EU (or more correctly France, which like every other EU country has a veto over a future EU-UK trade deal) could hold the UK ""hostage"" in the backstop unless Downing Street allowed French fishermen to continue fishing in UK waters after Brexit. But Brussels has repeated over and again that it is not prepared to re-open and renegotiate the withdrawal agreement itself. If extra declarations are not sufficient to get the withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons in a second vote or if the first vote results in an overwhelming defeat for the prime minister - what will the EU do then? Considering the game-planning and different case-scenario analyses going on right now in the UK, it may surprise you to know that the EU, in its Brexit meetings with representatives of all 27 EU countries, isn't yet debating this option. May not ruling out second MPs' Brexit vote Laura Kuenssberg: PM gives no clues over possible 'Plan B' What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? If Theresa May needed to freeze the negotiating period with the EU which runs out on 29 March next year, in order to hold a second referendum or even a general election, she (or her successor if it comes to a leadership contest) would have to submit an official request. Of course this has never happened before in EU history, so everyone is navigating the unknowns. Please upgrade your browser But it is thought highly unlikely in EU circles that permission for an Article 50 (negotiating period) freeze or extension would be granted by 27 EU leaders on the spot at their December EU summit. The EU rarely, if ever, does things in a hurry. There would need to be a legal text approved, I'm told. And of course, the vote to freeze or extend needs to be unanimous amongst all the 27. Brexit: All you need to know EU insiders also say they would base their decision around the reasons given by the UK for prolonging the Article 50 process. ""We'll only agree to it, if we believe it will significantly impact the current situation,"" one high-level contact told me. ""We're not going to extend this complicated process that casts a long shadow over wider EU business for any longer than is meaningful."" It's no secret that the EU would love the UK to change its mind and stay in the EU. Any real possibility of that will be welcomed across the Channel but what the EU doesn't want to do is extend this Article 50 period for endless votes in the House of Commons. ""There's also the democratic question,"" another diplomat told me. And this I hear again and again from EU contacts. A slight resentment after years of being accused by many in the UK of a ""democracy deficit"" in Brussels - one of the reasons many voters opted to leave the EU - that now Theresa May might try to resubmit her withdrawal agreement over and again in Parliament until she gets the ""right result"". The EU has been derided for doing this in the past in countries like Denmark over the Maastricht Treaty and Ireland over the Lisbon Treaty. On Friday Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council which represents all EU member countries in Brussels, tried to kybosh UK speculation about the role the EU could play in a change of Brexit direction. He insisted the options on the table were for the UK to accept the negotiated withdrawal agreement or face no deal or no Brexit. As if to head off any UK comment that Brussels would inevitably budge if faced with the real potential of a costly no deal, Mr Tusk added: ""The EU is prepared for every scenario.""

Merkel's travel nightmare,"Chancellor Merkel returned to German soil far earlier than planned, carrying an umbrella in the Cologne rain German Chancellor Angela Merkel missed the opening of the G20 summit in Argentina after her plane was forced to land shortly after leaving Berlin. The plane carrying Mrs Merkel's team turned back while flying over the Netherlands late on Thursday, because of a communications failure. The Airbus made a safe but unscheduled landing in Cologne. Mrs Merkel flew to Madrid on Friday then boarded a scheduled Iberia airlines flight to Buenos Aires. Among her fellow passengers on board the Iberia flight was AgustÃ­n AgÃ¼ero, who tweeted a picture of the chancellor on board. Allow Twitter content?

On Thursday evening the captain of Mrs Merkel's plane told those on board that he had decided to turn back after the ""malfunction of several electronic systems"". The plane's communications system went down and the crew had to use a satellite phone to contact air traffic controllers, Germany's Spiegel website reported. Russia-Ukraine crisis clouds G20 summit G20: Why Trump and Xi won't make a deal World leaders gather for G20 summit The problem is thought to have been with an electronic distribution box, which controls both the radio and discharge of aviation fuel. At no time was there any risk to the lives of passengers, a spokeswoman for Mrs Merkel stressed. The German air force denied suggestions that the plane's electronics could have been sabotaged. ""There's is absolutely no indication of a criminal background,"" a spokesman said. An added problem for the plane was that Cologne airport's longer runway was unavailable, Spiegel added. As the A340 had to slow down quickly and it was still fully laden with fuel, its braking system overheated and the fire brigade met the plane on the tarmac. The German delegation was kept on the plane for some time before officials decided to travel by bus to a hotel in Bonn. The plane was met on the tarmac in Cologne by emergency vehicles The chancellor and a smaller delegation including the finance minister travelled to Madrid on an air force plane on Friday morning before leaving for Argentina on an Iberia plane, a spokesman said. Mrs Merkel's husband was among those on the initial flight who remained in Germany. Although there is a standby government plane for long-haul flights, no crew was available to fly it, German media report. Organising an alternative route proved a headache for the German government, as Mrs Merkel's entourage had to include several security officials. The chancellor missed the ""family photo"" at the start of the G20 summit and officials were trying to reschedule planned bilateral meetings with national leaders. German TV's satirical Heute Show tweeted an image showing three other G20 leaders arriving alongside an airport baggage hall, with the caption: ""Merkel decided on an alternative arrival.""

Drag queen head teacher backed by school,"According to social media, Miss Tish Ewe has performed in places including Cardiff, Bristol and Dundee The owners of a school with a head teacher who performs a drag act have said the roles are not ""incompatible"". Andrew Livingstone, 39, is the head of Horatio House in Lound, Suffolk, and he also has a second job outside of work, as an entertainer called Miss Tish Ewe. According to the Eastern Daily Press,external, his act contains explicit material. Great Yarmouth Community Trust, which owns the school, said it had agreed guidelines with him to ensure ""a separation between his two jobs"". Mr Livingstone's act is labelled on Twitter as ""Queen of Quay Pride and Great Yarmouth!"", and boasts he has performed in places including Cardiff, Bristol and Dundee. The teacher has received support on the social media site about his sideline. Miss Tish Ewe typically performs in a blonde and pink wig Mr Livingstone was appointed in July as the head of the independent school, near Lowestoft, and its proprietors said he brought ""considerable expertise in education and school improvement to the trust"". The school said his drag queen act came up during checks, but that it did ""not believe that the two jobs are incompatible, and agreed with Mr Livingstone clear guidelines to ensure that there is a separation between his two jobs, including the use of social media in promoting his act"". The trust said schools regulator Ofsted was ""satisfied"" with the separation of roles and there had been no direct complaints from parents. Pupils from Norfolk and Suffolk attend the school, which is on the border of the two counties. Both Norfolk and Suffolk county councils said they had not received any complaints.

'Excess winter deaths highest in 40 years',"There were around 50,100 excess winter deaths in England and Wales in 2017-18 - the highest since the winter of 1975-76, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. The increase is thought to be down to the flu, the ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine in older people and spells of very cold weather last winter. Most excess deaths occurred in women and the over-85s. Similar peaks in excess deaths have been seen in previous years. Before the 2017-18 peak in excess winter deaths, there were peaks in 2014-15 and 1999-2000. An extra 6,000 deaths are estimated to have occurred during last winter compared with three years ago. The figures for last winter, counted as December to March, are still provisional while figures for all other previous winters have been confirmed. Nick Stripe, head of health analysis and life events at the Office for National Statistics said: ""Peaks like these are not unusual - we have seen more than eight peaks during the last 40 years. ""It is likely that last winter's increase was due to the predominant strain of flu, the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine and below average winter temperatures"". Last winter, two strains of flu - influenza A and B - were circulating. Despite more people over 65 getting a flu jab, the vaccine was more effective in younger people and could explain why flu had a greater impact on elderly people, the ONS said. This year, it is hoped thatan enhanced flu vaccine for elderly peopleshould perform better. The ONS said the increases could also be explained partly by colder weather and lower temperatures, compared with the five-year average, in December, February and March. More than a third of the excess deaths were caused by respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia. GP surgeries and pharmacies should have all their stocks of the flu vaccine by now. Public Health England has advised all adults over 65 to have the vaccine as soon as possible. Flu vaccine delays 'over by weekend' Enhanced flu jab to save 'hundreds of lives' Surge in flu hospital admissions Winter deaths were highest in 30 years Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

No deal for Noel's bus lane claim,"Noel Edmonds claimed on I'm A Celebrity that he has a tactic for beating traffic - driving in bus lanes. The Deal or No Deal presenter said he originally drove a black cab to get to and from work more quickly, before upgrading to a bus after getting a ticket for using the wrong lane. ""Bristol traffic is chaotic,"" he told the ITV1 show. But Bristol Council has now said their bus lanes are only for licensed buses - ""not celebrities"". Noel - who became the first contestant voted off the show on Friday night - said his wife Liz initially bought him a black cab and that, by driving in bus lanes, he shaved an hour off his commute. While he said this was ""totally legal"", he told campmates on the jungle-based reality show that after the council installed CCTV in bus lanes, he got a ticket. ""So having got the ticket, I didn't take my cab in the bus lane,"" he said. ""I did what any sane person would do. I bought a bus. I've a Routemaster bus."" ""How the other half live,"" commented fellow competitor Fleur East - echoing the thoughts of many others on social media who were surprised at his admission. Noel has a Routemaster - like one of these The 69-year-old added: ""One of the extraordinary things about licensing in the UK is that you can drive it on a car licence, as long as there are no more than nine people on board."" That's correct - asconfirmed by the DVLA,external. While they said they couldn't advise specifically on an individual driver or vehicle, passenger-carrying vehicles can be driven by anyone using a category B car driving licence. That's as long as the vehicle is at least 30 years old, isn't carrying more than eight passengers (as Noel said), and isn't being used for reward or hire. However, if he's using it in Bristol's bus lanes as he insinuated, he may not be able to do so any longer. A Bristol City Council spokesman told the BBC: ""While the penalties we issue aren't a touch on bushtucker trials, our bus lanes are just for licensed buses, taxis and cyclists, not celebrities."" Noel with wife Liz, who he says bought him a black cab The council's bus lanes are monitored by CCTV cameras, with any motorist using a bus lane illegally issued with a penalty charge notice. The council said their bus lanes are ""placed strategically to try and improve journey times around the city and we ask that people abide by the law"". Noel may have more luck if he moves house however, because whether or not a bus is allowed in a bus lane (without paying passengers, that is) depends on where in the country that bus lane is - different areas have different rules. Transport for London, for example, said normally all buses are allowed on the city's roads as long as a bus has nine seats for passengers, plus the driver's seat. ""There is no regulation on whether it's a public/private bus or whether the passengers have paid,"" a spokeswoman said. Noel isn't the first famous person to use an unusual mode of transport - theDuke of Edinburgh had his own black cab,externalfor many years, to allow him to travel inconspicuously.

"Police face down mob of 100 teenagersAbout 100 youths surrounded officers and launched bricks and fireworks at them in Stanley, County Durham.Tyne & Wear","This video can not be played Stanley town centre mob of youths attacks officers Up to 100 teenagers surrounded police in a town centre before a mob attacked officers during an ""appalling"" disturbance. Fireworks and bricks were launched and a community officer was punched in the face in Stanley, County Durham. Police have since launched a text alerts service to inform parents of local disorder, urging them to ""take responsibility"" for their children. It is hoped they will be encouraged to collect teenagers from disturbances. Officers were called out to reports of a ""vulnerable female"" at the bus station in the town on the night of 3 November. They were bombarded by the youths upon arrival, then set upon by about 20 hoodie-wearing youngsters in an attack captured on the officers' body cams. Sgt Dave Clarke said his officers had been forced to use pepper spray after tensions ""escalated"" when some teenagers had objected to being told what to do. ""You had a group of six to 10 boys wanting to show off in front of their friends, and that developed into kicks, karate kicks, punching and people jumping around sparring,"" he said. ""After at least 10 warnings, the officers used the pepper spray."" The police team targeting knife crime Tasers plea after police officer assaults Police injured in attack 'involving 50 youths' Bricks and fireworks were thrown at officers In the wake of the attack, the force launched its Be Informed text alert service, to which parents can opt-in to be told whenever there is disorder in the town. Any parent who believes their child may be in the vicinity can go and collect them, police said. Sgt Emma Kay, from Durham Constabulary, said: ""Parents were asked to come and review the footage from the officers' body cams that night and they all agreed the behaviour of the children was appalling. ""While there is a hardcore group of individuals involved in this incident, there are many more people stood on the sidelines, young people who are going to affect their life chances by continuing to engage in this type of behaviour. ""We are asking for parents to step up to the plate, take responsibility for your children. ""Do you know where they are, or are they going to bring trouble to your door?""

Allotment murderer jailed for life,"Rahim Mohammadi told jurors they were ""sending an innocent man to prison"" A man who murdered an elderly widow with a lawnmower flex on an allotment has been jailed for at least 19 years. Rahim Mohammadi, 42, was convicted of killing 80-year-old Lea Adri-Soejoko following a trial at the Old Bailey. He throttled Mrs Adri-Soejoko with the mower cable and left her body inside a locked shed at the site in Colindale, north London in February last year. Judge Richard Marks QC said opium user Mohammadi killed Mrs Adri-Soejoko in a ""violent loss of temper"". During sentencing, the judge said: ""How bitterly ironic that the place she loved so much - the allotment - was the place she met her death. ""It goes without saying that although Lea was fit for her age she was an elderly lady and as such, confronted and attacked by you as she was, was vulnerable in the extreme."" Lea Adri-Soejoko was secretary for the allotments where her body was found Mrs Adri-Soejoko was the secretary of the Colindale Allotment Garden Association, and Mohammadi had feared he was going to be thrown off his plot. Mohammadi, a Kurdish Iranian, claimed to be a victim of torture, and was given an allotment through the charity Freedom from Torture. Mrs Adri-Soejoko's body was found in a lock-up store at the allotments Mrs Adri-Soejoko's son, Mark, said Mohammidi's background was irrelevant to his mother's death. ""Where they come from has nothing to do with it. We are the children of immigrants. This is about the actions of one wicked individual,"" he said. Her daughter, Tess Adri-Soejoko, added: ""Hatred is something you kind of rise to in a situation like this. I'm just glad that the truth has been revealed about him and who he truly is."" Can Chicago cure London's violence? Murder victim's family leave UK and say London 'too dangerous' Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh of the Met Police said Mrs Adri-Soejoko was a ""sprightly"" person who was loved by all. By contrast, he described Mohammadi as a ""manipulative, evil, controlling individual"". Mrs Adri-Soejoko's body was found inside the shed close to Sheaveshill Avenue The court had heard how Mohammadi had been involved with the allotment since 2008. In September 2016, he clashed with Mrs Adri-Soejoko at an allotment association meeting and he called her a ""bloody old witch"". Five months later Mohammadi attacked her at the allotments, causing bruises and fractures to her ribs, before throttling her with the cable.

Snow leopard shot dead after escaping,"Margaash, the eight-year-old snow leopard, was killed on 23 October, Dudley Zoo said A snow leopard was shot dead after a zookeeper left the enclosure door open and it escaped. Dudley Zoo said eight-year-old Margaash was killed after getting free on 23 October when the zoo had closed and all visitors had left. An investigation found the door to the enclosure was left open at 17:00 BST through ""keeper error"". A disciplinary procedure has taken place into those involved and security is being reviewed. Once keepers saw Margaash outside, the zoo said its animal escape procedure was put in place and the firearms team managed the incident. The zoo said the leopard was killed by a senior member of the firearms team with a single shot and did not suffer. It added staff had no other option and the decision was taken in the interest of public safety. This video can not be played Footage released by Dudley Zoo in February shows its two snow leopards in their enclosure Zoo director Derek Grove said: ""This was an incredibly sad incident and our staff are understandably heartbroken. ""Euthanasia is, and always will be, a last resort. Efforts to persuade Margaash to return to his enclosure failed and as the animal was close to surrounding woodland and dark was approaching, the vet did not believe a tranquiliser dart was a safe option due to the amount of time the drug takes to work. ""Safety of the public is always of paramount importance and our staff are highly experienced and rigorously trained."" Margaash, eight, had been at Dudley Zoo since 2011 The zoo is located in the centre of Dudley, next to Dudley College of Technology and close to a number of shops and houses. It said it had notified people who had ""adopted"" the animal and had informed all the keepers so they could explain the situation to visitors. Margaash was born at Banham Zoo in Norfolk in May 2010 and was transferred to Dudley Zoo in September 2011, where he lived with three-year-old female TaÃ¯ga. He was thefather of a snow leopard cub that died at the zoo in 2013. Snow leopards are endangered and there may be as few as 4,000 left in the wild Estimates of their numbers in the wild are difficult because the animals are highly elusive They are native to Central Asia Its main prey are ibex, argali and bharal (Himalayan blue sheep) Snow leopards measure between about 55 and 65cm (22 - 26in) tall and 90 to 115cm (36 - 44in) in length They have been known to live for up to 22 years in captivity but in the wild their life expectancy is more like 10 to 12 years Information Source:Snow Leopard Trust,external Dudley Zoo is on Castle Hill, close to the centre of the town The British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) said it was ""saddened"" to hear of the death. It added: ""The zoo has informed our association that all the necessary procedures and protocols with regards to an animal escape were followed at that time, including informing their local authority, a requirement of the Secretary of State's standards of modern zoo practice. ""Following the incident we understand that the zoo has carried out a thorough internal investigation with a view to implementing any changes that they feel may be required."" Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Turkey raffle axed amid vegans' outcry Animals die in island pet shop fire The Snow Leopard Trust said: ""As fellow animal lovers, our thoughts are of course with the Margaash, the snow leopard that was tragically killed - but also with the staff and volunteers of Dudley Zoo, who must be in shock and grief. ""We do partner with many zoos around the world to raise awareness and share expertise when possible. We believe zoos play an important role in wildlife conservation, both as a major funding partner and as a point of contact to animals for millions of people. ""It's a great loss, and we hope the necessary measures will be taken to avoid any such tragic situation in the future."" A spokesman from the Born Free Foundation said: ""While this is a sad incident that is undoubtedly very distressing to those who cared for Margaash, it brings into sharp focus - once again - that zoos simply cannot guarantee the safety of people and their animals. ""There will be those who claim that zoos contribute to conservation: whether or not these claims hold water the captive life and unfortunate death of a snow leopard at a zoo should serve to remind us just how we are failing wild animals wholescale, both in captivity and in nature.""

Hunt as couple's car 'washes up' on beach,"Susan and James Kenneavy have not been seen at home or been in contact with family The search has been suspended for a couple whose car was found washed-up on a beach in the south of Scotland amid bad weather. James and Susan Kenneavy's empty Ford Kuga was found by workmen clearing debris on Drummore beach, near Stranraer, at about 07:30 on Thursday. The discovery followed heavy rain and flooding on Drummore coastal road on Wednesday. The search has been halted but should resume on Saturday morning. The air, sea and land search operation will resume on Saturday A police spokesman asked for the public's help to trace the couple and discover the movements of their grey Ford Kuga - registration SJ15UKX. He added that the couple, thought to be in their 70s, had not been seen at home in Drummore and had not been in contact with family. Insp Duncan Cameron told the BBC weather conditions in the area had been ""extremely challenging"", with heavy wind and rain. ""A lot of the roadways around that area had been closed due to concerns about the weather,"" he said. He said the coastguard, lifeboats and mountain rescue teams had been involved in the search which has now been suspended until Saturday morning. ""At the minute our efforts are very much focused on tracing Mr and Mrs Kenneavy,"" he said. ""We are concerned for their well-being given the passage of time since their car was discovered. ""However, all our efforts are focused on tracing them - hopefully safe and well. ""We have got as much resource dedicated to that effort as we possibly can."" Drummore villager Edward Beck, who has known Mr Kenneavy for more than 30 years, described his friend as a ""diamond"". ""No matter what he was going through he would always smile and laugh - very witty and full of humour,"" he said. ""A really nice little fellow. I love him to bits, he is just great."" He said he believed the couple were originally from the East Kilbride area but had lived in Dumfries and Galloway for decades. A search into the night on Thursday failed to find any trace of Mr and Mrs Kenneavy Mr Beck told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programmethat local people had been aware of weather warnings from the Met Office and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. He also described how conditions along the coastal route could be extremely treacherous and said large storm waves could affect the main road into the village. He added: ""You can be driving through three, four feet of water and a lot of cars can suck water into the engine and you can get stranded. That part [of the road] actually looks like it's in the sea if you hit it at the right time."" A spokesman for HM Coastguard said they had been contacted by police just after 15:30 on Thursday requesting assistance in the search for the couple. He added: ""The HM Coastguard Search and Rescue Helicopter based at Prestwick, Drummore, Stranraer and Portpatrick coastguard rescue teams and lifeboats from Stranraer and Portpatrick were all sent to assist.""

The French village that fears for its Brits,"Alet-les-Bains in southern France may be a long way away from the UK, but Brexit looms large there. And it's not just the large number of Britons among its 440 residents who worry about the future. ""Our English friends have done a lot for the village,"" says resident Annick Van Mairis. ""Thanks to them, dilapidated houses have become beautiful. Our main fear is that they should have to leave for some reason or other."" In a country not renowned for being Anglophile, the warm feelings towards Alet's 60-strong British community are striking. Retired postman Gérard Baudru says they have brought ""brotherhood"" to the village - as well as work for himself. ""The number of greeting cards in December and January is extremely high,"" he enthuses. The mutual attraction between Alet and its British residents is rooted in geography. The village is located in Aude, the second-poorest area in mainland France. It has no industry. Its main city, Carcassonne, has half the population of Oldham in the north-west of England and five times its unemployment rate (24% to Oldham's 4.5%). Aude may be struggling economically but, attracted by the stunning scenery, the lifestyle and dirt-cheap property prices, pensioners started trickling in from Britain and other parts of northern Europe in the 1980s. When Ryanair began operating flights from London and Manchester to Carcassonne in 1998, the trickle became a flood. Alet, a medieval spa town with a 9th Century abbey, caught the eye of many. One of the early arrivals, Min Stevenson, had originally planned to settle with her husband in a country house near the Pyrenees but decided on Alet instead. ""We thought, if we do that we won't feel as if we're living in France,"" she recalls.  ""What I want is to be in a village. And I like the fact that people come along and say, 'hello, nice to see you'. The French people were very friendly."" Their story is typical. British expats in Aude seek to blend in with the local culture rather than set up their own enclave. When David Goldsworthy settled in Limoux, a medium-sized town a 10-minute drive from Alet, fellow Brits were the last people he wanted to run into. ""When I heard English voices at the supermarket or Mr Bricolage [hardware store] I went the other way. I wasn't here for that. I was here to try to become part of the landscape."" L'Odalisque, a Limoux restaurant, has been popular with Britons since it opened three years ago. They make up 50% of its patrons even though owner Sven Choplin does not speak a word of English. ""We tried to translate our menu at first. The English said, 'stop! This is meaningless. We'd rather make the effort',"" he laughs. Annie Morejon - who owns the only store in the village, a grocery shop-cum-café - finds that some even out-French the French. Unlike the natives, who ""are sometimes not very polite, they come and give me a kiss"", she says. Far from recreating Little Britain, the newcomers are busy rebuilding old France. Until the arrival of the British and others, traditional homes in villages like Alet were crumbling. ""People from Aude did not value their own heritage,"" says Catherine Pouedras, who works at the Carcassonne tourist office. The newcomers eagerly bought properties to do them up.  They have done so ""in a way that respects the tradition and the harmony of the village"", Alet Mayor Ghislaine Tafforeau says. This renovation work has been ""a lesson for natives"", who she says are mainly interested in building identikit modern villas with gardens on the outskirts. One of the prettiest streets in the centre of the village, the mayor points out, is known locally as ""la rue des Anglais"". The British, says Alet resident Martine Théveniaut, ""have breathed new life into the place"". You will, if you try hard, find people in Alet who take exception to the British influx. Standing in a square, builders grumble about being undercut by a foreign workforce. ""The English give work to each other,"" one says. Another blames EU rules that allow ""posted workers"" to escape France's high social security contributions. But both men agree that if it were not for the British, half the houses in a nearby town would still be derelict. In the run-up to Brexit, however, fewer people have been snapping up such properties. Christophe Bac, a Limoux estate agent who advertises extensively in the UK, says the fall in the pound has meant that his share of British buyers has dropped from 30% a few years ago to 15% now. Some who find it increasingly difficult to make ends meet are already selling up, Mr Bac adds. Beyond the property market, Brexit could have consequences for the community life of villages like Alet. The most crucial British investment there has not been in stone and mortar, but in time and effort. The expats have brought to Alet an Anglo-Saxon zeal for self-help and grassroots action. The local British brigade plays a leading role in every charity sale and village fair. They staff a workshop that makes the Alet coat of arms displayed at festivities. They have raised funds to put flowers around the village ever since the municipality's budget ran out a few years ago. The Brits organise quiz nights and poetry evenings. One hosts a film club that screens alternately French and English-language films (with subtitles for each) every month. Alison Hope settled in Alet in 2013, and bought part of a 200-year-old former nougat factory from another Briton. She is making Robin Hood costumes for the Christmas pantomime - a British tradition the expats have introduced to Alet. ""French people do go,"" she says. ""This year we're putting up signs with subtitles so they can follow the action. ""Whenever we ask for help to set up an event, the English-speaking community is always there,"" says Jozy Laval, who heads Anim'Alet, a volunteer group. ""I like to say that this place is not Alet-les-Bains, but Anglet-les-Bains."" Deputy Mayor Jean-Pierre Gayda agrees that without them the village would have no civic life to speak of. ""I'm happy that the English are here in Alet - except during the 80 minutes of Le Crunch,"" he jokes, drawing the line at France against England at rugby. Dawn Stollar settled in the village back in the 1980s after falling ""in love with the region"". Now a sprightly 80, she remains a leading force in Alet's civic life. A few years ago she drew up a list of emergency numbers and volunteers that sick people could call when they needed help, or have a meal brought to their home. The list was particularly useful when the Aude valley was devastated by floods in mid-October, when the equivalent of five months of rain fell in a few hours. But it is unclear how much longer Alet will benefit from Dawn's energy. She is deeply worried she will be forced to return because of Brexit. One major source of concern for retired expats like her is health coverage. Although they would continue to have access to medical care under the Brexit withdrawal deal, the future is far from certain. And then there is money. Those living on pensions in sterling have already seen a 20% fall in their income since 2016. ""There's a limit to how much the elastic can stretch,"" Dawn says. ""I lie in bed thinking, 'what happens if I'm left alone and the income drops so much? What do I do?' You obviously go back to your children. That would be fun wouldn't it? Grannies from all over France and Spain trooping back to England to be with their children. ""All my life I got through everything somehow or other. But this one is coming very late in one's life, and you thought of a nice old age in a beautiful place and suddenly there is this tension."" Brexit is also bad news for the local economy. As their incomes dwindle, expats are spending less. The Britons' legendary enthusiasm for do-it-yourself has meant brisk business over the years for Mr Bricolage in Limoux. If Brexit drives many away, says store manager Gaëtan-Pierre Dumonceau, ""this would have a negative impact on our sales, and also on the villages where they are so heavily invested."" The travel industry, Aude's main cash earner, is already feeling the pinch. The British are its main foreign customers and the number of those visiting campsites in the area was down 27% between 2015 and 2017. In other words, many Britons looking for value holidays - the kind of tourism Aude specialises in - are staying away. Antoinette Fairhurst, who runs a bed and breakfast in Alet with her husband, notes that her income from the past summer's high season plummeted by two-thirds compared with last year. ""I hardly had any English that came,"" she says. François Raynaud, of the regional tourism agency, fears Brexit could make things worse, with tougher border checks. ""If the British don't come to Carcassonne that will leave a big hole,"" he says. Aude's other money-spinner is wine. The Blanquette de Limoux, a bubbly that locals compare favourably to champagne, is sold worldwide, with the British among the keenest drinkers. Le Sieur d'Arques, Limoux' leading winemaker, sells to UK supermarket chains such as Tesco and Waitrose. Brexit could hit sales with extra taxes and paperwork, says Sieur d'Arques export manager Gabi van Dael. ""We are very worried about what is going to happen next year."" Françoise Antech-Gazeau is head of Antech, an old Limoux family-run firm that specialises in high-end sparkling wine. Her main concern is not about the extra bureaucracy after Brexit - Antech has done business with generations of keen British customers and ""we will always find solutions"". But she fears a Brexit-induced downturn that could hit the purse of the British and lead them to drink less Blanquette. Brexit will not end the love affair between the British and Aude. The many who have moved there to work are determined to stay, and are busy getting residency permits or French citizenship. ""In terms of Brexit, you would have to shoehorn me out with a shotgun,"" says Charlotte Pye, a yoga teacher who helps kids in rugby clubs up and down the Aude valley in her spare time. ""My life is here."" But in an area with an economy on the brink, any drop in foreign income can make a big difference. And in a tiny place like Alet, the departure of even a few of its most active residents poses a threat to community life. ""Brexit is a danger for us,"" says Anim'Alet volunteer Claude Carayol. ""If the British are not there, who will replace them?"" Photographs by Samuel Aranda/Panos Pictures Copyright 2025 BBC.

Why are so many whales washing up?,"This video can not be played Almost 150 whales died in a mass stranding on NZ's Stewart Island The pictures are striking: dozens of whales lie stranded on an idyllic beach in a remote part of New Zealand. The group were found by a walker on Stewart Island earlier this week. And just a few days later, a further 51 pilot whales died after becoming stranded on a beach on the Chatham Islands. While whale strandings are not uncommon, they usually involve just a single animal rather than a whole group. The recent flurry of mass strandings has brought a renewed focus on the mysterious, and rare, phenomenon. So why does it happen? While the exact reasons remain unclear, experts say many different factors could play a part. ""Quite often animals that turn up on a beach are getting exhausted, they're malnourished, or they haven't eaten because they're ill,"" says Dr Simon Ingram, a Professor of Marine Conservation at the University of Plymouth. ""They can be in the final stages of being ill or die at sea and end up getting washed up on a beach,"" he adds. But Dr Ingram says that sickness or injury mainly plays a part when a single animal is found stranded. ""The trouble is that in a huge number of animals it's quite likely that some of them are going to be ill anyway,"" he explains. It's also true that there have been cases where groups of healthy whales have ended up getting stranded. So what could be behind these cases? Some experts say that certain aspects of the coastline or sea bed can disorientate whales, especially if they roam outside of their usual habitat. ""Some places like the tip of New Zealand are hotspots for stranding,"" says Dr Ingram. ""Sometimes this is due to geographic features of the coastline. If there's a feature like a peninsular or headland then animals that should be in deeper [waters] may suddenly find themselves in a confusing, shallow bay."" Dead pilot whales on a beach in the Chatham Islands, New Zealand Shallow water can pose a risk to pilot whales in particular because of the way in which they navigate and communicate. ""These animals forage and feed largely by echolocation,"" says Dr Andrew Brownlow, a veterinary pathologist who has undertaken post-mortems on stranded pilot whales in Scotland. ""So they use sound to navigate and communicate and find their prey."" ""Using echolocation in areas with very shallow, silty mud is like trying to walk through a forest on a foggy day,"" he explains, ""It's very hard to get your bearings and see clearly."" 'I will never forget the cries of stranded whales' Whale 'had 115 plastic cups' in stomach Pilot whales get stuck in Icelandic fjord, twice This combination of shallow waters and confused, muddled, echolocation is a serious danger and may lead to mass strandings. ""They end up coming into shallow areas and get stranded by the receding tide, so the natural lay-of-the-land is a real risk factor for these animals,"" Dr Brownlow says. Many of the whales had severe injuries from being caught in the shallow water But if a single whale gets injured or lost, why do they end up beached in such large numbers? Experts say the answer lies in their herd-like behaviour. ""It's a problem you get with these very social animals that tend to, for reasons we have never been clear on, end up following either a sick leader onto the beach or end up getting lost as a group,"" Dr Brownlow says. ""This particular species seems to be very prone to that herd behaviour."" Pilot whales are incredibly social and may follow one another into hazards such as shallow water It means that if one pilot whale encounters a problem then it can have an impact on the entire group. Dr Brownlow points to one case in 2015 when around 30 whales became stranded on the Isle of Skye, off Scotland's west coast. ""We think that was because one of the females was having trouble giving birth and was in a lot of distress,"" he explains. ""She came into shallow waters, and all the other members of the group followed her onto the beach."" Another possible cause of strandings, some experts suggest, is warmer water temperatures. ""We've had an unusual week, which we haven't got to the bottom of, and it's fair to say it's been an entirely unusual year,"" Dr Karen Stockin, a marine mammal scientist based at New Zealand's Massey University, told AFP news agency after the latest mass stranding. ""I suspect a lot of that has been driven by the warmer sea surface temperatures that we're seeing at the moment."" She explained: ""That's likely affecting where the prey is moving and as a consequence we're seeing prey moving and [whale] species following."" New Zealand's summer begins on Saturday and Dr Stockin warned that there could be more beachings to come. ""We're just going into stranding season now, this is only the beginning of it and we're very mindful of the fact that this a very busy start,"" she said. While Dr Stockin says that global warming may be playing apart in the rising sea temperatures, most experts say that it's important not to jump to conclusions about the role of humans in these cases. ""Pilot whales have probably been stranding in New Zealand since before people lived there,"" Dr Ingram says. ""It's probably not anything to do with what humans have done."" ""It's a very dynamic ecosystem that these animals are in, so I would be very cautious in making any connection between these examples and climate change.""

"Allotment murderer jailed for lifeRahim Mohammadi murdered Lea Adri-Soejoko with a lawnmower cord to ""stop her complaining"".London","Rahim Mohammadi told jurors they were ""sending an innocent man to prison"" A man who murdered an elderly widow with a lawnmower flex on an allotment has been jailed for at least 19 years. Rahim Mohammadi, 42, was convicted of killing 80-year-old Lea Adri-Soejoko following a trial at the Old Bailey. He throttled Mrs Adri-Soejoko with the mower cable and left her body inside a locked shed at the site in Colindale, north London in February last year. Judge Richard Marks QC said opium user Mohammadi killed Mrs Adri-Soejoko in a ""violent loss of temper"". During sentencing, the judge said: ""How bitterly ironic that the place she loved so much - the allotment - was the place she met her death. ""It goes without saying that although Lea was fit for her age she was an elderly lady and as such, confronted and attacked by you as she was, was vulnerable in the extreme."" Lea Adri-Soejoko was secretary for the allotments where her body was found Mrs Adri-Soejoko was the secretary of the Colindale Allotment Garden Association, and Mohammadi had feared he was going to be thrown off his plot. Mohammadi, a Kurdish Iranian, claimed to be a victim of torture, and was given an allotment through the charity Freedom from Torture. Mrs Adri-Soejoko's body was found in a lock-up store at the allotments Mrs Adri-Soejoko's son, Mark, said Mohammidi's background was irrelevant to his mother's death. ""Where they come from has nothing to do with it. We are the children of immigrants. This is about the actions of one wicked individual,"" he said. Her daughter, Tess Adri-Soejoko, added: ""Hatred is something you kind of rise to in a situation like this. I'm just glad that the truth has been revealed about him and who he truly is."" Can Chicago cure London's violence? Murder victim's family leave UK and say London 'too dangerous' Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh of the Met Police said Mrs Adri-Soejoko was a ""sprightly"" person who was loved by all. By contrast, he described Mohammadi as a ""manipulative, evil, controlling individual"". Mrs Adri-Soejoko's body was found inside the shed close to Sheaveshill Avenue The court had heard how Mohammadi had been involved with the allotment since 2008. In September 2016, he clashed with Mrs Adri-Soejoko at an allotment association meeting and he called her a ""bloody old witch"". Five months later Mohammadi attacked her at the allotments, causing bruises and fractures to her ribs, before throttling her with the cable.

"'Controlling' man stamped partner to deathDzilva Butiene spoke little English and was murdered by the man she ""relied on"".Cambridgeshire","Dzilva Butiene, 48, had more than 60 bruises and marks on her body An isolated and vulnerable woman who faced alcoholism and cancer was stamped to death by the controlling partner she had relied on, a report has found. Mother-of-two Dzilva Butiene was murdered by Kestutis Bauzys - who had convinced her to move from Lithuania to England - in Wisbech, in April 2017. ADomestic Homicide Review,externalsaid Ms Butiene, 48, who spoke limited English, ""seemed to have nowhere to turn to"". The report said it was likely others would be ""in a very similar position"". When the body of Ms Butiene was discovered in the flat they shared in the Cambridgeshire town, she had more than 60 bruises and marks on her chest and abdomen. Bauzys wasjailed for life with a minimum of 17-and-a-half years. Although the report is anonymised, the BBC understands it relates to Ms Butiene's death. Kestutis Bauzys had been in a relationship with the woman for about four years A report, made by Fenland Community Safety Partnership (FCSP), said Ms Butiene was unable to find consistent work after her treatment for cervical cancer in 2014, had few close friends and very limited English and was unaware of any support agencies. ""She appears to have become reliant on the perpetrator for her needs,"" it said. ""It is difficult to imagine how her life must have been, given that she seems to have had nowhere to turn to, or been aware of how she could have sought support."" Ms Butiene's body was found in Orange Grove, Wisbech Ms Butiene and Bauzys had known each other from school and he persuaded her to move to the UK, where he was already living, ""on the promise of a better lifestyle"" in September 2013. She was described as a ""tiny, meek woman"" by a previous employer, while he was known to be a body builder who used steroids. When Ms Butiene was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn for a seizure and spasms in November 2016 she told staff she was depressed ""but said that by agreement with her partner she had agreed not to disclose this to hospital staff"". Bauzys also told staff he injected her with magnesium sulphate. The report said: ""Both of these actions give some indication of a controlling relationship and if [Ms Butiene] had been minded to discuss an abusive relationship this is the type of situation which should be identified as an opportunity and maximised."" It added a referral to mental health services for her depression or support for alcohol dependency, which had increased, appeared not have been considered. Following recommendations from the report, the hospital's chief nurse, Emma Hardwick, said it had ""revised process [which] includes direction for staff to ask all patents direct questions relating to domestic abuse"". A FCSP spokesman said review recommendations are ""translated into an action plan, with individual actions being identified as either national, county or Fenland specific"".

Political and trade rifts threaten G20,"This video can not be played Putin and the Saudi crown prince ""high five"" in Buenos Aires World leaders have held the opening session of their annual G20 summit, with any number of disputes and disagreements on the table. Host president, Argentina's Mauricio Macri, said the solution was ""dialogue, dialogue and dialogue"" and called for a clear message of shared responsibility. But US President Donald Trump has already cancelled meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. And huge differences remain on climate change, trade and the Khashoggi affair. The G20, made up of 19 of the world's most industrialised nations plus the EU, accounts for 85% of the world's economic output and two-thirds of the world's population. In pictures: World leaders gather Trump's trade war: Stakes are high at G20 Merkel's travel nightmare Its meetings, which began in 2008, are an opportunity for members to develop global policies tackling major issues - but many of the key decisions will be made in one-on-one encounters. There is massive security for the summit in Buenos Aires, with a bank holiday declared for Friday and the city's main business district shut down. Protesters angry at the money spent on the summit while Argentina struggles through tough austerity demonstrated outside the meeting. Analysis by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Meeting world leaders at the G20 summit was a test for Mohammed bin Salman to see who would snub him. He is the only Arab leader in the G20 and already stood out in his traditional dress amid a sea of suits. And at times he looked uncertain, even nervous. Some of his counterparts shared a word or two but few went out of their way to shake his hand. So the optics of the summit, to use the diplomatic jargon, were not that great for MBS. Read on The world leaders were all called on to the stage and assumed their position for the traditional family photograph. The G20 photo ahead of Friday's plenary session Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stood on the outside of the photo, far away from Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This is the crown prince's first major diplomatic test since the murder in Turkey of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a key critic of the government. Saudi Arabia has blamed ""rogue agents"" but suspicion has fallen on the prince for ordering the killing. After the photo was taken, the crown prince did manage a hearty exchange with Mr Putin. French President Emmanuel Macron held a five-minute exchange with the crown prince during which, a French official said, Mr Macron had conveyed ""very firm"" messages over the Khashoggi affair. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Mr Trump had a ""friendly meeting"" with the crown prince, Saudi media said, although the president later said there had been ""no discussion"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May also met the crown prince. A Downing Street spokesman said the PM had ""stressed the importance of ensuring that those responsible for the appalling murder of Jamal Khashoggi are held to account"" and that ""such a deplorable incident"" should not happen again. In addition Mrs May held a 15-minute meeting to discuss trade with Mr Macri. Their two nations have long disputed sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. Mr Macri's opening address to the summit admitted there would be issues of disagreement that needed to be managed. This video can not be played So how does a G20 summit work? He called for consensus on sustainable development, the future of work, food supply, climate change and international trade, adding: ""I am an optimist"". There are certain to be plenty of bilateral, trilateral or even larger get-togethers, although the one that will not be taking place is the highest-profile. Mr Trump said he would not meet Mr Putinbecause three Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors seized by Russia in the Black Sea near Crimea had not been returned. ""We don't like what happened. Nobody does,"" he said on Friday. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow regretted the decision. But he said: ""If this is so, the president will have a couple of extra hours in the programme for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has blamed the crisis ""entirely"" on Russia and said she would raise the issue with Mr Putin. The second-highest profile meeting will also involve Mr Trump. He will have dinner on Saturday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The key issue there will be the nations' trade tariffs dispute. The US has hit a total of $250bn (Â£196bn) of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. China said consensus was increasing on a deal but that differences remained. After earlier indicating pessimism on an agreement, Mr Trump said: ""They want to and we'd like to. There are some good signs. We'll see what happens."" Mr Putin has also weighed in, with a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump's America First policy. The Russian president condemned ""dishonest competition"" along with ""vicious"" sanctions and protectionist measures. The Brics group, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, issued a statement saying protectionism ran counter to the ""spirit and rules of the World Trade Organization"". Ahead of the summit's official startMr Trump signed a trade deal with the Mexican and Canadian leaders. Mr Trump described the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - which replaces the Nafta free trade deal - as ""probably the greatest trade deal ever"". ""All of our countries will benefit greatly,"" he said. European diplomats told Associated Press there has been tough haggling over a final statement. Argentine officials indicated differences on trade could be overcome. However, that will still leave the obstacle of climate change. This video can not be played Why have thousands of demonstrators been marching against the G20 summit in Buenos Aires? Mr Trump has not hidden his objection to collective action on the issue. UN chief Antonio Guterres said in Buenos Aires that ""this is a make-it-or-break-it moment"" on the issue. President Macron was quoted by AFP news agency as saying he would refuse to sign a trade deal with South America's Mercosur bloc if Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro withdrew from the Paris climate accord.

Kuenssberg: No 'Plan B' clues,"""It's a long flight,"" one of my fellow lobby journalists asked, ""will you spend any time working up a Plan B in case the vote falls?"" ""Nice try,"" the prime minister answered. And however many ways the question was put to Theresa May during a 20 minute press huddle on board the government's Voyager plane, she was resolutely and determinedly not going to let much slip. What will she do if she can't get her vote through? Is there a plan B? Could there be a Norway-style relationship with the EU? Could there be another referendum? Westminster'sawash with speculation and gossipabout what might happen next if her Brexit compromise is killed off by her colleagues. It's not surprising. Unless she pulls off a political miracleher planis on track to, at least at the first time of asking, be rejected by the Commons. That would be the central policy of a minority government being chucked out - an event that even in this strange times, might be the end of her leadership and the end of the government. Should May be 'camped out' in Parliament? Nine Tory Brexit tribes May must convince Brexit: A really simple guide Of course the defeat might not happen. If it does, the scale of it will be hugely important. If it's only by a few votes, perhaps she would try again. If it was by a thumping 100, I'm not sure she would be able to. That raises the prospect of another last-ditch effort to crank something else out of Brussels, even a new prime minister, or a general election. You can forgive Westminster then perhaps for indulging in rather a lot of speculation - it's not idle gossip, but the hunt for clues about what's next in these vital days. But all Mrs May would really give on the way to Buenos Aires was a slightly more emphatic plea to backbench MPs to think about their constituents, rather than themselves - an obvious, if veiled criticism of her Brexiteer backbenchers who think her plan leaves the UK too closely tied to the EU after Brexit. Goodness knows what she really thinks of them in private. Some of her allies have had pretty colourful words for them of late, many of which are too rude to write down in a respectable blog. But you can imagine the drift, the frustration, at the prime minister's proposal not being seen as ""pure enough"" as one senior politician described it, to pass. ""They'd have bitten our hands off in 2016 for this,"" they said. ""Now it seems nothing will ever be good enough."" But instead the prime minister gave her familiar lines on why she could not support a customs union-style deal or another referendum, her already familiar mantras about why the deal she has negotiated is the right one. Mrs May is due in Buenos Aires for the G20 summit Talk to her confidants in Number 10 and they say her fears about chaos and disruption if the vote fails are genuine, insisting there is no theorising or strategising about what would happen next. One insider suggested at that moment ""Parliament would have their hands on the executive"", downplaying the idea of Number 10's ability to argue for a second vote. But if nothing comes along to change the dynamics, before too long discussions about what happens next may well be ones that the prime minister simply has to have. If she wants to avoid them she may need to find a new script, and fast.

Rail fares to rise by 3.1% in January,"This video can not be played Why has your commute turned into a nightmare? Millions of commuters will have to pay an average of 3.1% more for rail tickets from 2 January. The rise, announced by industry body the Rail Delivery Group, follows a year of disruption on some lines. There had been calls for a price freeze following the chaos caused by the introduction of new timetables in May. The rise, which is lower than the 3.4% average rise for fares in 2018, means another Â£100 for a Manchester to Liverpool annual season ticket. How to save money on train fares Reality Check: Where does your train fare go? Anthony Smith, chief executive of independent watchdog Transport Focus, said the rail industry got Â£10bn a year from passengers, who wanted a reliable railway offering better value for money. Fewer than half (45%) of passengers are satisfied with the value for money of train tickets, according to Transport Focus. This video can not be played Rail fare rises ""wrong on every level"" Andy Burnham tells Radio 4's World at One Alex Hayman of consumer group Which? said the new price rises would only add to passengers' misery after a year of timetable chaos, with rail punctuality falling to its lowest level in 12 years. ""Value for money needs to be a key part of the upcoming government review and passengers must receive automatic compensation for delays and cancellations,"" he said. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the increase showed ""a government and rail industry out of touch with passenger concerns"", while RMT union general secretary Mick Cash called it ""another kick in the teeth for passengers on Britain's rip-off privatised railways"". Rail Delivery Group (RDG) chief executive Paul Plummer admitted that no one wanted to pay more to travel, ""especially those who experienced significant disruption earlier this year"". ""Money from fares is underpinning the improvements to the railway that passengers want and which ultimately help boost the wider economy,"" he said. The RDG said train companies would introduce 7,000 new carriages, supporting 6,400 extra services a week by 2021, meaning more seats on more reliable, comfortable and frequent trains. Watchdog orders Network Rail to improve 'Nobody took charge' in timetable chaos ""After a year of horrendous disruption to the railways this really is abhorrent,"" Chris in Cambridge told the BBC. ""I travel from Cambridge to London for work each day costing me just under Â£5,000 for an annual season ticket. For the three months of disruption I was refunded approximately one month's worth of my season ticket."" This video can not be played How do UK rail fares compare to Europe? Rachel in Sheffield said she could not believe fares were rising. ""I have now had to change my start times at work twice since March this year just to ensure that I actually get on a train [due to overcrowding]"". Michelle in Chorley told the BBC her daily commute to Manchester was ""a joke"", suffering ""delays, cancellations, over-crowding, not enough carriages, signal failures"". ""I'm incredibly lucky to work for a company that allows flexibility in start times but not everyone is in that position,"" she said. ""I have heard of others receiving written warnings from employers for being late multiple times through no fault of their own. ""I already feel Â£1,700 (what I pay for a season ticket) is more than enough to cover the sub-standard service we receive and totally begrudge the idea of having to pay more without any sign of improvement."" By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent Labour says fares should be frozen when performance isn't up to scratch. Passenger groups agree. However, the industry and the government point to more fundamental issues. With so many people now travelling by train, there are many more services operating on ancient infrastructure. Government funding for expensive upgrade projects to deal with overcrowding is only possible, rail bosses say, if passengers - not taxpayers in general - cover the bulk of everyday running costs. And they say if rail fares are frozen, rail companies' costs still rise in line with inflation. Again, the operators argue that taxpayers should not be left to plug that gap. By Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter The launch of the new ""millennial"" railcard, which will be available to four million passengers, is running slightly late. The Rail Delivery Group had promised that the digital-only 26-to-30 railcard would be available before the end of the year, but that has been put back until midday on 2 January. For a Â£30 fee, the new railcard will offer one-third off most leisure fares for 12 months. However, anyone travelling before 10am on a weekday will have to pay a minimum fare of Â£12. This is the same restriction as on the 16-25 railcard. Unlike the card for younger passengers, that minimum fare will also apply on weekdays throughout July and August. The launch of the card, which cannot be used for season tickets, was originally announced by the chancellor in the autumn 2017 Budget.

Ukraine bars Russian men from entry,"Martial law is in force in regions bordering Russia, including Donetsk near the front line with rebels Ukraine will not allow Russian men aged 16-60 into the country following the imposition of martial law, Kiev says. An exception would be made for ""humanitarian cases"" such as those travelling to funerals. Russia says it is not planning retaliatory measures. Martial law has been imposed in 10 Ukrainian regions until 26 December. This came as Ukraine's president voiced fears of a Russian invasion after Russian forces fired on and seized three Ukrainian boats and 24 sailors. Ukraine said Sunday's incident in the Black Sea was a flagrant violation of international law, while Russia says the vessels violated its territorial waters. It is the most dangerous clash at sea off Crimea since Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014. Why Ukraine-Russia sea clash is fraught with risk Who controls the waters? Russia-Ukraine sea clash in 300 words The restrictions were announced after President Petro Poroshenko met the country's top security officials, including border guard chiefs, in Kiev. The president tweeted (in Ukrainian) thatthe ban was designed to prevent the formation of ""private armies"" in Ukraine,external. He was referring to Russian-backed separatists who formed units in April 2014 to fight Ukrainian government forces in eastern Ukraine. Mr Poroshenko also said registration criteria would be tightened for Russian citizens in the regions under martial law. On Tuesday, he warned there was a threat of ""full-scale war"" with Russia. ""The number of [Russian] tanks at bases located along our border has grown three times,"" the president said. Five of the 10 regions border Russia while two are adjacent to Moldova's breakaway Trans-Dniester region, where Russian troops are stationed. The other three regions border the Black Sea or Sea of Azov close to Crimea. The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Kiev says the ban could have a devastating impact on cross-border travel as the holiday period approaches. Many Russians have relatives living in Ukraine. Reacting to the Ukrainian ban, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow was not planning ""mirror"" measures as this ""could result in full madness"". Russia earlier said the 30-day martial law in Ukraine had been declared in order to potentially suspend presidential elections set for 31 March. It said President Poroshenko - whose approval ratings have plummeted - would then be the main beneficiary. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Poroshenko denies the claim, saying the polls will be held as scheduled. Ukraine's SBU state security service has searched the property of a senior Russian-backed Orthodox priest in Voronkiv, a village about 50km (30 miles) from Kiev. SBU agents raided the residence of Metropolitan Pavel outside Kiev (pictured) The SBU said Metropolitan Pavel was suspected of inciting religious hostility. He is father-superior of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra monastery, one of the most revered sites in Orthodox Christianity. He told journalists that he was resident at the monastery, not in Voronkiv. He admitted criticising Filaret, leader of the Kiev Patriarchate, but denied fomenting religious hostility. The branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church loyal to Filaret has been recognised as independent by the Constantinople Patriarchate, Orthodox Christianity's highest authority. The dispute has soured centuries-old ties between Ukrainian and Russian clergy and exacerbated Kiev-Moscow tensions. Five reasons why Orthodox Church split matters Metropolitan Pavel says he is being subjected to pressure and threats Stricter checks are now expected at border crossings. Although the ban applies to all points of entry into Ukraine, the main focus is likely to be on the nearly 2,000km (1243 miles) Ukrainian-Russian land border. Soon after the conflict began in 2014, Ukraine started building a ""wall"" - a system of fortifications along the border. However, the project is still unfinished due to lack of funds. To further complicate the matter, hundreds of kilometres of Ukraine's border are de facto controlled by Russia and pro-Russian separatists in the east. With no direct flights between Ukraine and Russia, Kiev-Moscow trains have become popular Meanwhile, checkpoints have been set up between Ukraine and Russian-annexed Crimea in the south and also on the line of separation between Ukraine and two self-proclaimed rebel republics in the east. And even before Friday's ban, Ukraine had already put restrictions on Russian nationals wanting to visit Ukraine. A number of them have been deported for failing to explain the purpose of their visit, Ukraine says. Russian nationals - as well as other foreigners - are routinely denied entry into Ukraine if they have visited Crimea or the self-proclaimed republics not via Ukrainian-controlled points of entry. Kiev has also stopped direct flights between Ukraine and Russia. At least three of the 24 Ukrainians were injured when the Russian coast guard and special forces attacked their vessels last Sunday. One of the detained Ukrainian sailors (C) is escorted by a Russian security service officer in Crimea A court in Crimea later ordered the Ukrainians to be detained for 60 days, despite an international outcry. US President Donald Trump cancelled a planned meeting at the G20 summit in Argentina with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over the issue. Trump cancels Putin talks The sailors are accused of illegally crossing into Russia. They are not treated by Russia as prisoners of war.

"Girl, 4, saves mum with 999 callKaitlyn Wright showed ""wisdom beyond her years"" talking to the call handler when her mum fell ill.Dorset","This video can not be played Kaitlyn Wright, 4, called 999 when her mum was taken ill A four-year-old girl has been praised for her actions in calling for an ambulance when her mum was taken ill. Kaitlyn Wright from Askerswell, Dorset, dialled 999 earlier this month when she was at home with her mother Charlene, who began having a seizure. South Western Ambulance Service (SWAS) said she showed ""wisdom beyond her years"" in talking to the call handler and explaining her mum's condition. Paramedics were dispatched and Mrs Wright recovered. The ambulance service has released a recording of the call in which Kaitlyn is heard saying ""Mummy is having a fit and I need to look after her."" A spokesperson said she ""showed extraordinary bravery, presence of mind and wisdom beyond her years"". Snow leopard shot dead after escaping Father Christmas 'must be a man' Lorry sheds load of beer on slip road Kaitlyn visited the SWAS's 999 control centre near Bristol earlier when she was formally commended for her actions. Mrs Wright described her daughter as her ""little guardian angel"". ""I just remember Kaitlyn's dad bringing her back to the house and asking if I needed shopping and he went off. The next thing I know the paramedic is looking at me. ""I have regular seizures so all three children know exactly what to do, we've been very thorough with it."" Kaitlyn's father, Simon Wright, said: ""Just teaching her to press the three little buttons, and the green one, and asking for help - it's saved Charlene's life and if she hadn't done that we might not be sitting here today. It's amazing."" Mrs Wright added: ""My first thought was, 'I'm safe with all three of my children'. It's probably one of the best feelings in the world. ""It's quite scary when you're not well, and you're vulnerable, but I know she can save my life. ""She saved me, basically, because anything could have happened while no-one was there."" Jess Hodkinson, who answered the 999 call, said she was ""impressed"" with Kaitlyn. ""I was quite surprised because she had such a tiny voice, so I knew it was a young child but she was really brave, she answered my questions clearly and with confidence and she knew exactly what to do in an emergency.""

Low-cal diabetes diet offered on NHSA diet of soups and shakes that can reverse type 2 diabetes is to be trialled by the NHS in England.HealthComments,"Thousands of people with type 2 diabetes in England are to be prescribed a very low-calorie diet in the hope of reversing their condition. Under the pilot they will be restricted to 800 calories a day, in the form of soups and shakes, for three months. When the diet was trialled last year, almost half of those involved managed to put their diabetes into remission. NHS England has also announced it's expanding a programme to prevent people developing type 2 diabetes. The health service currently spends around 10% of its budget on treating diabetes in England. Up to 5,000 patients will be prescribed the diet by the NHS initially. They will also receive follow-up support. Nine out of 10 people with diabetes in the UK have type 2, which is strongly linked to diet and lifestyle. Type 1 diabetes,external, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease that is not linked with being overweight or inactive. Isobel Murray took part in a trial of the scheme One patient who took part in a recent trial, involving 298 people, lost more than four stones (25kg) and no longer needs diabetes medication. Isobel Murray, from Largs in North Ayrshire, was on the liquid-only diet for 17 weeks, with each meal consisting of a 200-calorie sachet of powder mixed with water to make a soup or a shake. After losing weight, she was then introduced to healthy, solid meals by dieticians - but she said while the liquid diet was relatively easy, ""eating normal food is the hardest bit"". She said of the diet: ""You have to be fired up, you have to be prepared, but anybody can do it if you feel strongly enough."" Is a low-calorie crash diet right for me? Prof Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity for NHS England, acknowledged the diet is challenging and it does not suit everyone. ""But we think it is worth exploring the implementation of these programmes within the NHS so that those who could benefit, can benefit,"" he said. While type 2 diabetes can have a genetic component, it is strongly linked to being overweight or obese. About two-thirds of adults and one-third of children are currently overweight or obese, which is driving up rates of the condition. Type 2 diabetes affects 7,000 under-25s in England and Wales Type 2 diabetes signs 'detectable years before diagnosis' Diabetes is actually five separate diseases, research suggests It is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high It is caused by problems with a chemical in the body (hormone) called insulin Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can include excessive thirst, needing to urinate a lot and tiredness It can increase the risk of getting serious problems with the eyes, heart and nerves A type 2 diabetes prevention programme has been running in England for the past three years and has seen encouraging results. So far, more than 250,000 people who were on the cusp of developing type 2 diabetes have been referred to classes which offer advice and support on food, diet and exercise. On average, participants have each lost 8lb (3.6kg) in weight, greatly reducing their risk of developing the condition. Now the programme is also set to undergo a significant expansion, helping 200,000 people a year. Each of the drinks has about 200 calories Experts have previously cautioned that low-calorie diets should not be tried without any support to keep the weight off afterwards. Dieting helps lose the fat which has built up around the pancreas, allowing the organ to work properly again and produce enough of the hormone insulin. Dr Shareen Forbes, reader in diabetes and endocrinology at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""There are now a number of studies that demonstrate remission of type 2 diabetes with weight loss. ""Such interventions can have significant economic impacts given the levels of type 2 diabetes now in society. ""These are important clinical studies,"" she said. But Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said industry needed to take action too. ""The NHS pound will go further if the food industry also takes action to cut junk calories and added sugar and salt from processed food, TV suppers and fast-food takeaways,"" Mr Stevens said. The announcements come ahead of what is known as the Forward Plan for the NHS in England, in which measures that prevent ill health in the first place are expected to be heavily emphasised. Type 2 diabetes 'affects 7,000 under-25s' Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' NHS 'should recommend meal replacement shakes' 'I beat diabetes with 200-calorie drinks' Is a low-calorie crash diet right for me?

Cyber-attack! Would your firm handle it better than this?,"The day starts badly for IT administrator Tony Lewis when he reads an email from a hacker What's it like being the victim of a live cyber-attack? What should you do to protect your company from further damage? And should you pay that ransom demand? Technology of Business eavesdropped on a ""war games"" exercise hosted by cyber security firm Forcepoint that was based on lots of real-life experiences. IT staff at fictional High Street optician Blink Wink's head office have been suckered by a phishing email. Someone clicked on a link to a spoof website because they thought the email looked legitimate. It wasn't. That was two months ago. Today, the proverbial hits the fan... Tony Lewis, Blink Wink's IT administrator, starts his day clearing out the company's public email inbox of the usual junk and spam. One message stands out. His stomach lurches. ""I have more where this came from. We will be in touch shortly with our demands,"" the text says below someone's name, credit card details and email address. Tony hopes it's a hoax, but can't take the risk. He swallows hard and calls the firm's security officer, Doug Hughes. Doug isn't impressed as he's on holiday in New York where it's 3:30am. ""This better be good,"" he growls. Tony forwards the suspect email. ""Have we validated the credit card number?"" Doug asks, tension evident in his voice now. ""Is it one of our customers?"" ""I don't know yet,"" admits Tony. Security officer Doug Hughes is having a day to forget... ""Well, when did we get this?"" Doug snaps. ""Um... well... it seems we got it yesterday just after I'd left work, so I didn't notice it until this morning."" ""So we're at least 12 hours into this?"" ""Um, yeah,"" Tony mumbles sheepishly. ""We've got a second email,"" Tony tells Doug. ""It's a ransom demand for Â£15,000 in the Litecoin crypto-currency. We have to pay by 22:00 BST or they'll delete all our customer records."" ""What?"" shouts Doug. ""I thought they only had one?"" ""Um, no. They claim to have them all."" In a sweat, Doug calls Blink Wink's legal counsel Grace Bolton for advice. She has to dial in several times as her headset is malfunctioning. Her voice keeps cutting out during the conversation. ""This is obviously a potential breach,"" she says. ""So do not respond to that message. I'll need to review existing legislation so we know where we stand."" ""What about the police?"" asks Doug, his romantic city break now thoroughly ruined. ""And the Information Commissioner? What about GDPR, who do we notify?"" Things are spiralling out of control for Blink Wink. The hackers have posted a tranche of customer names and credit card numbers on Pastebin, a public website for sharing text and source code. Doug has now confirmed that the data is genuine. ""Shouldn't we shut down the website?"" asks Tony. ""Then we'll limit the risk."" Grace butts in. ""Before we do that, who do we need to tell first? What's our data breach policy?"" ""I thought that came from legal,"" says Doug. ""Aren't you the data protection officer?"" Grace asks Tony. ""Nope, not me..."" No-one at Blink Wink seems very sure what they should be doing in this situation ""God, is it me?"" asks Doug despairingly. ""Anyway, if we pull the website that'll just draw attention to ourselves won't it? Not sure that's the right thing to do."" ""Me neither,"" says Grace. Blink Wink's head of public relations, Sandra Ellis, has been looped in to the conversation. ""This isn't looking good,"" she says rather obviously. ""We've failed to protect our customers' private data. We could get really hammered for this."" She points out that the firm has a ""buy one get one free"" contact lens promotion running at the moment. ""We're driving people to the website right now. Are their details being stolen too?"" ""Very possibly,"" says Doug. ""We've got to shut down the site - or parts of it anyway. And then we've got to decide whether to pay the ransom."" Sandra Ellis has drafted a public statement but doesn't propose releasing it to the media until people start asking questions. ""We'll just say we are experiencing an incident and do it reactively,"" she says. ""Not an incident - a breach,"" Doug advises. ""No, don't use the word 'breach' - not yet anyway,"" chips in Grace, thinking of the legal ramifications. Tony bursts in on the conference call. ""We've found some malware! We saw an email come in that went to quarantine so we checked it out and it had an attachment. That could be it."" ""You didn't click on it did you?"" asks Doug, his day going from bad to worse. ""Um... I just thought it would speed things up..."" The crop-spraying drones that go where tractors can't The country that's 'high risk, high return' for start-ups What is 5G and what will it mean for you? The cameras that know if you're happy - or a threat Phone in the right hand? You're a hacker! Doug swears and dips out of the call to get his security staff to check for any more damage. Grace turns the conversation to informing the Information Commissioner's Office. ""We can phone or report it online,"" she tells them. ""But we need to say what we did to mitigate the problem."" ""Well, we were meant to get the latest threat detection software last year, but the guy who was looking into that left and wasn't replaced,"" says Tony. ""It kinda didn't happen."" ""Well don't tell the ICOthat,"" Grace barks. ""If we can't show we had adequate controls in place we could be in trouble. And the cyber-insurance people might not pay out either."" Later, Doug confirms that the latest phishing email was a red herring, but informs the team: ""They did find a phishing email sent two months ago that linked to a log-in page made to look like the one for our cloud provider. That's how they got in. ""We've got to handle things better from now on,"" Doug concludes. ""This will happen again, and it's only going to get worse."" If you don't react quickly to a cyber-attack, hackers will have the upper hand Richard Ford, chief scientist at Forcepoint, says: ""Reacting late has put Blink Wink on the back foot. You need to move quickly in these situations otherwise the attackers dictate the pace. ""A poor knowledge of data breach laws has made the company vulnerable. They clearly didn't have a breach policy in place nor did they know who was responsible for each role or what they should be doing."" Richard says the firm should have: prepared a data breach plan with step-by-step actions to take rehearsed this plan with staff designated who is responsible for what during a breach regularly circulated and updated the plan so senior staff were familiar with it notified third-parties and suppliers gathered evidence for the Information Commissioner to show how it has handled the issue called its cyber-insurance provider for advice and help prepared a statement for customers demonstrating how it would help deal with any damage refused to pay the ransom - there's no guarantee they'd get their data back. And if your firm is the victim of a data breach, cyber expert Troy Hunt says it should: identify where the demand/ransomware came from contain infected devices (get them offline) assess how many machines have been affected restore lost data from back-ups tell customers if their data has been compromised plan to make sure this doesn't happen again.

Marriott hack hits 500 million guests,"Sheraton is one of Marriott's brands The records of 500 million customers of the hotel group Marriott International have been involved in a data breach. The hotel chain said the guest reservation database of its Starwood division had been compromised by an unauthorised party. It said an internal investigation found an attacker had been able to access the Starwood network since 2014. The company said it would notify customers whose records were in the database. Marriott International bought Starwood in 2016, creating the largest hotel chain in the world with more than 5,800 properties. Starwood's hotel brands include W Hotels, Sheraton, Le MÃ©ridien and Four Points by Sheraton. Marriott-branded hotels use a separate reservation system on a different network. Marriott said it was alerted by an internal security tool that somebody was attempting to access the Starwood database. After investigating, it discovered that an ""unauthorised party had copied and encrypted information"". It said it believed its database contained records of up to 500 million customers. For about 327 million guests, the information included ""some combination"" of: name address phone number email address passport number account information date of birth gender arrival and departure information It said some records also included encrypted payment card information, but it could not rule out the possibility that the encryption keys had also been stolen. ""We deeply regret this incident happened,"" the company said in a statement. ""Marriott reported this incident to law enforcement and continues to support their investigation.  The company has already begun notifying regulatory authorities."" The company has set up awebsite,externalto give affected customers more information. It will also offer customers in the US and some other countries a year-long subscription to a fraud-detecting service. In a statement, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office said: ""We have received a data breach report from Marriott involving its Starwood Hotels and will be making enquiries. If anyone has concerns about how their data has been handled they can report these concerns to us."" The Marriott group said it would contact affected customers whose email addresses were in the Starwood reservation database. The database contained details of reservations made on or before 10 September 2018. The company has set up a dedicatedhelp website,externalfor those affected and is also operating a free helpline. For UK customers the number is 0808 189 1065. Marriott is not certain whether the attackers were able to obtain payment information, so be aware of any suspicious transactions on your account. Also be aware that scammers may be sending out mass emails pretending to represent the Marriott group. The company says it will not include attachments in its notification emails and will not ask for personal information over email. If in doubt, call the helpline. The company is offering affected customers a year-long subscription to a fraud-checking service. by Chris Fox, technology reporter It's not the biggest data breach we've ever seen (that dubious honour goes to Yahoo!) but it's certainly up there with some of the worst. Not only were up to 500 million customer records accessed and potentially copied, but the attackers had had unauthorised access since 2014. And even though payment card information was encrypted, the company thinks the key may have been stolen too. The UK's data regulator has confirmed it is investigating, and so the threat of a whoppingGDPR penaltylooms. Although the Marriott group's headquarters are in the US, it has to comply with the EU's GDPR rules when dealing with citizens in the EU. The way it has disclosed this breach, notified customers and offered fraud-checking services will certainly help its cause. But the ICO and other international regulators may rule the company has been too slow to act. As always with a big data breach, be aware that scammers may send out emails claiming to be from the Marriott group. The hotel chain says it will not send any notification emails with attachments, and will not request any information from its customers by email. Cyber-attack!

How to save money on train fares,"No one likes spending their hard-earned money on rail fares, which areset to increase by an average of 3.1%in 2019. But like death and taxes, if you have to take the train to work, buying a ticket is somewhat unavoidable. However, there are some tricks to help keep the cost to a bare minimum. If you are travelling every day of the week, you ought to consider investing in an annual season ticket because it can save you serious amounts of money over the course of 12 months. An annual pass costs roughly the same as 10 monthly tickets - meaning you effectively get two months for free. If possible, buy your season ticket before 2 January as the existing 2018 prices still apply. It's worth checking to see if your employer offers interest-free season ticket loans. You could also pay for it with a credit card if you're lucky enough to have a 0% offer. Those aged between 16 and 25 - as well as full-time students of any age - have long been eligible for a railcard, which costs Â£30 a year and offers a third off tickets for most journeys. From 2 January anyone aged 26 to 30 will also be able to enjoy the same benefits with thenew ""millennial"" railcard,external. Buying an annual London Travelcard (known as a ""gold card"") offers the same savings on train journeys across the UK. TheFamily & Friends railcard,externalalso costs Â£30 and cuts standard anytime, off-peak and advance adult fares by a third, and reduces kids' fares by 60%. It sounds simple, but just as with air fares, the closer to your journey time the more expensive train tickets tend to be. If you know you'll be travelling on a specific date, you can book up to three months in advance for most routes - and even further out on some. There's more detail aboutadvance tickets here.,external Also, buying tickets directly from a rail operator's website, rather than a third party, can save you a booking fee. Transport Focus, the independent watchdog, advises passengers to complain if their service is disrupted. If you are delayed you may be entitled to claim compensation. Conditions vary between train operators about the length of delay before they will hand over their cash and some will only pay if the delay was the fault of the rail industry rather than strike action, for example. The percentage of the fare refunded also varies between operators. Passengers are advised to contact the train operator via email or phone depending on the company's complaints handling procedures. Include the date, time and route of your train and the full details of your complaint. Keep a copy of your complaint and of any tickets you send. Not the easiest of options, but if you have the time and patience then splitting your journey into multiple tickets can lower the overall cost. Your tickets must cover the whole journey and your train has to actually stop at that station. Mark Smith, who is behind the train blog Seat61, says the technique works best on ""obscure cross-country journeys"" rather than trains in and out of big cities. You can do it yourself on National Rail, or search for ""split ticketing"" online. If you're making a leisure journey and have the luxury of time, consider taking a coach instead. They can often be vastly cheaper than trains - particularly at peak times. Going from London to Manchester on Friday 14 December at 5pm and returning two days later will cost Â£83 on Virgin Trains, while a National Express coach would be less than Â£30. Chris Miller currently travels from Cambridge to London daily and pays just under Â£5,000 for an annual season ticket. But from February, when his season ticket runs out, he plans to switch to working from home twice a week to reduce travel costs. However, he admits: ""I am one of the lucky ones, I have an understanding manager and flexible working.""

How to avoid expensive train tickets,"Train tickets are about to get more expensive. Again. Prices are going uptwice as fast as wages, according to the TUC union. The government claims that's no longer the case. And the rail industry says it's spending Â£50bn on improving the rail network to make it more reliable and more comfortable. There are ways to pay much less for the same seat on the same journey. Here are some tips for hacking the cost of train travel, without getting into trouble. Splitting your journey into multiple tickets can lower the overall cost. Your tickets must, of course, cover the whole journey. And wherever you split your ticket, the train has to actually stop at that station. Mark Smith, who writes the train blog Seat61, says this works best on ""obscure cross-country journeys"" rather than trains in and out of big cities. You can do it yourself onNational Rail,external, or there are websites which can work it out for you. Search for ""split ticketing"". Watch this video fromBBC Three's Watchdog Wednesday... This video can not be played Watchdog looks at how to cut your train fares in half. Sounds basic, but it often works. ""The earlier you do it, the better. York to London can be Â£11,"" says Mark Smith. Train companies release their timetables at least 12 weeks ahead and some even earlier. National Rail keeps alist,externalof the earliest you can book for different train companies. You can get a 16-25 railcard if you're under 26 or a full-time student of any age. It costs Â£30 for a year and for most journeys you can get a third off the price. ""You can always save a few quid by booking with a rail operator, not a third party website,"" says Mark Smith. Ticket prices are the same across all websites, but some add a booking fee on top. If you go directly to the train company, you can avoid it. If your train is delayed by more that an hour you are entitled to a minimum 50% refund. Lots of train companies will give a refund if it's half an hour late - check with the firm you're travelling with.

Low-cal diabetes diet offered on NHS,"Thousands of people with type 2 diabetes in England are to be prescribed a very low-calorie diet in the hope of reversing their condition. Under the pilot they will be restricted to 800 calories a day, in the form of soups and shakes, for three months. When the diet was trialled last year, almost half of those involved managed to put their diabetes into remission. NHS England has also announced it's expanding a programme to prevent people developing type 2 diabetes. The health service currently spends around 10% of its budget on treating diabetes in England. Up to 5,000 patients will be prescribed the diet by the NHS initially. They will also receive follow-up support. Nine out of 10 people with diabetes in the UK have type 2, which is strongly linked to diet and lifestyle. Type 1 diabetes,external, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease that is not linked with being overweight or inactive. Isobel Murray took part in a trial of the scheme One patient who took part in a recent trial, involving 298 people, lost more than four stones (25kg) and no longer needs diabetes medication. Isobel Murray, from Largs in North Ayrshire, was on the liquid-only diet for 17 weeks, with each meal consisting of a 200-calorie sachet of powder mixed with water to make a soup or a shake. After losing weight, she was then introduced to healthy, solid meals by dieticians - but she said while the liquid diet was relatively easy, ""eating normal food is the hardest bit"". She said of the diet: ""You have to be fired up, you have to be prepared, but anybody can do it if you feel strongly enough."" Is a low-calorie crash diet right for me? Prof Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity for NHS England, acknowledged the diet is challenging and it does not suit everyone. ""But we think it is worth exploring the implementation of these programmes within the NHS so that those who could benefit, can benefit,"" he said. While type 2 diabetes can have a genetic component, it is strongly linked to being overweight or obese. About two-thirds of adults and one-third of children are currently overweight or obese, which is driving up rates of the condition. Type 2 diabetes affects 7,000 under-25s in England and Wales Type 2 diabetes signs 'detectable years before diagnosis' Diabetes is actually five separate diseases, research suggests It is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high It is caused by problems with a chemical in the body (hormone) called insulin Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can include excessive thirst, needing to urinate a lot and tiredness It can increase the risk of getting serious problems with the eyes, heart and nerves A type 2 diabetes prevention programme has been running in England for the past three years and has seen encouraging results. So far, more than 250,000 people who were on the cusp of developing type 2 diabetes have been referred to classes which offer advice and support on food, diet and exercise. On average, participants have each lost 8lb (3.6kg) in weight, greatly reducing their risk of developing the condition. Now the programme is also set to undergo a significant expansion, helping 200,000 people a year. Each of the drinks has about 200 calories Experts have previously cautioned that low-calorie diets should not be tried without any support to keep the weight off afterwards. Dieting helps lose the fat which has built up around the pancreas, allowing the organ to work properly again and produce enough of the hormone insulin. Dr Shareen Forbes, reader in diabetes and endocrinology at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""There are now a number of studies that demonstrate remission of type 2 diabetes with weight loss. ""Such interventions can have significant economic impacts given the levels of type 2 diabetes now in society. ""These are important clinical studies,"" she said. But Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said industry needed to take action too. ""The NHS pound will go further if the food industry also takes action to cut junk calories and added sugar and salt from processed food, TV suppers and fast-food takeaways,"" Mr Stevens said. The announcements come ahead of what is known as the Forward Plan for the NHS in England, in which measures that prevent ill health in the first place are expected to be heavily emphasised. Type 2 diabetes 'affects 7,000 under-25s' Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' NHS 'should recommend meal replacement shakes' 'I beat diabetes with 200-calorie drinks' Is a low-calorie crash diet right for me?

Satellites warn African farmers of pests,"""Plant doctors"" can now give local farmers that pest infestations are on their way so they can take precautions UK researchers have developed an early warning system to prevent the crops of African farmers from being devastated. The Pest Risk Information Service(Prise),externalcombines temperature data and weather forecasts with computer models. It then sends farmers a mobile phone alert so that they can take precautions. It is hoped that the system will boost yields and increase farm incomes by up to 20%. Prise is being used in Kenya, Ghana and Zambia and will be rolled out soon in other parts of the world. Prise is an upgrade of a highly successful UK Aid scheme run by the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International development charity (CABI). It uses a network of so called ""plant doctors"" and clinics to advise farmers when pests or diseases destroy their crops. Farmers and plant doctors have access to an app to help them diagnose pest infestations and suggest remedies The ""doctors"" draw on a database using an an app to help them to diagnose the issue and then prescribe the right pesticide and other measures. Walter Wafula, who grows Maize in Bungoma in Kenya, told BBC News that the service had transformed his family's lives. ""Because of the increased income from my farm, my kids can now go to a better school and the life at home has improved because I can provide the basic needs for my family,"" he said. So far, the scheme has helped 18.3 million farmers, in 34 countries across Africa, Asia and the Americas. On average farm incomes and yields are 13% higher for those using the service. The data for the Prise system will be processed by the JASMIN supercomputer data cluster in Oxfordshire But Prof Charlotte Watts, chief scientific adviser for the UK's Department for International Development, which funds the plant doctor scheme, says a new initiative with CABI and the UK Space Agency (UKSA) will use the network to prevent, rather than just mitigate infestations. She says the idea is to use satellite data collected by the UKSA to develop a system that is able to predict when pest infestations will strike a week or more in advance. Satellites can provide accurate land temperature information, which is one of the most important drivers of pest infestations. This, combined with weather data and computer models, can be used to give farmers enough time to spray pesticide and take other precautions. CABI worked with the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council, to develop the project. Prof Watts told BBC News that the early indications are that the system is working. ""Farmers are completely dependent on crops and the predictability of having a good yield to survive and also to send their kids to school,"" she said. ""So if we can reduce the impact of pests, if we can enable them to get better yields - which we are already seeing - it will mean that we can help them move out of poverty.""

Breaking|Breaking newsMarriott hack hits 500 million guestsMarriott says details of up to 500 million guests may have been accessed in a database breach.Technology,"Sheraton is one of Marriott's brands The records of 500 million customers of the hotel group Marriott International have been involved in a data breach. The hotel chain said the guest reservation database of its Starwood division had been compromised by an unauthorised party. It said an internal investigation found an attacker had been able to access the Starwood network since 2014. The company said it would notify customers whose records were in the database. Marriott International bought Starwood in 2016, creating the largest hotel chain in the world with more than 5,800 properties. Starwood's hotel brands include W Hotels, Sheraton, Le MÃ©ridien and Four Points by Sheraton. Marriott-branded hotels use a separate reservation system on a different network. Marriott said it was alerted by an internal security tool that somebody was attempting to access the Starwood database. After investigating, it discovered that an ""unauthorised party had copied and encrypted information"". It said it believed its database contained records of up to 500 million customers. For about 327 million guests, the information included ""some combination"" of: name address phone number email address passport number account information date of birth gender arrival and departure information It said some records also included encrypted payment card information, but it could not rule out the possibility that the encryption keys had also been stolen. ""We deeply regret this incident happened,"" the company said in a statement. ""Marriott reported this incident to law enforcement and continues to support their investigation.  The company has already begun notifying regulatory authorities."" The company has set up awebsite,externalto give affected customers more information. It will also offer customers in the US and some other countries a year-long subscription to a fraud-detecting service. In a statement, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office said: ""We have received a data breach report from Marriott involving its Starwood Hotels and will be making enquiries. If anyone has concerns about how their data has been handled they can report these concerns to us."" The Marriott group said it would contact affected customers whose email addresses were in the Starwood reservation database. The database contained details of reservations made on or before 10 September 2018. The company has set up a dedicatedhelp website,externalfor those affected and is also operating a free helpline. For UK customers the number is 0808 189 1065. Marriott is not certain whether the attackers were able to obtain payment information, so be aware of any suspicious transactions on your account. Also be aware that scammers may be sending out mass emails pretending to represent the Marriott group. The company says it will not include attachments in its notification emails and will not ask for personal information over email. If in doubt, call the helpline. The company is offering affected customers a year-long subscription to a fraud-checking service. by Chris Fox, technology reporter It's not the biggest data breach we've ever seen (that dubious honour goes to Yahoo!) but it's certainly up there with some of the worst. Not only were up to 500 million customer records accessed and potentially copied, but the attackers had had unauthorised access since 2014. And even though payment card information was encrypted, the company thinks the key may have been stolen too. The UK's data regulator has confirmed it is investigating, and so the threat of a whoppingGDPR penaltylooms. Although the Marriott group's headquarters are in the US, it has to comply with the EU's GDPR rules when dealing with citizens in the EU. The way it has disclosed this breach, notified customers and offered fraud-checking services will certainly help its cause. But the ICO and other international regulators may rule the company has been too slow to act. As always with a big data breach, be aware that scammers may send out emails claiming to be from the Marriott group. The hotel chain says it will not send any notification emails with attachments, and will not request any information from its customers by email. Cyber-attack!

"Ukraine bars Russian men from entryThe measure is part of martial law imposed in 10 regions, amid fears of a Russian land invasion.Europe","Martial law is in force in regions bordering Russia, including Donetsk near the front line with rebels Ukraine will not allow Russian men aged 16-60 into the country following the imposition of martial law, Kiev says. An exception would be made for ""humanitarian cases"" such as those travelling to funerals. Russia says it is not planning retaliatory measures. Martial law has been imposed in 10 Ukrainian regions until 26 December. This came as Ukraine's president voiced fears of a Russian invasion after Russian forces fired on and seized three Ukrainian boats and 24 sailors. Ukraine said Sunday's incident in the Black Sea was a flagrant violation of international law, while Russia says the vessels violated its territorial waters. It is the most dangerous clash at sea off Crimea since Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014. Why Ukraine-Russia sea clash is fraught with risk Who controls the waters? Russia-Ukraine sea clash in 300 words The restrictions were announced after President Petro Poroshenko met the country's top security officials, including border guard chiefs, in Kiev. The president tweeted (in Ukrainian) thatthe ban was designed to prevent the formation of ""private armies"" in Ukraine,external. He was referring to Russian-backed separatists who formed units in April 2014 to fight Ukrainian government forces in eastern Ukraine. Mr Poroshenko also said registration criteria would be tightened for Russian citizens in the regions under martial law. On Tuesday, he warned there was a threat of ""full-scale war"" with Russia. ""The number of [Russian] tanks at bases located along our border has grown three times,"" the president said. Five of the 10 regions border Russia while two are adjacent to Moldova's breakaway Trans-Dniester region, where Russian troops are stationed. The other three regions border the Black Sea or Sea of Azov close to Crimea. The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Kiev says the ban could have a devastating impact on cross-border travel as the holiday period approaches. Many Russians have relatives living in Ukraine. Reacting to the Ukrainian ban, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow was not planning ""mirror"" measures as this ""could result in full madness"". Russia earlier said the 30-day martial law in Ukraine had been declared in order to potentially suspend presidential elections set for 31 March. It said President Poroshenko - whose approval ratings have plummeted - would then be the main beneficiary. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ukraine's SBU state security service has searched the property of a senior Russian-backed Orthodox priest in Voronkiv, a village about 50km (30 miles) from Kiev. SBU agents raided the residence of Metropolitan Pavel outside Kiev (pictured) The SBU said Metropolitan Pavel was suspected of inciting religious hostility. He is father-superior of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra monastery, one of the most revered sites in Orthodox Christianity. He told journalists that he was resident at the monastery, not in Voronkiv. He admitted criticising Filaret, leader of the Kiev Patriarchate, but denied fomenting religious hostility. The branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church loyal to Filaret has been recognised as independent by the Constantinople Patriarchate, Orthodox Christianity's highest authority. The dispute has soured centuries-old ties between Ukrainian and Russian clergy and exacerbated Kiev-Moscow tensions. Five reasons why Orthodox Church split matters Metropolitan Pavel says he is being subjected to pressure and threats Stricter checks are now expected at border crossings. Although the ban applies to all points of entry into Ukraine, the main focus is likely to be on the nearly 2,000km (1243 miles) Ukrainian-Russian land border. Soon after the conflict began in 2014, Ukraine started building a ""wall"" - a system of fortifications along the border. However, the project is still unfinished due to lack of funds. To further complicate the matter, hundreds of kilometres of Ukraine's border are de facto controlled by Russia and pro-Russian separatists in the east. With no direct flights between Ukraine and Russia, Kiev-Moscow trains have become popular Meanwhile, checkpoints have been set up between Ukraine and Russian-annexed Crimea in the south and also on the line of separation between Ukraine and two self-proclaimed rebel republics in the east. And even before Friday's ban, Ukraine had already put restrictions on Russian nationals wanting to visit Ukraine. A number of them have been deported for failing to explain the purpose of their visit, Ukraine says. Russian nationals - as well as other foreigners - are routinely denied entry into Ukraine if they have visited Crimea or the self-proclaimed republics not via Ukrainian-controlled points of entry. Kiev has also stopped direct flights between Ukraine and Russia. At least three of the 24 Ukrainians were injured when the Russian coast guard and special forces attacked their vessels last Sunday. One of the detained Ukrainian sailors (C) is escorted by a Russian security service officer in Crimea A court in Crimea later ordered the Ukrainians to be detained for 60 days, despite an international outcry. US President Donald Trump cancelled a planned meeting at the G20 summit in Argentina with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over the issue. Trump cancels Putin talks The sailors are accused of illegally crossing into Russia. They are not treated by Russia as prisoners of war.

'Controlling' man stamped partner to death,"Dzilva Butiene, 48, had more than 60 bruises and marks on her body An isolated and vulnerable woman who faced alcoholism and cancer was stamped to death by the controlling partner she had relied on, a report has found. Mother-of-two Dzilva Butiene was murdered by Kestutis Bauzys - who had convinced her to move from Lithuania to England - in Wisbech, in April 2017. ADomestic Homicide Review,externalsaid Ms Butiene, 48, who spoke limited English, ""seemed to have nowhere to turn to"". The report said it was likely others would be ""in a very similar position"". When the body of Ms Butiene was discovered in the flat they shared in the Cambridgeshire town, she had more than 60 bruises and marks on her chest and abdomen. Bauzys wasjailed for life with a minimum of 17-and-a-half years. Although the report is anonymised, the BBC understands it relates to Ms Butiene's death. Kestutis Bauzys had been in a relationship with the woman for about four years A report, made by Fenland Community Safety Partnership (FCSP), said Ms Butiene was unable to find consistent work after her treatment for cervical cancer in 2014, had few close friends and very limited English and was unaware of any support agencies. ""She appears to have become reliant on the perpetrator for her needs,"" it said. ""It is difficult to imagine how her life must have been, given that she seems to have had nowhere to turn to, or been aware of how she could have sought support."" Ms Butiene's body was found in Orange Grove, Wisbech Ms Butiene and Bauzys had known each other from school and he persuaded her to move to the UK, where he was already living, ""on the promise of a better lifestyle"" in September 2013. She was described as a ""tiny, meek woman"" by a previous employer, while he was known to be a body builder who used steroids. When Ms Butiene was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn for a seizure and spasms in November 2016 she told staff she was depressed ""but said that by agreement with her partner she had agreed not to disclose this to hospital staff"". Bauzys also told staff he injected her with magnesium sulphate.

Mum dies after breast enlargement surgery,"Louise Harvey died at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital almost three weeks after a breast enlargement operation in London A mother-of-three died from a blood clot 17 days after undergoing breast enlargement surgery. Beauty therapist Louise Harvey, 36, of Norwich, died on 5 July following her operation in London. An inquest into her death was opened on Tuesday and adjourned for a full hearing on 26 March. It is understood she was a patient of Transform Cosmetic Surgery which said it conducted an internal investigation and passed the outcome to the coroner. ""We can confirm that a patient passed away on 5 July 2018, nearly three weeks after undergoing a procedure at a Transform hospital,"" it added. ""We are deeply saddened by this and have undertaken a full internal investigation.

What caused the train chaos?,"British commuters have faced cancellationsand delays since a timetable change was introduced on 20 May. What was dubbed the ""greatest timetable change for a generation"" has left Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway customers facing travel disruption from London and the South East to Newcastle, Nottingham, Merseyside and Greater Manchester. These charts explore the current state of rail travel in Great Britain. In 2016-17, 1.7 billion passengers travelled on the British train network, with journeys adding up to 65.8 billion kilometres. Since 1994, the total number of passengers has increased by 135% - making trains a lot busier since privatisation. Half of these journeys were on just four networks, primarily covering southern England: Govia Thameslink Railway South Western Railway London Overground Southeastern A large proportion of train travel takes place in London and the south of England. But rail represents just 2.6% of all trips, according to the National Travel Survey. Most journeys by English residents were by car (75.5%), walking (8.4%) or bus (7.2%). One way to measure train performance is punctuality - the proportion of trains reaching their final destination on time. Just under 90% of all trains arrived within five minutes of their scheduled times in the past year for London, the South East and regional services, or 10 minutes for long-distance operators. But, a breakdown by franchise can shed light on why some passengers might be more upset than others. Govia Thameslink Railway, the company that owns Southern Rail, and Virgin East Coast Main Line saw nearly 20% of their trains delayed. Reality Check: When is a train on time? Focusing on cancellations and severe delays (more than 30 minutes) brings up similar results. Once again, First Hull Trains is the worst performing train operating company. This might be explained by its size. With just one million passengers last year, it is one of the smallest in Great Britain. That means a few cancellations could disproportionately affect its statistics. In comparison, Govia Thameslink Railway has more than 320 million annual passengers. With 6% of trains cancelled or severely delayed, the scale of disruption would be far greater. The average price for a train journey (taking inflation as measured by the retail price index into account) has gradually gone down since 1999. From 1999 to 2016, the average price paid per single journey decreased from Â£5.79 to Â£5.46. Prices peaked in 2008 at Â£6.04, according to the Rail Delivery Group. This covers journeys made on rail franchises in Great Britain - excluding the London Underground and open-access operators such as Grand Central or First Hull Trains. Open-access operators don't receive subsidy from, or pay any premium to, the Department for Transport. Last month, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents all rail companies, launched a public consultation on fares in the UK. It says about 55 million different fares exist in the current system, so customers aren't always offered the cheapest available. In 2016-17, the UK rail industry generated Â£19bn in income. About half of that was generated by passengers. Passenger fares accounted for Â£9.7bn, while on-train catering and car parking generated Â£0.8bn. Income from passengers increased by 1.1% on the year before. According to theOffice of Rail and Road,external(ORR), this was due to a combination of more journeys and higher fares. Overall, the industry received 21% of its total income from the government. The ORR said that this funding was a mixture of grants for the government-owned Network Rail, support for franchises and the rail freight industry. The biggest item of expenditure in 2016-17 was operating services. Train operators spent Â£11.3bn on costs such as staff salaries and rolling stock, as well as payments to the Department for Transport. More than one million passengers departed from London train stations on the average autumn weekday in 2016, according to theDepartment for Transport,external. Birmingham and Manchester followed, with more than 123,012 and 99,019 departures. Waterloo was the busiest station in the English capital in 2016, when 218,000 passengers departed from the station on a typical autumn weekday. Next in line were Victoria and St Pancras International at 197,000 and 131,000 passengers.

Rail timetable chaos criticism,"This video can not be played Transport secretary Chris Grayling: Passengers were let down ""No-one took charge"" during the timetable chaos that caused severe disruption on Britain's railways in May, a regulator has said. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) blamed a lack of ""responsibility and accountability"" and said passengers were ""badly treated"". It said track manager Network Rail, two train operators and the Department for Transport ""had all made mistakes"". It came as the government promised a major review of Britain's railways. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling - who had previously insisted: ""I don't run the railways"" - told the BBC's Today programme that the problem was system-wide and that it was his job to ""make sure it doesn't happen again"". He said he had taken at ""face value"" assurances by industry-leaders that they were ready to make the changes. The unhappy face of rail travellers From 20 May, passengers suffered delays and cancellations after the rail industry attempted to introduce the biggest timetable change in a generation. The upgrade - which involved changes to 46% of train times - mainly affected Northern Trains in the north west of England and Govia Thameslink (GTR) routes into London. The ORR assessed the causes, consequences and management of the disruption Over a period of several weeks, GTR and Northern cancelled up to 470 and 310 scheduled trains respectively each weekday. ORR chairman Prof Stephen Glaister said: ""Good intentions and over-optimism within the rail industry about its ability to recover missed deadlines left no time to uncover and fix problems. Rail timetable chaos inquiry launched Northern axe trains in timetable reshuffle ""When problems arose, timetable planners were stretched and train operators were ill-equipped to help passengers."" Prof Glaister told the BBC ""it was unclear"" who should have the responsibility for tackling the problems. But, following a three-month inquiry, the ORR found the causes of the botched rollout dated back years. These included delays with Network Rail's electrification work in northern England, as well as late changes to the Thameslink programme. This pushed back the development of the timetable and gave train operators less time to prepare for the introduction of new services. Rail users expressed their frustrations at Manchester Piccadilly during the disruption The ORR also said that: Network Rail was best placed to manage these risks but did not take sufficient action Neither GTR or Northern were prepared for the disruption that arose, nor did they do enough to provide accurate information to passengers Both the Department for Transport (DfT) and the ORR itself failed in their duties to oversee the industry Prof Glaister told the BBC that the ORR itself had failings - like everyone else in the industry. ""We took on trust what we were told,"" he said. ""What happened here is that railway people have a tradition of sorting out problems as they occur. ""That led to complacency when in the process of planning the timetables - deadlines were missed, late decisions were made so that operators didn't have time to deliver a proper service on the day."" Tom Burridge, Transport correspondent This report underlines an inherent weakness in our rail system; No single entity or person is in overall control. The mayhem resulting from a complicated shake-up of timetables on Northern and Govia Thameslink was the product of systemic failings over several months. But as the problems built up on both Network Rail and Govia Thameslink in the run-up to the launch of the new schedules, it seems that no-one properly flagged up the risks and the potential that it all might go badly wrong. Officials from Network Rail, the Department for Transport (DfT) and the train companiesweremeeting. Industry sources say DfT officials were briefed that things weren't going to plan. The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says he received the necessary assurances from the train companies. So the infamous and well-known British train blame game rolls on. Andrew Haines, the boss of Network Rail, offered his ""sincerest apologies to passengers for letting them down with May's timetable troubles"". ""A whole system approach to timetable planning must be the way ahead and we have already started on that path with the new winter timetable due in December that will see some modest improvements."" The DfT said it welcomed the ORR's findings and called May's disruption ""unacceptable"". The resignation of Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR,was announced in June. Mr Grayling, when asked if other resignations were needed, said the report found Northern Rail's problems were linked to local infrastructure problems. Northern Rail said the report found ""that the root cause of the timetable disruption was delays to engineering projects to improve the railway"". It said train operators were usually given 40 weeks to plan the twice-yearly introduction but had to rewrite its May 2018 timetable in 16 weeks. The company added it was ""deeply sorry"" for the disruption, saying it had reinstated 151 of the 165 services hit by the problems. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group which represents train companies and Network Rail, said the rail industry was determined to learn from the issues to avoid a repeat. He added: ""The structural issues highlighted in this report underline the need for the wide-ranging, root and branch rail review we have been calling for to deliver meaningful reform."" The government has also launched what it called the most significant review of the rail industry since privatisation, headed by former British Airways boss Keith Williams. It comes amid significant challenges, with punctuality at a 12-year low and commuters facing an increase of up to 3.2% in the cost of season tickets from January. The DfT said the review would consider all parts of the sector, including accountability, the franchising system and value for money for passengers and taxpayers. Mr Grayling told the BBC: ""The fragmentation of the industry today doesn't work"". ""What I am absolutely certain of is we need an integrated railway"". He pointed to Japan where the rail companies were integrated and  London where contracts were performance-related. Labour wantsto nationalise the industrybut Mr Grayling told the BBC: ""It's not about ownership... it's about the pressure on the system.""

Network Rail told to improve,"The rail regulator has ordered Network Rail, which manages tracks and other infrastructure, to improve its performance The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said punctuality and reliability on the UK's rail network were at their worst for five years. If Network Rail fails to comply with the ORR's demands it could be fined. Network Rail's boss said it took responsibility for its part in poor train service reliability. It is the first time in a decade that the ORR has issued such an order against publicly-owned Network Rail. The regulator said extreme weather and problems implementing the May 2018 timetable had contributed to the poor performance. It said the recent disruption on the railways had not always been Network Rail's fault. However, it added, there were concerns about Network Rail's ability to restore services in a timely fashion, after problems had occurred. Rail delays are 'worst for five years' Network rail to put new projects on hold The announcement follows a series of recent independent reviews into train performance, which have highlighted many areas where Network Rail, and some train companies, must improve. The ORR is demanding that Network Rail work more closely with train operators to address the findings of the reviews into performance on the network. It has ordered Network Rail to report back by mid-February and outline how it will improve its ability to recover services after there are incidents on the network. Four years ago the ORR fined Network Rail Â£50m. Some of that money was invested in improving on-board passenger services on trains, including faster wifi. ""Today's decision is a clear demonstration of ORR's approach to how we will hold Network Rail to account,"" said the ORR's chief executive, John Larkinson. ""Passengers and freight customers rely on Network Rail for punctual and reliable train services and the evidence we have collected suggests to us that Network Rail is failing to take all reasonable steps to effectively manage performance and recover from incidents on its network."" ""This is a capability issue which must be addressed urgently,"" he said. Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, said: ""We know that train performance has not been what our passengers deserve. We have let them down and we take responsibility for the part we have played in poor train service reliability. ""Network Rail is fully committed to leading the industry back to higher levels of performance both through our own measures and actions and by working closely with our industry partners."" The ORR also found Network Rail was better placed to ""deliver efficiently"" in its next five-year funding period called CP6, which starts in April 2019, compared with the same point five years ago. ""We are pleased that the ORR has acknowledged the progress we have made in preparing for CP6, including by establishing work banks, securing network access for planned engineering works and building up maintenance resources,"" Mr Haines said. Separately, the Department for Transport is expected to soon announce how it will punish Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) to account for the chaotic introduction of a new timetable, with more services, in May following weeks of negotiations.

Australian students in mass climate protest,"Protests were organised in 27 places across Australia Thousands of Australian school students have urged greater action on climate change in protests across the country. The students skipped school on Friday to highlight what they say are inadequate climate policies by the Australian government. On Monday, Australian PM Scott Morrison rebuked their plans for ""activism"" during school hours and insisted his government was tackling climate change. Many students said his remarks had bolstered their resolve to protest. ""We will be the ones suffering the consequences of the decisions they [politicians] make today,"" protester Jagveer Singh, 17, told the BBC. Organisers say they were inspired by Greta Thunberg,a 15-year-old girl in Sweden who has undertaken similar protests. Students protest in central Sydney on Friday Australia has committed to reducing its emissions by 26-28% on 2005 levels by 2030, under the Paris climate agreement. Mr Morrison most recently cited a renewable energy target, a clean energy purchasing fund, and a hydropower project as evidence of Australia's progress. He told parliament on Monday: ""What we want is more learning in schools and less activism in schools."" Resources Minister Matt Canavan, meanwhile, angered protesters by saying students would not learn anything from ""walking off school and protesting"". ""The best thing you learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole [welfare] queue because that's what your future life will look like,"" he told a radio interviewer. Many students held placards criticising the government, and PM Morrison specifically. ""I hate ScoMo [Scott Morrison] more than I hate school,"" one said. Earlier this week,the UN said Australia and many nations were falling short of their emission commitments. Australia had made ""no improvement"" in its climate policy since last year, according tothe emissions gap report,external. School Strike 4 Climate Action protests have been held in every state capital and 20 regional towns. The BBC asked several students why they were taking part. Milou Albrect (l) and Harriet O'Shea Carre organised the protest The idea started with Milou Albrect and Harriet O'Shea Carre, both 14, in the state of Victoria. ""The climate change emergency is something we have been thinking about for a long time,"" Harriet said. ""We wrote letters and did different things but they never seemed to make a difference. Really, education, is our only power. By sacrificing that [on Friday], it's making a big point."" Milou said: ""We want our government to acknowledge publicly that climate change is a crisis. Stop digging coal, stop making new coal mines, switch to renewable energy."" Visiting Australia's controversial Adani mine Jean Hinchcliffe, 14, organised a rally in Sydney Jean Hinchcliffe, 14, saw the idea to protest grow in Victoria and decided to start one in her home city, Sydney. ""I can't just sit around until I'm old enough to vote,"" she said. ""Everyone, all young people, we can see that climate change is a real issue and we're completely sick of politicians' inaction. ""It's really scary for us, to see how it's going to impact our future,"" she said, citing fears about rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Ruby Walker says her generation has grown up thinking about climate change Ruby Walker, 16, organised a protest in her town of Inverell, about 570km (350 miles) north of Sydney, after seeing others' plans on Facebook. She had also been inspired by the activism of high school students in the US during environment and gun control debates, she said. ""I think social media is a big part of it.

Boy's letter to dad in heaven gets reply,"Jase Hyndman with his dad when he was a toddler A boy who sent a birthday card to his dad ""in heaven"" received a touching letter from the Royal Mail to say it had been delivered safely. Jase Hyndman, seven, from West Lothian, received the letter assuring him his message to his father James had made it through the ""difficult"" journey. His mother Teri Copland said: ""I actually cannot state how emotional he is knowing his dad got his card. ""Royal Mail you've just restored my faith in humanity."" In response to Jase's envelope requesting to be sent to ""heaven"", Royal Mail's Sean Milligan said: ""I just wanted to take this opportunity to contact you about how we succeeded in the delivery of your letter, to your dad in heaven. ""This was a difficult challenge avoiding stars and other galactic objects on route to heaven,"" the note added. It concluded: ""I will continue to do all I can to ensure delivery to heaven safely."" The Facebook post with Royal Mail's response to Jase was shared more than 200,000 times. Jase and his 10-year-old sister Neive mark the occasion of their father's birthday every year since he died in May 2014. Ms Copland said: ""He was overwhelmed and kept saying 'my dad really got my letter mum'... I've always told Neive and Jase even if you can't get anyone a present it's always nice to make sure you send a card at Christmas and birthdays. ""I want people to realise that a small gesture of kindness can have such a fantastic impact on someone's life... Royal Mail actually took part and that gives me so much comfort.""

Takeaway gave customer kidney failure,"A further eight customers at Blakenall One Call Peri Peri Chicken in Walsall suffered food poisoning after a salmonella outbreak in July 2017 The owner of a chicken takeaway that left a customer in a critical condition with kidney failure has been handed a suspended prison sentence. A further eight customers at Blakenall One Call Peri Peri Chicken in Walsall suffered food poisoning after a salmonella outbreak in July 2017. Muhammed Khan, 30, of West Bromwich Road, showed a ""flagrant disregard"" for safety, Walsall council said. He was handed a six-month suspended sentence at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Khan admitted six charges of failing to comply with EU provision concerning food safety and hygiene during an earlier hearing at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court. This included the selling of food unfit for human consumption - such as pizzas and doner meat contaminated with salmonella bacteria, and failing to have proper safety measures and food management systems in place to prevent the contamination of high risk food. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Walsall Council environmental health officers visited the takeaway in the summer. Salmonella was found on a kitchen sponge and on a doner kebab cutter It sent environmental swabs for analysis which identified salmonella enteritis on a kitchen sponge, on a food preparation sink and on the doner kebab cutter. ""As a consequence of the food hygiene failings eight people suffered acute food poisoning - one patient's symptoms were so severe that he suffered renal failure, needed critical care and had a two-week stay in hospital,"" Walsall Council said. Khan was also ordered to pay costs of more than Â£700 to the victims ""for expenses they incurred as a consequence of the poisoning"" and has been banned as a food operator. Snow leopard shot dead after escaping Father Christmas 'must be a man' Lorry sheds load of beer on slip road It was his second custodial sentence after he was jailed for six-months in prison for similar offences at another of his food outlets: Pizza Cottage in Caldmore.

Another 50 pilot whales die off NZ,"The only surviving whale was too badly injured to be saved Fifty-one pilot whales have died after becoming stranded on a beach on the Chatham Islands off New Zealand. The mass stranding means more than 200 whales have died in separate incidents over the past week in the region. New Zealand's Department of Conservation says between 80 and 90 whales were found to have become stranded in Hanson Bay on Thursday. Several dozen managed to refloat themselves but 50 were found dead and one had to be put down. 'The night I found 145 stranded whales' ""There was no likelihood of being able to successfully save the remaining whale. Sadly, the decision was made to euthanise. It was the most humane thing to do,"" said DOC's Chatham Islands Operations Manager, Dave Carlton. ""This is always an awful decision to have to make."" The dead are being buried close to the beach on the remote island As is common practice in New Zealand, officials are working closely with local Maori communities to arrange for the handling of the whales. They are being buried in the sand just behind the beach. The DoC said skin and blubber samples were being taken for analysis. The remote and sparsely populated Chatham Islands are about 800km (500 miles) off the east coast of New Zealand's South Island. The deaths there come less than a week after145 pilot whales were found dead on a remote beachin New Zealand's far south Stewart Island. Many of the whales had severe injuries from being caught in the shallow water Ten pygmy whales were also found dead on a beach in Northland on Sunday. Whale strandings are not uncommon in New Zealand, but mass incidents are rare and the cause is rarely clear. Officials say it could be the whales make navigational errors, lose their way in bad weather or while escaping predators, or that they fall victim to illness.

Top UK tech boss in US fraud charges,"Mike Lynch's lawyers say he will ""vigorously defend the charges"" Mike Lynch, the former chief executive of software giant Autonomy, has been charged with fraud in the US. The charge, which carries a maximum term of 20 years,,externalrelates to Autonomy's $11bn sale in 2011 to computer giant Hewlett-Packard. Autonomy was seen as a runaway British success at the time of its sale. Mr Lynch's lawyers say he will ""vigorously defend the charges"". Mr Lynch has now stepped down as a government scientific adviser. ""Dr. Lynch has decided to resign his membership of the CST [Council for Science and Technology] with immediate effect. We appreciate the valuable contribution he has made to the CST in recent years,"" a government spokesperson said. The court documents say Mr Lynch made $815m fraudulently from the 14 charges levelled at him. A Cambridge graduate who built Autonomy up to be one of the top 100 UK public companies Has an OBE for services to enterprise Is a fellow of the Royal Society Was previously on the boards of the British Library and the BBC Autonomy was founded by Mr Lynch in 1996. It developed software that could extract useful information from ""unstructured"" sources such as phone-calls, emails or video, and then do things such as suggest answers to a call-centre operator or monitor TV channels for words or subjects. Before it was bought by Hewlett-Packard, it had headquarters in San Francisco and Cambridge. In 2010, about 68% of Autonomy's reported revenues came from the US and elsewhere in the Americas. In 2012, a year after the takeover, HP wrote off three-quarters of the value of Autonomy. Earlier this year, Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy's former finance chief was found guilty of fraud. According to this week's charges, between 2009 and 2011, Mr Lynch and Stephen Chamberlain, vice president of finance, along with other co-conspirators, artificially inflated Autonomy's revenues by overstating them. The two are also accused of making misleading statements to regulators and market analysts covering the company. The charge sheet also says they ""intimidated, pressured and paid off persons who raised complaints about or openly criticised Autonomy's financial practices and performance"". Mr Lynch's lawyers, Chris Morvillo of Clifford Chance and Reid Weingarten of Steptoe & Johnson, said in a statement that the indictment was ""a travesty of justice"". The statement said Mr Lynch was a ""world-leading entrepreneur who started from nothing"" and was being made a scapegoat for HP's failures. It called the allegations ""stale"" and said they amounted to a business dispute over the application of UK accounting standards, something which is the subject of a civil case with HP in the English courts. HP issued a statement welcoming the start of proceedings: ""HPE is gratified that justice prevailed and that Mr Hussain was held accountable for his criminal actions when he was convicted in April of this year. ""HPE is now pleased to learn that Dr Lynch and Mr Chamberlain have also been criminally charged in this matter by a federal Grand Jury. ""HPE believes that the facts uncovered during the course of this matter will further demonstrate the harm that was caused by Dr Lynch, Mr Chamberlain, Mr Hussain and others to HP and looks forward to seeing justice served once again."" By Simon Jack, BBC business editor Mike Lynch was a rock star in UK technology circles. The company he founded, Autonomy, was one of the jewels in the crown of what became known as Silicon Fen - a high tech cluster of businesses grouped around Cambridge University- and drawing on its talent pool. The sale of Autonomy for $11bn to Hewlett-Packard was trumpeted as proof positive the UK could grow businesses to be the envy of the world's biggest tech giants. The deal made its founders very rich and hopes were high that they would go on to propagate a new generation of businesses in the way Paypal alumni - such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel - did in California. However, within a year, HP declared Autonomy had been wearing the Emperor's new clothes. Revenues had been massively inflated, it said, and the US company wrote off nearly $9bn of the $11bn it had paid. Mike Lynch has always denied the charges - saying any discrepancies were down to different accounting methods of recognising revenue.

Smoking banned in Scottish prisons,"Scotland's prisons are smoke-free after tobacco sales ceased last week Scotland has introduced a smoking ban in prisons as part of an effort to help inmates quit. It is estimated about 72% of Scottish prisoners smoke regularly, although sales of tobacco ceased in last week in preparation for the ban on Friday. Vaping is still allowed and the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) has offered e-cigarette kits free of charge to prisoners who want them. The SPS chief executive said the ban would bring ""significant improvements"". The date of the ban was announced following a major report into prison workers' exposure to second-hand smoke in July 2017. Prisoners to be offered free vaping kits ahead of tobacco ban New law in Scotland bans e-cigarettes sales to under-18s The study showed levels of second-hand smoke in some cells were similar to levels found in bars before Scotland's 2006 smoking ban. It also said prison staff were exposed to similar levels of smoke as someone who lived with a smoker. The report prompted the SPS to commit to making Scotland's prisonssmoke-free by the end of 2018. A similar ban has already been introduced in many prisons in England. Prisoners were previously allowed to smoke in cells and some outside areas on prison sites, while staff were not permitted to smoke. The SPS has worked with partner agencies on a number of services to help inmates quit such as cessation groups and access to nicotine replacements in every jail. Free vaping kits are still on offer but will be sold at normal prices from April. SPS chief executive Colin McConnell acknowledged it would be ""difficult"" for prisoners to give up smoking. He added: ""The percentage of people who smoke in prisons is much higher than the community at large. ""I fully understand how difficult it has been, and will continue to be, for many in our care to give up smoking and that is why we are committed to working alongside our partners in the NHS to provide every support possible to assist them. ""Having a smoke free prisons estate in Scotland will bring significant improvements to health, quality of life, and sense of wellbeing and assist in the reduction of health inequalities for all those in our care."" Public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said: ""Smoking kills around one in five people in Scotland, and four times as many people smoke in prisons as across Scotland as a whole. ""Providing a smoke-free environment in prisons will help create a Scotland where we reduce the use of and harm from tobacco and help achieve our aim of a tobacco-free generation."" However, Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said smoking was one of the few pleasures many prisoners had. He added: ""At the very least inmates should be allowed to light up outside, in an exercise yard or designated smoking area.""

Charlottesville driver 'acted in anger',"Heather Heyer died after being struck by the car in Charlottesville A man who drove his car into a crowd of protesters in Virginia, killing a woman, was motivated by ""anger"", prosecutors said at the start of his trial. James Alex Fields Jr, 21, is accused of murder and causing serious injury in Charlottesville in August 2017. Heather Heyer, 32, died when the car hit a group of people protesting against a white nationalist rally. Mr Fields's lawyers say he acted out of fear for his own safety. Charlottesville: 'A battle for the soul of America' In opening statements at the trial, the defence and prosecution both agreed that Mr Fields, from Ohio, had driven his car into the crowd but they disputed his intent. Alex Fields Jr (l) was pictured taking part in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia The white supremacist rally was one of the largest such gatherings in America in decades. Dozens were injured in the violence that erupted between white nationalists and counter-protesters. The ""Unite the Right"" march was organised to protest against plans to remove a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. Graphic video of the incident involving Mr Fields's car was widely shared on social media. The rise of the alt-right Are US right-wing groups on the rise? Prosecutor Nina Antony said that photographic and video evidence would show that Mr Fields's actions were pre-meditated and not motivated by self-protection, as the defence would argue. She said that months before the incident, the reputed far-right sympathiser had posted pictures on Instagram showing a group of people being struck by a car. ""On August 12, James Alex Fields Jr was here in Charlottesville with anger and images of violence fixed in his mind. The case is about his decision to act on that anger and those images,"" she said. The white nationalist rally in Charlottesville was the biggest such event in America in decades Among those who gave witness statements was Brendan Gilmore who said he had started filming on his mobile phone when he saw the car approach the crowd. ""I heard a sickening sound and saw bodies going everywhere,"" he said. Another witness was Marcus Martin who was photographed being thrown into the air by the force of the impact. He suffered a broken leg and ankle. He described Heather Heyer as ""a great person"". Defence lawyer John Hill said the rally and counter-protest had descended into pitched battles with some people armed with guns. He said that after his client was detained he had expressed remorse and told police that he ""feared for his safety and that he was scared to death"". The trial continues. The rally attracted a large counter-protest and clashes broke out 'A battle for the soul of America' Why US right-wing groups are on the rise YouTube's neo-Nazi music problem Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Merkel plane diverted after technical hitchThe German chancellor will miss the start of the G20 in Argentina after her flight had to turn back.Europe,"Chancellor Merkel returned to German soil far earlier than planned, carrying an umbrella in the Cologne rain German Chancellor Angela Merkel missed the opening of the G20 summit in Argentina after her plane was forced to land shortly after leaving Berlin. The plane carrying Mrs Merkel's team turned back while flying over the Netherlands late on Thursday, because of a communications failure. The Airbus made a safe but unscheduled landing in Cologne. Mrs Merkel flew to Madrid on Friday then boarded a scheduled Iberia airlines flight to Buenos Aires. Among her fellow passengers on board the Iberia flight was AgustÃ­n AgÃ¼ero, who tweeted a picture of the chancellor on board. Allow Twitter content?

On Thursday evening the captain of Mrs Merkel's plane told those on board that he had decided to turn back after the ""malfunction of several electronic systems"". The plane's communications system went down and the crew had to use a satellite phone to contact air traffic controllers, Germany's Spiegel website reported. Russia-Ukraine crisis clouds G20 summit G20: Why Trump and Xi won't make a deal World leaders gather for G20 summit The problem is thought to have been with an electronic distribution box, which controls both the radio and discharge of aviation fuel. At no time was there any risk to the lives of passengers, a spokeswoman for Mrs Merkel stressed. The German air force denied suggestions that the plane's electronics could have been sabotaged. ""There's is absolutely no indication of a criminal background,"" a spokesman said. An added problem for the plane was that Cologne airport's longer runway was unavailable, Spiegel added. As the A340 had to slow down quickly and it was still fully laden with fuel, its braking system overheated and the fire brigade met the plane on the tarmac. The German delegation was kept on the plane for some time before officials decided to travel by bus to a hotel in Bonn. The plane was met on the tarmac in Cologne by emergency vehicles The chancellor and a smaller delegation including the finance minister travelled to Madrid on an air force plane on Friday morning before leaving for Argentina on an Iberia plane, a spokesman said. Mrs Merkel's husband was among those on the initial flight who remained in Germany. Although there is a standby government plane for long-haul flights, no crew was available to fly it, German media report. Organising an alternative route proved a headache for the German government, as Mrs Merkel's entourage had to include several security officials. The chancellor missed the ""family photo"" at the start of the G20 summit and officials were trying to reschedule planned bilateral meetings with national leaders. German TV's satirical Heute Show tweeted an image showing three other G20 leaders arriving alongside an airport baggage hall, with the caption: ""Merkel decided on an alternative arrival.""

The chancellor had been due to have talks on Friday with President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping but was due to arrive in Buenos Aires only by  early evening. Amid the continuing crisis over Russia's seizure of 24 Ukrainian sailors, a spokeswoman in Berlin said the chancellor's meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Saturday would go ahead as planned. President Trump has cancelled a meeting with the Russian leader. The Airbus A340-300 hit by technical failure is named Konrad Adenauer after West Germany's first post-war chancellor. For finance minister Olaf Scholz, the plane's technical problems are nothing new.

Merkel plane diverted after technical hitch,"Chancellor Merkel returned to German soil far earlier than planned, carrying an umbrella in the Cologne rain German Chancellor Angela Merkel missed the opening of the G20 summit in Argentina after her plane was forced to land shortly after leaving Berlin. The plane carrying Mrs Merkel's team turned back while flying over the Netherlands late on Thursday, because of a communications failure. The Airbus made a safe but unscheduled landing in Cologne. Mrs Merkel flew to Madrid on Friday then boarded a scheduled Iberia airlines flight to Buenos Aires. Among her fellow passengers on board the Iberia flight was AgustÃ­n AgÃ¼ero, who tweeted a picture of the chancellor on board. Allow Twitter content?

On Thursday evening the captain of Mrs Merkel's plane told those on board that he had decided to turn back after the ""malfunction of several electronic systems"". The plane's communications system went down and the crew had to use a satellite phone to contact air traffic controllers, Germany's Spiegel website reported. Russia-Ukraine crisis clouds G20 summit G20: Why Trump and Xi won't make a deal World leaders gather for G20 summit The problem is thought to have been with an electronic distribution box, which controls both the radio and discharge of aviation fuel. At no time was there any risk to the lives of passengers, a spokeswoman for Mrs Merkel stressed. The German air force denied suggestions that the plane's electronics could have been sabotaged. ""There's is absolutely no indication of a criminal background,"" a spokesman said. An added problem for the plane was that Cologne airport's longer runway was unavailable, Spiegel added. As the A340 had to slow down quickly and it was still fully laden with fuel, its braking system overheated and the fire brigade met the plane on the tarmac. The German delegation was kept on the plane for some time before officials decided to travel by bus to a hotel in Bonn. The plane was met on the tarmac in Cologne by emergency vehicles The chancellor and a smaller delegation including the finance minister travelled to Madrid on an air force plane on Friday morning before leaving for Argentina on an Iberia plane, a spokesman said. Mrs Merkel's husband was among those on the initial flight who remained in Germany. Although there is a standby government plane for long-haul flights, no crew was available to fly it, German media report. Organising an alternative route proved a headache for the German government, as Mrs Merkel's entourage had to include several security officials. The chancellor missed the ""family photo"" at the start of the G20 summit and officials were trying to reschedule planned bilateral meetings with national leaders. German TV's satirical Heute Show tweeted an image showing three other G20 leaders arriving alongside an airport baggage hall, with the caption: ""Merkel decided on an alternative arrival.""

Hunt as couple's car 'washes-up' on beach,"Susan and James Kenneavy have not been seen at home or been in contact with family The search has been suspended for a couple whose car was found washed-up on a beach in the south of Scotland amid bad weather. James and Susan Kenneavy's empty Ford Kuga was found by workmen clearing debris on Drummore beach, near Stranraer, at about 07:30 on Thursday. The discovery followed heavy rain and flooding on Drummore coastal road on Wednesday. The search has been halted but should resume on Saturday morning. The air, sea and land search operation will resume on Saturday A police spokesman asked for the public's help to trace the couple and discover the movements of their grey Ford Kuga - registration SJ15UKX. He added that the couple, thought to be in their 70s, had not been seen at home in Drummore and had not been in contact with family. Insp Duncan Cameron told the BBC weather conditions in the area had been ""extremely challenging"", with heavy wind and rain. ""A lot of the roadways around that area had been closed due to concerns about the weather,"" he said. He said the coastguard, lifeboats and mountain rescue teams had been involved in the search which has now been suspended until Saturday morning. ""At the minute our efforts are very much focused on tracing Mr and Mrs Kenneavy,"" he said. ""We are concerned for their well-being given the passage of time since their car was discovered. ""However, all our efforts are focused on tracing them - hopefully safe and well. ""We have got as much resource dedicated to that effort as we possibly can."" Drummore villager Edward Beck, who has known Mr Kenneavy for more than 30 years, described his friend as a ""diamond"". ""No matter what he was going through he would always smile and laugh - very witty and full of humour,"" he said. ""A really nice little fellow. I love him to bits, he is just great."" He said he believed the couple were originally from the East Kilbride area but had lived in Dumfries and Galloway for decades. A search into the night on Thursday failed to find any trace of Mr and Mrs Kenneavy Mr Beck told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programmethat local people had been aware of weather warnings from the Met Office and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. He also described how conditions along the coastal route could be extremely treacherous and said large storm waves could affect the main road into the village. He added: ""You can be driving through three, four feet of water and a lot of cars can suck water into the engine and you can get stranded. That part [of the road] actually looks like it's in the sea if you hit it at the right time."" A spokesman for HM Coastguard said they had been contacted by police just after 15:30 on Thursday requesting assistance in the search for the couple. He added: ""The HM Coastguard Search and Rescue Helicopter based at Prestwick, Drummore, Stranraer and Portpatrick coastguard rescue teams and lifeboats from Stranraer and Portpatrick were all sent to assist.""

"Let's focus on the deal, May tells MPs","This video can not be played Theresa May: ""It's our duty to deliver Brexit for the British people"" Theresa May has refused to rule out another Commons vote on her Brexit deal if MPs reject it the first time. The PM said she thought she could win the vote on 11 December despite dozens of Tory MPs being against the deal. In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, she urged MPs to ""deliver on the vote of the referendum"". EU Council President Donald Tusk warned if MPs rejected the deal, the UK would face a choice between leaving without a deal or not leaving at all. Under Commons rules, the prime minister is not meant to ask MPs the same question twice - she would have to change the contents of her deal. Alternatively, if enough MPs indicate they have changed their minds after voting the deal down, it could be held again, but it would be up to the Speaker to decide whether to allow that. Brexit: A really simple guide A dilemma for the People's Vote campaign Labour gets behind bid to stop 'no-deal' What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Pressed by Laura Kuenssberg on whether she would attempt to hold another vote, Mrs May - who is in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for a G20 summit of world leaders - said: ""I'm focused on the vote that is taking place on 11 December and I want everybody who's going to participate, all members of Parliament, to focus on what this vote does."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he did not now expect any Labour MPs to vote for Mrs May's deal, telling Talk Radio he thinks the party will ""hold together"". The Labour leadership has said it is ready to support a cross-party amendment to the vote that would explicitly rule out a no-deal. The amendment would not be binding but it would be hard for the PM to ignore it, if it is passed by Parliament. European Council President Donald Tusk, meanwhile, has stressed that the deal the EU struck with Theresa May was the ""only possible one"". He said: ""If this deal is rejected in the Commons, we are left with, as was stressed a few weeks ago from Prime Minister May, an alternative - no deal or no Brexit at all."" But a senior UK official said: ""Right from the very outset, Donald Tusk has not hidden the fact that he finds (Brexit) a moment of sadness for himself and for the EU. ""But the prime minister has always been very clear to President Tusk that we are leaving on 29 March next year."" The BBC's Europe Editor Katya Adler What is the EU up to while a fevered UK Parliament burns with questions and throbs with Brexit conspiracy theories? Well, the EU is watching and waiting. Arms folded. ""It's groundhog day in this negotiation process,"" an EU diplomat told me. ""We (the EU) are again on the outside, watching the UK debate with itself, unsure of what direction to head in. They voted to leave. We've even got an exit deal on the table now but still the UK is undecided."" Read Katya's full blog Margaret Beckett is one of three former foreign secretaries urging another referendum It is widely expected that MPs will reject the EU withdrawal agreement and blueprint for a future trade deal agreed with the EU. In anticipation of this happening, some MPs are trying to mobilise support for the so-called ""Norway Plus"" option, which they claim could win support across the House of Commons. Under their plan,external, the current withdrawal agreement would be honoured but the UK would seek to rejoin the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which it belonged to before entering the European Economic Community in 1973 - on an indefinite basis. Russia-Ukraine crisis clouds G20 summit Nine Tory tribes May needs to convince If Efta's existing members - Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland - agreed, it would allow the UK to retain membership of the customs union and full access to the single market. Advocates of the plan say the UK would still be outside the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy - but it would also mean continued free movement of people. Mrs May said this kind of deal would not fulfil the referendum pledge to take back control of the UK's borders, laws and money. Meanwhile three former Labour foreign secretaries have warned of the damage to British influence around the world if the UK leaves the EU. David Miliband, Jack Straw and Margaret Becketttold the Financial Times,externalthey all backed the People's Vote campaign for another referendum. Although Labour is still committed to keeping all options open, Mr McDonnell said if it came to another referendum, it would be ""difficult to see"" an option to remain not being included on the ballot paper. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the public mood was changing In a speech in Bristol, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox argued that while the deal will not please everyone, critics ""are yet to face up to"" the ""tough choices"" she had to make. He told the BBC the PM was ""changing the public mood"" and while different approaches would give the UK a freer hand to strike other trade deals, they would come with a ""price"" in terms of reduced access to EU markets. The Financial Times says,externalMrs May is enlisting the support of senior Brexiteers such as Michael Gove and Geoffrey Cox to try to sell her controversial Irish ""backstop"" plan to sceptical Tory MPs. Mr Fox said he was not ""enthusiastic"" about the backstop, which could see the UK enter a customs partnership with the EU until its future relationship is sorted out and without the unilateral right to pull out. But he insisted the chance of the backstop, described as an ""insurance policy"" by Mrs May, actually coming into force was slight as it was just as ""unpalatable"" to other EU members, including the Republic of Ireland. And Treasury Minister Liz Truss, who is backing Mrs May to get the agreement through Parliament, suggested parts of it could be renegotiated after the UK left the EU.

The Nine Tory Brexit tribes,"With a Commons vote on her Brexit agreement set for 11 December, Theresa May has less than two weeks to turn her fortunes around. However, at this point, the prime minister's deal seems to have only further entrenched Tory battle lines against her. The number of Conservative MPs against the deal currently floats at around 93, according to the latest BBC tally. This only includes those who have explicitly stated they don't support it. Total opposition, including Tory MPs who have yet to publicly declare their position, is said to be well over 100. Number crunching: Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Clash over who screens Brexit TV debate DUP accuses No 10 of 'hiding' over Brexit There are 315 Tory MPs in Parliament - not counting two who are currently suspended - and they have splintered off into a bewildering array of factions over Brexit. Here's a guide to the different groups. They're advocating, and have long advocated, leaving the EU without a deal in place, or on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, and have categorically ruled out supporting the prime minister's deal. Made up of the most fervent and veteran Brexit supporters within the European Research Group, the Eurosceptic think tank headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, these MPs view achieving their version of Brexit as more important than keeping Theresa May in No 10. Some, arguably, think it is even more important than keeping the Conservatives in government - although chances are you probably won't hear them admitting this publicly (the Democratic Unionist Party, who keep Mrs May in power, have recently hinted at this, if it means the deal's proposals for Northern Ireland can be ditched). They are only a handful in number, but given Mrs May's increasingly slim parliamentary majority - with the DUP also opposed to her deal - this troublesome tribe could prove numerous enough to sink her deal. This group thinks there is no longer enough time to realistically achieve a renegotiation of the deal on offer before the legislated exit day of 29 March 2019, as well as believing the prime minister has used up all her bargaining power and political capital in Brussels and has reached the point of no return, or, as numerous EU leaders stated last weekend: ""This is it."" These Conservatives argue that a no-deal Brexit - where the UK would leave the EU on WTO trading terms - is better than the deal Mrs May has put on the table and the only option left in the face of what they view as an inevitable defeat in parliament. Some cabinet ministers are rumoured to be quietly making the argument for a ""negotiated no deal"", whereby the UK's EU membership would be extended to allow the government to better prepare for leaving without a deal. According to Article 50 rules, leaving without a deal is technically the default option for the UK should a deal not be reached, bar a change in government. But despite this small group of advocates, a no-deal Brexit is not likely to get a majority of MPs in Parliament behind it. Many MPs have vowed to find a way to prevent the UK from ""crashing out"", should the prime minister's deal be defeated in parliament. Boris Johnson: 'Super Canada' is the answer Vocally-supported by the likes of Boris Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who both resigned in July over Mrs May's Chequers blueprint, this group of mostly European Research Group members have been arguing for a Canada-style free trade agreement (also known as ""Canada +++"" or ""Super Canada"" in some circles) for some time. Some MPs who previously resided in this tribe have broken off to align themselves with the aforementioned No Dealers faction. Some at this point may be in favour of extending Article 50 in order to make room for renegotiation, despite extension being a previous red line for many in this group. The group recently set out their vision for the UK again in a document entitled ""Your Right to Know: the case against Chequers,externaland the draft Withdrawal Agreement in plain English"". They claim a Canada-type deal - whereby the UK would be out of the single market and customs union, with no tariffs or quotas on any imports and exports between the UK and EU - is a ""superior alternative"" to the prime minister's deal. Mrs May claims their solution fails to adequately solve the Irish border question in that the plan would create a hard border. Many, if not all, in this group also have strong objections to the Irish backstop, and insist on it being binned in favour of no backstop at all. Tory backbencher Nick Boles has branded their proposal a ""Fantastic Beast of Johnsonian Folklore"". Mr Boles is among those Conservatives arguing for a Norway-style Brexit instead. George Freeman: Norway is the only sensible option The so-called ""Norway Plus"" option would see the UK retaining membership of the customs union and full access to the single market - meaning freedom of movement and the payments to the EU for market access the prime minister wants to end would likely continue. But Norway's advocates say we'd be outside the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and outside the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  Current EFTA members include Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. This proposal has evolved since it was first put forward, when it said the UK should gain (or regain; we left in 1972 when we joined the EEC, under Edward Heath) temporary membership of EFTA for a few years until we negotiate a strong free trade deal. However, the consensus in European diplomatic circles is that current members as well as the EU would be against temporary UK membership of the bloc. Now, Norway is being pitched as an indefinite solution to a deal that looks likely to die on the doorstep of Parliament. Conservatives such as George Freeman are claiming this proposal enjoys cross-party support and is ""the only sensible way to deliver the EU referendum result"". Indeed, it's rumoured some cabinet ministers are willing to get on board with this option if the draft agreement falls in the Commons. The Conservatives who openly support the prime minister's deal are mainly made up of loyal government ministers. The trouble is, there currently still aren't enough of them to get the prime minister's deal through Parliament - and there's still no ruling out even more ministerial resignations than we've already seen in between now and voting day. Then there are the pragmatic backbenchers (see below for another breed of pragmatists who openly criticise the deal). This group would normally make up a large, silent majority chunk in the middle of the party, shielding themselves from the din of ardent Leavers and Remainers. They're normally loyal to party policy and vote accordingly on Brexit matters. However, Theresa May's deal has melted away support even from this tribe, who were in fact dangerously shaky in numbers even before the deal was unveiled thanks to the Conservatives' lack of a working majority. Daniel Kawczynski: Northern Ireland backstop is unacceptable Though clear in their opposition to the prime minister's deal, not all Conservatives are giving up on it altogether. The bulk of this tribe are made up of MPs who have serious concerns about the backstop proposals for Northern Ireland. Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury, has emphasised the extent to which the backstop remains a sticking point with many backbenchers: ""It is interesting the number of Conservative MPs that like me will swallow everything else they are not happy with, and may be persuaded. ""But the issue of part of the country being treated different to the rest is something many of us find completely unacceptable."" This group also includes the DUP, with leader Arlene Foster insisting that Theresa May can find ""a third way, a better way"". However, otherrecent comments by Ms Foster,external, suggesting a Jeremy Corbyn-led government is preferable to the prime minister's deal, would relocate the Northern Irish party into a far more extreme tribe than this one. Others have pointed to what they see as the positives in May's deal, such as ending freedom of movement and shielding the UK economy from the uncertainty of a no-deal Brexit. Some also stress that there is room for more manoeuvre on the details of the future relationship. But these upsides have so far failed to surmount other concerns, such as those surrounding aspects of the transition period, the role of the European Court of Justice and the Â£39bn ""divorce payment"". Nicky Morgan: Back the prime minister These are the Conservatives who despite their distaste for the deal, are supporting it through gritted teeth. It could be that many of these are choosing not to publicly state their position either way as of yet, but will begrudgingly cast their vote in favour when it comes to the day due to a lack of other options. Theresa May will certainly be hoping this group increases in number in the coming weeks, as it seems clear that winning over direct converts from either side in large numbers is unlikely. Lead pragmatist Nicky Morgan, previously of the Norway tribe, has called on MPs to discard their ""entrenched positions"" and back the prime minister. Ken Clarke dubbed the deal ""a bit of a dog's breakfast"", but has vowed to support it regardless - despite being a veteran Remainer. This tribe would probably have viewed any deal as worse than staying in the EU. Many privately support another referendum, but have yet to join the handful of Tory MPs who openly back the People's Vote campaign, alongside the likes of Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve. If the prime minister's deal is rejected, a large group of MPs currently keeping quiet could come out to publicly support another referendum, aligning themselves with many Labour MPs. Other parts of the tribe are hoping an EU Supreme Court ruling will see the UK being able to unilaterally revoke Article 50, potentially paving the way to cancel Brexit altogether. Anna Soubry: Country has made a terrible mistake After Jo Johnson's recent resignation as a government minister and support for this option, the People's Vote campaign has received a Tory boost. This option is being sold as the only way to solve the current impasse in Parliament. These Tories also campaign across party lines and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Labour MPs such as Chuka Ummuna. The People's Vote campaign's march in Westminster recently attracted hundreds of thousands of supporters. The campaign also has the support of former Prime Minister John Major, who told the BBC as early as July that the case for another referendum was ""morally justified"". Leading campaigner Anna Soubry told the BBC: ""The best deal we have with the EU is the current dealâ¦people are realising our country has made a terrible mistake.""

Russia-Ukraine crisis clouds G20 summit,"This video can not be played Putin and the Saudi crown prince ""high five"" in Buenos Aires World leaders have held the opening session of their annual G20 summit, with any number of disputes and disagreements on the table. Host president, Argentina's Mauricio Macri, said the solution was ""dialogue, dialogue and dialogue"" and called for a clear message of shared responsibility. But US President Donald Trump has already cancelled meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. And huge differences remain on climate change, trade and the Khashoggi affair. The G20, made up of 19 of the world's most industrialised nations plus the EU, accounts for 85% of the world's economic output and two-thirds of the world's population. In pictures: World leaders gather Trump's trade war: Stakes are high at G20 Merkel's travel nightmare Its meetings, which began in 2008, are an opportunity for members to develop global policies tackling major issues - but many of the key decisions will be made in one-on-one encounters. There is massive security for the summit in Buenos Aires, with a bank holiday declared for Friday and the city's main business district shut down. Protesters angry at the money spent on the summit while Argentina struggles through tough austerity demonstrated outside the meeting. Analysis by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Meeting world leaders at the G20 summit was a test for Mohammed bin Salman to see who would snub him. He is the only Arab leader in the G20 and already stood out in his traditional dress amid a sea of suits. And at times he looked uncertain, even nervous. Some of his counterparts shared a word or two but few went out of their way to shake his hand. So the optics of the summit, to use the diplomatic jargon, were not that great for MBS. Read on The world leaders were all called on to the stage and assumed their position for the traditional family photograph. The G20 photo ahead of Friday's plenary session Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stood on the outside of the photo, far away from Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This is the crown prince's first major diplomatic test since the murder in Turkey of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a key critic of the government. Saudi Arabia has blamed ""rogue agents"" but suspicion has fallen on the prince for ordering the killing. After the photo was taken, the crown prince did manage a hearty exchange with Mr Putin. French President Emmanuel Macron held a five-minute exchange with the crown prince during which, a French official said, Mr Macron had conveyed ""very firm"" messages over the Khashoggi affair. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Mr Trump had a ""friendly meeting"" with the crown prince, Saudi media said, although the president later said there had been ""no discussion"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May also met the crown prince. A Downing Street spokesman said the PM had ""stressed the importance of ensuring that those responsible for the appalling murder of Jamal Khashoggi are held to account"" and that ""such a deplorable incident"" should not happen again. In addition Mrs May held a 15-minute meeting to discuss trade with Mr Macri. Their two nations have long disputed sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. Mr Macri's opening address to the summit admitted there would be issues of disagreement that needed to be managed. This video can not be played So how does a G20 summit work? He called for consensus on sustainable development, the future of work, food supply, climate change and international trade, adding: ""I am an optimist"". There are certain to be plenty of bilateral, trilateral or even larger get-togethers, although the one that will not be taking place is the highest-profile. Mr Trump said he would not meet Mr Putinbecause three Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors seized by Russia in the Black Sea near Crimea had not been returned. ""We don't like what happened. Nobody does,"" he said on Friday. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow regretted the decision. But he said: ""If this is so, the president will have a couple of extra hours in the programme for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has blamed the crisis ""entirely"" on Russia and said she would raise the issue with Mr Putin. The second-highest profile meeting will also involve Mr Trump. He will have dinner on Saturday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The key issue there will be the nations' trade tariffs dispute. The US has hit a total of $250bn (Â£196bn) of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. China said consensus was increasing on a deal but that differences remained. After earlier indicating pessimism on an agreement, Mr Trump said: ""They want to and we'd like to. There are some good signs. We'll see what happens."" Mr Putin has also weighed in, with a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump's America First policy. The Russian president condemned ""dishonest competition"" along with ""vicious"" sanctions and protectionist measures. The Brics group, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, issued a statement saying protectionism ran counter to the ""spirit and rules of the World Trade Organization"". Ahead of the summit's official startMr Trump signed a trade deal with the Mexican and Canadian leaders. Mr Trump described the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - which replaces the Nafta free trade deal - as ""probably the greatest trade deal ever"". ""All of our countries will benefit greatly,"" he said. European diplomats told Associated Press there has been tough haggling over a final statement. Argentine officials indicated differences on trade could be overcome. However, that will still leave the obstacle of climate change. This video can not be played Why have thousands of demonstrators been marching against the G20 summit in Buenos Aires? Mr Trump has not hidden his objection to collective action on the issue. UN chief Antonio Guterres said in Buenos Aires that ""this is a make-it-or-break-it moment"" on the issue. President Macron was quoted by AFP news agency as saying he would refuse to sign a trade deal with South America's Mercosur bloc if Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro withdrew from the Paris climate accord.

Trump's trade war: Stakes are high at G20,"US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are due to meet again this week The stakes are high at this week's G20 summit, where President Trump is due to meet China's President Xi Jinping. Hopes that the meeting could open the way for a deal over trade between the two countries have been undermined by recent threats by the US president. Only days before the summit in Argentina, President Trump said current tariff levels on $200bn (Â£157bn) of Chinese imports would rise as planned. He also threatened tariffs on $267bn of other Chinese exports to the US. Then, just before taking off for Argentina, President Trump told reporters at the White House that while China was interested in striking a deal, ""I don't know if I want to do it"" and ""I like the deal we have now"". The stage could now be set for a possible escalation of the trade war between the two nations. World leaders gather for G20 summit Merkel plane diverted after technical hitch Why Trump and Xi won't make a deal President Trump started the dispute with China earlier this year, accusing the Chinese of ""unfair"" trade practices and intellectual property theft. The US has hit a total $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. This video can not be played So how does a G20 summit work? China had already hit the US with $3bn of tariffs in April, in response to US tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports. President Trump offered a glimmer of hope earlier this month, when he said he thoughtthe US could strike a trade deal with China. Trump has long accused the Chinese of unfair trading practices But only days before the summit, he poured cold water on such optimism. President Trump told the Wall Street Journal,externalhe expected to go ahead with plans to raise tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods - first introduced in September - to 25% (up from 10%) starting in January 2019. President Trump also said that if talks were unsuccessful, he would carry out a threat to hit the remaining $267bn of annual Chinese exports to the US with tariffs of 10-25%. The Trump administration alsorecently accused China of not changing its ""unfair"" trade practices. ""I think the most likely scenario is that Xi Jinping doesn't offer big enough concessions to Trump, and so nothing much comes of the G20 meeting,"" says Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics. Trump talks tough on China before G20 US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Grappling with China's growing power Recent summits also do not bode well for any resolutions at the G20 level. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit recently ended without a formal leaders' statementbecause of US-China divisions over trade. And a G7 summit in Canada in June ended in disarray asTrump retracted his endorsement of the joint statement. ""I think unfortunately, the US and China remain quite far apart in the issues behind the trade conflict, so we are not too optimistic,"" says Valerie Mercer-Blackman, senior economist at the Asia Development Bank. ""Failure to agree on the communique at the Apec meeting... also suggests that there is quite substantial distance between the two sides, and there doesn't seem to be a specific proposal on the table yet to end the impasse."" The stakes are high. ""If the meeting fails to deliver a truce, then the US will almost certainly hike tariff rates [on $200bn of existing Chinese goods] in January, and a further expansion in tariffs is quite likely,"" says Mr Evans-Pritchard. US tariffs on $200m worth of Chinese imports could go up from 10% to 25% in January A rise in those tariffs would see many multinational firms accelerate their plans to move supply chains away from China, while tariffs on additional Chinese imports would pose ""a significant political and economic risk for Trump"", says Michael Hirson, Asia director at Eurasia Group. ""Remaining US imports from China are more heavily tilted towards consumer items. American households, especially those from lower income brackets, will feel the impact more than they have over tariffs on previous rounds,"" he adds. If the US were to impose tariffs on additional Chinese goods, China could seek to retaliate, butwould have limited room to do so via trade. This is because China's existing $113bn tariffs on US goods are not far from the $130bn it imported from the US in 2017. More from theBBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Why Switzerland worries about Brexit Should we pay people for donating blood? Choppy waters for Greek shipping sector Is the Arctic set to become a main shipping route? Instead of fighting back aggressively with more tariffs, China is more likely to defend its economy by easing fiscal and monetary policy, letting its currency fall and forging trade deals with other countries, analysts say. China has also been affected by the US's tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports ""China's strategy towards Trump will favour resilience over retaliation,"" Mr Hirson says. If the conflict between China and the US continues to escalate, non-tariff barriers particularly in the technology sector are likely to become increasingly popular. The US has already made moves in this direction. It recentlyrestricted American firms from selling parts to a Chinese companyover national security concerns. ""While tariffs draw most of the attention, non-tariff measures are just as important in this trade war and will probably be in play for much longer,"" says Mr Hirson. ""On the US side, this includes measures such as recently passed legislation that tightens investment restrictions and export controls... In China, it involves using regulatory tools such as anti-trust investigations to squeeze US tech firms and tip the advantage to domestic competitors.""

Hunt as couple's car 'washes up' on beachSusan and James Kenneavy's car was spotted on Drummore beach after a night of heavy rain and flooding.South Scotland,"Susan and James Kenneavy have not been seen at home or been in contact with family The search has been suspended for a couple whose car was found washed-up on a beach in the south of Scotland amid bad weather. James and Susan Kenneavy's empty Ford Kuga was found by workmen clearing debris on Drummore beach, near Stranraer, at about 07:30 on Thursday. The discovery followed heavy rain and flooding on Drummore coastal road on Wednesday. The search has been halted but should resume on Saturday morning. The air, sea and land search operation will resume on Saturday A police spokesman asked for the public's help to trace the couple and discover the movements of their grey Ford Kuga - registration SJ15UKX. He added that the couple, thought to be in their 70s, had not been seen at home in Drummore and had not been in contact with family. Insp Duncan Cameron told the BBC weather conditions in the area had been ""extremely challenging"", with heavy wind and rain. ""A lot of the roadways around that area had been closed due to concerns about the weather,"" he said. He said the coastguard, lifeboats and mountain rescue teams had been involved in the search which has now been suspended until Saturday morning. ""At the minute our efforts are very much focused on tracing Mr and Mrs Kenneavy,"" he said. ""We are concerned for their well-being given the passage of time since their car was discovered. ""However, all our efforts are focused on tracing them - hopefully safe and well. ""We have got as much resource dedicated to that effort as we possibly can."" Drummore villager Edward Beck, who has known Mr Kenneavy for more than 30 years, described his friend as a ""diamond"". ""No matter what he was going through he would always smile and laugh - very witty and full of humour,"" he said. ""A really nice little fellow. I love him to bits, he is just great."" He said he believed the couple were originally from the East Kilbride area but had lived in Dumfries and Galloway for decades. A search into the night on Thursday failed to find any trace of Mr and Mrs Kenneavy Mr Beck told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programmethat local people had been aware of weather warnings from the Met Office and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. He also described how conditions along the coastal route could be extremely treacherous and said large storm waves could affect the main road into the village. He added: ""You can be driving through three, four feet of water and a lot of cars can suck water into the engine and you can get stranded. That part [of the road] actually looks like it's in the sea if you hit it at the right time."" A spokesman for HM Coastguard said they had been contacted by police just after 15:30 on Thursday requesting assistance in the search for the couple. He added: ""The HM Coastguard Search and Rescue Helicopter based at Prestwick, Drummore, Stranraer and Portpatrick coastguard rescue teams and lifeboats from Stranraer and Portpatrick were all sent to assist.""

Australia students in mass climate protest,"Protests were organised in 27 places across Australia Thousands of Australian school students have urged greater action on climate change in protests across the country. The students skipped school on Friday to highlight what they say are inadequate climate policies by the Australian government. On Monday, Australian PM Scott Morrison rebuked their plans for ""activism"" during school hours and insisted his government was tackling climate change. Many students said his remarks had bolstered their resolve to protest. ""We will be the ones suffering the consequences of the decisions they [politicians] make today,"" protester Jagveer Singh, 17, told the BBC. Organisers say they were inspired by Greta Thunberg,a 15-year-old girl in Sweden who has undertaken similar protests. Students protest in central Sydney on Friday Australia has committed to reducing its emissions by 26-28% on 2005 levels by 2030, under the Paris climate agreement. Mr Morrison most recently cited a renewable energy target, a clean energy purchasing fund, and a hydropower project as evidence of Australia's progress. He told parliament on Monday: ""What we want is more learning in schools and less activism in schools."" Resources Minister Matt Canavan, meanwhile, angered protesters by saying students would not learn anything from ""walking off school and protesting"". ""The best thing you learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole [welfare] queue because that's what your future life will look like,"" he told a radio interviewer. Many students held placards criticising the government, and PM Morrison specifically. ""I hate ScoMo [Scott Morrison] more than I hate school,"" one said. Earlier this week,the UN said Australia and many nations were falling short of their emission commitments. Australia had made ""no improvement"" in its climate policy since last year, according tothe emissions gap report,external. School Strike 4 Climate Action protests have been held in every state capital and 20 regional towns. The BBC asked several students why they were taking part. Milou Albrect (l) and Harriet O'Shea Carre organised the protest The idea started with Milou Albrect and Harriet O'Shea Carre, both 14, in the state of Victoria. ""The climate change emergency is something we have been thinking about for a long time,"" Harriet said. ""We wrote letters and did different things but they never seemed to make a difference. Really, education, is our only power. By sacrificing that [on Friday], it's making a big point."" Milou said: ""We want our government to acknowledge publicly that climate change is a crisis. Stop digging coal, stop making new coal mines, switch to renewable energy."" Visiting Australia's controversial Adani mine Jean Hinchcliffe, 14, organised a rally in Sydney Jean Hinchcliffe, 14, saw the idea to protest grow in Victoria and decided to start one in her home city, Sydney. ""I can't just sit around until I'm old enough to vote,"" she said. ""Everyone, all young people, we can see that climate change is a real issue and we're completely sick of politicians' inaction. ""It's really scary for us, to see how it's going to impact our future,"" she said, citing fears about rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Ruby Walker says her generation has grown up thinking about climate change Ruby Walker, 16, organised a protest in her town of Inverell, about 570km (350 miles) north of Sydney, after seeing others' plans on Facebook. She had also been inspired by the activism of high school students in the US during environment and gun control debates, she said. ""I think social media is a big part of it. You're constantly seeing these issues happening around the world and seeing other students stick up for things you believe in,"" she said. ""I feel like Australia is an embarrassment when it comes to climate change.""

US woman jailed in 'candy floss mix-up',"A roadside drug test labelled old candy floss, also known as cotton candy, as a dangerous drug A Georgia woman spent three months in jail after her bag of candy floss was mistaken for methamphetamine owing to a defective drug test, says a lawsuit. Dasha Fincher, 41, is suing Monroe County, the police and a drug test company over the alleged mix-up during a traffic stop on New Year's Eve 2016. The 41-year-old was held in custody because she could not afford her $1m (Â£780,000) bond. The legal action argues the county violated her civil rights. 'My life was ruined by a police typo' US man 'mistakenly injected with drugs' She was arrested and charged with meth trafficking and possession of meth with intent to distribute, according to the lawsuit. The court documents say she was improperly detained from 31 December 2016 until 4 April, when her charges of drug possession and trafficking were dropped. Dasha Fincher says she missed the birth of her twin grandsons due to the wrongful jailing A state crime laboratory had already tested the bag of light blue candy floss - known as cotton candy in the US - and determined on 22 March it contained no drugs. Ms Fincher says she missed important life events due to the unlawful jailing, including the birth of her twin grandsons and the chance to care for her daughter after a miscarriage. In addition, the arrest remains on her record despite her innocence, according to the lawsuit. Ms Fincher is seeking damages for negligence and wrongful actions, as determined by a jury, from Monroe County, the two officers who arrested her and the test manufacturer Sirchie. County officials and Sirchie did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A 2016 ProPublica investigation,externalfound that cheap roadside drug tests ""routinely produce false positives"" that result in tens of thousands of Americans being wrongfully jailed.

"Deal good for constituents, May tells MPs","This video can not be played Theresa May: ""It's our duty to deliver Brexit for the British people"" Theresa May has refused to rule out another Commons vote on her Brexit deal if MPs reject it the first time. The PM said she thought she could win the vote on 11 December despite dozens of Tory MPs being against the deal. In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, she urged MPs to ""deliver on the vote of the referendum"". EU Council President Donald Tusk warned if MPs rejected the deal, the UK would face a choice between leaving without a deal or not leaving at all. Under Commons rules, the prime minister is not meant to ask MPs the same question twice - she would have to change the contents of her deal. Alternatively, if enough MPs indicate they have changed their minds after voting the deal down, it could be held again, but it would be up to the Speaker to decide whether to allow that. Brexit: A really simple guide A dilemma for the People's Vote campaign Labour gets behind bid to stop 'no-deal' What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Pressed by Laura Kuenssberg on whether she would attempt to hold another vote, Mrs May - who is in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for a G20 summit of world leaders - said: ""I'm focused on the vote that is taking place on 11 December and I want everybody who's going to participate, all members of Parliament, to focus on what this vote does."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he did not now expect any Labour MPs to vote for Mrs May's deal, telling Talk Radio he thinks the party will ""hold together"". The Labour leadership has said it is ready to support a cross-party amendment to the vote that would explicitly rule out a no-deal. The amendment would not be binding but it would be hard for the PM to ignore it, if it is passed by Parliament. European Council President Donald Tusk, meanwhile, has stressed that the deal the EU struck with Theresa May was the ""only possible one"". He said: ""If this deal is rejected in the Commons, we are left with, as was stressed a few weeks ago from Prime Minister May, an alternative - no deal or no Brexit at all."" But a senior UK official said: ""Right from the very outset, Donald Tusk has not hidden the fact that he finds (Brexit) a moment of sadness for himself and for the EU. ""But the prime minister has always been very clear to President Tusk that we are leaving on 29 March next year."" The BBC's Europe Editor Katya Adler What is the EU up to while a fevered UK Parliament burns with questions and throbs with Brexit conspiracy theories? Well, the EU is watching and waiting. Arms folded. ""It's groundhog day in this negotiation process,"" an EU diplomat told me. ""We (the EU) are again on the outside, watching the UK debate with itself, unsure of what direction to head in. They voted to leave. We've even got an exit deal on the table now but still the UK is undecided."" Read Katya's full blog Margaret Beckett is one of three former foreign secretaries urging another referendum It is widely expected that MPs will reject the EU withdrawal agreement and blueprint for a future trade deal agreed with the EU. In anticipation of this happening, some MPs are trying to mobilise support for the so-called ""Norway Plus"" option, which they claim could win support across the House of Commons. Under their plan,external, the current withdrawal agreement would be honoured but the UK would seek to rejoin the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which it belonged to before entering the European Economic Community in 1973 - on an indefinite basis. Russia-Ukraine crisis clouds G20 summit Nine Tory tribes May needs to convince If Efta's existing members - Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland - agreed, it would allow the UK to retain membership of the customs union and full access to the single market. Advocates of the plan say the UK would still be outside the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy - but it would also mean continued free movement of people. Mrs May said this kind of deal would not fulfil the referendum pledge to take back control of the UK's borders, laws and money. Meanwhile three former Labour foreign secretaries have warned of the damage to British influence around the world if the UK leaves the EU. David Miliband, Jack Straw and Margaret Becketttold the Financial Times,externalthey all backed the People's Vote campaign for another referendum. Although Labour is still committed to keeping all options open, Mr McDonnell said if it came to another referendum, it would be ""difficult to see"" an option to remain not being included on the ballot paper. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the public mood was changing In a speech in Bristol, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox argued that while the deal will not please everyone, critics ""are yet to face up to"" the ""tough choices"" she had to make.

Fox seeks to rally support for Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""It's our duty to deliver Brexit for the British people"" Theresa May has refused to rule out another Commons vote on her Brexit deal if MPs reject it the first time. The PM said she thought she could win the vote on 11 December despite dozens of Tory MPs being against the deal. In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, she urged MPs to ""deliver on the vote of the referendum"". EU Council President Donald Tusk warned if MPs rejected the deal, the UK would face a choice between leaving without a deal or not leaving at all. Under Commons rules, the prime minister is not meant to ask MPs the same question twice - she would have to change the contents of her deal. Alternatively, if enough MPs indicate they have changed their minds after voting the deal down, it could be held again, but it would be up to the Speaker to decide whether to allow that. Brexit: A really simple guide A dilemma for the People's Vote campaign Labour gets behind bid to stop 'no-deal' What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Pressed by Laura Kuenssberg on whether she would attempt to hold another vote, Mrs May - who is in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for a G20 summit of world leaders - said: ""I'm focused on the vote that is taking place on 11 December and I want everybody who's going to participate, all members of Parliament, to focus on what this vote does."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he did not now expect any Labour MPs to vote for Mrs May's deal, telling Talk Radio he thinks the party will ""hold together"". The Labour leadership has said it is ready to support a cross-party amendment to the vote that would explicitly rule out a no-deal. The amendment would not be binding but it would be hard for the PM to ignore it, if it is passed by Parliament. European Council President Donald Tusk, meanwhile, has stressed that the deal the EU struck with Theresa May was the ""only possible one"". He said: ""If this deal is rejected in the Commons, we are left with, as was stressed a few weeks ago from Prime Minister May, an alternative - no deal or no Brexit at all."" But a senior UK official said: ""Right from the very outset, Donald Tusk has not hidden the fact that he finds (Brexit) a moment of sadness for himself and for the EU. ""But the prime minister has always been very clear to President Tusk that we are leaving on 29 March next year."" The BBC's Europe Editor Katya Adler What is the EU up to while a fevered UK Parliament burns with questions and throbs with Brexit conspiracy theories? Well, the EU is watching and waiting. Arms folded. ""It's groundhog day in this negotiation process,"" an EU diplomat told me. ""We (the EU) are again on the outside, watching the UK debate with itself, unsure of what direction to head in. They voted to leave. We've even got an exit deal on the table now but still the UK is undecided."" Read Katya's full blog Margaret Beckett is one of three former foreign secretaries urging another referendum It is widely expected that MPs will reject the EU withdrawal agreement and blueprint for a future trade deal agreed with the EU. In anticipation of this happening, some MPs are trying to mobilise support for the so-called ""Norway Plus"" option, which they claim could win support across the House of Commons. Under their plan,external, the current withdrawal agreement would be honoured but the UK would seek to rejoin the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which it belonged to before entering the European Economic Community in 1973 - on an indefinite basis. Russia-Ukraine crisis clouds G20 summit Nine Tory tribes May needs to convince If Efta's existing members - Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland - agreed, it would allow the UK to retain membership of the customs union and full access to the single market. Advocates of the plan say the UK would still be outside the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy - but it would also mean continued free movement of people. Mrs May said this kind of deal would not fulfil the referendum pledge to take back control of the UK's borders, laws and money. Meanwhile three former Labour foreign secretaries have warned of the damage to British influence around the world if the UK leaves the EU. David Miliband, Jack Straw and Margaret Becketttold the Financial Times,externalthey all backed the People's Vote campaign for another referendum. Although Labour is still committed to keeping all options open, Mr McDonnell said if it came to another referendum, it would be ""difficult to see"" an option to remain not being included on the ballot paper. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the public mood was changing In a speech in Bristol, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox argued that while the deal will not please everyone, critics ""are yet to face up to"" the ""tough choices"" she had to make. He told the BBC the PM was ""changing the public mood"" and while different approaches would give the UK a freer hand to strike other trade deals, they would come with a ""price"" in terms of reduced access to EU markets. The Financial Times says,externalMrs May is enlisting the support of senior Brexiteers such as Michael Gove and Geoffrey Cox to try to sell her controversial Irish ""backstop"" plan to sceptical Tory MPs.
