Alternative ways to break Brexit deadlock,"Theresa May is making a last ditch bid to save her Brexit deal after suffering a crushing defeat in a Commons vote on it. Britain is still on course to leave the EU, but nobody knows whether it will be with a deal or not, or whether there will be a general election or a second referendum. You canread about all the likely scenarios here. But here are some alternative ideas that a few weeks ago seemed highly unlikely but which could, in these extraordinary times, start to look like contenders. The European Court of Justice has ruled that Britain can revoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the legal mechanism taking the country out of the EU on 29 March - without the approval of the other 27 member states. This turns previous assumptions about Brexit on their head, and gives hope to those who believe it has all been a terrible mistake. There is some debate over how the government would go about cancelling Brexit. And given the divided state of Parliament, it is hard to see how any prime minister could get backing for such a move without a further referendum. Theresa May ruled it out on the grounds it would be seen as a betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave in 2016. European Council President Donald Tusk has hinted that cancelling Brexit would be his preferred option, tweeting, after Mrs May's deal was defeated by 230 votes: ""If a deal is impossible, and no-one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?"" EU's Tusk hints UK should cancel Brexit With no apparent parliamentary majority for any single course of action - is it time to get the Queen involved? In Britain's constitutional monarchy, this is not meant to happen. Her Majesty has always remained above the political fray and will, no doubt, want to stay that way. But she is the only person who can invite someone to form a government and become prime minister. And if Theresa May loses a no-confidence vote in the Commons - and Labour has not ruled out tabling further such motions after Theresa May won the vote on 16 January - then this power could come into play. There would be a 14-day period during which the Queen could ask someone to form a new government if it was clear they could command the confidence of the House. That could be Labour or another Conservative government or a cross-party government. The Queen would not be able to exercise her own political judgement - everything would depend on whether the would-be new prime minister is deemed to have a realistic chance of getting their laws through Parliament. The nightmare scenario, for the Queen and her advisers, is where it's not clear who has the best chance of winning a confidence vote but different people are making competing claims. If after 14 days, a new government cannot gain MPs' confidence, a general election will follow. There could be multiple confidence votes, or none, before the 14-day deadline. One thing the Queen can't do is dissolve Parliament and trigger a general election. The monarch was stripped of that power by the 2011 Fixed-term Parliament Act. Brexit is not the only controversial issue to be put to a public vote recently - and some countries, such asthe Republic of  Ireland, before a referendum on overturning to its ban on abortion, have turned to a ""citizens assembly"" to find a way forward. In Ireland, the body was set up to advise elected representatives on a number of ethical and political dilemmas. It is made up of 99 members chosen at random to broadly represent the views of the Irish electorate, and a chairman. Citizens' assemblies are meant to give their members time to learn about an issue through discussions led by experts and then reach a conclusion through a series of votes. The Guardian backs a citizens' assembly,externalto sort out Brexit, arguing in an editorial that Parliament should have the right, if it chooses, to put the ideas the assembly produces to a referendum. Left-wing campaign group Compass is another backer, and is supported by Labour MP Liz Kendall, former Archbishop of Canterbury the Right Reverend Lord Williams and Blur front man Damon Albarn, among others. Green MP Caroline Lucas was reported to be planning to raise the citizens assembly plan with Theresa May when she met the prime minister to discuss Brexit compromises, after the PM's Brexit plan was voted down. This video can not be played Liz Kendall suggests a ""citizens' assembly of ordinary people"", as used in Ireland, to ask UK voters about Brexit NI to pilot 'Citizens' Assembly' Nick Boles MP, co-architect of a plan for backbenchers to draw up a compromise plan This was a scheme dreamed up by Conservative backbencher Nick Boles and two colleagues, Nicky Morgan and Sir Oliver Letwin, who want a softer Brexit than the one being promoted by Mrs May. Mr Boles has put forward legislation, the European Union Withdrawal Number 2 Bill, that would give the government three weeks to seek a compromise and leave as planned on 29 March. If his bill failed to get through the Commons, the three MPs had planned to push for a solution that takes the job out of government hands. Instead, the36-strong House of Commons Liaison Committee,externalwould have been tasked with coming up with its own compromise deal. The committee, comprised of chairmen and women of the Commons select committees and other parliamentary committees, meets periodically to give the prime minister a grilling on issues of the day. It has not previously been pressed into action to come up with policy ideas. Its members span every shade of opinion on Brexit, from Conservative Remainers such as Sarah Wollaston to veteran Eurosceptics Sir Bill Cash and Bernard Jenkin. There are also Labour and SNP figures, and one Lib Dem. Whether they could do a better job than the cabinet of agreeing a Brexit deal is an open question. And they have now rejected the proposal, with the majority of members saying at a meeting on Wednesday, 16 January that they felt they were not equipped to draw up legislation. There was also anger at what was seen as an attempt to bounce the committee into accepting Mr Boles's plan, although it is understood there are likely to be further moves to give Parliament a decisive role in deciding the way ahead on Brexit. A cross-party group of MPs, under the People's Vote banner, is pushing for another EU referendum. But what would the question be? A direct ""Remain or Leave"" re-run of the 2016 vote? Leave with a deal or no-deal? Or a combination of the two, with potentially three questions? Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at King's College, London, has suggested the Brexit impasse could be resolved by holding a further referendum - then another one. He wrotein the Guardian,externalthat two referendums could be held a few weeks apart - the first, a straight Leave or Remain choice. Then, if Leave won, another vote on the terms of departure. Former cabinet minister Justine Greening has suggested an alternative - one referendum offering three choices, with people getting a first- and second-preference vote. Winston Churchill's wartime coalition with King George VI Could a cabinet made up of different parties, usually formed during a time of national crisis, offer a solution? It may seem like a concept confined to the history books - stirring up memories of Winston Churchill's wartime coalition or Ramsay MacDonald's 1930s national government, but it has been publicly floated as a way out of the Brexit stalemate. Advocates of such an arrangement have included Tory pro-Remain MP Anna Soubry, who suggested Mrs May should reach out to the SNP, Plaid Cymru, Labour backbenchers ""and other sensible, pragmatic people who believe in putting this country's interests first and foremost"". Her fellow Tory backbencher Sir Nicholas Soames, Churchill's grandson, has also backed the idea. Both the Labour and Conservative front benches rejected the suggestion last summer - but it was revived by Remain-supporting Conservative MP Nicky Morgan in December. However, Ramsay MacDonald's decision to form a national government was considered a betrayal by many in the Labour Party, in the early 1930s. And the electoral battering suffered by the Lib Dems after going into coalition in 2010 will still be fresh in many minds. A Parliamentary Commission, made up of senior figures from the Leave and Remain sides of the debate, to oversee Brexit, is another idea that has been raised by MPs. There was a lot of talk about this in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 referendum. Heavyweight figures, including Nicola Sturgeon, Lord Hague, Sir John Major and Yvette Cooper backed it. It is probably far too late to set up such a body to oversee the UK's withdrawal from the EU, on 29 March. But the idea might regain some traction if trade talks get under way after Brexit day or if the Brexit deadline is extended. But MPs are not meant to tell governments what to do, just scrutinise the decisions of ministers and hold them to account. So the danger is it could end up being a talking shop with no real power.

Can Theresa May bring her critics on board?,"Meetings, on their own, are not a Plan B. Conversations, are not by themselves, compromises. To get any deal done where there are such clashing views all around, it requires give and take. It feels like a political lifetime since there has been a fundamental dispute in the cabinet, in the Tory party and across Parliament. Theresa May has stubbornly, although understandably, tried to plot a middle course. But that has failed so spectacularly at this stage. Ultimately she may well be left with the same dilemma of which way to tack. It's clear, wide open, in public, that the cabinet is at odds with each other. Just listen to David Gauke and Liam Fox on whether a customs union could be a compromise for example. The answer for her is not suddenly going to emerge from a unified tier of her top team. There are perhaps five or six of the cabinet who would be happy to see that kind of relationship as a way to bring Labour on board. But there is a group of around the same size who would rather see what they describe as a ""managed no deal"". You may well wonder if that isn't a contradiction in terms. But the principle would be that the UK would pay the divorce bill already agreed and over a two-year period construct a series of side deals on specific issues, rather than try to come up with a whole new comprehensive plan. There are already intense arguments about whether that's remotely realistic. But the overall point is that the prime minister cannot just therefore look to her top colleagues for an immediate solution. Before she decides which way to tack, or how far to budge, she may need to ask herself if the talks she wants to hold with other political parties are occasions when she is really open to ideas - or just ways of managing the political situation. One cabinet minister involved in the talks suggested that many MPs still needed to understand how the agreement they have reached with the EU worked. And that as ""project reality"" dawned, there could still be a way through of salvaging Mrs May's deal in something like its current form. And certainly there wasn't much in the PM's lectern statement to suggest she is suddenly ready to move very much. One former minister described it as ""still flicking the V at the 48% - she's deluded, she never changes her mind and cannot conceive that others might"". If all that the prime minister intends to do is massage a few egos with these talks, it seems unlikely that she'll find a quick route to success. And Labour may well stay outside the process. Many members of the public might be furious that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn won't play nice during a time of crisis. He's always said he believes in dialogue, but when it really matters, he says no. But inside the Labour movement there are others who might accuse of him of helping to make Brexit happen if he takes part. Like so many facets of this process, it's not a straightforward political calculation. But across Parliament, for a very long time now, even some MPs who were on the prime minister's side to start with have been intensely frustrated that she hasn't listened. It will take a lot more than a cup of tea in Downing Street to bring her many critics on board.

Kuenssberg: When will May budge on Brexit?,"""She is as inflexible as a dodo,"" one member of the government says of Theresa May - but that's not the only reason why she has been slow to compromise. We all know that if you stretch an elastic band at both ends, eventually it snaps. And throughout her leadership, the PM has had Parliament as a whole pulling at one end, and the Eurosceptics in her party at the other. It may be that in the next few days, the length of elastic finally can't cope with the tension anymore. One formerly extremely loyal Tory MP said this morning: ""Just at the moment when we need the maximum flexibility, we have the leader worst suited to it."" Brexit Live: Latest as MPs debate no-confidence vote Corbyn urges end of 'zombie government' What is a vote of no-confidence? Didn't the PM promise a cross-party approach last night? Well, the suggestion of those talks is not quite what you might expect. There's been no attempt from the government to reach out to the Labour official frontbench. And insiders have made it pretty clear that the idea would not include Jeremy Corbyn. So, the government's plan - at least for the next few hours - is to keep going with its plan more or less unchanged and peel off a few opposition MPs here and there. But by the end of the evening, there is a sense that there will have to be some more meaningful moves. It's a reminder of how unusual this era is that, across Westminster, the feeling about this serious legal effort to remove her from office can be described as blasÃ©. But after that, one Cabinet minister joked the prime minister will budge at ""five past seven"" (the vote took place at 19:00 GMT). And it's true that a shift to promising some kind of closer relationship with the EU, whether an actual customs union or something by a similar name, seems to be becoming more likely. That's not because everyone in the government, let alone in No 10 or in the Cabinet, thinks it's the right thing to do - Liam Fox, whose job it is to pursue an independent trade policy, is not the only one with significant doubts. But you can see a realistic route of getting that kind of arrangement through the House of Commons. One former minister involved in trying to persuade the PM to soften up said: ""We have three days to push and push her to move, or there won't be anything that can get through."" Even on the record now,ministers like David Gauke are acknowledging a customs union could be the solution,external. Whether that move comes tonight or tomorrow, or, if not, then maybe after a second attempt to get the existing plan with a few tweaks through Parliament fails, it is one of the potential routes that many in government are considering as a way out of the quagmire. What they know, however, is that if they take that path, it is at considerable risk to their own party. That's not just because the prime minister herself has said on many, many occasions she would not consider a customs union - there are plenty of ministers who believe that walking away with no deal is a preferable course of action and would fight it hard. That's not just because it would be a breach of the Tories' own manifesto. But also because there is a hardcore of Tory Brexiteers who say they would rather quit their party and walk away than support such a plan. That's no secret. They have said it many times publicly, and they say they are willing to see a historic split in the governing party. And, more dangerously for the prime minister, even if the plan was passed by the Commons, Labour might continue to push votes of no-confidence in the government beyond that, and those furious Eurosceptics might vote with the opposition to sink their own party. That might seem outlandish, and it may well never come to pass. But this has been the most brutal reality for Theresa May all along. There are some MPs in her own party - not very many - but a group for whom getting what they see as a ""proper"" Brexit is more important than staying in power. She may tack to a closer relationship with the EU in order to get a deal through Parliament in the next few weeks. But just as it was obvious at the start of this process, so it's clear now, Brexiteers in Parliament could be Theresa May's salvation or her ultimate undoing. PS:Nerds will welcome a reminder that a paragraph of one of Mrs May's long speeches about the EU might give her some cover for a pivot of position, if it's the way she has to go. She ruled out staying in the current Customs Union, but then came something you might describe as ""nebulous""... ""I do want us to have a customs agreement with the EU,"" she said. ""Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the Customs Union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position. ""I have an open mind on how we do it. It is not the means that matter, but the ends."" Let's see if in the next few days that paragraph suddenly feels rather relevant.

Crush death boy 'told to shut up by mum',"Alfie Lamb was previously described in court as a ""smiley"" boy A mum repeatedly told her three-year-old son to be quiet while he was being crushed to death by her boyfriend's car seat, a court has heard. Alfie Lamb cried so much ""it sounded like he was choking"" as he was squashed by Stephen Waterson, who was sitting in front of him, the Old Bailey heard. A woman who was in the back of the car with Alfie and his mother Adrian Hoare said the boy had asked for more space. Ms Hoare, 23, and Mr Waterson, 25, from Croydon, both deny manslaughter. The pair had been travelling with Emilie Williams and Marcus Lamb, who was driving, and were returning from a shopping trip to Sutton on 1 February last year. In a videoed police interview, 19-year-old Ms Williams said Mr Waterson's seat ""was right back... because he said he had to stretch his legs right out"". ""Alfie was kicking the chair, asking him to move it forward"" but apart from shifting it ""for a few seconds"", the 25-year-old refused, the jury heard. Despite the three-year-old's distress, Ms Hoare said the boy was ""getting himself worked up"" and she told him to ""shut up"", Ms Williams said. She told police Ms Hoare believed Alfie had gone to sleep when he went quiet, then ""thought he was just mucking around"" as she tried to wake him. The 19-year-old added that when the boy was lifted from the car by Mr Waterson, he looked ""pale"" and was not moving. The jury also heard Ms Williams had been threatened by Mr Waterson, who tried to persuade her to lie about what happened. ""He was telling me a lot of things. He said he would put me in the boot of the car and get rid of me. He said he would kill me,"" she said. Ms Hoare was also ""going along with it and helping"", Ms Williams said. Giving evidence by video-link, the 19-year-old told the court Ms Hoare had slapped her cheek outside Asda after Alfie died, which ""left a hand print for about half an hour."" Ms Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Miss Williams. Mr Waterson denies manslaughter and the intimidation of Mr Lamb. The couple and Ms Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making false statements to police. The trial continues.

Inflation at lowest in nearly two years,"The UK inflation rate fell to 2.1% in December, from 2.3% the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figure was the lowest in nearly two years, pushed down by petrol price falls. The inflation reading was in line with analysts' expectations. The figure is close to the Bank of England's target of 2% and may mean the Bank is less likely now to consider any rate rises in the near future. Inflation is being outstripped by average UK pay growth, with the most recent available figures showing that wages excluding bonuses were up by 3.3% for the three months to October 2018. The head of inflation at the ONS, Mike Hardie, said: ""Inflation eased mainly due to a big fall in petrol, with oil prices tumbling in recent months. ""Air fares also helped push down the rate, with seasonal prices rising less than they did last year. These were partially offset by small rises in hotel prices and mobile phone charges. ""House price growth was little changed in the year to November, with buoyant growth across much of the UK held back by London and the South East."" What's striking about the inflation figures isn't so much what they tell you about the cost of living. It's what they suggest about interest rates. In October, traders in the City were betting the Bank of England would seek to head off inflationary pressure and take some heat out of the economy by raising interest rates again by May. Pay rises had started to improve significantly, fuelling fears employers would have to start boosting prices to pay those higher labour costs and keep up their profits. In order to head off inflation and keep it close to the 2% target over the next two years, so the logic went, interest rates would have to rise sooner rather than later. But now the betting is a rate rise won't happen before November. And part of the reason may be Brexit-related uncertainty. In other words (so the theory goes) Brexit-related uncertainty is causing consumers to pull their horns in and businesses to hold back on new investment. Therefore there's less demand for the goods or services they wish to buy, and therefore less upwards pressure on prices. Therefore, in turn, there's less need for an early rise in interest rates. This might be some comfort if you're stuck with a huge mortgage, concerned about exactly when the next quarter-point rise in interest rates will come. Think of it as a modest silver lining to the gathering clouds of Brexit-related uncertainty. The price of petrol fell by 6.4p per litre on the month to 121.7p, which was the lowest price since April 2018. Diesel fell by 4.6p to 131.9p per litre, the weakest since July 2018. These downward effects were offset by upward contributions from a variety of categories, including accommodation services and, to a lesser extent, mobile phone charges, games, toys, hobbies and food. Inflation peaked at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017, but is now at its lowest since January of that year. The ONS said consumer prices over the fourth quarter as a whole were 2.27% higher than a year previously, a smaller rise than the 2.47% forecast by the Bank of England in November. The inflation figures also pointed to less short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices, the ONS added. For manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many imported - was 3.7% up on December 2017, down steeply from annual inflation of 5.3% in November and marking the weakest increase since June 2016. Examining the possibility of interest rate rises, Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said:  ""With inflation within a whisker of its 2% target, the [Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee] will probably feel comfortable in waiting until Brexit uncertainty is resolved before moving again. The fall in CPI inflation from 2.3% in November to 2.1% in December was bang in line with the consensus forecasts. Note that the MPC predicted in December that CPI inflation would fall to 1.75% by January.  So the committee's forecasts are on track."" She said that Ofgem's energy price cap on utility prices should subtract 0.2 percentage points from CPI inflation in January and, looking ahead further in the year, that inflation should remain below the Bank's 2% target for much of the year. Stephen Clarke, senior economics analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said the easing of inflation provides a ""welcome relief to households amid wider economic uncertainty"". He added: ""Assuming very damaging Brexit outcomes are avoided, a tight labour market continuing to put upward pressure on pay should mean 2019 is set to be a better - if not great - year for wages.""

How will the EU respond?,"This video can not be played The prime minister's Brexit deal is backed by 202 MPs but 432  vote against. Clearly Europe was fully expecting the defeat of the Brexit deal in parliament on Tuesday night. Seconds after the results were announced, pre-prepared tweets expressing disappointment came flooding in from EU leaders. Here in Brussels, frustration hung in the air. With 73 days to go until Brexit day, Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk appealed (once again) for clarity from the UK. ""MPs keep saying what they don't want,"" fumed one of their colleagues. ""They reject this deal. They reject no deal. They need to decide now what it is they will agree to."" Those in the UK who expect the EU to 'rush to the rescue' with proposed changes to the Brexit agreement are in for a let-down. Europe's leaders have no agreed Plan B up their sleeve and see no advantage in scrambling to find one. They believe the debate in the UK still needs to play out. What just happened and what comes next? Donald Tusk suggests UK should stay in EU Reality Check: What are the biggest government defeats? ""It's important not to rush now,"" urged Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, widely tipped to become Angela Merkel's successor. With the prospect of a softer Brexit looming, as well as the possibility, however small, of no Brexit at all, the EU thinks this is not a time to meddle. It's far more effective to keep up the pressure. One EU diplomat told me Theresa May should save on the plane fuel and not bother flying out to Brussels any time soon. ""We're not going to hold a special summit or anything,"" he said. ""There's nothing we Europeans can do today or tomorrow that will solve this. London has to come up with solutions, then we have to decide if we can accept them."" This video can not be played Brexit vote explained in one minute For now the EU insists it hasn't the slightest intention of re-negotiating the divorce deal, known as the Withdrawal Agreement. Leaders are fully aware many MPs hate the backstop, the Irish border guarantee written in to the agreement, but there's no indication the EU would give it up. It has insisted over and again that it intends to protect the Northern Ireland peace process, to stand up for the concerns of member state Ireland and - very important indeed to Brussels - to protect the single market (don't forget the land border between the EU and a post-Brexit UK will run down the island of Ireland). Brussels also interprets the sheer scale of the vote against the Brexit deal on Tuesday as a sign that MPs were rejecting far more than the backstop. EU leaders have expressed frustration at Tuesday's vote So what now? EU leaders think it increasingly likely that the Prime Minister will ask them for an extension to the Article 50 leaving process to allow her more time. And while European hearts sink at the thought of months' more uncertainty, indecision and going around in Brexit-related circles, they will most probably grant the extension. Preferably no longer than July to avoid having to select new UK MEPs - the European Parliament holds elections this year - but my contacts tell me the EU could extend Article 50 even longer if necessary. Bottom line: it's worth it to the EU, if it means avoiding a costly, chaotic no deal Brexit which would also hit European citizens and businesses hard. Back to Tuesday night's vote, EU diplomats tell me the bloc's position should become clearer next week. It's no mean feat coaxing 27 different leaders towards a common position.

Reports last week suggestedthey could be drastic with cuts on between 80% and 90% of goods, with some tariffs being scrapped completely. If you need a refresher on what tariffs are and what they aim to do, here's a handy explanation. BBC Radio 5 Live Sally Jones, Deloitte UKâs director for International Trade Policy, has been speaking about the UK's trading arrangements after Brexit and expectations that more information will be released today. She told Wake Up To Money that industries such as steel, ceramics and agriculture were concerned their products would be ""less competitive"". This is because they are already operating in markets where there are already high tariffs under the World Trade Organization rules and also where there is a lot of international competition. Taking cars as an example, tariffs here can be as high as 25% for component parts, and 10% for finished cars under WTO rules, she said. ""If we chose to set a zero tariff  on those components and finished cars for import into the UK then you would see competition for our plants in Sunderland and similar would be increased"". BBC News Channel Labour MP Stephen Kinnock says he had ""constructive talks"" with cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove and the prime minister's chief of staff Gavin Barwell. He says he raised the need for the prime minister to take no deal off the table, as well as discussing his preferred option of a Norway-style agreement, which would see a close relationship with the European Union. He told BBC News: âItâs time for all parties to come together in the national
interest."" Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has rejected government claims that it would take more than a year to organise another referendum. The Conservative MP, who is a supporter of the People's Vote campaign, said: ""The timetable put forward by the government is simply wrong and they must be aware of it themselves."" He says another referendum could be carried out ""swiftly and within a limited extension of Article 50"".

Home Secretary Sajid Javid has criticised a tweet from a Guardian columnist which references calculations that the Leave vote has been declining - in part due to older Leave supporters dying. Polly Toynbee was tweeting about her column, which discusses estimates that the Leave vote has been shrinking by about 1,350 a day. Mr Javid retweeted her along with the comment: ""How utterly disrespectful"". The calculation, conducted on behalf of the People's Vote campaign, takes into account the number of mainly Leave voters who have died, and mainly Remain voters who have reached voting age. The survey predicted that - assuming no voters changed their mind - demographic factors alone were causing the Leave majority to shrink by almost half a million a year.

Norman SmithAssistant political editor Senior Tory MP Nick Boles is seeking to secure parliamentary backing for a bill that would force the government to delay Article 50. The measure would kick in if Mrs May was unable to get a Brexit deal through the Commons by the end of February. Mr Boles said he believed a number of Cabinet ministers  - including the chancellor - support his plan. He also said ministers outside the Cabinet had told him they would resign if forced to oppose the measure. Mr Boles has decided to drop his previous plan to give the Liaison Committee the power to introduce a new draft bill after it was widely criticised by members of the committee. It's thought Mr Boles' proposal - if accepted by the speaker - would be voted on ahead of Mrs May's statement to MPs on her Brexit plans on 29 January. Mr Boles made his comments in an interview with the Political Thinking podcast - published tomorrow. Â© 2025 BBC.

What happens if there's a no-deal Brexit?,"If there is no deal, the UK would be reduced to trading on World Trade Organisation rules The UK government has been consistent in saying that even if there is no deal, it does not intend to bring in any new checks on goods crossing the borderâ-âis that feasible? Let's take a step backâ:â If there is no deal, then the UK is going to be trading with the EU and the rest of the world on what are known as World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. These arethe most basic set of rules for trade; âthey set out how far and in what ways each member guarantees to keep its markets open to all other members. Dublin open to extending Article 50 talks Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The hardest border - BBC News Reality Check: Could no-deal Brexit cause traffic jams? WTO terms mean tariffs on some goods, particularly food and agriculture, and much higher barriers to trade compared to the EU single market. The most important WTO principle is that you do not discriminate, âso if the UK government refused to check goods crossing the Irish border, then it also could not check goods arriving into UK ports from China, Brazil or anywhere else. But if the UK said Ireland was a special case and continued to check goods at other ports, then what would happen? Former WTO negotiator, Dmitry Grozoubinski, argues that if the UK were to breach those WTO rules by having an open border for Ireland but maintaining goods checks on its other borders,the immediate practical impact would be effectively nothing,external. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue That is because there is nothing like a WTO enforcement body that is immediately going to charge the UK, or force a policy change. The WTO is a member-driven organisation, so another member would have to make a complaint. The first stage would simply be an uncomfortable meeting for the UK, at which other members would express their displeasure. But still nothing would prevent the UK from keeping an open Irish border. There would then be a 60-day period in which the UK and whoever complained would try to resolve the issue. If the UK could not talk this member down, a WTO Panel would be convened and a formal case begun. If the panel were to find the open Irish border policy to be in breach of the rules, the UK would still get another chance to discuss compensation with the complainant, and at the very end of the process the panel could authorise ""retaliation"". The WTO sets the most basic rules for world trade That means working out how much the UK's border policy has disadvantaged the complainant, and letting them levy higher tariffs on the UK to balance that out. But by the time that happened it would be 2021 or even 2022, and the WTO still could not actually make the UK change its policy. But that would surely be a reckless move by the UK at a time when it is trying to persuade other countries to sign trade deals. Going rogue at the WTO would certainly be an eye-catching start to an independent trade policy but if the UK did go through with something like this there would be massive pressure on the EU and the Irish government. The Irish government has been insistent that even in a no-deal situation it would not be imposing border checks. But if the situation persisted for more than a couple of months, I am not sure that would be sustainable. The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) touched on this issue in its ""alternative to Chequers"" plan. Please upgrade your browser It suggested that one way to get around the non-discrimination requirement of the WTO would be to apply for a national security waiver. In limited circumstances, WTO rules can be broken if it is a requirement of a member state's national security. The IEA said: ""While waivers are narrowly drawn, the potential for conflict in Northern Ireland and a return to the Troubles would appear to be fully justify any request for a WTO waiver."" ""It is extremely unlikely that any WTO member will complain, given the question of the security of Northern Ireland. It is open to the EU to do the same, and if it does not, it would need to explain this to the Republic of Ireland."" WTO experts tell me this is a reasonable interpretation of the organisation's rules. The IEA suggests such a waiver could be in place for an initial two years. But the key point remains: Even if the WTO is on side, would the EU and its member states tolerate a situation where there is an open backdoor into the single market for more than a couple of months?

What is a vote of no confidence?,"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is facing a potential leadership crisis, after Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick resigned over the government's plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Senior Conservative Party figures have told BBC News political editor Chris Mason they would not be surprised if Mr Sunak ended up facing a no-confidence vote from his own MPs. It's a vote in which MPs from all parties decide whether they want the government to continue. It can trigger a general election and see a new prime minister appointed. While any MP can propose a no-confidence motion, there's no guarantee their request will be granted. However, if the leader of the opposition - currently Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - introduces the motion, convention means the government must provide parliamentary time for a debate. The wording is usually: ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government."" The motion only needs a simple majority to pass: one more MP needs to vote in favour than the number voting against. If the government wins, it carries on as before. At present,the government has a majority of 58 in the House of Commons,external, so a lot of Conservative MPs would need to to vote against their own government for the motion to succeed. When is the next general election? If the government loses, two things could happen. In normal circumstances, you would expect Parliament to be dissolved and a general election to be called. It is also possible that the King could invite somebody else to form a government - someone who could win a vote of confidence in the House of Commons. That would be very unusual. It last happened in January 1924, when Stanley Baldwin's Conservatives decided to assemble a new Parliament rather than resigning, after losing their majority in a general election. His government was defeated in a vote of no confidence and King George V asked Labour's Ramsay MacDonald -  leader of the second biggest party - to form a government instead. But almost a century later, it's not clear how that would work. Conservative MPs could agree on a different leader themselves, whom the King could then invite to form a new government. Rishi Sunak is the second prime minister of King Charles III's reign In principle, the monarch could even refuse to dissolve Parliament for an election. Under the Lascelles principles (devised by Sir Alan Lascelles, private secretary to King George VI in 1950), the monarch could decline to do so if: the existing Parliament was still capable of doing its job a general election would be bad for the economy another prime minister could be found who could get a majority in the House of Commons But these scenarios would put the monarch in a very difficult position, and it is not clear how they would play out. What does the King do? If the government loses a confidence vote, the situation is similar to that of an election in which no one party wins a majority. That means that the existing prime minister would only resign if it's clear someone else can command the support of the House of Commons. However, if an alternative government is ready to take over, convention suggests that the PM should stand down. But there is nothing clearly stated in law that says that they must do so. Failing to step down would risk bringing the King into the dispute, as the monarch appoints PMs and, in theory, can dismiss one who behaves unconstitutionally. It's very rare for a government to lose a no-confidence motion. It has only happened once since World War Two. That was in 1979, when the then Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan's minority government fell and was replaced by Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives at the subsequent general election. James Callaghan was the last PM to lose a no-confidence vote Except for the period between 2011 and March 2022, when the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was in place, prime ministers have been able to call a general election whenever they want. That means they can avoid a potential no-confidence vote by simply calling an election. Is axing fixed-term parliaments a good idea?

Kuenssberg: When will PM budge?,"""She is as inflexible as a dodo,"" one member of the government says of Theresa May - but that's not the only reason why she has been slow to compromise. We all know that if you stretch an elastic band at both ends, eventually it snaps. And throughout her leadership, the PM has had Parliament as a whole pulling at one end, and the Eurosceptics in her party at the other. It may be that in the next few days, the length of elastic finally can't cope with the tension anymore. One formerly extremely loyal Tory MP said this morning: ""Just at the moment when we need the maximum flexibility, we have the leader worst suited to it."" Brexit Live: Latest as MPs debate no-confidence vote Corbyn urges end of 'zombie government' What is a vote of no-confidence? Didn't the PM promise a cross-party approach last night? Well, the suggestion of those talks is not quite what you might expect. There's been no attempt from the government to reach out to the Labour official frontbench. And insiders have made it pretty clear that the idea would not include Jeremy Corbyn. So, the government's plan - at least for the next few hours - is to keep going with its plan more or less unchanged and peel off a few opposition MPs here and there. But by the end of the evening, there is a sense that there will have to be some more meaningful moves. It's a reminder of how unusual this era is that, across Westminster, the feeling about this serious legal effort to remove her from office can be described as blasÃ©. But after that, one Cabinet minister joked the prime minister will budge at ""five past seven"" (the vote took place at 19:00 GMT). And it's true that a shift to promising some kind of closer relationship with the EU, whether an actual customs union or something by a similar name, seems to be becoming more likely. That's not because everyone in the government, let alone in No 10 or in the Cabinet, thinks it's the right thing to do - Liam Fox, whose job it is to pursue an independent trade policy, is not the only one with significant doubts. But you can see a realistic route of getting that kind of arrangement through the House of Commons. One former minister involved in trying to persuade the PM to soften up said: ""We have three days to push and push her to move, or there won't be anything that can get through."" Even on the record now,ministers like David Gauke are acknowledging a customs union could be the solution,external. Whether that move comes tonight or tomorrow, or, if not, then maybe after a second attempt to get the existing plan with a few tweaks through Parliament fails, it is one of the potential routes that many in government are considering as a way out of the quagmire. What they know, however, is that if they take that path, it is at considerable risk to their own party. That's not just because the prime minister herself has said on many, many occasions she would not consider a customs union - there are plenty of ministers who believe that walking away with no deal is a preferable course of action and would fight it hard. That's not just because it would be a breach of the Tories' own manifesto. But also because there is a hardcore of Tory Brexiteers who say they would rather quit their party and walk away than support such a plan. That's no secret. They have said it many times publicly, and they say they are willing to see a historic split in the governing party. And, more dangerously for the prime minister, even if the plan was passed by the Commons, Labour might continue to push votes of no-confidence in the government beyond that, and those furious Eurosceptics might vote with the opposition to sink their own party. That might seem outlandish, and it may well never come to pass. But this has been the most brutal reality for Theresa May all along. There are some MPs in her own party - not very many - but a group for whom getting what they see as a ""proper"" Brexit is more important than staying in power. She may tack to a closer relationship with the EU in order to get a deal through Parliament in the next few weeks. But just as it was obvious at the start of this process, so it's clear now, Brexiteers in Parliament could be Theresa May's salvation or her ultimate undoing. PS:Nerds will welcome a reminder that a paragraph of one of Mrs May's long speeches about the EU might give her some cover for a pivot of position, if it's the way she has to go. She ruled out staying in the current Customs Union, but then came something you might describe as ""nebulous""... ""I do want us to have a customs agreement with the EU,"" she said. ""Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the Customs Union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position. ""I have an open mind on how we do it. It is not the means that matter, but the ends."" Let's see if in the next few days that paragraph suddenly feels rather relevant.

No-deal 'may mean border checks',"Nigel Dodds MP uploaded this picture of the meeting to his Twitter account A Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) delegation has met Prime Minister Theresa May, just hours before the government saw off a no-confidence vote. The votes of the 10 DUP MPs were crucial in backing Mrs May, who won by 19 votes. The DUP voted against Mrs May's Brexit deal in Parliament on Tuesday. Party leader Arlene Foster said the meeting with the PM had been ""useful"" and that discussions would continue. Meanwhile, the Irish government has said it is activating plans for a no-deal Brexit, should the UK leave the EU with no deal. LIVE: May wins no-confidence vote What happens if there's a no-deal Brexit? Brexit deal: How did your MP vote? NI businesses: 'Take no deal off table' The DUP said the result of the Brexit vote had made a no-deal outcome more likely, and has urged Mrs May to return to Brussels to seek concessions on the Irish border backstop. Speaking after she met the prime minister, Mrs Foster said: ""These are critical times for the United Kingdom and we have indicated that first and foremost we will act in the national interest."" The rejection of the deal by MPs has put the manner of the UK's departure on 29 March in doubt. This video can not be played Ireland's no-deal Brexit plans 'now being implemented' Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he would do everything he could to avoid no deal, but had to ensure the Republic of Ireland was fully prepared. ""These are no longer contingency plans, they are being implemented,"" he said. The Irish government is to bring an ""omnibus"" piece of legislation to the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament), which willcover no-deal planning for: Checks at ports and airports Customs, sanitary and phytosanitary checks (measures to protect humans, animals and plants from diseases, pests or contaminants) The supply of medicines The government was not currently making plans for checks along the Irish border, Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin. He warned businesses and other organisations to get their plans in place, if they were not already doing so. Mr Varadkar said the ""onus"" was on Westminster to come up with an ultimate solution - but he still believed the current withdrawal deal was a good agreement. ""The ball is very much in Westminster's court, now they need to come up with something they can get through Parliament,"" he said. ""Over the coming weeks the government will continue to work with EU partners in a collective effort to conclude talks with the UK to get a deal. The Irish border has been one of the biggest sticking points during Brexit negotiations ""We've always said if the UK were to evolve from its red lines on the customs union and the single market, then the EU position could evolve also."" The only long-term solution to the Irish border issue would have to come ""not through goodwill but through an agreement"" that the EU accepts, added the taoiseach. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar's deputy Simon Coveney said the Republic of Ireland would not block a UK request to extend the Brexit deadline, as long as the UK has a workable plan to discuss. Analysis by Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter Dublin is playing this carefully. The Irish government is reluctant to say anything that could further stoke tensions, but all the while acutely aware that time is running out. It continues to ramp up no-deal preparations, including on key issues like transport and the supply of medicines. The DUP says the scale of the defeat last night means the backstop cannot remain in the deal, but Irish thinking is unlikely to budge. It is mindful of its often-repeated commitment to avoid the return of a hard Irish border, and has banked on the backstop being its insurance policy to ensure that. Dublin will now be looking to its support network in Brussels to stand firm in the face of any political pressure from Westminster. EU planning notices published last month said that in the event of no deal, every consignment of animal products (including food) coming into the EU from the UK would have to undergo checks ""at the point of entry"". It did not suggest that Ireland would be exempt from that. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) On Monday, the UK prime minister said those EU plans made it ""clear there will be no flexibility on border checks in no deal"". ""The Irish government will be expected to apply EU checks in full,"" she added. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said the Theresa May's defeat over the Brexit deal reinforced the need for the Irish government to ""stand firm"" on the backstop. Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said the government needed to ""grab this process by the scruff of the neck and seek an extension to Article 50""  - a law which triggered the process of Brexit.

Mr Eastwood said the majority of people in Northern Ireland believed the backstop was the only way to protect the interests of all communities. ""This voice cannot be ignored,"" he added. Alliance leader Naomi Long said the scale of the prime minister's defeat was ""surprising"" and the only way forward was another referendum.

Pregnant MP and proxy voting,"This video can not be played MP delays C-section for Brexit vote Among those crowded into the House of Commons in the picture above, for the crunch Brexit vote, is one participant who really did have somewhere else to be - heavily-pregnant Labour MP Tulip Siddiq. That's her in the blue dress, sitting in a wheelchair, turning up to take part in the democratic process. She has revealed that she haddelayed giving birth until later this week so she could voteon the deal. Her actions have reignited the debate over proxy voting in Parliament. The UK does not have a system in place where an MP can nominate a proxy to vote on their behalf, even if they have recently become a parent - or are just about to give birth. There is a system in Parliament for MPs who cannot make a vote called ""pairing"" - where an MP on either side of an issue agree to not vote, so cancelling each other out. However, Ms Siddiq said she did not trust the systemafter Tory chairman Brandon Lewis was accused of breaking the system when he voted on a Trade Bill, despite being paired with Lib Dem Jo Swinson, who was on maternity leave. He later apologised for making an ""honest mistake"". Ms Siddiq, who endured a difficult first pregnancy with her daughter two years ago, had been advised by doctors to have a Caesarean section on Monday or Tuesday this week, but agreed to postpone the procedure until Thursday so she could vote. She said: ""If my son enters the world even one day later than the doctors advised, but it's a world with a better chance of a strong relationship between Britain and Europe, then that's worth fighting for.""

Commons Speaker John Bercow said that a proxy vote for Ms Siddiq would be his ""preference"", but it was not in his power to grant it. However, he was happy for her to be ""nodded through"". This process normally means an MP's vote can be counted if they are anywhere on the parliamentary estate, rather than going through the voting lobby. After the Brexit vote, SNP health spokeswoman Philippa Whitford raised the issue in the Commons. She said Ms Siddiq was due to have a Caesarean section because she has a ""high risk"" pregnancy and gestational diabetes. Dr Whitford told the Commons on a point of order after the Brexit vote: ""I have to say, as a doctor, to put our colleague at risk - and her baby at risk - because we cannot have a method of allowing those who are sick or pregnant (to vote) is disgraceful.""

Stricter age ratings for film rape scenes,"Keira Knightley's film The Duchess would get a higher age rating under the new system Under-15s will no longer be able to go to see films that depict rape and other sexual violence under new rules set by Britain's film ratings body. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) surveyed more than 10,000 people and found it to be among parents' main concerns. Any film showing sexual violence will now get at least a 15 rating rather than a 12 or a 12A. The BBFC also wants its ratings to appear on all streaming services. BBFC chief executive David Austin said a film like Keira Knightley's 2008 drama The Duchess, which was classed as a 12 at the time, would be made a 15 today because it included a rape scene. ""What parents told us was, that's too much for 12-year-olds,"" he told BBC News. ""It's enough that a 12-year-old knows that a rape has taken place. They do not need to see it, no matter how discreetly it's filmed."" In the survey, parents said they were worried about the ""sexualisation of society and what they called the pornification of society"", according to Mr Austin. ""They are worried about children growing up being exposed to too much too soon, and they want to hold onto their children's childhood as far as they can,"" he said. ""That's another one of the reasons why from now on we will not be classifying any depiction of sexual violence at 12. We will limit it to 15."" The BBFC said they were right to give Netflix's To The Bone a 15 rating The BBFC also looked at other ""real life"" scenarios like self-harm, mental health and suicide, but said its existing rules were in line with the public's views. For example, viewers were happy that Netflix's To The Bone, about a young women dealing with anorexia, was given a 15. ""Parents and children said we were right to do this because that issue is not suitable when it's shown in that way for 12-year-olds,"" Mr Austin said. Viewers were less worried about less realistic action violence, such as that seen in James Bond or Marvel films, the survey found. Meanwhile, 95% of teenagers surveyed said they want online streaming services to carry the same age ratings as cinemas and DVDs. They already appear on many Netflix shows and films, but Mr Austin said they were working with Netflix to make it 100% - as well as working with other services. He said: ""We are going to be working in 2019 with some of the big platforms to fulfil what the public has asked us to do, which is to ensure those ratings are consistent when you view something at the cinema, whether you view it on DVD or whether you view it on a tablet in your bedroom."" The new guidelines will come into effect on 28 February. Red Sparrow would be an 18 if it was released under the new guidelines The Duchess - now would be 15 rather than 12A. The film contains a brief scene in which a man pushes a woman onto a bed and forces himself on her. The scene cuts away to outside the room but the actions implicate rape. Under the old guidelines this was considered permissible at 12A as the guidelines stated that sexual violence may be ""briefly and discreetly indicated"". However, the public were clear in the consultation that sexual violence should not be depicted at all at 12A and the new guidelines now prohibit this. The Kite Runner - now would be 15 rather than 12A. Similarly with The Duchess, The Kite Runner contains a scene with a rape implication. For the same reasons as above, the implicated actions would no longer permissible at 12A. 10 Cloverfield Lane - now would be 15 rather than 12A. Focus groups felt that the level of threat in the film was strong, rather than moderate, aggravated by the fact that the threat occurs within a realistic setting (at least until the sci-fi reveal later in the film). The threat also carries an element of sexual threat. The old guidelines permitted moderate physical and psychological threat at 12A but the new guidelines say any sexual threat must be brief and negatively presented. Sausage Party - now would be 18 rather than 15. Respondents to the research questions were surprised by the level of sexual detail throughout the film and considered that describing ""strong sex references"" was understated; suggesting ""strong sexual themes"" as a more accurate description. Wind River - now would be 18 rather than 15. Focus groups felt that the build-up of the sexual threat, combined with the gang nature and the recognisable 'real world' context were aggravating factors. The new guidelines state that sexual violence at 15 must not be detailed or prolonged and that credible real word settings and the presence of a gang dynamic are aggravating factors. Red Sparrow - now would be 18 rather than 15. Viewers did not feel enough had been cut from the film to classify it as a 15, and they particularly objected to the film's depiction of sexual violence and the way it combines sex and violence.

She said the receptionist had explained that Dr Krishan was Scottish, only to be told: ""She doesn't look Scottish."" The receptionist then replied: ""What do Scottish people look like?""

Man dumped 100 tonnes of waste at school,"The school said beetles hatching from the tip ""took over the area"" A lorry driver who dumped 100 tonnes of stinking waste on a special school's car park, landing it with a Â£22,000 bill, has been jailed for 12 months. Francis Heaton, 61, admitted leaving the pile at Oldham's Kingfisher Special School, in April 2018. The school's principal said the smell from ""the rotting tip was unbearable"". Judge Paul Lawton told Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court that Heaton, of Gorton, had committed a ""deliberate, selfish and unlawful act"". Heaton's fly-tipping and subsequent arrest was caught on a dashcam by police The pile meant windows at the primary school, which accommodates 192 children with complex and severe learning needs, could not be opened, leading to staff concerns about the health of children. It also disturbed the routine of a number of pupils with autism, which the school said had caused them distress. More stories from the North West of England Heaton was caught by police while dumping waste and he later told officers he had made five trips to the site. The Environment Agency, which investigated Heaton and brought the case against him, said the lock on the school's gates had been cut to allow him access to dump Trommel fines, highly processed household waste which is usually taken to landfill as it cannot be recycled. In court, Heaton's defence counsel said he was a man of ""very limited income"", who was the ""fall guy"" for others who had organised the dumping. ""There's a much greater degree of culpability further up the line,"" his counsel said, adding that another man seen in the lorry with Heaton had never been traced. Heaton was described by his defence as a ""fall guy"" for others who arranged the dumping Sentencing Heaton, Judge Lawton said it was ""inconceivable"" anyone could have thought the site was suitable for tipping. He added that dumping the waste had been ""a deliberate, selfish and unlawful act for short-term financial reward"". In a statement, the school's executive principal Anne Redmond said not only was the smell ""unbearable"" but ""flying beetles"" had hatched from the pile and infested the area. She added her thanks to police for catching Heaton ""so swiftly"", as if they had not arrested him, ""who knows how many more lorry loads of waste would have been tipped on our site?""

""They are worried about children growing up being exposed to too much too soon, and they want to hold onto their children's childhood as far as they can,"" he said. ""That's another one of the reasons why from now on we will not be classifying any depiction of sexual violence at 12. We will limit it to 15."" The BBFC said they were right to give Netflix's To The Bone a 15 rating The BBFC also looked at other ""real life"" scenarios like self-harm, mental health and suicide, but said its existing rules were in line with the public's views. For example, viewers were happy that Netflix's To The Bone, about a young women dealing with anorexia, was given a 15. ""Parents and children said we were right to do this because that issue is not suitable when it's shown in that way for 12-year-olds,"" Mr Austin said. Viewers were less worried about less realistic action violence, such as that seen in James Bond or Marvel films, the survey found. Meanwhile, 95% of teenagers surveyed said they want online streaming services to carry the same age ratings as cinemas and DVDs. They already appear on many Netflix shows and films, but Mr Austin said they were working with Netflix to make it 100% - as well as working with other services. He said: ""We are going to be working in 2019 with some of the big platforms to fulfil what the public has asked us to do, which is to ensure those ratings are consistent when you view something at the cinema, whether you view it on DVD or whether you view it on a tablet in your bedroom."" The new guidelines will come into effect on 28 February. Red Sparrow would be an 18 if it was released under the new guidelines The Duchess - now would be 15 rather than 12A. The film contains a brief scene in which a man pushes a woman onto a bed and forces himself on her. The scene cuts away to outside the room but the actions implicate rape. Under the old guidelines this was considered permissible at 12A as the guidelines stated that sexual violence may be ""briefly and discreetly indicated"". However, the public were clear in the consultation that sexual violence should not be depicted at all at 12A and the new guidelines now prohibit this. The Kite Runner - now would be 15 rather than 12A. Similarly with The Duchess, The Kite Runner contains a scene with a rape implication. For the same reasons as above, the implicated actions would no longer permissible at 12A. 10 Cloverfield Lane - now would be 15 rather than 12A. Focus groups felt that the level of threat in the film was strong, rather than moderate, aggravated by the fact that the threat occurs within a realistic setting (at least until the sci-fi reveal later in the film). The threat also carries an element of sexual threat. The old guidelines permitted moderate physical and psychological threat at 12A but the new guidelines say any sexual threat must be brief and negatively presented. Sausage Party - now would be 18 rather than 15. Respondents to the research questions were surprised by the level of sexual detail throughout the film and considered that describing ""strong sex references"" was understated; suggesting ""strong sexual themes"" as a more accurate description. Wind River - now would be 18 rather than 15. Focus groups felt that the build-up of the sexual threat, combined with the gang nature and the recognisable 'real world' context were aggravating factors. The new guidelines state that sexual violence at 15 must not be detailed or prolonged and that credible real word settings and the presence of a gang dynamic are aggravating factors. Red Sparrow - now would be 18 rather than 15. Viewers did not feel enough had been cut from the film to classify it as a 15, and they particularly objected to the film's depiction of sexual violence and the way it combines sex and violence.

European 'surprise' at scale of Brexit defeat,"European newspapers and broadcasters have reacted with surprise to the scale, if not the fact, of UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Commons defeat on her Brexit deal. Although few are willing to predict what happens next, many expect a delay to the 29 March deadline for Britain to leave the European Union. In France, the centre-left dailyLe Monde,externalcalls the defeat ""more stinging than the most alarming prediction"", and wonders whether Mrs May can ""survive politically, as cosmetic operations will not be enough to change MPs' minds"". ""This launches a new dynamic. Anything is now possible in both the British political scene and the future of Brexit"" France's Le Figaro sees the ""most important defeat in the history of British parliamentary democracy"" The centre-rightFigaro,externalsays the ""most important defeat in the history of British parliamentary democracy has plunged the country a little deeper into chaos"" - a point also made by the left-wing dailyLiberation,external. Le Figaro turns its attention to opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying the best way for him to avoid a second Brexit referendum would be to ""start talks with Theresa May on reaching a compromise"". ""This seems improbable, but in times of crisis nothing is off the table,"" the paper says. Liberation says the UK ""no longer lives in normal circumstances"" Liberation remarks that the ""unprecedented scale of May's defeat would have resulted in her immediate resignation in normal circumstances, but since the Brexit referendum more than two and a half years ago Britain... no longer lives in normal circumstances"". ""Chaos"" and ""disorder"" are the keywords in German coverage of the vote, from the populistBild,externaltabloid to theHandelsblatt,externalbusiness daily. Suddeutsche Zeitung says Mrs May ""took her brutal defeat stoically"" Munich's centre-leftSueddeutsche Zeitung,externalsays Britain ""has become rather ungovernable"". It sees Mrs May taking her ""brutal defeat stoically"", but wonders where she intends to go with Brexit. The centre-rightFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,externalis also reduced to musing that ""it will be interesting to see what happens next"". The centre-rightDie Welt,externalsees little immediate prospect of a stable response in Downing Street. In answer to the question ""quo vadis Britannia?"" (""Where are you marching, Britain?"") it thinks Mrs May will be ""counting on pragmatism from Brussels"". There is some sympathy for Theresa May's predicament. Vienna's centre-rightDie Presse,externalpraised her ""unperturbed and well prepared"" response to defeat, adding that ""no one could blame her for not fighting to the last second... for her political survival"". But other commentators are far less forgiving. Begona Arce in Spain'sEl Periodico,externalsays Mrs May ""achieved the impossible, by managing to unite the Conservatives with the opposition against the Brexit plan. It is a colossal failure after almost two years of negotiations"". Der Standard believes Mrs May ""put party interests before the country"" Sebastian Borger in Austria's centre-leftDer Standard,externalagrees that Mrs May's ""bitter defeat was well deserved"" as she had ""put party interests before the country"". ""When the difficult situation in Ireland in particular should have made her soften her plans, she still tried to ingratiate herself with the enemies of the EU in her own party, but to no avail,"" he says. The Irish Times expects Article 50 to be paused In the Republic of Ireland itself, Pat Leahy of theIrish Times,externalexpects that Article 50 will now ""be paused to allow parliament to give its view, and for the EU to respond"". The Irish Examiner's Gerard Howlin,externalagrees that nothing is clear beyond the possible postponement of Britain's departure on 29 March. He sees the ""end of the beginning of Brexit"", but warns that the ""beginning of the end is not in sight yet"". Theresa May should not count on concessions from the European Union, according to Italy'sLa Stampa,external, which leads on Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warning that ""time is almost up"". La Stampa references a war film with its caption ""Brexit â the Longest Day"" The paper adds that Brussels is ""also preparing for a no-deal Brexit by approving 14 temporary measures"". Rzeczpospolita says ""Disaster for May in the House of Commons â what next for Brexit?"" In Poland,Rzeczpospolita's Artur Bartkiewicz,externalfears that ""the time left is physically not enough for parliament to adopt even the basic measures to avoid economic catastrophe"". The Dutch public broadcasterNOS,externaldoes not see much chance of a postponement to the 29 March departure day, either. It says all 27 EU countries would have to agree, and ""not everyone is keen on letting Britain keep tweaking an agreement that will not make it through the House of Commons anyway"". At least the Dutch centre-leftVolkskrant,externaldaily thinks Mrs May will live to fight another day. Volkskrant thinks the prime minister will survive the no-confidence vote It says she should survive the no-confidence vote, despite the ""greatest political crisis since Guy Fawkes tried to blow up parliament four centuries ago"", as Brexit supporters see her as the best chance of a no-deal departure - ""which is ironic, given that they tried to remove her just before Christmas"". Belgium's centre-left dailyDe Morgen,externallooks further ahead, and insists that the only way forward is to ""let the British people choose how to untie this Gordian knot in a referendum"". The Czech Republic'sMlada Fronta Dnes,externalhas had enough. Over a cartoon of the Mr Bean comedy character, it complains that the British ""are really overdoing it with their crazy humour!""

Massive ice disc forms in US river,"This video can not be played The giant ice disc has been slowly spinning A rare natural phenomenon taking shape in the US state of Maine is mesmerising people around the world. A giant slow-turning ice disc, measuring approximately 91m (298ft) wide, has formed in the Presumpscot River in the city of Westbrook. The captivating natural oddity has drawn comparison to an alien spacecraft, a carousel and the Moon. Researchers believe ice discs spin because of temperature changes in the water, creating a vortex underneath. The movement chips away the edges, creating its circular shape. Allow Facebook content?

Hillsborough scene 'set for failure',"Graham Mackrell (left) and David Duckenfield deny the charges against them Jurors at the trial of Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield have heard how ""the scene was almost literally set"" for failure. Prosecutors said the ground's safety certificate had not been updated or amended since it was granted in 1979 - a decade before the disaster. Mr Duckenfield, 74, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. Ex-Sheffield Wednesday secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, denies safety breaches. Richard Matthews QC told Preston Crown Court: ""Few of those involved with the safety certificate appear to have performed their function diligently."" The stadium safety certificate was ""very out of date"" by 1989, the jury was told. The arrangements at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989 meant 10,100 Liverpool fans had to get through seven turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, the court heard. The jury was shown images of the police control box overlooking the terraces Mr Matthews told the jury the Crown's case was that ""the risk of death was obvious, serious and present throughout the failings of David Duckenfield to show reasonable care"". He said it was an ""extraordinary failure"" for Mr Duckenfield not to have personal knowledge of the potential confining points and hazards to safe entry at the stadium. Earlier, the jury was given a virtual tour of the stadium and shown the view from inside the police control box. Prosecutors showed what would have been on each of the television screens in front of Mr Duckenfield and his team on 15 April 1989. Mr Matthews said the jury would hear from expert John Cutlack who estimated the capacity figure for the Leppings Lane terrace, where the fatal crush happened, should have been 5,426, rather than 7,200. The jury was shown a video of an FA Cup semi final at Hillsborough in 1981 between Spurs and Wolves where the terraces became too full and the crowd was allowed to sit on the edge of the pitch. Mr Matthews said the court would hear evidence of police blocking access to the terrace during that match and stopping any more spectators from entering during the game. This video can not be played Hillsborough trial: Jury shown police view of stadium Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, is accused in relation to the deaths of 95 people who were in the crowd at Sheffield Wednesday's ground for the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The retired chief superintendent was South Yorkshire Police's match commander for the game. Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Mr Mackrell is charged with contravening the stadium's safety certificate and a health and safety offence. Mr Mackrell was the club's designated safety officer for the Hillsborough stadium. The 96 people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Jurors have been told 96 fans were killed as a result of a crush in pens at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. Of those, 94 died on the same day. The youngest of the victims had been 10-year-old Jon-Paul Gilhooley. Lee Nicol, 14, died two days later and Tony Bland, who suffered ""terrible brain damage"" was in a permanent vegetative state until his death in March 1993, jurors heard. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the death of Mr Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused.

'IS attack' kills US troops in Syria,"The Kurdish Hawar News Agency said the blast occurred at a restaurant US soldiers have been killed in an apparent suicide bombing in northern Syria claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, the US military has said. IS said a militant had detonated an explosive vest next to a US patrol in the Kurdish-held town of Manbij. Two US soldiers, a civilian employee at the defence department and a contractor died, US Central Command said. Another three US soldiers were wounded. US forces are in Manbij to back Kurdish and Arab forces. IS fighters have been driven out of almost all of eastern Syria. Turkey 'ready to set up Syria safe zone' War-weary Syrians in Manbij wait to learn fate Is Trump ending the 'Forever Wars'? After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Wednesday's attack took place at a restaurant near Manbij's main market. The US troops were at the restaurant to meet members of the Manbij Military Council, a witness told Reuters news agency.

TheUS soldiers were subsequently evacuated by a helicopter that landed on a playground,external, the Syrian Kurdish Hawar News Agency reports. It cited the head of Manbij's health committee as saying that 18 people had been killed, including the US soldiers, and that another 18 had been wounded. US troops used armoured vehicles to patrol the centre of Manbij following the attack US Central Command later confirmed that four Americans were killed. ""Two US service members, one department of defence (DoD) civilian and one contractor supporting DoD were killed and three service members were injured while conducting a local engagement in Manbij,""it said in a statement.,external Last month, President Donald Trump announced that the US would begin pulling out all its 2,000 troops from Syria because IS had been ""defeated"". Opponents of the withdrawal stressed that although IS now controlled only 1% of the territory they overran five years ago, the group had not disappeared entirely. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has previously criticised Mr Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, said on Wednesday that the move could encourage IS attacks and ""set in motion enthusiasm by the enemy we're fighting"". Later,US Vice-President Mike Pence said he and President Trump condemned the attack in Syria,externalbut reiterated that the withdrawal plan would continue. ""We have crushed the [IS] caliphate and devastated its capabilities. As we begin to bring our troops home... we will never allow the remnants of [IS] to re-establish their evil and murderous caliphate."" A recent US report said there were still as many as 14,000 IS militants in Syria and even more in neighbouring Iraq - and that they were expected to shift to guerrilla tactics in an attempt to rebuild their network. Syrian Kurds also fear that Manbij and other towns they control near the border with Turkey might come under attack by the Turkish military, which wants to clear them of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia. The Turkish government considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades.

"Inflation at lowest in nearly two yearsUK inflation fell to 2.1% in December, pushed down by falling fuel prices.BusinessComments","The UK inflation rate fell to 2.1% in December, from 2.3% the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figure was the lowest in nearly two years, pushed down by petrol price falls. The inflation reading was in line with analysts' expectations. The figure is close to the Bank of England's target of 2% and may mean the Bank is less likely now to consider any rate rises in the near future. Inflation is being outstripped by average UK pay growth, with the most recent available figures showing that wages excluding bonuses were up by 3.3% for the three months to October 2018. The head of inflation at the ONS, Mike Hardie, said: ""Inflation eased mainly due to a big fall in petrol, with oil prices tumbling in recent months. ""Air fares also helped push down the rate, with seasonal prices rising less than they did last year. These were partially offset by small rises in hotel prices and mobile phone charges. ""House price growth was little changed in the year to November, with buoyant growth across much of the UK held back by London and the South East."" What's striking about the inflation figures isn't so much what they tell you about the cost of living. It's what they suggest about interest rates. In October, traders in the City were betting the Bank of England would seek to head off inflationary pressure and take some heat out of the economy by raising interest rates again by May. Pay rises had started to improve significantly, fuelling fears employers would have to start boosting prices to pay those higher labour costs and keep up their profits. In order to head off inflation and keep it close to the 2% target over the next two years, so the logic went, interest rates would have to rise sooner rather than later. But now the betting is a rate rise won't happen before November. And part of the reason may be Brexit-related uncertainty. In other words (so the theory goes) Brexit-related uncertainty is causing consumers to pull their horns in and businesses to hold back on new investment. Therefore there's less demand for the goods or services they wish to buy, and therefore less upwards pressure on prices. Therefore, in turn, there's less need for an early rise in interest rates. This might be some comfort if you're stuck with a huge mortgage, concerned about exactly when the next quarter-point rise in interest rates will come. Think of it as a modest silver lining to the gathering clouds of Brexit-related uncertainty. The price of petrol fell by 6.4p per litre on the month to 121.7p, which was the lowest price since April 2018. Diesel fell by 4.6p to 131.9p per litre, the weakest since July 2018. These downward effects were offset by upward contributions from a variety of categories, including accommodation services and, to a lesser extent, mobile phone charges, games, toys, hobbies and food. Inflation peaked at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017, but is now at its lowest since January of that year. The ONS said consumer prices over the fourth quarter as a whole were 2.27% higher than a year previously, a smaller rise than the 2.47% forecast by the Bank of England in November. The inflation figures also pointed to less short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices, the ONS added. For manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many imported - was 3.7% up on December 2017, down steeply from annual inflation of 5.3% in November and marking the weakest increase since June 2016. Examining the possibility of interest rate rises, Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said:  ""With inflation within a whisker of its 2% target, the [Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee] will probably feel comfortable in waiting until Brexit uncertainty is resolved before moving again. The fall in CPI inflation from 2.3% in November to 2.1% in December was bang in line with the consensus forecasts. Note that the MPC predicted in December that CPI inflation would fall to 1.75% by January.  So the committee's forecasts are on track."" She said that Ofgem's energy price cap on utility prices should subtract 0.2 percentage points from CPI inflation in January and, looking ahead further in the year, that inflation should remain below the Bank's 2% target for much of the year. Stephen Clarke, senior economics analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said the easing of inflation provides a ""welcome relief to households amid wider economic uncertainty"".

U-turn over InfoWars on smart TVsRoku bans Alex Jones after initially defending its decision to stream the conspiracy theorist's channel.Technology,"Apple's ban of Alex Jones's InfoWars podcasts last August led to similar moves by several other technology companies Video-streaming service Roku has made a U-turn over its addition of InfoWars - the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's channel. Social media activists noticed,externalRoku was offering the channel earlier this week, half a year after YouTube, Facebook and Apple, among others, had banned it. Roku initially defended the decision on the grounds it did not censor content unless it was illegal. But it has backtracked, after facing widespread criticism. Roku makes set-top boxes and video-streaming sticks that provide access to thousands of channels of third-party content. In addition, its technology is built into several brands of smart TVs and Blu-ray players. The California-based company recently declared ithad nearly 24 million active accounts,external. It thus provided Jones a mainstream outlet after others, including Twitter, Spotify and Vimeo, had joined a wider ban and blocked his accounts last year. This censorship had been criticised by some free speech advocates and Roku appeared to side with them when it issued an initial statement. ""We do not curate or censor based on viewpoint,"" it said. ""While the vast majority of all streaming on our platform is mainstream entertainment, voices on all sides of an issue or cause are free to operate a channel."" But it subsequently faced a backlash that included criticism by lawyers representing the families of victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting. Jones had previously falsely claimed that the 2012 massacre had been ""staged"" with actors and that the 26 children and adults killed had not been harmed. Roku says it is installed on more than 25% of all smart TVs sold in the US The lawyers accused Roku of being ""indifferent to the suffering"" the families had experienced and added that the company was interfering with ""efforts to prevent people like Jones from profiting off innocent victims whose lives have been turned upside down by unspeakable loss"". Several hours later, Roku said it had changed its mind. ""After the InfoWars channel became available, we heard from concerned parties and have determined that the channel should be removed from our platform,""it tweeted,external. ""Deletion from the channel store and platform has begun and will be completed shortly.""

Kuenssberg: When will May budge?,"""She is as inflexible as a dodo,"" one member of the government says of Theresa May - but that's not the only reason why she has been slow to compromise. We all know that if you stretch an elastic band at both ends, eventually it snaps. And throughout her leadership, the PM has had Parliament as a whole pulling at one end, and the Eurosceptics in her party at the other. It may be that in the next few days, the length of elastic finally can't cope with the tension anymore. One formerly extremely loyal Tory MP said this morning: ""Just at the moment when we need the maximum flexibility, we have the leader worst suited to it."" Brexit Live: Latest as MPs debate no-confidence vote Corbyn urges end of 'zombie government' What is a vote of no-confidence? Didn't the PM promise a cross-party approach last night? Well, the suggestion of those talks is not quite what you might expect. There's been no attempt from the government to reach out to the Labour official frontbench. And insiders have made it pretty clear that the idea would not include Jeremy Corbyn. So, the government's plan - at least for the next few hours - is to keep going with its plan more or less unchanged and peel off a few opposition MPs here and there. But by the end of the evening, there is a sense that there will have to be some more meaningful moves. It's a reminder of how unusual this era is that, across Westminster, the feeling about this serious legal effort to remove her from office can be described as blasÃ©. But after that, one Cabinet minister joked the prime minister will budge at ""five past seven"" (the vote took place at 19:00 GMT). And it's true that a shift to promising some kind of closer relationship with the EU, whether an actual customs union or something by a similar name, seems to be becoming more likely. That's not because everyone in the government, let alone in No 10 or in the Cabinet, thinks it's the right thing to do - Liam Fox, whose job it is to pursue an independent trade policy, is not the only one with significant doubts. But you can see a realistic route of getting that kind of arrangement through the House of Commons. One former minister involved in trying to persuade the PM to soften up said: ""We have three days to push and push her to move, or there won't be anything that can get through."" Even on the record now,ministers like David Gauke are acknowledging a customs union could be the solution,external. Whether that move comes tonight or tomorrow, or, if not, then maybe after a second attempt to get the existing plan with a few tweaks through Parliament fails, it is one of the potential routes that many in government are considering as a way out of the quagmire. What they know, however, is that if they take that path, it is at considerable risk to their own party. That's not just because the prime minister herself has said on many, many occasions she would not consider a customs union - there are plenty of ministers who believe that walking away with no deal is a preferable course of action and would fight it hard. That's not just because it would be a breach of the Tories' own manifesto. But also because there is a hardcore of Tory Brexiteers who say they would rather quit their party and walk away than support such a plan. That's no secret. They have said it many times publicly, and they say they are willing to see a historic split in the governing party. And, more dangerously for the prime minister, even if the plan was passed by the Commons, Labour might continue to push votes of no-confidence in the government beyond that, and those furious Eurosceptics might vote with the opposition to sink their own party. That might seem outlandish, and it may well never come to pass. But this has been the most brutal reality for Theresa May all along. There are some MPs in her own party - not very many - but a group for whom getting what they see as a ""proper"" Brexit is more important than staying in power. She may tack to a closer relationship with the EU in order to get a deal through Parliament in the next few weeks. But just as it was obvious at the start of this process, so it's clear now, Brexiteers in Parliament could be Theresa May's salvation or her ultimate undoing. PS:Nerds will welcome a reminder that a paragraph of one of Mrs May's long speeches about the EU might give her some cover for a pivot of position, if it's the way she has to go. She ruled out staying in the current Customs Union, but then came something you might describe as ""nebulous""... ""I do want us to have a customs agreement with the EU,"" she said. ""Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the Customs Union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position. ""I have an open mind on how we do it. It is not the means that matter, but the ends."" Let's see if in the next few days that paragraph suddenly feels rather relevant.

Massive ice disk forms in US river,"This video can not be played The giant ice disc has been slowly spinning A rare natural phenomenon taking shape in the US state of Maine is mesmerising people around the world. A giant slow-turning ice disc, measuring approximately 91m (298ft) wide, has formed in the Presumpscot River in the city of Westbrook. The captivating natural oddity has drawn comparison to an alien spacecraft, a carousel and the Moon. Researchers believe ice discs spin because of temperature changes in the water, creating a vortex underneath. The movement chips away the edges, creating its circular shape. Allow Facebook content?

First woman climbs sacred Indian mountain,"Dhanya Sanal was the first woman to scale the peak A woman has climbed a mountain in India, where only men were allowed until now for religious reasons. Dhanya Sanal's ascent to the summit of Agasthyakoodam in southern Kerala state came after a court ruling in November. Local tribespeople oppose women climbing it because of its statue of a Hindu sage associated with celibacy. Ms Sanal, 38, told the BBC she had not been stopped by locals or protesters. Campaigners say it's a victory in the fight to end gender discrimination. Ms Sanal said she had been ""ready to turn back"" if tribespeople stopped her, but while she did encounter protesters, she said they had not prevented her from continuing her trek. Sabarimala: Indian women make history by entering temple The Indian god who bars women from his temple In November, the high court in Kerala ruled that women could trek to the 1,868m (6,128ft) peak. The court said that restrictions on trekking could not be based on gender after a women's group petitioned the court. The group welcomed Ms Sanal's climb. ""We have moved one step ahead in ending gender discrimination in Kerala,"" Divya Divakaran, one of its members, told the BBC. Agasthyakoodam is the second highest peak in Kerala Located within a biosphere reserve in India's Western Ghats, Agasthyakoodam is the second highest peak in Kerala. The high court rejected the claim made by tribespeople, who live at the foothills, that the verdict hurt their beliefs. They had said they worshipped the sage, Agastya, and did not want women in the vicinity of his idol as that amounted to disrespecting his celibacy. The terrain is steep and rocky and the trail is inside a thick forest. Trekkers often take two or three days to scale the peak. ""It isextremely tough terrain that demands extra physical fitness,external,"" Ms Sanal told the Times of India newspaper. She was the only woman in a group of 100 trekkers. The group was accompanied by two female forest officials. Officials told the BBC that more than 100 women had registered for treks in the coming weeks. Local tribespeople revere the sage whose idol is at the peak Earlier this month, two women made history in Kerala by entering a prominent Hindu shrine, following months of protests against their entry. The Sabarimala temple was historically closed to women of ""menstruating age"" - defined as between 10 and 50. Devotees believe that the deity is an avowed bachelor and the ban was in keeping with his wishes. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals. The women's entry to the shrine prompted massive protests across Kerala. One of the two women is recovering in hospitalafter her mother-in-law allegedly attacked her for entering the temple. Despite India's Supreme Court overturning the ban on women, Hindu devotees have continued to protest at the site.

Hotel attackers killed by Kenyan forces,"This video can not be played Nairobi Dusit hotel attack: explosions, gunfire and rescue operation At least 21 people were killed when Somali militants stormed a luxury hotel compound in Nairobi, Kenya's government has confirmed. Hundreds were forced to flee the bloodshed at the DusitD2 hotel and business complex on Tuesday. Some 28 injured people have been admitted to hospital, and Kenya's Red Cross said 19 are still missing. Somalia-based Islamist group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack, which triggered a 19-hour security operation. President Uhuru Kenyatta said the siege ended with five jihadist attackers ""eliminated"". Kenya has been a target for al-Shabab since October 2011, when it sent its army into Somalia to fight the jihadist group. The BBC's Andrew Harding, in Nairobi, says cowering groups of civilians were escorted to safety by security forces throughout Tuesday night, amid sporadic bursts of gunfire and the boom of explosions that continued well beyond dawn. Many had spent hours hiding in their offices, or in bathrooms. On the crowded street outside the large, upmarket complex, friends and relatives embraced those who emerged andthanked Kenyan security forces. Mourners have now begun to bury the dead. Read more from Andrew: Relief replaces fear after Kenya attack In a televised address, President Kenyatta said ""every person that was involved in the funding, planning and execution of this heinous act"" would be ""relentlessly"" pursued. People arrive at the Chiromo mortuary in Nairobi to help identify victims Two people believed to be linked to the attack were arrested after raids on Wednesday, AFP reported. How Kenya's hotel siege unfolded In pictures: Assault on hotel complex Outrage at pictures of victims According to Reuters news agency, al-Shabab issued a statement calling the attack ""a response"" to US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The move last year overturned decades of US foreign policy, and drew international criticism. Jerusalem is a sacred city in Islam, Judaism and Christianity - and while Israel regards the whole of Jerusalem as its indivisible capital, Palestinians claim the eastern part of the city as the capital of a future state. Kenyan James Oduor, commonly known as Cobra, was tweeting as the attack was unfolding. He was known for his love of football and was well-liked. Allow Twitter content?

The attackers, two of which are shown here, were caught on CCTV as they entered the complex A woman working in a neighbouring building told Reuters: ""I just started hearing gunshots, and then started seeing people running away raising their hands up and some were entering the bank to hide for their lives."" Security camera footage showed at least four heavily armed men walking in and opening fire. There are reports they had been seen visiting the compound in recent days. Allow Twitter content?

At 23:00, a government official said that all the buildings in the complex had been secured by security forces. But just an hour later, gunfire and sporadic explosions were reported in the area. There was more heavy gunfire at about 07:00 on Wednesday. Security forces then combed their way through the building where frightened workers had barricaded themselves inside. The five-star DusitD2 hotel has 101 rooms. Located in the Westlands suburb, minutes from the capital's business district, it has its own spa and several restaurants. When the gunmen first entered there was confusion, as people first tried to escape and then retreated into the building as they came under fire. One eyewitness, Faith Chepchirchir, told Reuters: ""People were trying to run towards the gate, but then I saw everyone who was running towards the gate was coming back from the gate, now heading to this opposite direction. ""So for me we just closed the doors and then gunshots were just being sprayed all over. From the top, I think [the gunmen] went to the top floor and then started spraying bullets."" Many civilians were trapped in the complex for several hours Many civilians remained holed up in the complex for several hours, as they hid from the attackers in bathrooms, and even under tables and chairs. 'How we survived Kenya hotel siege' Some were able to keep in contact with loved ones by text. They included Zinzi Khalwale, daughter of a former senator Boni Khalwale. Her father told The Daily Nation she had hidden in one of the rooms of her office until her rescue. By the evening, all but the seventh floor of the complex had been cleared, but some civilians remained there, apparently in close proximity to the surviving attackers. They oppose the Somali government, but have carried out attacks throughout East Africa. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? In September 2013,al-Shabab gunmen entered the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi and targeted shoppers. During an 80-hour siege at the upscale centre, 67 people were killed. Two years later,the group carried out its deadliest ever assault in Kenya, shooting dead almost 150 people at Garissa University.

Shoreham crash pilot 'known risk-taker',"Andy Hill is accused of killing 11 men A ""devastating"" plane crash at the Shoreham Airshow which killed 11 men was caused by the pilot's ""serious negligence"", a court has heard. Jurors were told Andy Hill's Hawker Hunter jet ""disintegrated"" upon impact, creating a ""massive fireball"" when it hit the ground in August 2015. The vintage aircraft was in ""excellent working order"", the Old Bailey heard, and ""pilot error"" was purely to blame. Mr Hill, 54, denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. Tom Kark QC, prosecuting, told jurors the defendant was an experienced pilot but had been known to take risks, and a previous air show display had been halted due to his ""dangerous"" flying. Mr Hill, a British Airways captain at the time, had been performing a manoeuvre at Shoreham known as a bent loop before his jet crashed into the A27 in West Sussex, the court heard. Holding up a scale model of the Hawker Hunter, Mr Kark told jurors it had ascended to about 2,800ft (850m) when Mr Hill attempted the stunt. The jet was ""too low, probably by as much as a 1,000ft below the height required"" at the top of the loop, the court heard. ""Mr Hill should not have started his descent"", Mr Kark said, but ""nevertheless continued the manoeuvre"". The jury was shown footage of the jet disappearing behind a row of trees, before it ""disintegrated and...caused a massive fireball"". Spectator David Miles, who was standing on the ""busy"" road, ""watched as the aircraft descended down onto the road and exploded,"" the court heard. ""He heard a bang and started running as fast as he could away from the crash, aware of course that wreckage would be coming his way,"" Mr Kark said. ""He felt an enormous heat and fell to the floor. People that he had been standing next to had simply disappeared and the motorbikes he had noticed earlier were now just burning wreckage."" Ten of the victims died instantaneously, the court heard, while the death of eleventh victim Maurice Abrahams would have been ""rapid"" once his car was engulfed in flames. Two other vehicles were ""completely destroyed"" along with their occupants, Mr Kark said. The jury was told Mr Hill ""miraculously escaped"" when the aircraft broke up and he was thrown into a ditch. At the scene, he was able to give his name as ""Andy"" but was otherwise ""incoherent"", Mr Kark said. He suffered head injuries and rib fractures and has made a full recovery, the court heard. Mr Hill has been repeatedly interviewed by police since the crash, making no comment each time, Mr Kark said. On 1 June 2017, he provided officers with a 10-page statement which said he had no recollection of the crash and believed G-Force pressures may have contributed, Mr Kark said. However, the prosecution said Mr Hill would have experienced ""nothing unusual"" for an experienced pilot, and witness testimony would discount the possibility of G-Force being a factor in the crash. ""In other words he did not lose consciousness in that aircraft"", Mr Kark said. Pilot Andy Hill survived the Hawker Hunter jet crash Mr Hill, from Sandon, Hertfordshire, had served in the RAF between 1985 and 1994 before becoming a commercial pilot, the court heard. The trial would hear from witnesses likely to describe him as ""highly competent and experienced,"" Mr Kark said. However, ""there have also been times when he has taken risks or flown in a way one would not expect a careful and competent fast jet display pilot to do"", he told the court. During a practice display at Duxford in Cambridgeshire in 2014 Mr Hill had flown over the M11 at about 200ft, well below the 500ft minimum, Mr Kark said. ""Mr Hill, in short, was playing fast and loose with the rules which are designed to keep people safe from aircraft performing aerobatic manoeuvres."" Mr Kark said such incidents had demonstrated a ""more cavalier attitude to safety than was appropriate"". The prosecutor said a display by Mr Hill at the 2014 Southport Air Show was halted when he ""performed a dangerous manoeuvre"" which ""took him far too close to the crowd"". Mr Kark said the event's flight director took the ""rare"" step after a ""stop, stop, stop"" call was issued. ""It ought to have been a red light warning to him to plan his displays with great care."" ""Unfortunately, on this occasion in 2015 at Shoreham, no-one had time to call out a 'stop' and his display ended in tragedy. ""The prosecution case is that it was Mr Hill's serious negligence that led directly to the loss of those eleven lives,"" he added. Of the 11 men who died, five were in vehicles and six were spectators. The trial is expected to last up to seven weeks.

We leave you with this photo of a street vendor in the South African city of Durban. It's one ofour favourite photos taken this week: Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg Hundreds of people have been assaulted and tortured Human rights groups in Zimbabwe say at least 12 people have
been killed during several days of violent protests sparked by a sharp rise in the price of fuel. Hospitals and clinics have reportedly treated a further 78 gunshot victims, and more than a hundred cases involving assault, torture, and dog bites - all blamed on Zimbabweâs security forces. The opposition says hundreds of
people have been arrested and many more beaten and tortured by security forces. A coalition of local human rights groups acknowledged there
had been some looting and violence by protesters. But said it condemned, with
great disdain, the random and indiscriminate response of the police and army. Zimbabweâs opposition has accused the government of behaving
like a rogue state â and of cutting off the internet in the hope of
hiding its crimes against humanity beneath a blanket of darkness. While some access appears to have been restored, many people say that social media platforms remain blocked. This has added to a sense of deepening
crisis for a country which had hoped its worst years were over. Public anger erupted after the government, desperately short of cash, raised the price of petrol. Many Zimbabweans, worn down by years of economic hardship, suddenly found they couldnât even afford the bus fare to work. President Emmerson Mnangagwa is currently abroad, trying to
woo foreign investors. But news of his brutal security crackdown at home is leaking
out â despite the lack of internet. Repression was a hallmark of the governing Zanu-PF under
Robert Mugabe. It doesnât seem like much has changed since he was pushed out.

Africarail says construction of the Niger section of a railway that will link Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Niger, Benin and Togo has been awarded to BollorÃ©, which is owned by the French billionaire Vincent BollorÃ© who iscurrently being investigated in an Africa corruption probe. The Nigerien government has not responded to the BBC's requests for an interview. La lettre du Continent reports that Africarail is seeking compensation. BBC World Service Thousands of people in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, have turned out for the funeral of a man shot late on Thursday during clashes with the security forces. One witness said police opened fire as the mourners threw rocks, calling for President Omar al-Bashir to step down -  a constant chant at country-wide demonstrations now in their fifth week. A doctor and a boy were also shot dead on Thursday. A group of anti-government doctors called the killings cold-blooded and announced a strike at a large private hospital. The rights group Amnesty International has urged Sudan to end what what it called a ""continued onslaught"" against medical facilities and injured protesters. It said security forces were killing people in an unbridled spree that was even affecting children. BBC World Service Ethiopia has received warm praise from the UN and other aid agencies for granting 900,000 refugees the right to leave their camps and seek work, schooling and access to bank accounts. The UN said giving displaced people dignity was the smart thing to do, and an example to other countries where refugee rights are instead being eroded. Ethiopian officials said it was a win-win policy because a large untapped number of previously economically inactive people would help boost economic growth. Many of Ethiopia's refugees, from conflicts in neighbouring countries, have spent decades in one of 20 camps, largely dependent on foreign aid. The law, approved on Thursday, is Ethiopia's commitment to a recent UN compact to improve the lives of the world's 25 million refugees and to ease the burden on host nations. Thomas NaadiBBC Africa, Accra This video can not be played Ahmed Hussein-Suale investigated corruption in Ghanaian football Ghanaian undercover journalist Ahmed Hussein-Suale, who was shot dead while driving home, is being buried today. An MP, Kennedy Agyapong, who had threatened him has left the
country denying he knew of the murder. The journalist was a key member of the team which exposed corruption within the Ghanaian Football Association. After the BBC broadcast the documentary several months ago, Mr Agyapong circulated photos of Mr Hussein-Suale and called for retribution against him. Many in Ghana have condemned
his actions, accusing him of exposing the undercover journalist to harm. Mr Agyepong
told local media he did not regret his comments and denied any involvement in the murder. He said he would submit to any form of investigation. Meanwhile, President Nana Akufo-Addo has
condemned the killing of the journalist and urged the police to increase its efforts to find those responsible. The President of the Ghana Journalist
Association, Affail Monney, has urged journalists to remain calm and
not be intimidated by the incident. Mr Husein-Suale, was shot three times in
his car by an identified gunmen on a motorbike. Ibrahim AydidBBC Monitoring Al-Shabab
militants have abducted at least 60 schoolchildren from a village in
south-western Somalia, according to local media reports. The children
were kidnapped mostly from Koranic schools in El Garas village, in Bakool
Region. The Islamist militant
group is believed to have kidnapped the children to recruit and train them as
child soldiers. South-west
State deputy minister of security, Abdirizak Aden, told local media
that the abducted children are aged between 14 and 20 years. There are reports that al-Shabab has been demanding residents of areas under its
control to hand over their children as recruits. This has led to the emergence
of self-organised groups of Somali villagers who are resisting al-Shabab's move to recruit child soldiers. Reports from Zimbabwe indicate that access to the internet appears to have been restored, but that access to social media platforms and messaging apps such as WhatsApp remains blocked. Many Zimbabweans rely on platforms like WhatsApp as a key source of information. Soaking in clean water encourages the worm out of the body, when it can then be gently extracted One of the health bodies spearheading the drive to eradicate Guinea worm says the disease is close to being wiped out. The US-based Carter Centre says that only 28 cases of Guinea worm were reported in 2018, compared to the 3.5 million infections recorded in 1986. If it succeeds, it means Guinea worm would be the third disease to be eradicated, after smallpox and rinderpest. Guinea worm is a tissue parasite that is rarely fatal, but causes severe pain. When the worm emerges, usually from the feet, it causes an intensely painful build-up of fluids, a blister and an ulcer accompanied by fever, nausea and vomiting. The World Health Organization, which works alongside the Carter Centre and Unicef against the disease, explains thatGuinea worm is eradicable for these reasons,external: Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service The government of the Democratic Republic
of Congo has rejected a call from the African Union (AU) for the announcement of the
presidential election results to be suspended. The AU has said it has
serious doubts about the integrity of the provisional result which gave victory
to Felix Tshisekedi. Another opposition candidate Martin Fayulu has asked
the constitutional court to nullify the result saying he won. It is clear the AU's call for
the election result to be postponed has angered the Congolese
government. A spokesman Lambert Mende said the
Constitutional Courtwas independent and no-one had the right to tell it what todo. The AU says its chair, the Rwandan president Paul Kagame, and other
heads of state will soon head to Kinshasa to help find a way out of the
crisis. Mr Mende said the delegation was welcome but insisted the post
election process would remain unchanged. That suggests the swearing in of
FÃ©lix Tshisekedi could happen within days if the Constitutional Court upholds
his victory. Anne SoyBBC Africa, Nairobi A Canadian citizen is among the five suspects detained for 30 days in connection with Tuesday's attack on a hotel complex in Kenya's capital, Nairobi. Four men and a woman stood in
the dock at the High Court in Nairobi with their heads bowed. They are the
first suspects to appear in connection with the 19-hour siege at the DusitD2 complex in which 21 people died. But no charges were read out to them. The director of public prosecution asked for more time to carry out investigations he described as ""complex and transnational"". Four of the suspects are Kenyan citizens. The fifth
is a Canadian-Somali. Earlier, police told the BBC
they had arrested seven people. A man who was seen in the company of the
militants before the attack is understood to be among those detained, but he
was not presented in court on Friday. Somalia-based Islamist group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack.

He was speaking afterhis colleague Ahmed Hussein-Suale was shot dead while driving home, after a politician called for retribution against him. Mr Hussein-Suale was a member of Tiger Eye Private Investigations, run by Anas, and had investigated corruption in Ghana's football leagues. Five suspects have appeared in court in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, in connection with Tuesday's deadly attack on a hotel complex in the city. The Director of
Public Prosecution says they are still under investigation, calling the larger context of the attack ""complex and transnational"". The suspects were
not charged, and they will be held in remand for 30 days. Twenty-one people died in the 19-hour siege at the luxury compound. Somalia-based Islamist group al-Shabab says it was behind the attack. Former militia leader Charles BlÃ© GoudÃ© (L) has been tried alongside Laurent Gbagbo on the same charges Former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo and youth leader Charles BlÃ© GoudÃ© will remain in jail until 1 February, according to the International Criminal Court (ICC). That's the date the court has set for the prosecution's appeal againstTuesday's ruling that Mr Gbagbo and Mr BlÃ© GoudÃ© should be acquitted. Both men had been charged with crimes against humanity in connection with violence following a disputed 2010 election that left 3,000 dead and 500,000 displaced. During the political stand-off there were bloody clashes and targeted killings in the main city of Abidjan in the south, and several hundred were massacred in the western town of Duekoue.

Sally NabilBBC News, Cairo Flibanserin is produced in Egypt by a local pharmaceutical company As Egypt becomes the first Arab country to authorise the production and sale of a drug meant to boost the female libido, I've been exploring whether there's a market for it in such a socially conservative country. ""I felt drowsy and dizzy, and my heart was racing."" This is how Leila felt after taking her first pill of the so-called ""female Viagra"" - chemically known as flibanserin. The drug was first authorised for use in the US almost three years ago, and is now being produced in Egypt by a local pharmaceutical company. Leila - not her real name - is a conservative housewife in her mid-30s. She prefers to conceal her identity as, like many women in Egypt, talking about sexual problems and sexual needs is still very much a taboo. After almost 10 years of marriage, she says she decided to get the drug ""out of mere curiosity"".

British man killed,"Luke Potter was involved in development projects across East Africa A British man killed in an attack on a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya, has been named as Luke Potter by the international development charity he worked for. In a statement,external, Gatsby said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by the death of its Africa programmes director. Mr Potter was among at least 21 people killed. It is understood a member of the UK Special Forces was involved in a rescue operation at the complex. The Somalia-based militant group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack. Gunmen stormed the complex in the capital on Tuesday. Gunfire and explosions continued into Wednesday beforePresident Uhuru Kenyatta announced the siege had ended. The Foreign Office said another Briton was also wounded in the attack. Latest updates on the siege aftermath In pictures: Attack in Kenya's capital In a statement, Gatsby Africa said Mr Potter had ""devoted the past 10 years of his career to helping some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world"" and had worked with the charity for more than three years, carrying out assignments across East Africa. ""Luke was respected by all he worked with, bringing huge drive, determination, a relentless work ethic, and a thirst for new ideas to every project,"" the statement said. ""He brought a calm head and his unique sense of humour to every situation."" It said Mr Potter was ""instrumental"" in establishing the organisation's forestry programme in Kenya and provided ""crucial leadership, guidance and support"" to other programmes in Tanzania and Rwanda. The charity said its ""thoughts and deepest condolences"" were with Mr Potter's family, partner, daughter and friends and they were offering support to them and their own staff. This video can not be played The scene at the Nairobi Dusit hotel as the rescue operation took place The UK High Commissioner to Kenya, Nic Hailey, confirmed the death of a British man on Twitter. ""I'm very sad to confirm that we believe at least one British national has been killed in the attack,"" he said. ""We are providing our support to his family and friends at this very difficult time."" The Foreign Office added it was ""in contact with the Kenyan authorities"" and was ""ready to help any other British people affected"". It is understood a member of the British SAS - who was in Kenya as part of a training team - was involved in rescuing hostages. The armed special forces soldier entered the hotel complex to help rescue the trapped civilians and, according to a source, fired his weapon. He is believed to have been working alongside members of the US Special Forces, who were already in Nairobi when the attack took place. A man believed to be a member of the British SAS helps people caught up in the attack to safety Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Twitter: ""Really tragic news from Kenya - my thoughts are with the families and friends who have lost loved ones in this attack including one British citizen. ""UK stands with Kenya at this difficult time. Our team in Nairobi are supporting all Brits affected."" On Wednesday morning, President Kenyatta announced the assault was over, adding that the ""terrorists"" had been ""eliminated"" and more than 700 civilians had been evacuated to safety. He said: ""We will seek out every person that was involved in the funding, planning and execution of this heinous act. ""We are a country governed by laws, rules and regulations - a country that embraces peaceful coexistence... I must also state that we are also a nation that never forgets those who hurt our children."" The president said 14 ""innocent"" people had been killed in the attack. Kenya's police chief later said the death toll had risen to 21. The Kenya Red Cross said about 45 people were still unaccounted for. The US State Department said an American man was among those killed. The luxury complex, which houses the DusitD2 hotel as well as offices, is in the Westlands district of the city. The attack began at about 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Tuesday, when four gunmen threw bombs at vehicles in the car park, before entering the lobby, where one blew himself up, police say. Security camera footage showed at least four heavily armed men walking in and opening fire. There are reports they had been seen visiting the compound in recent days. When the gunmen first entered the complex there was confusion, as people first tried to escape to freedom and then retreated into the building as they came under fire. Many civilians remained holed up in the complex for several hours, as they hid from the attackers in bathrooms, and even under tables and chairs. Groups of civilians were escorted to safety by security forces throughout the night. In the early hours of Wednesday, more than 100 people were rescued.

'How we survived the siege',"About 700 people survived an attack by gunmen on a compound of offices and a hotel in Kenya's capital. The siege, which began at 15:00 local time on Tuesday, lasted 19 hours. Here's how some of them escaped from the al-Shabab attackers: Two journalists working for national broadcaster NTV found themselves caught in the siege for more than 12 hours. ""We are crammed inside the toilet with a number of guys,"" messaged reporter Silas Apollo to a WhatsApp group with other journalists while hiding. ""I'm very scared."" It took 19 hours to secure the complex ""They have been combing the building and shooting aimlessly. It's too scary to imagine,"" he posted on WhatsApp. They told Kenya's private Daily Nation newspaper thatthey, and at least 14 others trapped with them, had to change positions moving from the toilets,external- sometimes crawling, lying on the floor or standing - to the main hall. They were eventually rescued from their office block at 03:15 local time on Wednesday. Ronald Ng'eno was in his office where he worked as a communications officer for the Commission on Revenue Allocation when he heard ""a massive blast followed by unending gunshots"", he told AFP news agency. This video can not be played Ronald Ng'eno had tweeted goodbye to his family He and his colleagues tried to escape but realised the gunmen were already inside. ""They started firing directly towards us and that was when we changed course and ran into the bathrooms located on first floor. Upon entering the bathroom I saw a small opening on the ceiling and that's where I hid momentarily,"" he told AFP. We were crammed in the bathroom and we had to be very quiet, he told the BBC. At around 19:00 local time, as gunfire was heard in the vicinity, Mr Ng'eno tweeted that he was still stuck in a bathroom: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He had been communicating with the police and, even though his phone had stopped working officers had arranged to use a special knock on the door to identify themselves. ""At 2.30 am on Wednesday we heard the knock and we knew help had finally come,"" he told AFP. He walked out of the complex early on Wednesday morning after being trapped for more than 11 hours, he told the BBC. ""It was just after serving food to the customers, then all of a sudden a bang outside the hotel,"" a waiter at the DusitD2 hotel, who asked to be called Charles, told the BBC OS radio programme on the World Service The security services helped evacuate all the buildings He, another colleague and a customer from the hotel escaped together. ""The terrorists started shooting at the people. After that we started running. Everyone started running. ""Some were running outside, some were hiding in the toilets. I managed to escape through the back door."" He added that Kenyan security services were already at the scene when he escaped ""and they helped us to manage to walk out"". Tracy Wanjiru, who was caught up in the DusitD2 siege, also survived the attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall six years ago,reports Nairobi News site,external. In September 2013, al-Shabab gunmen entered the Nairobi mall and fired on shoppers, leading to a siege over four days in which 67 people were killed. ""I was working there when the attackers stormed in, it was not easy just like today. All I can say is that I thank God,"" she told Nairobi News. She heard gunshots near where she worked as a manager of a hair salon within the DusitD2 hotel complex. She tried to look outside and then heard a loud explosion. ""I jumped back to the salon, told my colleagues to be keen because we were under attack. They dismissed me at first but when they heard wails and screams, everyone went into hiding.""

Hiram Macharia, a marketing executive at LG Electronics, told the Reuters news agency that after he heard the first explosion he tried to escape. There were emotional scenes as people were rescued ""I grabbed a fire extinguisher and we started going downstairs. Then we saw two of the attackers firing at the elevators and we turned back. We hid under desks in our office,"" he told Reuters. ""They were firing twice at each of the elevator doors and the two staircase doors on each floor as they walked up the building. One of them fired at our office doors, entered slightly and then moved on."" Mr Macharia hid in his office, but one colleague ran to the roof and was shot dead there, he added. Bryson Mwamburi, a university student who was working at the Dusit complex, had just dodged a shooter's bullet and was scaling down an electric fence when he was arrested by police. This video can not be played Bryson Mwamburi: I was wrongly arrested after surviving Nairobi attack A few hours earlier he had been in an office at the Grosvenor building when he heard a loud bang and what sounded like gunshots. He ran to the seventh floor, climbed out of a window and hid in a balcony. But a man on the ground spotted him and fired at him, so he ran to the fifth floor and then to the ground floor and used his shirt to scale an electric fence. He was then arrested by police positioned outside the complex. ""I cried and told the police officers that I had been inside one of the buildings at the Dusit complex and there was a gunman who tried to kill me, but they still arrested me,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bryson said he was locked in a police cell and kept overnight, but he was eventually freed without charge on Wednesday morning. ""A tweet I had sent before leaving the building saved my life and I was freed,"" he said. ""Family and friends launched a campaign on social media after they discovered I was being unofficially held as a suspect."" The entire ordeal was humbling, he said. Mamadou Dia was on a business trip from Paris for STP Consultants when he was caught up in the siege. He told the Reuters agency that he was huddled in a room with Chinese and Canadian residents of the hotel and a waiter when he was texted to say that police knew where he was hiding. ""They told us by text that the police knew we were in that room and that they would come, and one-and-a-half hours later, the police came to evacuate us,"" he said. He added that the attackers started shooting at them ""like snipers,"" as armed officers escorted them out. The police fired back, he said. Brian Gatimu, a tour operator based inside the office complex, was on the rooftop car park when he heard a huge bang. After shooting the guards, the gunmen attacked some cars before heading to the hotel ""I saw huge smoke billowing from the entrance,"" AFP reports Mr Gatimu as saying on Capital FM News. He said wasn't meant to be in the car park but he had left his lights one so his battery had run flat - and he was waiting for someone to come and jumpstart his car. He hid in his car for two hours, calling for help on Twitter, before police officers came to rescue him, he said. ""My car is tinted. I stayed inside hoping all is well. I was shaken,"" he said. Reuben Kimani, a barista working at the hotel, told AFP that he recognised an attacker because he had served him coffee in the run-up to the assault. ""I knew one of them because he had a big scar on one of his hands,"" he told AFP. ""They shot six of my friends, four didn't die but two succumbed."" He said the attackers yelled out, ""Why are you killing our brothers and sisters in Somalia?"" before opening fire. He was rescued after several hours trapped inside the hotel. Cyprian Otieno, a 23-year-old student, told AFP that he went to the Dusit complex because his friend wanted to get a cocktail. Several buildings had to be evacuated ""All of a sudden we heard a weird boom followed by gunfire,"" he said, adding that security guards ordered everyone to get back He heard a voice shouting: ""Kill them, kill them"" in Swahili and more gunfire. A group of about 20 people then fled towards the back of the hotel, he said. ""Sorry to say at that point it was every man for himself.  We were all together in the beginning but after a few minutes the attackers began shooting... I can't even really remember what happened afterwards."" John Maingi said there had been ""a flash of lights and a loud bang"" at the Secret Garden restaurant where he worked. ""When I peeped outside I saw a human leg, which has been cut off,"" he told AFP news agency. ""We hid in the room and then some police officers rescued us.""

British man killed in Kenyan hotel attack,"Luke Potter was involved in development projects across East Africa A British man killed in an attack on a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya, has been named as Luke Potter by the international development charity he worked for. In a statement,external, Gatsby said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by the death of its Africa programmes director. Mr Potter was among at least 21 people killed. It is understood a member of the UK Special Forces was involved in a rescue operation at the complex. The Somalia-based militant group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack. Gunmen stormed the complex in the capital on Tuesday. Gunfire and explosions continued into Wednesday beforePresident Uhuru Kenyatta announced the siege had ended. The Foreign Office said another Briton was also wounded in the attack. Latest updates on the siege aftermath In pictures: Attack in Kenya's capital In a statement, Gatsby Africa said Mr Potter had ""devoted the past 10 years of his career to helping some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world"" and had worked with the charity for more than three years, carrying out assignments across East Africa. ""Luke was respected by all he worked with, bringing huge drive, determination, a relentless work ethic, and a thirst for new ideas to every project,"" the statement said. ""He brought a calm head and his unique sense of humour to every situation."" It said Mr Potter was ""instrumental"" in establishing the organisation's forestry programme in Kenya and provided ""crucial leadership, guidance and support"" to other programmes in Tanzania and Rwanda. The charity said its ""thoughts and deepest condolences"" were with Mr Potter's family, partner, daughter and friends and they were offering support to them and their own staff. This video can not be played The scene at the Nairobi Dusit hotel as the rescue operation took place The UK High Commissioner to Kenya, Nic Hailey, confirmed the death of a British man on Twitter. ""I'm very sad to confirm that we believe at least one British national has been killed in the attack,"" he said. ""We are providing our support to his family and friends at this very difficult time."" The Foreign Office added it was ""in contact with the Kenyan authorities"" and was ""ready to help any other British people affected"". It is understood a member of the British SAS - who was in Kenya as part of a training team - was involved in rescuing hostages. The armed special forces soldier entered the hotel complex to help rescue the trapped civilians and, according to a source, fired his weapon. He is believed to have been working alongside members of the US Special Forces, who were already in Nairobi when the attack took place. A man believed to be a member of the British SAS helps people caught up in the attack to safety Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Twitter: ""Really tragic news from Kenya - my thoughts are with the families and friends who have lost loved ones in this attack including one British citizen. ""UK stands with Kenya at this difficult time. Our team in Nairobi are supporting all Brits affected."" On Wednesday morning, President Kenyatta announced the assault was over, adding that the ""terrorists"" had been ""eliminated"" and more than 700 civilians had been evacuated to safety. He said: ""We will seek out every person that was involved in the funding, planning and execution of this heinous act. ""We are a country governed by laws, rules and regulations - a country that embraces peaceful coexistence... I must also state that we are also a nation that never forgets those who hurt our children."" The president said 14 ""innocent"" people had been killed in the attack. Kenya's police chief later said the death toll had risen to 21. The Kenya Red Cross said about 45 people were still unaccounted for. The US State Department said an American man was among those killed. The luxury complex, which houses the DusitD2 hotel as well as offices, is in the Westlands district of the city. The attack began at about 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Tuesday, when four gunmen threw bombs at vehicles in the car park, before entering the lobby, where one blew himself up, police say. Security camera footage showed at least four heavily armed men walking in and opening fire. There are reports they had been seen visiting the compound in recent days. When the gunmen first entered the complex there was confusion, as people first tried to escape to freedom and then retreated into the building as they came under fire. Many civilians remained holed up in the complex for several hours, as they hid from the attackers in bathrooms, and even under tables and chairs. Groups of civilians were escorted to safety by security forces throughout the night. In the early hours of Wednesday, more than 100 people were rescued. About 30 people are being treated at Nairobi hospitals, media reports say.

Arrest in sex worker murder inquiry,"Rebecca Hall went missing from her Bradford home on 13 April 2001 A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a sex worker who was killed in a ""vicious attack"" nearly two decades ago. Rebecca Hall went missing from her home in the Little Horton area of Bradford on 13 April 2001. She suffered severe head injuries and her body was found two weeks later in an alleyway in Thornton Street. A 37-year-old woman was detained on Friday and has since been released under investigation, police said.

Calls to ban low-level letterboxes,"Low-level letterboxes should be banned to prevent postal workers straining their backs or being bitten by dogs, a Conservative MP has said. Proposing new legislation, just before MPs began debating a no-confidence motion in the government over Brexit, Vicky Ford said it was a ""key issue"". She called for all new letterboxes to be installed between 70cm (2ft 3.5ins) and 170cm (5ft 7ins). The Communication Workers Union is campaigning for new buildings to meet EU letter box height standards. The CWU, which represents postmen and women, said it did not expect private households or businesses to change their doors immediately, but for the measurements to become a new building regulation in the UK, and to cover replacement doors as well. The red heart of the British streetscape Man's arm trapped in letterbox Mystery river postbox to be removed The union first started its campaign to raise the level of letterboxes in 1958 and, while it was agreed by the British Standards Agency, it was never enshrined into building standards law. A similar campaign by its sister union in Ireland saw low-level letterboxes banned in 2001 and the CWU believes ""the time has come"" to replicate this in the UK. Moving the bill in the House of Commons, Ms Ford revealed there were 16,800 back-related spells of absence in the Royal Mail last year. ""There are over 95,000 postmen and women working for Royal Mail,"" she said. ""They deliver to 30 million address, they serve each of our communities six days a week, every week of the year, and when I asked postal workers what I could do for them, they asked me to look at low-level letterboxes. ""This bill simply wants to stop developers from building swathes of homes each with a letterbox placed near to the ground and I hope that this will be a moment of unity in British politics."" The bill will come back to the House of Commons for a second reading in March, although it has little chance of becoming law.

YouTube bans dangerous or harmful pranks,"The film Birdbox led to a craze in which people attempt everyday tasks while blindfolded YouTube clips that depict dangerous or emotionally distressing âpranksâ have been banned from the platform. The move comes in response to so-called ""challenges"" that have sometimes resulted in death or injury. The Google-owned video sharing site said such material had âno place on YouTubeâ. However, the firm appears to be failing to enforce its existing rules on harmful content. A Buzzfeed report detailed,externalhow images depicting, or alluding to, bestiality were still appearing on the site - despite a pledge last April to remove the material. Some of the videos had attracted many millions of views. YouTube said it âworked to aggressively enforce our monetisation policies to eliminate the incentive for this abuseâ. But enforcing its new rules on pranks may prove even more difficult, given ambiguity over what may or may not be considered harmful. âYouTube is home to many beloved viral challenges and pranks,â a messageadded to the siteâs FAQ section read,external. âThat said, weâve always had policies to make sure whatâs funny doesnât cross the line into also being harmful or dangerous. âOur Community Guidelines prohibit content that encourages dangerous activities that are likely to result in serious harm, and today clarifying what this means for dangerous challenges and pranks.â From now on, the site said it would not allow videos that featured âpranks with a perceived danger of serious physical injury"". This includes pranks where someone is tricked into thinking they are in severe danger, even if no real threat existed. The site added: âWe also donât allow pranks that cause children to experience severe emotional distress, meaning something so bad that it could leave the child traumatized for life.â YouTube said it had worked closely with child psychologists on what might constitute a traumatic experience. It did not post a full list, but said it included scenarios where a child is tricked into believing their parents had died. The new rules come in response to several instances of pranks and stunts that are seriously ill-advised at best, and deadly at worst. In May, Minnesota woman Monalisa Perez, 20, was sentenced to six months in prison after shooting dead her boyfriend, Pedro Ruiz. The couple had hoped video of their stunt, in which an encyclopaedia was meant to protect Mr Ruiz, would go viral on YouTube. Also last year, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported a spike in reported cases of illness from detergent ingestion following a craze that had people eating pods containing laundry detergent. It prompted the productâs maker, Procter and Gamble, to enlist the help of American Football star Rob Gronkowski to front apublic awareness campaign on social media,external. More recently, a challenge inspired by a scene in Netflix show Birdbox involved carrying out activities - such as driving - while blindfolded.At least one person is known to have crashed as a result. ________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Brexit uncertainty hits house purchases,"The West Midlands had the strongest annual house price growth across the UK in the 12 months to November 2018. But housing activity in southern England was muted because of Brexit uncertainty. Average house prices across the UK climbed by 2.8%, rising from 2.7% annual growth in October 2018. In the West Midlands, prices rose by 4.6%, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry. It said the average UK house price was Â£230,630 in October, falling by 0.1% month-on-month. Over the past two years, there has been a slowdown in UK house price growth, driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England, the report said. The lowest annual growth was in London, where prices actually fell by 0.7% over the year to November, unchanged from the previous month. Where can I afford to live? How I bought a house without mum and dad Where does rent hit young people the hardest? London house prices have been falling over the year each month since July 2018, while potential buyers and sellers have been postponing transactions in the south of England until after the EU withdrawal. Other regions showing the strongest price growth after the West Midlands included the East Midlands, up 4.4%, the South West, up 4.3%, and the North East, up 4%. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' UK Residential Market Survey for November 2018 reported subdued activity in almost all areas of the UK, mainly driven by Brexit uncertainty and a lack of fresh stock. The UK Property Transactions Statistics for November 2018 showed that on a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of transactions on residential properties with a value of Â£40,000 or greater was 100,930, 0.5% lower compared with the same period a year ago. Kevin Roberts, director of the Legal & General Mortgage Club, said: ""The ongoing political uncertainty is clearly causing some buyers and sellers to take a wait-and-see approach when it comes to the property market."" North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said: ""On the one hand, the risk of uncertainty for the property market increases after yesterday's Brexit deal vote, but on the other, it helps to concentrate minds on all sides as the threat of a 'no deal' rises, which was reflected in sterling's strengthening immediately after the result was announced."" At the country level, the largest annual price growth was recorded in Wales, where prices climbed by 5.5% over the year. Scotland saw house prices increase by 2.9% over the last 12 months. In England, the average price increased by just 2.6% over the year. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

Hillsborough jury shown police box view,"Graham Mackrell (left) and David Duckenfield deny the charges against them Jurors at the trial of Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield have heard how ""the scene was almost literally set"" for failure. Prosecutors said the ground's safety certificate had not been updated or amended since it was granted in 1979 - a decade before the disaster.

Richard Matthews QC told Preston Crown Court: ""Few of those involved with the safety certificate appear to have performed their function diligently."" The stadium safety certificate was ""very out of date"" by 1989, the jury was told. The arrangements at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989 meant 10,100 Liverpool fans had to get through seven turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, the court heard. The jury was shown images of the police control box overlooking the terraces Mr Matthews told the jury the Crown's case was that ""the risk of death was obvious, serious and present throughout the failings of David Duckenfield to show reasonable care"". He said it was an ""extraordinary failure"" for Mr Duckenfield not to have personal knowledge of the potential confining points and hazards to safe entry at the stadium. Earlier, the jury was given a virtual tour of the stadium and shown the view from inside the police control box. Prosecutors showed what would have been on each of the television screens in front of Mr Duckenfield and his team on 15 April 1989. Mr Matthews said the jury would hear from expert John Cutlack who estimated the capacity figure for the Leppings Lane terrace, where the fatal crush happened, should have been 5,426, rather than 7,200. The jury was shown a video of an FA Cup semi final at Hillsborough in 1981 between Spurs and Wolves where the terraces became too full and the crowd was allowed to sit on the edge of the pitch.

"Red Bull '4pm Finish Day' advert bannedIt was wrong to imply the energy drink can boost focus and help workers finish by 4pm, a ruling says.UK","Red Bull should not suggest its drink improves concentration, the watchdog ruled A poster advert campaign by Red Bull has been banned for wrongly implying the energy drink could increase focus and concentration. Posters shown on the London Underground suggested Red Bull could help workers finish their work and go home by 4pm. The Advertising Standards Authority said the advert was light-hearted but implied unauthorised health claims. Red Bull had said the poster merely promoted a ""consumer initiative"", encouraging workers to leave early. The poster offered ""the secret to finishing early"" and featured a poem with the concluding rhyme: ""Because to leap every hurdle a hectic day brings, you just need to know: Red Bull gives you wiiings."" One person who saw the poster complained to the ASA that the advert implied the caffeinated energy drink had a positive effect on health, improving focus and concentration. Supermarkets ban energy drinks for under-16s Red Bull doesn't 'give you wings' But Red Bull argued to the ASA that it was just promoting its own ""National 4pm Finish Day"" - a stunt which it invented specifically to be marked on 14 September 2018. It denied that the advert suggested any health benefit or that the drink made people better at doing their jobs through increased concentration or focus. But the ASA ruled against Red Bull, saying that consumers would understand that the poster did imply those health claims, which were not authorised on the EU Register. The EU Register of Nutrition and Health Claims is an official list of scientifically proven claims about foods and their benefits to health. ""We considered that the penultimate line of the poem, 'to leap every hurdle a hectic day brings', implied that Red Bull could help improve consumers' mental focus, concentration and energy levels, and therefore increase productivity,"" the ASA said. The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again and the company has been told not to imply that its product can boost health and concentration when those claims are not on the register.

EU's Tusk hints UK should cancel Brexit,"Donald Tusk hinted that cancelling Brexit is ""the only positive solution"" European Council President Donald Tusk has hinted that the UK should stay in the EU, after the prime minister's Brexit deal was rejected in parliament. ""If a deal is impossible, and no-one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?"" he tweeted. MPs voted by 432 votes to 202 to reject the deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU on 29 March. Other EU officials and politicians reacted with dismay to the result.

A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU LIVE: Reaction to Brexit vote It was the largest defeat for a sitting government in history, with 118 of the votes against coming from Prime Minister Theresa May's own Conservative Party. It has cast more doubt on the Brexit process, and the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has tabled a vote of no confidence in the government. This video can not be played Senior EU figures give their reaction to events in Westminster As well as Mr Tusk's tweet, there has been plenty of comment on Tuesday's vote from across Europe. Here are the key quotes: European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned that time was running out for the UK to strike a deal. ""I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up,"" he said shortly after the result was announced. Jean-Claude Juncker said the chance of a ""disorderly Brexit"" had increased ""The risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening's vote,"" he added. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he ""profoundly"" regretted the vote. ""An orderly withdrawal will remain our absolute priority in the coming weeks,"" he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg. He added that there would be a favourable response if Mrs May were prepared to rethink her position on issues like the single market and customs union. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was still time to negotiate but ""we're now waiting on what the prime minister proposes"". Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Tuesday was a ""bitter day for Europe"". ""We are well prepared, but a hard Brexit would be the least attractive choice, for the EU and [UK],"" he said. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of the ruling Christian Democrat Union party, echoed this view. ""A hard Brexit will be the worst of all options,"" she said. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. ""The pressure is mainly on them,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said of the UK. He said a transition period was essential because a no-deal Brexit would be damaging. ""We will have to negotiate a transition period with them because the British cannot afford to no longer have planes taking off or landing at home,"" he said. Later a presidential source said France was stepping up preparations for a ""no-deal"" Brexit. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that the Republic was also now preparing for a no-deal Brexit but would work hard to avoid it because it ""would not protect the peace in Northern Ireland"". But he said the ball was now in the UK government's court to find a solution. ""We understand the PM will now consult with other parties and other political leaders on an agreed way forward we welcome that,"" he said. ""The onus is on Westminster to come up with solutions that they can support but they must be solutions that the European Union and Ireland can accept."" Meanwhile Foreign Minister Simon Coveney ruled out any alternative to the agreement reached with the UK over the Irish border. ""We're not going to allow physical border infrastructure to reappear,"" he told national broadcaster RTE.

Kuenssberg: Theresa May's nightmare,"This video can not be played Theresa May's withdrawal deal was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs Theresa May's deal has not just been defeated - her plan for her main mission as leader of the country has been crushed by an alliance of her critics who don't even agree amongst themselves. Now she has another ordeal - an official vote of no confidence in her government being mounted by the opposition party. That is a legal attempt to push the government to collapse into a general election. On the runes tonight, it seems unlikely that it will force her into that, but she can't be absolutely sure. PMâs Brexit deal rejected by huge margin LIVE: Updates as MPs reject May's deal Brexitcast: Laura, Katya and the gang on the next steps One of the reasons No 10 has found themselves in this desperate position is because their judgements have been the wrong ones on so many occasions so far. She promised MPs tonight that if she survives the confidence vote, then there will be an attempt to listen to what MPs really want - an effort, at this very late stage, to find common cause in Parliament. But her team has been quick tonight to suggest that, while she is promising to listen, she has no inkling at this stage of dropping her own firm commitments - making it clear that she wants to stick to setting an independent trade policy, which so far shuts down a chance of moving to a Labour-friendly customs union. It doesn't sound tonight like she has any enthusiasm for junking her deal. Indeed, a source that was on a conference call with business leaders - hosted by the chancellor and other cabinet ministers - was told they could not renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement. The plan instead was for a ""shake down"" of MPs in the next few days to find out what they would tolerate in terms of promises for the longer term future relationship. As we've discussed here before, the Cabinet doesn't even have a clear view itself on how she should proceed. Today, the leader of the House of Commons told me it would be Brussels that has to move. But some others are crystal clear that the PM will have to soften her offer, because that's what Parliament will tolerate. Pound rises after Brexit vote Reality Check: What are the biggest government defeats? History was made tonight with the scale of this defeat - a higher figure than the wildest of numbers that were gossiped about before the vote. But the prime minister's dilemma is a more serious version of the same it's always been. She has no majority of her own in Parliament to make her middle way through stick. And her many critics don't agree on the direction she should take - a more dramatic break with the EU, or a tighter, softer version. Those two fundamental and clashing positions have always threatened to pull her and the government apart. Even the PM's allies would acknowledge that the government has made plenty of mistakes. But that widespread disagreement across the spectrum is Mrs May's nightmare that, right now, is a bad dream without end.

What is a no confidence motion?,"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is facing a potential leadership crisis, after Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick resigned over the government's plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Senior Conservative Party figures have told BBC News political editor Chris Mason they would not be surprised if Mr Sunak ended up facing a no-confidence vote from his own MPs. It's a vote in which MPs from all parties decide whether they want the government to continue. It can trigger a general election and see a new prime minister appointed. While any MP can propose a no-confidence motion, there's no guarantee their request will be granted. However, if the leader of the opposition - currently Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - introduces the motion, convention means the government must provide parliamentary time for a debate. The wording is usually: ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government."" The motion only needs a simple majority to pass: one more MP needs to vote in favour than the number voting against. If the government wins, it carries on as before. At present,the government has a majority of 58 in the House of Commons,external, so a lot of Conservative MPs would need to to vote against their own government for the motion to succeed. When is the next general election? If the government loses, two things could happen. In normal circumstances, you would expect Parliament to be dissolved and a general election to be called. It is also possible that the King could invite somebody else to form a government - someone who could win a vote of confidence in the House of Commons. That would be very unusual. It last happened in January 1924, when Stanley Baldwin's Conservatives decided to assemble a new Parliament rather than resigning, after losing their majority in a general election. His government was defeated in a vote of no confidence and King George V asked Labour's Ramsay MacDonald -  leader of the second biggest party - to form a government instead. But almost a century later, it's not clear how that would work. Conservative MPs could agree on a different leader themselves, whom the King could then invite to form a new government. Rishi Sunak is the second prime minister of King Charles III's reign In principle, the monarch could even refuse to dissolve Parliament for an election. Under the Lascelles principles (devised by Sir Alan Lascelles, private secretary to King George VI in 1950), the monarch could decline to do so if: the existing Parliament was still capable of doing its job a general election would be bad for the economy another prime minister could be found who could get a majority in the House of Commons But these scenarios would put the monarch in a very difficult position, and it is not clear how they would play out. What does the King do? If the government loses a confidence vote, the situation is similar to that of an election in which no one party wins a majority. That means that the existing prime minister would only resign if it's clear someone else can command the support of the House of Commons. However, if an alternative government is ready to take over, convention suggests that the PM should stand down. But there is nothing clearly stated in law that says that they must do so. Failing to step down would risk bringing the King into the dispute, as the monarch appoints PMs and, in theory, can dismiss one who behaves unconstitutionally. It's very rare for a government to lose a no-confidence motion. It has only happened once since World War Two. That was in 1979, when the then Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan's minority government fell and was replaced by Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives at the subsequent general election. James Callaghan was the last PM to lose a no-confidence vote Except for the period between 2011 and March 2022, when the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was in place, prime ministers have been able to call a general election whenever they want. That means they can avoid a potential no-confidence vote by simply calling an election. Is axing fixed-term parliaments a good idea?

Federer battles through against Evans,"Dan Evans, left, was applauded off the court after a combative display against Federer Australian Open 2019 Venue:Melbourne ParkDates:14-27 January Coverage:Daily live commentaries on the BBC Sport website, listen to Tennis Breakfast daily from 07:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and watch highlights on BBC TV and online from 19 January. Britain's Dan Evans succumbed in three sets after pushing defending champion Roger Federer hard in an entertaining Australian Open second-round match. Evans, ranked 189th in the world, lost 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 against the 20-time Grand Slam champion. But he never looked out of his depth, impressing the Rod Laver Arena with his shot-making. Federer will play Taylor Fritz in the third round after the American dispatched France's Gael Monfils. ""I couldn't pull away early in the match - it helps when you can sneak in a quick break,"" said third seed Federer, who at 37 is aiming to become the first man to win seven Australian Open titles. ""He played very well. It was hard to pull away, to his credit. I thought I played well."" Federer match gives Evans confidence Surgery might prolong Murray's career - Bryan Wimbledon finalist Anderson knocked out by Tiafoe Champion Wozniacki through to third round Federer fired down 11 aces to Evans' four British number four Evans, ranked inside the top 50 before a drugs ban, is aiming to climb back up the rankings as he continues his comeback. And the 28-year-old showed he still has all the tools to cause problems against the world's best. Federer was particularly impressed with Evans who, like the Swiss great, has a game heavily reliant on a sliced backhand. ""It felt like playing in a mirror a little bit. That was the mindset I had - how would I play myself potentially,"" the Swiss said. Evans had never taken more than five games in a set off Federer in their two previous meetings, bettering that on Rod Laver as he took Federer into a first-set tie-break. The Briton had been relatively untroubled on serve until the 12th game, swatting away Federer's first break point of the match with a serve and volley and going on to hold to take the set into the decider. Evans refused to be passive and took on Federer as he raced into a 5-3 lead with a wonderful cross-court forehand winner, leaving him with the set on his racquet. But, despite landing two first serves having managed only a 56% first-serve percentage previously, he was undone by Federer's brilliance. Federer, knowing he was fighting for survival, upped the tempo and forced Evans to miss two difficult volleys. Federer built on that momentum by breaking Evans in the very first game of the second set, although the Briton missed a chance of his own in the fourth before the pair continued to trade games. But Federer earned another opportunity on Evans' serve in the ninth game - this time for the set. Evans drilled two forehand winners to save two set points, but few in the crowd expected anything other than Federer to serve it out next game. So there was genuine shock on Melbourne's show court when Federer double faulted to give Evans two break points, before Evans put away a backhand winner to level for 5-5. Two games later we were in another tie-break - Federer taking control early on for a 3-0 lead and, after a brief Evans rally, sealing a two-set lead with an ace. The third set was far more straightforward for the six-time champion, who turned it in his favour with some magic in the fourth game. At 40-0 down, he casually knocked a pick-up past Evans and that was the catalyst for him to fight back and break his opponent.

Wales 'highest prison rate' in western Europe,"Wales has the highest imprisonment rate in western Europe, new research has claimed. The Wales Governance Centre's analysis of official figures also reveals average custody rates are higher than in England for a number of different groups and offences. In particular, non-white Welsh prisoners are overrepresented in prison. Report author Dr Robert Jones said this was a major cause of concern. ""Equally disturbing is that such an alarming trend has emerged in Wales without detection,"" his report concluded. ""This undoubtedly calls into question the role being played by UK justice agencies in Wales as well as civil society organisations and academic researchers."" This is the first time Wales has been analysed separately and Dr Jones said wider research was now needed. Sentencing figures show there were 154 prisoners for every 100,000 people in Wales, a higher proportion than England - which has the second-highest imprisonment rate. More people were being jailed in Wales despite a lower crime rate than in England every year between 2013 and 2017. The Sentencing Council downplayed the likelihood that meaningful differences exist between England and Walesin their recent evidence,externalto theCommission on Justice in Wales,,externalsaying guidelines ""ensure a consistency of approach"" regardless of location. But Dr Jones, who is based at Cardiff University, said this was an area that could no longer be disregarded. An average rate for the prison population in western European countries shows England, Scotland and Wales at the top The report also shows: The total number of prison sentences handed out in England dropped by 16% between 2010 and 2017; at the same time they rose by 0.3% in Wales Immediate custodial sentences imposed by magistrates rose by 12% in Wales. Women in Wales are more likely to receive short-term custodial sentences than men, with 78.6% jailed for less than 12 months, compared with 67% of men. White offenders in Wales were given the lowest average immediate custodial sentence length in 2017 (13.2 months), while black offenders recorded the highest average sentence length (21.5 months), followed by Asian (19 months) and mixed race (17.7 months). But Wales handed out shorter sentences to offenders than in England, with the average prison sentence being 13.4 months, compared with 17.2 months in England in 2017. And a higher percentage of sentences of four years or more were also handed out in England. Dr Jones added: ""Gradually, a detailed picture is emerging of the justice system in Wales and how it is quite different to that of England. ""A thorough debate is needed on why these kinds of sentencing and custodial patterns occur in Wales and whether these are the outcomes that the UK and Welsh governments want to see from the criminal justice system."" The researchers obtained the figures from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) under the Freedom of Information Act. A spokesperson for the MoJ said prison would ""continue to be the best place for serious offenders"". They said: ""As we have said previously, the prison population is too high and we are exploring potential alternatives to custody - such as reducing the number of ineffective short sentences which provide little opportunity to rehabilitate offenders and fail to tackle reoffending."" New prisons will have no bars on the windows Prisons: Why are they in such a state? Ministers consider ending shorter jail terms Katy Hanson, managing director of Welch & Co, who works as a duty solicitor in Pembrokeshire, said: ""Every court, wherever you are, has its own way of doing things and to a certain extent there are always going to be discrepancies, but I am surprised by these statistics. ""Courts do hand out shorter sentences and perhaps don't suspend sentences when they could. ""It's interesting that this has been released at a time when the government is looking at whether there's merit in scrapping short sentences. There's a lot of evidence that short-term sentences don't do that much to deter people offending."" She also questioned whether courts have fewer sentencing options. ""It feels as though probation have more courses and assistance available to those on probation in England, possibly because there are more defendants, so resources are being put there. ""That might make a difference because the courts there feel more can be done to assist people and prevent them reoffending."" Jane Hutt AM, deputy minister with a responsibility for crime and justice policy, said the report was very timely and would influence the Welsh Government's future work around offending, including a ""distinct and different justice system"" for female and youth offenders. ""Whilst justice remains a non-devolved function, work is under way to get the best possible solution for Wales,"" she added.

"New deal for schools in tough areasInspectors to focus on good teaching and a broad curriculum alongside results, says Ofsted.Family & EducationComments","A school in a tough area which has great teachers and a great curriculum could be rated outstanding from September, even if pupils' results are mediocre, says Ofsted. But the watchdog denies its proposed new inspection framework for England will mean a dumbing-down of standards. It says too many schools game the system by ""teaching to the test"" or ""off-rolling"" lower ability pupils. But education unions say the plans do not go far enough. Ofsted says its new framework aims to rebalance the inspection process to make sure that young people receive the best teaching possible. Ofsted to move away from exam results focus Ofsted admits some 'outstanding schools aren't that good' It says that instead of taking exam results and test data at face value, inspectors will look at how those results have been achieved, whether they are the result of broad and rich learning - or gaming and cramming. And this could mean less good news for a school in a leafy suburban area that looks as if it achieves high results ""but actually when you look beneath the bonnet they're doing this by a narrowed curriculum"" and ""some naff qualifications"", said Sean Harford, Ofsted's national director for education. ""Then actually they are going to get judged down because they should be doing better,"" warned Mr Harford. The inspectorate says its own research suggests that some schools are narrowing their curriculum in order to boost results in key exams. This can mean: at nursery, instead of playing with or reading to children, staff write ""endless"" reports at primary school, instead of reading a wide range of books, children focus on comprehension tests at secondary school, pupils drop arts, languages or music, as young as 13, to focus on exam subjects at college, students are steered towards ""popular"" courses to boost numbers but not helped to improve their English and maths Ofsted says the new framework will include a new ""quality of education"" judgement which assesses both results and the methods schools use to deliver them. Additionally, schools currently rated good by Ofsted, which now only have to have a one-day inspection every four years, will face additional scrutiny, with their inspections extended to two days. Another measure will see inspectors no longer using schools' internal performance data as inspection evidence which should help reduce teacher workload. There will also be greater focus on pupils' behaviour, with separate judgements for pupils' ""personal development"" and ""behaviour and attitudes"". The aim is to keep a check on ""low-level disruption in schools"" which is of great concern to parents and ""the bane of teachers' lives"", says Ofsted. ""Two words sum up my ambition for the framework: substance and integrity,"" said chief inspector Amanda Spielman. ""The substance that has all children and young people exposed to the best that has been thought and said, achieve highly and set up to succeed. ""And the integrity that makes sure every child and young person is treated as an individual with potential to be unlocked, and staff as experts in their subject or field, not just as data gatherers and process managers."" Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the government backed Ofsted's plan calling it ""a hugely positive step forward for all our schools"". But education unions were sceptical - Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the practices Ofsted deplored in the document, the narrowing of the school curriculum and teaching to the test, ""have been the results of its own enforcement, through inspection, of a range of narrow measures to judge school quality"". Dr Bousted said until these measures were abolished, schools would continue to be judged on results. The National Association of Head Teachers said the plan did not do enough to allay teachers' fears that schools in tough areas were treated unfairly in inspections and would not remove the disincentive for teachers and school leaders to work in the most challenging schools. . ""It doesn't appear to be the game-changer we hoped it would be,"" said NAHT director of policy, James Bowen. ""It appears to us that everything that was in the existing framework is still there and new things have been added as well. ""In a sense, its like a rearrangement of furniture. So there will still be enormous pressure on school leaders and schools under this new framework.""

British man killed in Kenyan hotel attackThe man is among at least 14 people killed in an attack on a luxury hotel in the Kenyan capital.UK,"Luke Potter was involved in development projects across East Africa A British man killed in an attack on a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya, has been named as Luke Potter by the international development charity he worked for. In a statement,external, Gatsby said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by the death of its Africa programmes director. Mr Potter was among at least 21 people killed. It is understood a member of the UK Special Forces was involved in a rescue operation at the complex. The Somalia-based militant group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack. Gunmen stormed the complex in the capital on Tuesday. Gunfire and explosions continued into Wednesday beforePresident Uhuru Kenyatta announced the siege had ended. The Foreign Office said another Briton was also wounded in the attack. Latest updates on the siege aftermath In pictures: Attack in Kenya's capital In a statement, Gatsby Africa said Mr Potter had ""devoted the past 10 years of his career to helping some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world"" and had worked with the charity for more than three years, carrying out assignments across East Africa. ""Luke was respected by all he worked with, bringing huge drive, determination, a relentless work ethic, and a thirst for new ideas to every project,"" the statement said. ""He brought a calm head and his unique sense of humour to every situation."" It said Mr Potter was ""instrumental"" in establishing the organisation's forestry programme in Kenya and provided ""crucial leadership, guidance and support"" to other programmes in Tanzania and Rwanda. The charity said its ""thoughts and deepest condolences"" were with Mr Potter's family, partner, daughter and friends and they were offering support to them and their own staff. This video can not be played The scene at the Nairobi Dusit hotel as the rescue operation took place The UK High Commissioner to Kenya, Nic Hailey, confirmed the death of a British man on Twitter. ""I'm very sad to confirm that we believe at least one British national has been killed in the attack,"" he said. ""We are providing our support to his family and friends at this very difficult time."" The Foreign Office added it was ""in contact with the Kenyan authorities"" and was ""ready to help any other British people affected"". It is understood a member of the British SAS - who was in Kenya as part of a training team - was involved in rescuing hostages. The armed special forces soldier entered the hotel complex to help rescue the trapped civilians and, according to a source, fired his weapon. He is believed to have been working alongside members of the US Special Forces, who were already in Nairobi when the attack took place. A man believed to be a member of the British SAS helps people caught up in the attack to safety Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Twitter: ""Really tragic news from Kenya - my thoughts are with the families and friends who have lost loved ones in this attack including one British citizen. ""UK stands with Kenya at this difficult time. Our team in Nairobi are supporting all Brits affected."" On Wednesday morning, President Kenyatta announced the assault was over, adding that the ""terrorists"" had been ""eliminated"" and more than 700 civilians had been evacuated to safety. He said: ""We will seek out every person that was involved in the funding, planning and execution of this heinous act. ""We are a country governed by laws, rules and regulations - a country that embraces peaceful coexistence... I must also state that we are also a nation that never forgets those who hurt our children."" The president said 14 ""innocent"" people had been killed in the attack. Kenya's police chief later said the death toll had risen to 21. The Kenya Red Cross said about 45 people were still unaccounted for. The US State Department said an American man was among those killed. The luxury complex, which houses the DusitD2 hotel as well as offices, is in the Westlands district of the city. The attack began at about 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Tuesday, when four gunmen threw bombs at vehicles in the car park, before entering the lobby, where one blew himself up, police say. Security camera footage showed at least four heavily armed men walking in and opening fire. There are reports they had been seen visiting the compound in recent days. When the gunmen first entered the complex there was confusion, as people first tried to escape to freedom and then retreated into the building as they came under fire. Many civilians remained holed up in the complex for several hours, as they hid from the attackers in bathrooms, and even under tables and chairs. Groups of civilians were escorted to safety by security forces throughout the night. In the early hours of Wednesday, more than 100 people were rescued. About 30 people are being treated at Nairobi hospitals, media reports say.

"'Game changer' liver transplant approvedIt's hoped perfusion machines that ""warm livers"" will increase the number of viable donated organs.Health","The normothermic perfusion machine pumps oxygenated blood and nutrients into livers outside the body A new procedure for storing livers donated for transplant has been hailed a ""game changer"" and approved for use on the NHS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) say perfusion machines could increase the number of livers that can be safely used for transplantation. They store donated livers at body temperature, which slows the deterioration of the organ. Usually donor livers are kept on ice. This can cause damage to the liver and limit how long it can be stored. About 20% of patients die while waiting for a liver transplant and about a third of donated livers are unable to be used for transplantation. These could include livers taken from elderly people or those in poor health and those damaged while the organ was removed from the donor's body or while being kept in ice. The perfusion machine allows the liver to recover from any damage and it can be flushed with blood at body temperature and given oxygen, medications and nutrients allowing its viability and function to be assessed. This could mean that livers that might have previously been considered unsuitable can be used safely. The machines can also extend how long the liver can be stored to allow more flexibility in the timing of the transplant operation. Keeping livers 'alive' boosts transplant success 'Warmed liver' transplant first Prof Kevin Harris, at NICE, said: ""It offers another way of preserving the liver and assessing whether livers which might have previously been considered unsuitable can be used safely. ""By using this procedure, more patients on the organ transplant waiting list could be offered a chance of a transplant and thereby potentially extending their lives."" Darius Mirza, professor of transplant surgery at University Hospitals Birmingham, said the machine was a ""game changer"". ""In the 30 years I've been involved with transplantation, there have been three or four events which have been game changers and I'm absolutely certain we are looking at a game changer that will change the way we practise organ storage and transplantation."" Liver perfusion is currently performed on the NHS in a small number of specialist centres in the UK. ""I signed up for the trial not knowing I would be one of the first to have this procedure in the country. Before my transplant I was very ill. I was losing weight, I couldn't sleep and my quality of life was quite low. ""I had a transplant after the hospital found a donor who was a match. The liver was kept alive using this procedure overnight and I was able to have the operation the following day. Nine days later I was back home. ""Having a transplant has changed my life. I've joined the gym, got fit and gone back to work and did some voluntary work for the Staffordshire Search and Rescue team and I also compete nationally and internationally in the Transplant Games as a member of the Team GB transplant team. ""My life is unbelievably wonderful. I'm very healthy, I'm very happy and very active. I think I've been very lucky."" This video can not be played New liver recipient in Staffordshire wants to donate Games medal to donor's family Vanessa Hebditch, from the British Liver Trust, said every year hundreds of people with advanced liver disease died while waiting for a transplant and this procedure offered ""real hope"". ""It is an exciting development that has the potential to shorten waiting list times and reduce mortality rates from advanced liver disease,"" she said. ""After transplant, the vast majority of people go on to lead full and healthy lives and it is truly amazing to see the transformation."" For the year2017-18,external, there were 1,043 liver transplants in the UK and 359 patients on the UK active transplant list. The latest evidence from trialsreviewed by a NICE committee concluded that the procedure ""worked well and was safe to be offered to patients who had been fully informed of the risks and benefits"". Doctors need to seek approval from their trust's management and record all data from the procedure in a database to further monitor its success.

Rihanna takes father to court over brand,"Rihanna claims her father is exploiting her name Singer Rihanna has taken her father to court in the US, accusing him of exploiting her name to further his entertainment business. She claims her father, Ronald Fenty, and his business partner have falsely suggested that she is connected to their firm, Fenty Entertainment. Their conduct has misled the public and hurt her Fenty brand, the name of her beauty business, the lawsuit says. Fenty Entertainment did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rihanna has asked the court to bar the firm from using the Fenty name for business. The lawsuit says Rihanna owns trademarks in the US for the Fenty name and has sent formal ""cease and desist"" requests. ""Defendants continue to this date to use their misrepresentations for their commercial advantage and to mislead the public,"" it says. ""This fraudulent conduct harms not only plaintiffs but the public at large and requires judicial intervention."" Mr Fenty, with whom Rihanna has said she has a difficult relationship, started the firm in California in 2017 with business partner Moses Perkins, according to the lawsuit. A press release, posted on the firm's website until ""at least October 2018"" announced the launch of the firm ""with"" Rihanna, despite the fact that she was not involved, it says. In another instance, Fenty Entertainment entered negotiations for Rihanna to perform 15 shows in Latin America for about $15m, without her authorisation, according to the complaint. ""Although Mr Fenty is Rihanna's father, he does not presently, nor has he ever, had the authority to act on Rihanna's behalf or had the right to use her Fenty mark, to exploit the goodwill of her Fenty brands or to solicit business on her behalf,"" it says. The lawsuit says these kinds of activities violate advertising, competition and privacy laws and risk ""serious irreparable injury"" to the Fenty brand if not stopped.

New deal for schools in tough areas,"A school in a tough area which has great teachers and a great curriculum could be rated outstanding from September, even if pupils' results are mediocre, says Ofsted. But the watchdog denies its proposed new inspection framework for England will mean a dumbing-down of standards. It says too many schools game the system by ""teaching to the test"" or ""off-rolling"" lower ability pupils. But education unions say the plans do not go far enough. Ofsted says its new framework aims to rebalance the inspection process to make sure that young people receive the best teaching possible. Ofsted to move away from exam results focus Ofsted admits some 'outstanding schools aren't that good' It says that instead of taking exam results and test data at face value, inspectors will look at how those results have been achieved, whether they are the result of broad and rich learning - or gaming and cramming. And this could mean less good news for a school in a leafy suburban area that looks as if it achieves high results ""but actually when you look beneath the bonnet they're doing this by a narrowed curriculum"" and ""some naff qualifications"", said Sean Harford, Ofsted's national director for education. ""Then actually they are going to get judged down because they should be doing better,"" warned Mr Harford. The inspectorate says its own research suggests that some schools are narrowing their curriculum in order to boost results in key exams. This can mean: at nursery, instead of playing with or reading to children, staff write ""endless"" reports at primary school, instead of reading a wide range of books, children focus on comprehension tests at secondary school, pupils drop arts, languages or music, as young as 13, to focus on exam subjects at college, students are steered towards ""popular"" courses to boost numbers but not helped to improve their English and maths Ofsted says the new framework will include a new ""quality of education"" judgement which assesses both results and the methods schools use to deliver them. Additionally, schools currently rated good by Ofsted, which now only have to have a one-day inspection every four years, will face additional scrutiny, with their inspections extended to two days. Another measure will see inspectors no longer using schools' internal performance data as inspection evidence which should help reduce teacher workload. There will also be greater focus on pupils' behaviour, with separate judgements for pupils' ""personal development"" and ""behaviour and attitudes"". The aim is to keep a check on ""low-level disruption in schools"" which is of great concern to parents and ""the bane of teachers' lives"", says Ofsted. ""Two words sum up my ambition for the framework: substance and integrity,"" said chief inspector Amanda Spielman. ""The substance that has all children and young people exposed to the best that has been thought and said, achieve highly and set up to succeed. ""And the integrity that makes sure every child and young person is treated as an individual with potential to be unlocked, and staff as experts in their subject or field, not just as data gatherers and process managers."" Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the government backed Ofsted's plan calling it ""a hugely positive step forward for all our schools"". But education unions were sceptical - Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the practices Ofsted deplored in the document, the narrowing of the school curriculum and teaching to the test, ""have been the results of its own enforcement, through inspection, of a range of narrow measures to judge school quality"". Dr Bousted said until these measures were abolished, schools would continue to be judged on results. The National Association of Head Teachers said the plan did not do enough to allay teachers' fears that schools in tough areas were treated unfairly in inspections and would not remove the disincentive for teachers and school leaders to work in the most challenging schools. . ""It doesn't appear to be the game-changer we hoped it would be,"" said NAHT director of policy, James Bowen. ""It appears to us that everything that was in the existing framework is still there and new things have been added as well. ""In a sense, its like a rearrangement of furniture. So there will still be enormous pressure on school leaders and schools under this new framework."" A consultation on the proposals will run until 4 April.,external Ofsted to switch from exam results focus Some 'outstanding schools not that good' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Kenya hotel attack leaves 15 dead,"This video can not be played Nairobi Dusit hotel attack: explosions, gunfire and rescue operation Suspected militants have attacked a luxury hotel complex in Nairobi, killing at least 15 people. The compound in the Westlands district of the Kenyan capital, which houses the DusitD2 hotel as well as offices, was attacked by gunmen on Tuesday. By the evening officials said the siege was over but gunfire and explosions were heard early on Wednesday and a security operation is ongoing. The Somalia-based militant group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack. Nairobi attack: Latest from the scene In pictures: Assault on hotel complex Police sources say 15 people have been killed, but an official number has not yet been confirmed by the government. Some civilians are reportedly still trapped in the complex, and some have been texting relatives from hiding places. A US citizen is among the dead, according to the US State Department. The fate of the attackers is also unclear. The attack began at about 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) when four gunmen threw bombs at vehicles in the car park before entering the lobby, where one blew himself up, police say. A woman working in a neighbouring building told Reuters news agency: ""I just started hearing gunshots, and then started seeing people running away raising their hands up and some were entering the bank to hide for their lives."" Security camera footage showed at least four heavily armed men walking in and opening fire. There are reports they had been seen visiting the compound in recent days. Security forces swiftly cordoned off the area At 20:00 GMT, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i said all the buildings in the complex had been secured by security forces. ""The situation is under control and the country is safe,"" he told reporters. ""Terrorism will never defeat us."" But just an hour later gunfire and sporadic explosions were reported in the area. Security forces then combed their way through the building with reports saying frightened workers had barricaded themselves inside. In the early hours of Wednesday, more than 100 people were rescued from the complex and taken to a nearby trauma centre. About 30 people are being treated at Nairobi hospitals, media reports say, while the security operation is ongoing. People have been escorted out of the building with gunshot wounds The five-star DusitD2 hotel has 101 rooms. Located in the Westlands suburb, minutes from the capital's business district, it has its own spa and several restaurants. Kenya has seen a number of terror attacks in recent years - most notably in areas close to the Somali border and in the country's capital. By Joe Inwood, BBC News, Nairobi Every person escaping the Dusit complex has the same story - heavily armed men firing indiscriminately, using bombs and automatic rifles to kill. Most were too shaken to talk. They were all relieved to have escaped. They were coming out in small groups, many hours after the first explosions. The blasts could be heard across the city. I was in my flat round the corner when they happened, followed by the unmistakable sound of gunfire. The pictures that have been coming from inside are truly horrific. Ordinary people going about their business, murdered as they had lunch or did their jobs. This has a personal feel, too. The restaurant that seems to have taken the brunt of the explosions is a place I know well. It was full of lovely staff who would always greet you with a smile. As I sit watching the survivors escape, I wonder how many of them didn't make it. They are a militant Islamist group that opposes the Somali government but has also carried out attacks throughout East Africa. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? Kenya is part of a regional peacekeeping operation that supports the Somali government in its battle against al-Shabab. In September 2013,al-Shabab gunmen entered the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi and targeted shoppers. During an 80-hour siege at the upscale centre, 67 people were killed. Two years later,the group carried out its deadliest ever assault in Kenya, shooting dead almost 150 people at Garissa University. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab?

'Civilians trapped' as Kenya siege goes on,"This video can not be played Nairobi Dusit hotel attack: explosions, gunfire and rescue operation At least 21 people were killed when Somali militants stormed a luxury hotel compound in Nairobi, Kenya's government has confirmed. Hundreds were forced to flee the bloodshed at the DusitD2 hotel and business complex on Tuesday. Some 28 injured people have been admitted to hospital, and Kenya's Red Cross said 19 are still missing. Somalia-based Islamist group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack, which triggered a 19-hour security operation. President Uhuru Kenyatta said the siege ended with five jihadist attackers ""eliminated"". Kenya has been a target for al-Shabab since October 2011, when it sent its army into Somalia to fight the jihadist group. The BBC's Andrew Harding, in Nairobi, says cowering groups of civilians were escorted to safety by security forces throughout Tuesday night, amid sporadic bursts of gunfire and the boom of explosions that continued well beyond dawn. Many had spent hours hiding in their offices, or in bathrooms. On the crowded street outside the large, upmarket complex, friends and relatives embraced those who emerged andthanked Kenyan security forces. Mourners have now begun to bury the dead. Read more from Andrew: Relief replaces fear after Kenya attack In a televised address, President Kenyatta said ""every person that was involved in the funding, planning and execution of this heinous act"" would be ""relentlessly"" pursued. People arrive at the Chiromo mortuary in Nairobi to help identify victims Two people believed to be linked to the attack were arrested after raids on Wednesday, AFP reported. How Kenya's hotel siege unfolded In pictures: Assault on hotel complex Outrage at pictures of victims According to Reuters news agency, al-Shabab issued a statement calling the attack ""a response"" to US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The move last year overturned decades of US foreign policy, and drew international criticism. Jerusalem is a sacred city in Islam, Judaism and Christianity - and while Israel regards the whole of Jerusalem as its indivisible capital, Palestinians claim the eastern part of the city as the capital of a future state. Kenyan James Oduor, commonly known as Cobra, was tweeting as the attack was unfolding. He was known for his love of football and was well-liked. Allow Twitter content?

At 23:00, a government official said that all the buildings in the complex had been secured by security forces. But just an hour later, gunfire and sporadic explosions were reported in the area. There was more heavy gunfire at about 07:00 on Wednesday. Security forces then combed their way through the building where frightened workers had barricaded themselves inside. The five-star DusitD2 hotel has 101 rooms. Located in the Westlands suburb, minutes from the capital's business district, it has its own spa and several restaurants. When the gunmen first entered there was confusion, as people first tried to escape and then retreated into the building as they came under fire. One eyewitness, Faith Chepchirchir, told Reuters: ""People were trying to run towards the gate, but then I saw everyone who was running towards the gate was coming back from the gate, now heading to this opposite direction. ""So for me we just closed the doors and then gunshots were just being sprayed all over. From the top, I think [the gunmen] went to the top floor and then started spraying bullets."" Many civilians were trapped in the complex for several hours Many civilians remained holed up in the complex for several hours, as they hid from the attackers in bathrooms, and even under tables and chairs. 'How we survived Kenya hotel siege' Some were able to keep in contact with loved ones by text. They included Zinzi Khalwale, daughter of a former senator Boni Khalwale. Her father told The Daily Nation she had hidden in one of the rooms of her office until her rescue. By the evening, all but the seventh floor of the complex had been cleared, but some civilians remained there, apparently in close proximity to the surviving attackers.

Why did pound gain after defeat?,"The markets were prepared for her to lose - but the scale of her defeat took most by surprise. But more surprising still was the fact that the pound - the first financial responder to political events - gained in value after the vote - despite many, most, confidently predicting a crushing defeat would send it down. So what to make of it? Using the benefit of hindsight, some are saying that the recent display of animosity in the House of Commons to the idea of a no-deal Brexit, something markets are most wary of - has convinced them that outcome is very unlikely. The other new line is that this crushing defeat for her Brexit deal, makes no Brexit - at least not on 29 March - a growing possibility. That's financial markets, which respond in seconds. Real businesses are not so sure. With 72 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU another milestone has come and gone with the future no clearer and planning for no deal more urgent. As one exasperated business group said tonight, politicians are playing a ""high stakes game of political poker"" with the future of the UK economy.

Biggest defeats in history,"Theresa May's Brexit deal has been rejected in the House of Commons by 230 votes. Reality Check has been looking back at some of the biggest government defeats. Defeats in the order of 100-plus votes are very rare. The three biggest government losses, according to the Institute for Government think tank, all occurred in 1924 when the minority Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald was defeated by margins of 166, 161 and 140. The defeats of 166 and 161 votes both occurred on 8 October 1924 and related to the response to the government's decision to drop criminal proceedings against John Ross Campbell, editor of the Communist newspaper Workers' Weekly. A few weeks afterwards, a general election was held - following a motion of no confidence in the government. That election saw the Conservatives gain more than 150 seats with Stanley Baldwin returning to power. The third biggest defeat also happened in 1924 when the government suffered a 140-vote defeat on its Housing Bill on 3 June. Ramsay MacDonald's minority government was defeated by a margin of 166 in 1924 There may be special circumstances around certain votes, so it's not always easy to compare each one - says Alice Lilly from the Institute for Government. Governments, she says, have, on occasion, chosen not to take part in certain votes - meaning the scale of defeat was much larger than it otherwise would have been. For example, in March 1977 Labour lost a vote by 293-0 on public spending cuts to pay for a 1976 loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  In that instance, party managers instructed Labour MPs not to take part. Other votes might be ""free"", meaning that MPs are not put under pressure to vote a certain way by their party leaders. Usually such votes happen on ethical issues that are seen as a matter of conscience, such as the same-sex marriage vote.

Five possible scenarios,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Tusk suggests UK cancels Brexit,"Donald Tusk hinted that cancelling Brexit is ""the only positive solution"" European Council President Donald Tusk has hinted that the UK should stay in the EU, after the prime minister's Brexit deal was rejected in parliament. ""If a deal is impossible, and no-one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?"" he tweeted. MPs voted by 432 votes to 202 to reject the deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU on 29 March. Other EU officials and politicians reacted with dismay to the result.

A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU LIVE: Reaction to Brexit vote It was the largest defeat for a sitting government in history, with 118 of the votes against coming from Prime Minister Theresa May's own Conservative Party. It has cast more doubt on the Brexit process, and the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has tabled a vote of no confidence in the government. This video can not be played Senior EU figures give their reaction to events in Westminster As well as Mr Tusk's tweet, there has been plenty of comment on Tuesday's vote from across Europe. Here are the key quotes: European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned that time was running out for the UK to strike a deal. ""I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up,"" he said shortly after the result was announced. Jean-Claude Juncker said the chance of a ""disorderly Brexit"" had increased ""The risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening's vote,"" he added. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he ""profoundly"" regretted the vote. ""An orderly withdrawal will remain our absolute priority in the coming weeks,"" he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg. He added that there would be a favourable response if Mrs May were prepared to rethink her position on issues like the single market and customs union. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was still time to negotiate but ""we're now waiting on what the prime minister proposes"". Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Tuesday was a ""bitter day for Europe"". ""We are well prepared, but a hard Brexit would be the least attractive choice, for the EU and [UK],"" he said. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of the ruling Christian Democrat Union party, echoed this view. ""A hard Brexit will be the worst of all options,"" she said. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. ""The pressure is mainly on them,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said of the UK. He said a transition period was essential because a no-deal Brexit would be damaging. ""We will have to negotiate a transition period with them because the British cannot afford to no longer have planes taking off or landing at home,"" he said. Later a presidential source said France was stepping up preparations for a ""no-deal"" Brexit. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that the Republic was also now preparing for a no-deal Brexit but would work hard to avoid it because it ""would not protect the peace in Northern Ireland"". But he said the ball was now in the UK government's court to find a solution. ""We understand the PM will now consult with other parties and other political leaders on an agreed way forward we welcome that,"" he said. ""The onus is on Westminster to come up with solutions that they can support but they must be solutions that the European Union and Ireland can accept."" Meanwhile Foreign Minister Simon Coveney ruled out any alternative to the agreement reached with the UK over the Irish border. ""We're not going to allow physical border infrastructure to reappear,"" he told national broadcaster RTE.

PMÃ¢ÂÂs Brexit deal rejected by huge margin,"This video can not be played The prime minister's Brexit deal is backed by 202 MPs but 432  vote against. Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal has been rejected by 230 votes - the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. MPs voted by 432 votes to 202 to reject the deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU on 29 March. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has now tabled a vote of no confidence in the government, which could trigger a general election. The confidence vote is expected to be held at about 1900 GMT on Wednesday. The defeat is a huge blow for Mrs May, who has spent more than two years hammering out a deal with the EU. The plan was aimed at bringing about an orderly departure from the EU on 29 March, and setting up a 21-month transition period to negotiate a free trade deal. The vote was originally due to take place in December, butMrs May delayed it to try and win the support of more MPs. LIVE: Reaction to May's defeat Brexit deal: How did your MP vote? Pound regains ground after Brexit vote Reality Check: What are the biggest government defeats? Donald Tusk suggests UK should stay in EU The UK is still on course to leave on 29 March but the defeat throws the manner of that departure - and the timing of it - into further doubt. MPs who want either a further referendum, a softer version of the Brexit proposed by Mrs May, to stop Brexit altogether or to leave without a deal, will ramp up their efforts to get what they want, as a weakened PM offered to listen to their arguments. History was made tonight with the scale of this defeat - a higher figure than the wildest of numbers that were gossiped about before the vote. But the prime minister's dilemma is a more serious version of the same it's always been. She has no majority of her own in Parliament to make her middle way through stick. And her many critics don't agree on the direction she should take - a more dramatic break with the EU, or a tighter, softer version. Those two fundamental and clashing positions have always threatened to pull her and the government apart. Read more from Laura The Brexit debate has cut across traditional party lines. Some 118 Conservative MPs - from both the Leave and Remain wings of her party - voted with the opposition parties against Mrs May's deal. And three Labour MPs supported the prime minister's deal: Ian Austin (Dudley North), Kevin Barron (Rother Valley) and John Mann (Bassetlaw). The most controversial sticking point was the issue of the Northern Irish backstop - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland. Mrs May had hoped new assurances from EU leaders this week, saying the backstop would be temporary and, if triggered, would last for ""the shortest possible period"", would help her garner more support. But in the debate leading up to the vote, members from all sides of the House said the move did not go far enough.

In normal times, such a crushing defeat on a key piece of government legislation would be expected to be followed by a prime ministerial resignation. But Mrs May signalled her intention to carry on in a statement immediately after the vote. ""The House has spoken and this government will listen,"" she told MPs. This video can not be played Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no confidence motion She offered cross-party talks to determine a way forward on Brexit, if she succeeded in winning the confidence vote. Former foreign secretary and leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson said it was a ""bigger defeat than people have been expecting"" - and it meant Mrs May's deal was now ""dead"". But he said it gave the prime minister a ""massive mandate to go back to Brussels"" to negotiate a better deal, without the controversial Northern Ireland backstop. And he said he would back Mrs May in Wednesday's confidence vote. Labour MP Chuka Umunna said that if his leader did not secure a general election, Mr Corbyn should do what the ""overwhelming majority"" of Labour members want and get behind a further EU referendum. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who also wants a second referendum, said Mrs May's defeat was ""the beginning of the end of Brexit"" - but conceded that campaigners would not get one without Mr Corbyn's backing. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mrs May had suffered ""a defeat of historic proportions"" and called again for the Article 50 ""clock to be stopped"" in order for another referendum to take place. ""We have reached the point now where it would be unconscionable to kick the can any further down the road,"" she said. However, government minister Rory Stewart said there was no majority in the Commons for any Brexit plan, including another referendum. By the BBC's head of political research Peter Barnes Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years. The next one is due in 2022. But a vote of no confidence lets MPs decide on whether they want the government to continue. The motion must be worded: ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government."" If a majority of MPs vote for the motion then it starts a 14-day countdown. If during that time the current government, or any other alternative government cannot win a new vote of confidence, then an early general election would be called. That election cannot happen for at least 25 working days. MPs are set to debate Labour's no confidence motion for about six hours following Prime Minister's Questions at 1200. Mr Corbyn said it would allow the House of Commons to ""give its verdict on the sheer incompetence of this government"". But DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party, which keeps Mrs May in power, would be supporting her in Wednesday's confidence vote. She told the BBC MPs had ""acted in the best interests of the entire United Kingdom"" by voting down the deal. But she added: ""We will give the government the space to set out a plan to secure a better deal."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson said the majority of 230 in Parliament is ""perhaps a bigger defeat than people had been expecting"" In her statement to MPs, Mrs May said she planned to return to the Commons next Monday with an alternative plan - if she survives the confidence vote. She said she would explore any ideas from cross-party talks with the EU, but she remained committed to delivering on the result of the 2016 referendum. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the risk of a disorderly Brexit had increased as a result of the deal being voted down. He said the agreement was ""the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal"" and that he and President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, had ""demonstrated goodwill"" with additional clarifications this week to put MPs minds at rest. ""I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible,"" he said. ""Time is almost up."" Mr Tusk said he regretted the outcome of the vote and later tweeted to ask ""who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?"" Allow Twitter content?

A statement from the Irish government also said it regretted the decision and that it ""continues to believe that ratification of this agreement is the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK"". It also said it will ""continue to intensify preparations"" for a no deal Brexit.

PM faces confidence vote after huge defeat,"MPs are voting on a motion that could oust Theresa May's government from power and start moves towards a general election. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who tabled the no confidence motion, said the PM's ""zombie"" administration had lost the right to govern, and they ""should do the right thing and resign"". But Mrs May said a general election was simply not ""in the national interest"". It comes 24 hours after MPs voted down the PM's Brexit plans by a huge margin. Closing the debate, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said: ""She is a prime minister without a majority for her flagship policy, with no authority and no plan B."" But Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, said Mrs May had provided ""inspirational leadership"". He launched a scathing attack on Mr Corbyn over a number of his positions on national security issues, saying to loud cheers from Conservative MPs that the country could not have confidence in him as a leader. Mr Corbyn's motion is backed by MPs from the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green Party. But senior Labour figures accept it is not likely to succeed, as she has the backing of Tory rebels and the DUP's 10 MPs, who less than 24 hours ago helped inflict a humiliating defeat on her. Labour says further no-confidence votes could follow if this one fails. Brexit Live: Reaction to May's defeat How did your MP vote? Dublin steps up Brexit no-deal plans Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? Laura Kuenssberg: Can May find common cause in Parliament? Mr Corbyn told MPs: ""The prime minister has consistently claimed that her deal, which has been decisively rejected, was good for Britain workers and businessâ¦ she should have nothing to fear by going to the people."" He added that 2011's Fixed-term Parliaments Act ""was never intended to prop up a zombie government"", saying that the prime minister had ""lost control"" and suffered an ""historic and humiliating defeat"". This video can not be played Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no confidence motion Mr Watson added: ""I don't doubt that [Mrs May] has sincerely attempted to fulfil the task given to us buy the voters in the referendum. I have no doubt too that she has tried her best and given it her all. ""But she has failed and I am afraid the failure is hers and hers alone. ""We know she has worked hard, but the truth is she is too set in her ways, too aloof to lead. ""She lacks the imagination and agility to bring people with her, she lacks the authority on the world stage to negotiate this deal. Ultimately she has failed."" Mrs May told MPs it was Parliament that decided to put the question of European Union membership to the people, ""and now Parliament must finish the job"". She said extending Article 50, the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March, to allow time for an election would mean ""delaying Brexit for who knows how long"". She repeated her offer of cross-party talks to find a way forward on Brexit, but has not so far invited the Labour leader to take part in them. A general election would ""deepen divisions when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty,"" Mrs May said. Tory MP for Croydon South, Chris Philip, accused Mr Corbyn of ""shameless political opportunism"", which put ""party interests ahead of national interests"". James Morris, Tory MP for Halesowen and Rowley Regis, said the motion was ""merely a tactical device by the opposition to cause chaos"". And Conservative ex-minister Anna Soubry, who wants Mr Corbyn to back another EU referendum, questioned why her party were six points ahead of Labour in a weekend opinion poll, adding: ""Could it be because he's the most hopeless Leader of the Opposition that we've ever had?"" But other MPs backed Mr Corbyn, with Labour's Stephen Doughty saying his leader was ""absolutely right"" to call for a general election ""because it is not just the government's record on Brexit which is at stake tonight"". Labour frontbencher Liam Byrne, MP for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, accused Mrs May of building ""a cage of red lines"" over Brexit. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the government of ""seeking to run down the clock"" over Brexit and warned that the UK could ""crash out"" of the EU with no deal. ""The risk of a no deal is something that is unthinkable,"" he said. ""If the government and the prime minister want to drive the bus over the cliff, we will not be in the passenger seat."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said 48% of the population who voted to remain in the EU had been ""totally disregarded"" by the government and Mrs May had an ""unwillingness to listen"". He said a general election provided ""another route and a welcome one"" that could resolve the issue, and he also called for a ""People's Vote"". The leader of Plaid Cymru in Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts, who will vote against the government later, added her support for a ""People's Vote"", and called for the House to come together to make progress, condemning the ""pantomime point scoring"" taking place. The DUP's leader Arlene Foster and its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds have both said they will support the government in the confidence vote. But, speaking after what she described as a ""useful discussion"" with the prime minister, Ms Foster said ""lessons will need to be learned"" from the defeat on the Brexit deal. ""The issue of the backstop needs to be dealt and we will continue to work to that end,"" she added. A shift to promising some kind of closer relationship with the EU, whether an actual customs union or something by a similar name, seems to be becoming more likely. That's not because everyone in the government, let alone in No 10 or in the Cabinet, thinks it's the right thing to do - Liam Fox, whose job it is to pursue an independent trade policy, is not the only one with significant doubts. But you can see a realistic route of getting that kind of arrangement through the House of Commons. One former minister involved in trying to persuade the PM to soften up said: ""We have three days to push and push her to move, or there won't be anything that can get through."" Read Laura's full blog David Cameron, who resigned the day after the UK voted in 2016 to leave the EU, said he hoped, and thought, Mrs May would win Wednesday's vote. Speaking to the BBC he also insisted hedid not regret calling the referendum. This video can not be played David Cameron: I don't regret calling referendum BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says that if the prime minister sees off the challenge, she will begin a series of meetings with ""senior Parliamentarians"" on Thursday. He said Mrs May intended to retain her ""red lines"" - ruling out Labour's demand for a customs union with the EU - with sources suggesting compromising on this would risk cabinet resignations. However, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Justice Minister David Gauke suggested that the customs union option could not be ruled out, saying: ""We have got to engage and we have got to be constructive.""

Earlier Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom told the BBC the government was clear that it will not delay or revoke Article 50, although Chancellor Philip Hammondreportedly suggested delaying Brexitin a conference call on Tuesday evening. Alternative ways to break Brexit deadlock By the BBC's head of political research Peter Barnes Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years. The next one is due in 2022. But a vote of no confidence lets MPs decide on whether they want the government to continue.

That election cannot happen for at least 25 working days. What is a no confidence motion? European leaders reacted to Tuesday's vote with dismaybut gave no indication they were willing to make concessions. Several have warned of increased chances of a no-deal Brexit, which many MPs fear will cause chaos at ports and damage industry. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, said Brussels ""profoundly regrets"" how the UK's MPs voted and said it was ""up to the British authorities"" to indicate how it would move forward. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker urged the UK to clarify its intentions, saying: ""Time is almost up."" And European Council President Donald Tusk has appeared to suggest that the UK should stay in the EU. ""If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?"", he tweeted. Katya Adler: Will EU help after May's defeat? European Parliament Live: MEPs discuss Brexit EU's Tusk suggests UK should cancel Brexit The Commons defeat - the largest in history, by 432 votes to 202 - came as a huge blow for Mrs May. She had spent two years negotiating the plan aimed at bringing about an orderly Brexit on 29 March, 2019, and setting up a 21-month transition period to negotiate a free-trade deal with Brussels. But it faced opposition across Parliament, which has never had a majority in favour of Brexit. The UK public voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. Some Remain MPs oppose the deal because they want a further referendum with the option to scrap Brexit, while others accept Brexit will happen but want the UK to have a closer relationship with the EU than currently proposed. On the other side are MPs who think Mrs May's deal leaves the UK tied too closely to EU rules, while some want to see a no-deal Brexit, which is where the UK leaves the EU without any special arrangements in place. A key sticking point on the plan remains theNorthern Irish backstop- the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland.

Pound rises after Brexit vote,"The pound has risen after MPs voted to reject Theresa May's Brexit deal by 230 votes. The voteopens up a range of outcomes, including no deal, a renegotiation of Mrs May's deal, or a second referendum. Sterling rose 0.05% to $1.287 after declines of more than 1% earlier in the day. The currency slumped 7% in 2018 reflecting uncertainty about the terms of the UK's exit from the European Union. MPs voted by 432 votes to 202 to reject the deal, the heaviest defeat for a sitting government in history. ""A defeat has been broadly anticipated in markets since the agreement with the EU was closed in November 2018 and caused several members of the government to resign,"" said Richard Falkenhall, senior FX strategist at SEB. But business groups said their members' patience was wearing thin. ""There are no more words to describe the frustration, impatience, and growing anger amongst business after two and a half years on a high-stakes political rollercoaster ride that shows no sign of stopping,"" said Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. He implored MPs to come to an agreement, and was joined in this plea by business groups including the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British Industry. Some investors see the chances of a no-deal Brexit diminishing as parliament exerts more authority over the process. ""The probability of a no deal has diminished while the chances of a delay in Article 50, a second referendum or even, at the margin, no Brexit at all, have all increased. The consequence of those scenarios has encouraged sterling to rally despite the PM suffering the worst parliamentary result in a century,"" said Jeremy Stretch of CIBC Capital Markets. On Friday, hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a major donor to the Brexit campaign, said he now expected the project to be abandoned altogether and that he is positioning for the pound to strengthen. The markets were prepared for her to lose - but the scale of her defeat took most by surprise. But more surprising still was the fact that the pound - the first financial responder to political events - gained in value after the vote - despite many, most, confidently predicting a crushing defeat would send it down. So what to make of it? Using the benefit of hindsight, some are saying that the recent display of animosity in the House of Commons to the idea of a no-deal Brexit, something markets are most wary of - has convinced them that outcome is very unlikely. The other new line is that this crushing defeat for her Brexit deal, makes no Brexit - at least not on 29 March - a growing possibility. That's financial markets, which respond in seconds. Real businesses are not so sure.  With 72 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU another milestone has come and gone with the future no clearer and planning for no deal more urgent. Read more here But others are concerned the rejection of Mrs May's plan makes a no-deal Brexit more likely as other options become fewer in number. ""A no-deal Brexit means the public will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. ""British businesses desperately need certainty about the UK's future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. The time for Parliamentary games is over."" While there is speculation that Britain's exit from the EU must now be suspended as the most-developed plan has been scrapped, businesses may not be counting on this, particularly complicated ones like banks. ""Firms in the finance industry have put contingency plans in place to minimise disruption for their customers in a 'no deal' scenario but critical cliff-edge risks remain, including on the transfer of personal data and the operation of cross-border contracts,"" said Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance. Omar Ali, UK financial services leader at accountants EY, added: ""Firms have no choice but to fully implement their no-deal plans.""

Passionate protests outside,"As MPs on both sides of the Brexit divide battled it out in the Commons ahead of the vote on Theresa May's deal, an even noisier and more passionate debate was going on across the road. With fancy dress, lurid floats and colourful banners, there was something approaching a carnival atmosphere, as the usual ranks of pro and anti-Brexit demonstrators outside Parliament were swollen by people who had travelled to London for the big vote. The two sides mostly kept a respectful distance from each other, as a low-key police presence tried to keep a right of way open for pedestrians. The protest was at times loud - with a group of pro-Brexit demonstrators ringing a ""liberty bell"" and beating a bass drum, with tensions escalating as the MPs' vote approached. Live: MPs debate Brexit deal May facing crunch vote on Brexit deal What voters want MPs to do about Brexit Everyone - with the notable exception of a man wielding a ""leave, then negotiate"" placard - appeared to be united in their disdain for Theresa May's Brexit agreement. ""It's a rubbish deal,"" said retired cab driver Colin Grostate, a card-carrying Conservative Party member, and prospective council candidate. ""Everybody in the country knows, except Theresa May. The lights are on but nobody's home. ""The woman's a nutcase. She's just in denial."" Colin Grostate: ""I am willing to die for the vote"" Mr Grostate, like some of the other pro-Brexit demonstrators, was wearing a yellow vest, in solidarity, he said, with ""working class"" protesters in France. He was angry about what he saw as a betrayal of the result of the 2016 referendum by MPs. ""We voted for freedom, not for money. We didn't say we wanted to be richer or poorer. We voted for freedom."" Mr Grostate, who lives in Ramsgate, has booked himself into a London hotel for four days to protest outside Parliament. ""I am willing to die for the vote. If they don't leave on the 30 March, there's thousands like me up and down the country that is willing to stand their ground. ""We lost 7 million British, Commonwealth and Americans fighting for this country to be free. We are not handing it over to the Europeans, that's for sure."" Peter Hayden, a Labour Party member, was equally angry, albeit in a more understated way, with his party leader. Peter Hayden: ""Labour will be sidelined on this whole issue"" He says he joined Labour because of Jeremy Corbyn's socialist policies - ""I was a Corbynite"" -  but has become disillusioned with Mr Corbyn's refusal to get behind calls for another EU referendum, which is what, he says, the vast majority of Labour members want and what they voted for at their party conference. ""He needs to come off the fence because otherwise the initiative will be taken by the Tories, so Labour will be sidelined on this whole issue."" Like Mr Grostate, the retired author, from Warwickshire, is in London for the week to make his voice heard. ""This is fanatics' alley,"" he says, surveying the protests going on around him. ""Everyone who is here, I suppose you could say including me, they are coming out because they feel fanatical, so you can't gauge opinion. The polls say there is a drift towards Remain and I hope they are right."" One of the more colourful floats touring the streets of Westminster Alena Useinviz is part of a group of EU citizens, In Limbo, protesting against what they believe is the reduction in rights that will flow from Mrs May's deal. ""I have lived here for 10 years legally. I have always paid tax. I have worked all my life. I now have to apply for the right to remain here. And I do not like that."" In Limbo protesters are angry at losing rights She added: ""As a British citizen with a German passport I think it's a bad deal. I would like to see it returned to the people. I would also like it to be inclusive of the European citizens here as well as the British citizens in Europe."" Victor Zanchi had dressed up as a ""plague doctor"" because, ""Brexit is taking us back to the Middle Ages"". The Italian citizen, who says he could not vote in the 2016 referendum, has since taken British citizenship, and is down for the day from York to make his voice heard, ahead of the vote. ""Ideally I would like Brexit completely stopped but I understand why that is not a straightforward thing to happen and a second referendum is the most reasonable way towards that."" Mark Day, a planning officer from Horsham, West Sussex, who was draped in an EU flag, said he would never have expected to take to the streets in protest at Brexit or join a political party - the Liberal Democrats - before the 2016 referendum.

He now feels he has to act, he says, because Brexit is ""the most disastrous thing that can ever happen to us in peacetime"".

""We are trying to say don't pass this withdrawal bill,"" said Marietta King, a member of UKIP's national executive committee, down for the day from the Midlands. She said she voted to stay in the EEC, as it was then called, in the 1975 referendum, but that was when it was purely a trading arrangement, she says, before it ""took control"" of so many laws.

El Chapo 'paid $100m bribe to ex-president'A witness accuses Enrique PeÃÂ±a Nieto of taking a $100m bribe from drug traffickers in October 2012.US & Canada,"Former Mexican president Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto (L) and JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n (R) Former Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto accepted a $100m (Â£77m) bribe from drug cartel kingpin JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n, a witness has testified. Alex Cifuentes, who says he was a close associate of GuzmÃ¡n for years, told a New York City courtroom that he had told authorities of the bribe in 2016. GuzmÃ¡n is accused of being behind the Sinaloa drug cartel, which prosecutors say was the largest US drug supplier. Mr PeÃ±a Nieto served as the president of Mexico from 2012 to 2018. GuzmÃ¡n, 61, has been on trial in Brooklyn since November after he was extradited from Mexico to face charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs as leader of what the US has called the world's largest drug cartel. ""El Chapo"" (right) is the highest-ranking alleged drug lord to face trial in the US so far According to reporters in the Brooklyn courthouse, Mr PeÃ±a Nieto had requested $250m before settling on $100m. Cifuentes claimed the delivery was made to Mexico City in October 2012 by a friend of El Chapo. Crazy moments from El Chapo's trial Mexico's most-wanted: A guide to the drug cartels Cifuentes, a Colombian drug lord who has described himself as El Chapo's ""right-hand man"", worked as his secretary and spent two years hiding from authorities with him in the Mexican mountains, according to prosecutors. He was arrested in Mexico in 2013 and was later extradited to the United States where he pleaded guilty to drug trafficking in a deal with prosecutors. Mr PeÃ±a Nieto has not responded to the latest claim, but has previously rejected allegations of corruption that have surfaced during the trial since it began in November. What to expect from El Chapo's trial Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Brooklyn The trial in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn is a security circus - with guards everywhere and metal detectors set up in different areas of the building, leading to the courtroom on the eighth floor. Outside of the building, part of the street is blocked off. The trial itself has offered macabre details about assassinations carried out by drug traffickers and stunning allegations about state officials. After the a former top lieutenant for El Chapo testified of an alleged bribe to the former Mexican president, reporters rushed out of the courtroom, heading to file their stories. It's hard to know what to believe when former drug traffickers testify, but one thing is clear: the tight security makes sense in a place where the stakes are so high. GuzmÃ¡n's lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, has argued that the real leader of the Sinaloa cartel is Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada. He claims Mr Zambada has survived prosecution by bribing the ""entire"" Mexican government, including Mr PeÃ±a Nieto and former president Felipe CalderÃ³n. President PeÃ±a Nieto and Mr CalderÃ³nimmediately rejected the accusation, with the latter calling it ""absolutely false and reckless"". In November another cartel member testified that an aide to current Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador was allegedly paid a bribe in 2005. Cifuentes testified earlier on Friday that El Chapo had ordered a $10m bribe be paid to a general, but later decided to have him killed instead. The hit was never carried out.

EU's Tusk suggests UK should cancel Brexit,"Donald Tusk hinted that cancelling Brexit is ""the only positive solution"" European Council President Donald Tusk has hinted that the UK should stay in the EU, after the prime minister's Brexit deal was rejected in parliament. ""If a deal is impossible, and no-one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?"" he tweeted. MPs voted by 432 votes to 202 to reject the deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU on 29 March. Other EU officials and politicians reacted with dismay to the result.

A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU LIVE: Reaction to Brexit vote It was the largest defeat for a sitting government in history, with 118 of the votes against coming from Prime Minister Theresa May's own Conservative Party. It has cast more doubt on the Brexit process, and the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has tabled a vote of no confidence in the government. This video can not be played Senior EU figures give their reaction to events in Westminster As well as Mr Tusk's tweet, there has been plenty of comment on Tuesday's vote from across Europe. Here are the key quotes: European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned that time was running out for the UK to strike a deal. ""I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up,"" he said shortly after the result was announced. Jean-Claude Juncker said the chance of a ""disorderly Brexit"" had increased ""The risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening's vote,"" he added. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he ""profoundly"" regretted the vote. ""An orderly withdrawal will remain our absolute priority in the coming weeks,"" he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg. He added that there would be a favourable response if Mrs May were prepared to rethink her position on issues like the single market and customs union. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was still time to negotiate but ""we're now waiting on what the prime minister proposes"". Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Tuesday was a ""bitter day for Europe"". ""We are well prepared, but a hard Brexit would be the least attractive choice, for the EU and [UK],"" he said. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of the ruling Christian Democrat Union party, echoed this view. ""A hard Brexit will be the worst of all options,"" she said. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. ""The pressure is mainly on them,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said of the UK. He said a transition period was essential because a no-deal Brexit would be damaging. ""We will have to negotiate a transition period with them because the British cannot afford to no longer have planes taking off or landing at home,"" he said. Later a presidential source said France was stepping up preparations for a ""no-deal"" Brexit. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that the Republic was also now preparing for a no-deal Brexit but would work hard to avoid it because it ""would not protect the peace in Northern Ireland"". But he said the ball was now in the UK government's court to find a solution. ""We understand the PM will now consult with other parties and other political leaders on an agreed way forward we welcome that,"" he said. ""The onus is on Westminster to come up with solutions that they can support but they must be solutions that the European Union and Ireland can accept."" Meanwhile Foreign Minister Simon Coveney ruled out any alternative to the agreement reached with the UK over the Irish border. ""We're not going to allow physical border infrastructure to reappear,"" he told national broadcaster RTE.

'Fairer' deal for schools in tough areas,"A school in a tough area which has great teachers and a great curriculum could be rated outstanding from September, even if pupils' results are mediocre, says Ofsted. But the watchdog denies its proposed new inspection framework for England will mean a dumbing-down of standards. It says too many schools game the system by ""teaching to the test"" or ""off-rolling"" lower ability pupils. But education unions say the plans do not go far enough. Ofsted says its new framework aims to rebalance the inspection process to make sure that young people receive the best teaching possible. Ofsted to move away from exam results focus Ofsted admits some 'outstanding schools aren't that good' It says that instead of taking exam results and test data at face value, inspectors will look at how those results have been achieved, whether they are the result of broad and rich learning - or gaming and cramming. And this could mean less good news for a school in a leafy suburban area that looks as if it achieves high results ""but actually when you look beneath the bonnet they're doing this by a narrowed curriculum"" and ""some naff qualifications"", said Sean Harford, Ofsted's national director for education. ""Then actually they are going to get judged down because they should be doing better,"" warned Mr Harford. The inspectorate says its own research suggests that some schools are narrowing their curriculum in order to boost results in key exams. This can mean: at nursery, instead of playing with or reading to children, staff write ""endless"" reports at primary school, instead of reading a wide range of books, children focus on comprehension tests at secondary school, pupils drop arts, languages or music, as young as 13, to focus on exam subjects at college, students are steered towards ""popular"" courses to boost numbers but not helped to improve their English and maths Ofsted says the new framework will include a new ""quality of education"" judgement which assesses both results and the methods schools use to deliver them. Additionally, schools currently rated good by Ofsted, which now only have to have a one-day inspection every four years, will face additional scrutiny, with their inspections extended to two days. Another measure will see inspectors no longer using schools' internal performance data as inspection evidence which should help reduce teacher workload. There will also be greater focus on pupils' behaviour, with separate judgements for pupils' ""personal development"" and ""behaviour and attitudes"". The aim is to keep a check on ""low-level disruption in schools"" which is of great concern to parents and ""the bane of teachers' lives"", says Ofsted. ""Two words sum up my ambition for the framework: substance and integrity,"" said chief inspector Amanda Spielman. ""The substance that has all children and young people exposed to the best that has been thought and said, achieve highly and set up to succeed. ""And the integrity that makes sure every child and young person is treated as an individual with potential to be unlocked, and staff as experts in their subject or field, not just as data gatherers and process managers."" Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the government backed Ofsted's plan calling it ""a hugely positive step forward for all our schools"". But education unions were sceptical - Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the practices Ofsted deplored in the document, the narrowing of the school curriculum and teaching to the test, ""have been the results of its own enforcement, through inspection, of a range of narrow measures to judge school quality"". Dr Bousted said until these measures were abolished, schools would continue to be judged on results. The National Association of Head Teachers said the plan did not do enough to allay teachers' fears that schools in tough areas were treated unfairly in inspections and would not remove the disincentive for teachers and school leaders to work in the most challenging schools. . ""It doesn't appear to be the game-changer we hoped it would be,"" said NAHT director of policy, James Bowen. ""It appears to us that everything that was in the existing framework is still there and new things have been added as well. ""In a sense, its like a rearrangement of furniture. So there will still be enormous pressure on school leaders and schools under this new framework."" A consultation on the proposals will run until 4 April.,external Ofsted to switch from exam results focus Some 'outstanding schools not that good' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Statue's face 'too friendly for Satan',"A mock-up of the sculpture, which has yet to be installed A planned sculpture of Satan in the Spanish city of Segovia has been criticised for being too jolly. The bronze statue was created as a tribute to a local legend, which says that the devil was tricked into building the city's famous aqueduct. But residents say that the devil - who is smiling and taking a selfie with a smartphone - looks too friendly. The artist told BBC News he was surprised by the level of criticism directed at his artwork. A judge has now ordered the artwork to be put on hold while he looks into whether it is offensive to Christians. Satanic Temple sues makers of TV series More than 5,400 people - just over 10% of the city's population - havesigned a petition,externalcalling for the sculpture to be cancelled. The petition says that because the devil is shown in a ""jovial"" way, with a phone in his hand, it ""exalts evil"" and is therefore ""offensive to Catholics"". Residents say that Satan's face should not appear so friendly It adds that Satan is supposed to be ""repulsive and despicable - not kind and seductive, like that of the 'good-natured devil' without malice"" that has been proposed. But the row has taken the artist, JosÃ© Antonio Abella, by surprise. ""It seems to me incredible that people would be so fiercely against the sculpture of a devil to commemorate a popular legend, taught to Segovian kids at school,"" Mr Abella, a former doctor who has taken up art in his retirement, told BBC News. ""I love Segovia. I have lived here for three decades and I was hoping for this sculpture to be a form of demonstration of how thankful I am to Segovia for being my adopted town. ""I haven't received any money whatsoever for this sculpture... I haven't done this for the money but as a personal tribute to the city I call mine. You can imagine how I feel."" City Councillor Claudia de Santos has also called the campaign ""unfair and disheartening"". She told El Pais newspaper that she would try to ensure that the sculpture goes ahead as planned.

'Game changer' liver transplant approved,"The normothermic perfusion machine pumps oxygenated blood and nutrients into livers outside the body A new procedure for storing livers donated for transplant has been hailed a ""game changer"" and approved for use on the NHS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) say perfusion machines could increase the number of livers that can be safely used for transplantation. They store donated livers at body temperature, which slows the deterioration of the organ. Usually donor livers are kept on ice. This can cause damage to the liver and limit how long it can be stored. About 20% of patients die while waiting for a liver transplant and about a third of donated livers are unable to be used for transplantation. These could include livers taken from elderly people or those in poor health and those damaged while the organ was removed from the donor's body or while being kept in ice. The perfusion machine allows the liver to recover from any damage and it can be flushed with blood at body temperature and given oxygen, medications and nutrients allowing its viability and function to be assessed. This could mean that livers that might have previously been considered unsuitable can be used safely. The machines can also extend how long the liver can be stored to allow more flexibility in the timing of the transplant operation. Keeping livers 'alive' boosts transplant success 'Warmed liver' transplant first Prof Kevin Harris, at NICE, said: ""It offers another way of preserving the liver and assessing whether livers which might have previously been considered unsuitable can be used safely. ""By using this procedure, more patients on the organ transplant waiting list could be offered a chance of a transplant and thereby potentially extending their lives."" Darius Mirza, professor of transplant surgery at University Hospitals Birmingham, said the machine was a ""game changer"". ""In the 30 years I've been involved with transplantation, there have been three or four events which have been game changers and I'm absolutely certain we are looking at a game changer that will change the way we practise organ storage and transplantation."" Liver perfusion is currently performed on the NHS in a small number of specialist centres in the UK. ""I signed up for the trial not knowing I would be one of the first to have this procedure in the country. Before my transplant I was very ill. I was losing weight, I couldn't sleep and my quality of life was quite low. ""I had a transplant after the hospital found a donor who was a match. The liver was kept alive using this procedure overnight and I was able to have the operation the following day. Nine days later I was back home. ""Having a transplant has changed my life. I've joined the gym, got fit and gone back to work and did some voluntary work for the Staffordshire Search and Rescue team and I also compete nationally and internationally in the Transplant Games as a member of the Team GB transplant team.

""It is an exciting development that has the potential to shorten waiting list times and reduce mortality rates from advanced liver disease,"" she said. ""After transplant, the vast majority of people go on to lead full and healthy lives and it is truly amazing to see the transformation."" For the year2017-18,external, there were 1,043 liver transplants in the UK and 359 patients on the UK active transplant list. The latest evidence from trialsreviewed by a NICE committee concluded that the procedure ""worked well and was safe to be offered to patients who had been fully informed of the risks and benefits"".

Wales has 'highest imprisonment rate',"Wales has the highest imprisonment rate in western Europe, new research has claimed. The Wales Governance Centre's analysis of official figures also reveals average custody rates are higher than in England for a number of different groups and offences. In particular, non-white Welsh prisoners are overrepresented in prison. Report author Dr Robert Jones said this was a major cause of concern. ""Equally disturbing is that such an alarming trend has emerged in Wales without detection,"" his report concluded. ""This undoubtedly calls into question the role being played by UK justice agencies in Wales as well as civil society organisations and academic researchers."" This is the first time Wales has been analysed separately and Dr Jones said wider research was now needed. Sentencing figures show there were 154 prisoners for every 100,000 people in Wales, a higher proportion than England - which has the second-highest imprisonment rate. More people were being jailed in Wales despite a lower crime rate than in England every year between 2013 and 2017. The Sentencing Council downplayed the likelihood that meaningful differences exist between England and Walesin their recent evidence,externalto theCommission on Justice in Wales,,externalsaying guidelines ""ensure a consistency of approach"" regardless of location. But Dr Jones, who is based at Cardiff University, said this was an area that could no longer be disregarded. An average rate for the prison population in western European countries shows England, Scotland and Wales at the top The report also shows: The total number of prison sentences handed out in England dropped by 16% between 2010 and 2017; at the same time they rose by 0.3% in Wales Immediate custodial sentences imposed by magistrates rose by 12% in Wales. Women in Wales are more likely to receive short-term custodial sentences than men, with 78.6% jailed for less than 12 months, compared with 67% of men. White offenders in Wales were given the lowest average immediate custodial sentence length in 2017 (13.2 months), while black offenders recorded the highest average sentence length (21.5 months), followed by Asian (19 months) and mixed race (17.7 months). But Wales handed out shorter sentences to offenders than in England, with the average prison sentence being 13.4 months, compared with 17.2 months in England in 2017. And a higher percentage of sentences of four years or more were also handed out in England. Dr Jones added: ""Gradually, a detailed picture is emerging of the justice system in Wales and how it is quite different to that of England. ""A thorough debate is needed on why these kinds of sentencing and custodial patterns occur in Wales and whether these are the outcomes that the UK and Welsh governments want to see from the criminal justice system."" The researchers obtained the figures from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) under the Freedom of Information Act. A spokesperson for the MoJ said prison would ""continue to be the best place for serious offenders"". They said: ""As we have said previously, the prison population is too high and we are exploring potential alternatives to custody - such as reducing the number of ineffective short sentences which provide little opportunity to rehabilitate offenders and fail to tackle reoffending."" New prisons will have no bars on the windows Prisons: Why are they in such a state? Ministers consider ending shorter jail terms Katy Hanson, managing director of Welch & Co, who works as a duty solicitor in Pembrokeshire, said: ""Every court, wherever you are, has its own way of doing things and to a certain extent there are always going to be discrepancies, but I am surprised by these statistics. ""Courts do hand out shorter sentences and perhaps don't suspend sentences when they could. ""It's interesting that this has been released at a time when the government is looking at whether there's merit in scrapping short sentences. There's a lot of evidence that short-term sentences don't do that much to deter people offending."" She also questioned whether courts have fewer sentencing options. ""It feels as though probation have more courses and assistance available to those on probation in England, possibly because there are more defendants, so resources are being put there. ""That might make a difference because the courts there feel more can be done to assist people and prevent them reoffending."" Jane Hutt AM, deputy minister with a responsibility for crime and justice policy, said the report was very timely and would influence the Welsh Government's future work around offending, including a ""distinct and different justice system"" for female and youth offenders. ""Whilst justice remains a non-devolved function, work is under way to get the best possible solution for Wales,"" she added.

Sturgeon wants new referendum,"This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon said the prime minister had suffered a defeat of historic proportions Scotland's first minister has said another referendum on Brexit is now the ""only credible option"" after MPs rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking after MPs voted by 432 to 202 against the deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU on 29 March. Labour immediately lodged a vote of no confidence in Mrs May's government following the defeat. Ms Sturgeon is due in London to meet SNP MPs ahead of the confidence vote. She said it was time to ""stop the clock"" on Brexit and ""put this issue back to the electorate"". But Mrs May has signalled her intention to carry on despite suffering the largest defeat for any sitting UK government in history, and has offered cross-party talks in a bid to find a way forward from the current stalemate if she wins the no confidence vote on Wednesday. In a statement released immediately after the vote, the prime minister said: ""The House has spoken and this government will listen."" PMâs Brexit deal rejected by 230 votes Live reaction to May's defeat How did Scottish MPs vote? Ms Sturgeon, whose SNP MPs voted against Mrs May's deal, confirmed her party would back the no confidence motion - which Labour hopes will spark a general election. And she said the ""historic"" scale of the defeat for the prime minister meant the country has now ""reached the point where it would be unconscionable to kick the can any further down the road."" Ms Sturgeon added: ""What must happen now is clear. Firstly, and most urgently, the clock must be stopped on the Article 50 process. This is the only way to avoid any possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU on 29 March without a deal. ""Secondly, legislation must be brought forward to put this issue back to the electorate in another referendum. ""The government has had more than two and a half years to deliver a workable Brexit plan and it has completely failed to do so. The notion that it can do so now in a matter of weeks is farcical."" This video can not be played The prime minister's Brexit deal is backed by 202 MPs but 432  vote against. Ms Sturgeon said another EU referendum with Remain as an option was now the ""only credible option to avoid untold damage to the economy and the prospects of future generations"". And she said it was ""also the only option, within the UK, that would allow Scotland's democratic wish to remain in Europe to be respected"". Mrs May spoke to Ms Sturgeon on the phone late on Tuesday evening as the prime minister started to reach out to other parties. In a post on Twitter following their conversation, Ms Sturgeon said it was ""not obvious that she [Mrs May] has any real idea what to do next"". Allow Twitter content?

The 35 SNP MPs were joined by every Scottish Labour and Liberal Democrat MP in rejecting the deal, as well as three Scottish Conservatives - John Lamont, Ross Thomson and Douglas Ross. But it was backed by the other 10 Scottish Conservatives, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Lamont, Mr Thomson and Mr Ross are expected to back the prime minister in the no confidence vote - as are the vast majority of the 115 other Conservative rebels and the DUP, which strongly opposes Mrs May's Brexit deal but says it wants a change of policy rather than a change of government. Responding to the Commons vote, Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird said the prime minister had now lost all authority, and that there was now a ""clear need for a general election to break the deadlock"". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who backs another referendum on Brexit, said the ""historic and devastating defeat"" for the prime minister meant her deal and her credibility were now in tatters. But the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, said the prime minister's proposals were the ""only substantial deal on the table"" that would ""avoid No Deal and deliver an orderly Brexit"". Mr Carlaw also challenged Mrs May's opponents to ""set out, quite specifically, how their own alternatives might work, how they would respect the referendum, and how they will secure a majority in parliament"". The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said he regretted the outcome of the vote and has urged the UK government to ""clarify its intentions with respect to its next steps as soon as possible"". By the BBC's head of political research Peter Barnes Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years. The next one is due in 2022. But a vote of no confidence lets MPs vote on whether they want the government to continue. The motion must be worded: ""That this House has no confidence in HM Government."" If a majority of MPs vote for the motion then it starts a 14-day countdown. If during that time the current government or any other alternative government cannot win a new vote of confidence, then an early general election would be called. That election cannot happen for at least 25 working days.

What are the biggest defeats?,"Theresa May's Brexit deal has been rejected in the House of Commons by 230 votes. Reality Check has been looking back at some of the biggest government defeats. Defeats in the order of 100-plus votes are very rare. The three biggest government losses, according to the Institute for Government think tank, all occurred in 1924 when the minority Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald was defeated by margins of 166, 161 and 140. The defeats of 166 and 161 votes both occurred on 8 October 1924 and related to the response to the government's decision to drop criminal proceedings against John Ross Campbell, editor of the Communist newspaper Workers' Weekly. A few weeks afterwards, a general election was held - following a motion of no confidence in the government. That election saw the Conservatives gain more than 150 seats with Stanley Baldwin returning to power. The third biggest defeat also happened in 1924 when the government suffered a 140-vote defeat on its Housing Bill on 3 June. Ramsay MacDonald's minority government was defeated by a margin of 166 in 1924 There may be special circumstances around certain votes, so it's not always easy to compare each one - says Alice Lilly from the Institute for Government. Governments, she says, have, on occasion, chosen not to take part in certain votes - meaning the scale of defeat was much larger than it otherwise would have been. For example, in March 1977 Labour lost a vote by 293-0 on public spending cuts to pay for a 1976 loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  In that instance, party managers instructed Labour MPs not to take part. Other votes might be ""free"", meaning that MPs are not put under pressure to vote a certain way by their party leaders. Usually such votes happen on ethical issues that are seen as a matter of conscience, such as the same-sex marriage vote.
