Canada threatens to freeze protesters' bank accounts,"This video can not be played Watch: Justin Trudeau explains why he's taking extreme measures to stop protesters. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken the unprecedented step of invoking the Emergencies Act to crack down on anti-vaccine mandate protests. Mr Trudeau said the scope of the measures would be ""time-limited"", ""reasonable and proportionate"" and would not see the military deployed. With no need for court orders, banks can freeze personal accounts of anyone linked with the protests. Hundreds of demonstrators remain in Canada's capital city. On Sunday, law enforcement cleared anti-mandate protesters at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor - a critical pathway for Canada-US trade - after a week-long stalemate. What began as a rally against a new rule that all truckers must be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border, or quarantine upon return, has grown into a broader challenge to all Covid health restrictions. ""This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting people's jobs,"" Mr Trudeau told a news conference on Monday. He said the police would be given ""more tools"" to imprison or fine protesters and protect critical infrastructure. Mr Trudeau told reporters the legislation would be applied temporarily and in a highly specific manner. Critics have noted that the prime minister voiced support for farmers in India who blocked major highways to New Delhi for a year in 2021, saying at the time: ""Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest."" Mr Trudeau's invoking of the Emergencies Act comes as demonstrations across Canada enter their third week. EXPLAINER:What powers will Emergencies Act give Trudeau? AT THE SCENE:After police raid, what next for Canada protests? Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said at Monday's news conference that banks would be able freeze personal accounts of anyone linked with the protests without any need for a court order. Vehicle insurance of anyone involved with the demonstrations can also be suspended, she added. Ms Freeland said they were broadening Canada's ""Terrorist Financing"" rules to cover cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding platforms, as part of the effort. Anti-vaccine mandate protests have entered their third week ""It's all about following the money,"" she said. She spoke after hackers released details of what they said were 93,000 donations for the truckers totalling $8.4m (Â£6.2m) to the crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo. The Emergencies Act, passed in 1988, requires a high legal bar to be invoked. It may only be used in an ""urgent and critical situation"" that ""seriously endangers the lives, health or safety of Canadians"". Lawful protests do not qualify. Speaking on Monday, Canada's Justice Minister David Lametti argued these conditions had been met. But the Canadian Civil Liberties Association disagreed, warning that the move ""threatens our democracy and our civil liberties"". Ottawa protest leader Tamara Lich dismissed Mr Trudeau's move, telling AP News: ""There are no threats that will frighten us. We will hold the line."" Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a Conservative, said he supported the federal government. But the premiers of Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan said the emergency powers were not needed in their regions. Before Mr Trudeau's announcement, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said invoking the Emergencies Act could ""throw oil on the fire"". Analysis by Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto Under growing pressure to bring the disruptive protests to an end - be it from the White House or increasingly frustrated Canadians - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has entered uncharted territory with the decision to invoke the never-before-used 1988 Emergencies Act, the country's most powerful tool for when it is facing a national emergency. The powers announced by Mr Trudeau go into effect immediately - but his government has to present it to the House of Commons and the Senate within a week and needs a green-light or the proclamation would be revoked. All main Canadian federal political party leaders have said it's time for the protests - which have had an impact on supply chains, the national economy and the country's relations with the US - to end. But they aren't all necessarily on board with Mr Trudeau's unprecedented move. Conservative leader Candice Bergen voiced concern it could inflame the situation. The support of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh may give Mr Trudeau enough votes to pass it through the House - though the Senate could still be a hurdle. Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers? Protests are ongoing in various parts of the country. In Ottawa, the nation's capital, between 400 to 500 trucks have been parked in the city centre for 18 days. Protesters have also been blockading border crossing at Coutts, Alberta, and Emerson, Manitoba.Â On Monday, Alberta police arrested 11 people and seized a cache of guns and other weapons. Weekend protests have also taken place in cities including Toronto and Winnipeg. Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers?

New powers proposed to end unsafe cladding scandal,"Home developers who refuse to pay the costs of removing unsafe cladding could have planning permission and projects blocked under government plans. New powers would also allow cladding companies to be sued and subject to fines for defective products. The proposed measures are part of a Building Safety Bill following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. People who are currently facing bills of thousands of pounds to fix their homes welcomed the move. Housing Secretary Michael Gove said it was ""time to bring this scandal to an end"". ""We cannot allow those who do not take building safety seriously to build homes in the future, and for those not willing to play their part they must face consequences,"" he said. The additions to the bill come after Mr Gove announced last month that no leaseholder living in a building higher than 11m - around four to six storeys high - ""will ever face any costs"" for fixing dangerous cladding. He said developers would be expected to pay their fair share to fix dangerous buildings, or face legal or tax changes. This video can not be played ""We are coming for you"" - Michael Gove's warning to firms that cut corners, sought to profiteer and mis-sold dangerous products Under the proposed laws, leaseholders would have up to 30 years to sue builders and product manufacturers for defects in England, but there are plans to extend it UK wide. At the moment it is six years. The courts would also be able to stop developers using ""shadowy shell companies"", the government said, ""which make them difficult to trace or identify who they are run by, so they can avoid taking responsibility for their actions"". Campaigners said the proposals were the ""most positive step forward we have yet seen in the building safety crisis"", but added ""many questions"" remained over costs for some leaseholders needing to fix fire safety defects other than cladding. ""The penny seems to have dropped with the government that leaseholders are the innocent party and that the polluters who caused this crisis must be the ones to pay to fix it,"" End Our Cladding Scandal said. The questions raised by campaigners emerged after the government said there would be a cap on the amount leaseholders would pay to fix safety defects other than dangerous cladding on blocks of flats. The cap will only apply to leaseholders where building owners do not have the resources to pay to fix any defects. Such costs may include fixing other building defects such as missing fire breaks or defective insulation, as well as fire patrols. Why is cladding unsafe and what is it costing residents? Unsafe cladding firms ordered to pay to fix homes The Department for Housing said the cap would be Â£15,000 for leaseholders in London and Â£10,000 in the rest of England. It confirmed developers that own buildings over 11m will still be required to pay the full costs of remedial works, while landlords linked to a developer and building owners, who are not linked to the developer but can afford to pay in full, will also be required to put up the money. It added any money paid out by leaseholders since the Grenfell Tower fire will count towards the cap amount. The BBC has asked the department how many leaseholders are estimated to come under the cap. The End Our Cladding Scandal campaign group questioned why leaseholders should ""have to pay to fix a problem for which they are in no way responsible?"" ""How is this fair? While these may seem small sums to ministers, they are enormous amounts to many ordinary people across the country - especially coming at a time of pay freezes, food price rises and energy cost hikes,"" it said. Andrew Parker, a partner at Forsters law firm which represents both developers and some leaseholder clients, told the BBC it would take ""many years"" to complete any remediation works. He said there was ""huge clamour"" to make buildings safe, but warned ""it's not going to be straight forward"". ""It's not at all obvious the best way to remediate these buildings,"" he said. ""It's not easy."" Mr Parker said the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire showed there was ""a lot of passing the buck"" between different sectors of the construction industry and there need to be discussions over the best way to make buildings safe. He added the developers his firm represents were on board with making their buildings safe, but questioned why the government had mentioned developers and manufacturers in its plans, but not contractors, engineers and designers who he said were ""equally culpable"". The cladding crisis has left many people with crippling bills to fix unsafe homes and there is still no help for the many buildings under 11m high with dangerous cladding. Removing cladding can cost millions of pounds per block, with the cost often being borne by individual flat owners, under the leasehold system in England and Wales. In the wake of the Grenfell fire, which killed 72 people, flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in hundreds of blocks of flats across the UK. Developers have argued that they met building regulations at the time and should not be liable for the cost of removing unsafe cladding However, some, such as housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, have already promised to foot the bill for issues at their buildings.

The Belfast woman who went to her own wake,"Sharon Jackson was given her prognosis in 2016 ""Instead of sorrow it's a chance for me to have a party and savour life in the moment."" That is how Sharon Jackson described organising her own wake, which she held at the weekend after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. The north Belfast woman said she came up with the idea of an ""awake wake"" after speaking about it to a friend. The event was a ""celebration of life... rather than being dark about the whole situation"", she added. ""Why would I miss something like that? Getting all my friends together in one place,"" she said. Sharon was 53 when she was given her prognosis in 2016. Since then, she has remained focused on the positive side of life and has also organised her funeral arrangements, including decorating her coffin with photographs of family and friends. Speaking before the event, Sharon said: ""It'll be a knees up with good memories and me being present in the moment for it. Sharon wanted to be present and share good memories at her wake ""I've asked friends to write obituaries which are to be funny, dark, and sarcastic.  They've all agreed to that and they'll be read out on the night. ""On the night there will be no goodbyes.  It's too upsetting.  I want friends to leave on a note of laughter."" On Saturday night it was her chance to have a final party with those loved ones. The following morning she described the wake as ""epic"". ""It was filled with joy, humour, love, and everything I expected,"" she said. ""We played music until 02:00."" Sharon was upbeat and keen to pass on a message to others who have terminal cancer. ""Celebrate life. Don't let cancer dictate to you that it's the end,"" she said. ""The worst thing that you can possibly do is to go down that dark hole of depression, thinking your life is over. ""It's not. You can have that party - celebrate with family and friends and embrace your life that you've had with them.""

Petrol and diesel prices reach new record high,"Fuel prices have hit a new record high at the pump across the UK, tightening the squeeze on UK consumers, the motoring organisation the AA has said. Over the weekend petrol reached 148.02p a litre, while diesel hit a new record high of 151.57p a litre last Thursday. Fuel previously hit a record in November, before wholesale and retail prices fell back. ""The cost of living crisis has been ratcheted up yet another notch,"" said Luke Bosdet of the AA. The RAC's fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the price of filling a 55-litre family car was now an ""eye-watering"" Â£81.41. ""With the oil price teetering on the brink of $100 a barrel and retailers keen to pass on the increase in wholesale fuel quickly, new records could now be set on a daily basis in the coming weeks,"" he said. Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Are we paying too much at the pump? Fuel prices at the pump are driven largely by the wholesale price of energy which has shot up due to tensions over whether Russia will invade Ukraine. On Monday, oil prices hit their highest level since 2014, reaching $95.56 a barrel. If the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, oil and gas supplies from Russia to Europe may be interrupted, pushing up wholesale prices further. The supply of oil and gas has already struggled to keep up with growing demand as the global economy picked up in recent months as Covid restrictions eased. The RAC's Mr Williams said: ""On a positive note, retailer margins - which were the reason drivers paid overly high prices in December and January - have now returned to more normal levels of around 7p a litre."" He said the big four supermarkets, which dominate fuel sales, should ""play fair"" with drivers by keeping their profit margins low. Day-to-day prices for food, household bills and other items such as used cars, have risen sharply in recent months, in part due to rising energy prices. The Petrol Retailers' Association (PRA), which represents independent retailers, said it would continue to ensure that the price of fuel was ""as competitive as possible"". But tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as other key factors such as tightness in the oil market and the dollar-sterling exchange rate, were likely to cause further volatility in the oil price, said Gordon Balmer, PRA's executive director. UK inflation is now at a 30-year high of 5.4%. New inflation figures for January will be released by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday. Mr Bosdet said the AA had surveyed 15,000 of its members after prices spiked at the end of last year and found higher fuel prices were leading 43% of them to cut back on the amount they used their car as well as other areas of spending. Mike Johnson at the energy consultancy Portland Analytics said what happens to energy prices next depended both on the situation in Ukraine and whether the Organisation of Petrol Exporting Countries (Opec) was able to boost supply. ""Opec and its allies have struggled to increase production in line with their output targets due to a combination of production outages and technical issues, whilst demand continues to rise,"" he said. While oil producing nations had agreed to increase production by 400,000 barrels per day in February Mr Johnson said it seemed unlikely that target would be met. Why are petrol prices going back up?

"Some officers are racist, Met Police boss admits","This video can not be played Racism is a problem in the Met Police, deputy assistant commissioner Bas Javid tells BBC Newsnight. A senior officer has admitted racism remains a problem in the Metropolitan Police, after two black colleagues told the BBC it was getting worse. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid told BBC Two's Newsnight some officers ""have racist views and are racist"". But he denied the Met was a ""racist organisation"". One officer said a supervisor used a racist slur against him. Another said senior leaders suggested black people were not clever enough for the Met. Warning: This report contains offensive language Mr Javid, who is the brother of Health Secretary Sajid Javid, said he was ""extremely disappointed"" to hear the allegations from the black officers - which include claims that the Met is failing to deal with complaints of racism and putting pressure on victims. He said: ""The fact that you've had officers or staff come to you to make allegations, what I'd like to see is an organisation where people feel comfortable to come forward and report it so we can deal with it effectively."" Why is it so hard to fix the Metâs toxic culture? Misogyny, racism and bullying found in Met ranks Met Police Federation has 'no faith' in Sadiq Khan The culture of London's Metropolitan Police force has come under close scrutiny, with Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick resigning after London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was not satisfied with her response to the scale of the cultural change required. Among his concerns were the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer last year, and a report into abusive behaviour at Charing Cross police station published earlier this month. It found that, between 2016 and 2018, officers shared messages that were highly sexualised, violent and discriminatory against women, ethnic minorities, LGBT people and disabled people - which they defended as ""banter"". The two black officers interviewed by Newsnight said there needed to be changes among the Met's senior leadership to root out racism and misogyny. One said some senior leaders refused to admit there were issues with discrimination, while the other suggested the next commissioner should be recruited from outside the force. Dame Cressida Dick resigned after London Mayor Sadiq Khan said she needed to do more to root out discrimination in the Met Mr Javid ruled himself out as a possible successor to Dame Cressida and said it would be for the mayor and home secretary to decide if the next commissioner should be someone from an ethnic minority. Asked if he accepted racism was a problem in the Met, he said: ""Yes, I do."" He added: ""What I would say is, there are people who have racist views and are racist and they are in policing. But what I won't do is describe the organisation as a racist organisation."" Mr Javid, who is responsible for professional standards, said there was ""absolutely no room for racism in policing, especially here in the Metropolitan Police"". ""If people are found to be racist or discriminatory in any way, then I will do absolutely everything I can to make sure they're removed from the police,"" he said. But one of the officers who spoke to the BBC said racism within the force had got worse and officers accused of discrimination did not face adequate sanctions. When he raised a complaint, he said the Met Police ""put more pressure on the victim than the accused"". He said he felt like he was the one who had to move departments, while the accused stayed in the same job. ""There shouldn't be any other option than for them to lose their job,"" he said. ""Until that changes, I don't think much will change in the Met."" He said a supervisor had referred to him as a monkey, ""one of the most derogatory terms that someone could ever refer to you as a black person"". ""It's hurtful and disgusting,"" he said. The officer also said he had been victimised based on the way he speaks, and colleagues had called him a drug dealer or gang member. The second officer, a black woman in a senior role, said working in the Met Police was ""incredibly traumatic"" for black officers because of the discrimination they faced. She said it was common for people of colour to be undermined and humiliated in meetings. In a recruitment meeting, senior leaders said black and Asian people were not joining the Met because they were not clever enough, she said. Both officers said things could not change in the Met Police unless there was a recognition of racism and misogyny in the force. ""I'm not convinced things will change,"" the male officer said. ""Things will remain the same until there are a group of top rank bosses who are replaced, in my opinion - the bosses who refused to admit there are issues in the Met."" The female police officer said the next Met Commissioner should be recruited from outside the force. ""Everyone who Cressida surrounded herself with were people who mirrored what she believed. You need an outsider,"" she said. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Janet Hills - who from 2013 to 2021 served as head of the Met's Black Police Association - said the force needed a ""consistent approach and zero tolerance towards people that are racist within policing"". She added that staff found to have committed misconduct or racist behaviour should face dismissal.

Two green freeports to be established in Scotland,"The Scottish and UK governments have agreed to establish two green freeports in Scotland. The special economic zones, offering tax breaks and lower business tariffs, are being promoted by the UK government as part of its ""levelling-up"" agenda. The Scottish Greens, the SNP's Scottish government partners, criticised the plans as ""greenwashing"" and said it was a ""corporate giveaway"". The deal comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson visits Scotland. A bidding process will begin in the spring and it is hoped the new sites will open in 2023. Green commitment demanded in freeport talks What are freeports and where will they be? Ministers from both the Scottish and UK governments will have a say in the assessment and selection process. The governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border,after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later saidthey would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. Freeports allow firms to import goods and then re-export them outside normal tax and customs rules Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said: ""We have been able to reach an agreement on a joint approach that enshrines the Scottish government's commitment to achieving net zero and embedding fair work practices through public investment. ""The establishment of green freeports will help us create new green jobs, deliver a just transition and support our economic transformation."" The UK government has committed funding of Â£52m to the project and bidders will have to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. However, in the first major split from the SNP since they signed a power-sharing deal last year, the Scottish Greens criticised the plans as ""greenwashing"". Finance spokesman Ross Greer toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme that his party wanted nothing to do with ""these so-called green freeports"". He said: ""There is nothing genuinely green about them. Freeports are a really effective way to give tax relief and throw public money at multinational companies who are already doing their best to avoid tax. ""The SNP used to oppose freeports for exactly the same reason the Scottish Greens still do. ""Internationally, freeports are associated with crime, money laundering, smuggling, low wages."" Mr Greer said that there was ""no actual solid requirements"" to meet climate targets or stick to fair work practices, and that it was ""naive"" to expect large corporations to adhere to these rules. The Prime Minister visited Rosyth dockyard in Fife Kate Forbes told BBC Scotland that all green freeport applicants would have to stick to their commitments to net zero targets and fair work. She said: ""If a bidder fails to do so, we would look at this very carefully. We would expect bidders who set out promises to meet those promises. ""They will be required to deliver robust decarbonisation plans, demonstrating how they will move to net zero. A bidder will not win without it."" Under the UK government's model, freeports are centred around at least one air, rail or sea port, but can extend up to 28 miles (45km) beyond. Forth Ports - which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland - said it would be bidding to create a Firth of Forth green freeport. While other bidders have not yet been announced, in July last year the Scottish government named nine areas being considered - Shetland, Orkney, Aberdeen with Peterhead, Montrose, Dundee, Cairnryan, the Firth of Forth and Glasgow city region. A Cromarty Firth consortium is also understood to be interested. Freeports are one of Boris Johnson's big ideas to ""level up"" the country. He thinks they'll bring new investment and jobs to areas that lag behind. But he's even had to change their name - they're now ""green freeports"" here - to win backing from the Scottish government. It sounds petty, but the name is the tip of a large iceberg. Why? Imagine what they might create. These low tax zones could give rise to a little Singapore on the Cromarty Firth, where goods can be imported, assembled and exported without the usual taxes and paperwork. Firms inside the freeport could pay lower rates of VAT and employment tax. Nicola Sturgeon's team warns that could give rise to low wage, low value zones, which water down workers' rights and rules which protect the environment. So she's insisted that firms inside green freeports should pay the living wage, and commit to net-zero targets on climate change, and inclusive growth in local communities. You might wonder if this compromise can work. If freeports don't offer incentives, why would employers want to move there at all? If Scottish freeports are regulated more, will they be able to create new jobs, or compete with their English counterparts? The Scottish government wants to avoid a stampede of firms moving into a low-tax zone, without adding anything to the Scottish economy. So it's happy to pour cold water on one of Boris Johnson's dreams. Ian Murray, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, said the agreement had been ""delayed for months because the two governments disagreed over the name. ""As a result of their petty point-scoring, regions in England already have a head start."" The Scottish government and the UK Treasury will use their tax powers, including rates relief, to support the freeports. Last year, the Scottish government said UK ministers risked undermining devolution if they set up the freeports in Scotland or Wales without the backing of devolved governments. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:  ""I am delighted that people across Scotland will reap the benefits that will come from having two new green freeports. ""Freeports will help to accelerate our plan to level up communities across the whole of the United Kingdom. ""They have the power to be truly transformational by creating jobs and investment opportunities to enable people to reach their potential."" Dundee has previously been suggested as a potential location for a freeport Also called free trade zones, they are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in the zone pay lower taxes, such as reduced VAT and lower rates of employment tax. Critics argue they simply defer the point when import tariffs are paid, which then still need to be paid at some stage. Will freeports help the economy? Mr Johnson began his trip to Scotland on Monday with a visit to Rosyth dockyard in Fife. He is not expected to meet Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross - who has called for him to stand down over parties held in Downing Street during lockdown - despite Mr Johnson beinginvited to address the Scottish Conservative conferencein Aberdeen next month. On his visit, Mr Johnson said he was ""working very hard with colleagues in Scotland"" on a joint agenda of ""uniting and levelling up"".

Trudeau invokes Emergencies Act for the first time,"This video can not be played Watch: Justin Trudeau explains why he's taking extreme measures to stop protesters. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken the unprecedented step of invoking the Emergencies Act to crack down on anti-vaccine mandate protests. Mr Trudeau said the scope of the measures would be ""time-limited"", ""reasonable and proportionate"" and would not see the military deployed. With no need for court orders, banks can freeze personal accounts of anyone linked with the protests. Hundreds of demonstrators remain in Canada's capital city. On Sunday, law enforcement cleared anti-mandate protesters at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor - a critical pathway for Canada-US trade - after a week-long stalemate. What began as a rally against a new rule that all truckers must be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border, or quarantine upon return, has grown into a broader challenge to all Covid health restrictions. ""This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting people's jobs,"" Mr Trudeau told a news conference on Monday. He said the police would be given ""more tools"" to imprison or fine protesters and protect critical infrastructure. Mr Trudeau told reporters the legislation would be applied temporarily and in a highly specific manner. Critics have noted that the prime minister voiced support for farmers in India who blocked major highways to New Delhi for a year in 2021, saying at the time: ""Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest."" Mr Trudeau's invoking of the Emergencies Act comes as demonstrations across Canada enter their third week. EXPLAINER:What powers will Emergencies Act give Trudeau? AT THE SCENE:After police raid, what next for Canada protests? Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said at Monday's news conference that banks would be able freeze personal accounts of anyone linked with the protests without any need for a court order. Vehicle insurance of anyone involved with the demonstrations can also be suspended, she added. Ms Freeland said they were broadening Canada's ""Terrorist Financing"" rules to cover cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding platforms, as part of the effort. Anti-vaccine mandate protests have entered their third week ""It's all about following the money,"" she said. She spoke after hackers released details of what they said were 93,000 donations for the truckers totalling $8.4m (Â£6.2m) to the crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo. The Emergencies Act, passed in 1988, requires a high legal bar to be invoked. It may only be used in an ""urgent and critical situation"" that ""seriously endangers the lives, health or safety of Canadians"". Lawful protests do not qualify. Speaking on Monday, Canada's Justice Minister David Lametti argued these conditions had been met. But the Canadian Civil Liberties Association disagreed, warning that the move ""threatens our democracy and our civil liberties"". Ottawa protest leader Tamara Lich dismissed Mr Trudeau's move, telling AP News: ""There are no threats that will frighten us. We will hold the line."" Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a Conservative, said he supported the federal government. But the premiers of Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan said the emergency powers were not needed in their regions. Before Mr Trudeau's announcement, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said invoking the Emergencies Act could ""throw oil on the fire"". Analysis by Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto Under growing pressure to bring the disruptive protests to an end - be it from the White House or increasingly frustrated Canadians - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has entered uncharted territory with the decision to invoke the never-before-used 1988 Emergencies Act, the country's most powerful tool for when it is facing a national emergency. The powers announced by Mr Trudeau go into effect immediately - but his government has to present it to the House of Commons and the Senate within a week and needs a green-light or the proclamation would be revoked. All main Canadian federal political party leaders have said it's time for the protests - which have had an impact on supply chains, the national economy and the country's relations with the US - to end. But they aren't all necessarily on board with Mr Trudeau's unprecedented move. Conservative leader Candice Bergen voiced concern it could inflame the situation. The support of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh may give Mr Trudeau enough votes to pass it through the House - though the Senate could still be a hurdle. Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers? Protests are ongoing in various parts of the country. In Ottawa, the nation's capital, between 400 to 500 trucks have been parked in the city centre for 18 days. Protesters have also been blockading border crossing at Coutts, Alberta, and Emerson, Manitoba.Â On Monday, Alberta police arrested 11 people and seized a cache of guns and other weapons. Weekend protests have also taken place in cities including Toronto and Winnipeg. Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers?

"Post Office scandal ruined lives, inquiry hears","Baljit Sethi, pictured here with his wife Anjana, was the first witness to speak at the inquiry The Post Office scandal that saw sub-postmasters wrongly convicted for fraud has ruined lives, a top lawyer has said. Barrister Jason Beer QC said former sub-postmasters and mistresses' stories should be at the heart of an inquiry. ""Lives were ruined, families torn apart, families were made homeless or destitute,"" he said. The cases constitute the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. Between 2000 and 2014, more than 700 sub-postmasters were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting due to a flaw in the Horizon accounting IT system. The inquiry - which is expected to run for the rest of this year - will look at whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system and will also ask how staff shouldered the blame. A total of 72 former sub-postmasters have had their names cleared so far. In his opening remarks, Sir Wyn Williams, the retired High Court judge who is leading the inquiry, expressed thanks to the 50 to 60 witnesses he expects to hear oral evidence from in the coming weeks. Sir Wyn said he sought to understand ""the scale and nature of the harm"" done to so many. ""These hearings would not be taking place at all were it not for the witnesses who have agreed to give up their valuable time to publicly relive what must be very distressing memories and events."" This video can not be played Watch: Tracy Felstead was sent to Holloway Prison for a crime she didn't commit Baljit Sethi was the first witness to give evidence on Monday. He had told the BBC beforehand he was looking forward to it. During his session, he described his long career spanning two decades, during which he ran two branches near Romford in Essex with his wife Anjana successfully using paper accounts. After Horizon was introduced, one branch had no problems at all, but the second one showed a hole in the accounts of Â£17,000, which they were asked to cover out of their own pocket. The Sethis were never charged, but still faced a financial and emotional nightmare. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? 'I want someone else jailed like I was' Listen: The Great Post Office Trial Mr Sethi said he tried to communicate with the head office in Chelmsford, Essex, after noticing a problem with the system. He broke down in tears and went on to say: ""I was the only man who ran the Post Office seven days a week. ""I used to open it at 8am and shut at 8pm. I was the only Post Office in the country running all seven days. ""I knew there was something wrong with the system but no-one wanted to know that,"" he added. ""We didn't take a single penny from the Post Office our entire life."" Mr Sethi has also told the BBC previously that the scandal meant he felt he was unable to be a good parent to his two sons and daughter. His son Amit said ahead of the session: ""I want accountability and those who suffered should be compensated appropriately. ""That's it - then we'll draw a line under it."" The judge will hear evidence on why sub-postmasters and postmistresses were singled out and whether they have been justly compensated, as well as analysing at least 100 written statements. Jason Beer QC said families had been ""torn apart"" because of the Post Office scandal Mr Beer, the counsel to the inquiry, pointed out that some former sub-postmasters had passed away before it started. ""It is about people whose mental and physical health has been impacted, people whose marriages and partnerships have deteriorated or failed, about people who have thought about taking their own lives and in some cases took their own lives,"" he said. The inquiry will also examine whether staff at software firm Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon software to complete tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking, knew the system had flaws while data from it was used in court to convict sub-postmasters. Evidence will be heard from witnesses in Leeds and Cardiff over the coming weeks. ""I cannot stress enough the importance of me understanding the scale and nature of the harm which has bee caused to so many individuals,"" Sir Wyn said.

Remaining Covid rules removed in Northern Ireland,"The regulations that are currently in place will become guidance on Tuesday All remaining Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland will be lifted, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced. A small number of restrictions are currently in place, including the wearing of face coverings and the use of Covid certification in nightclubs. Mr Swann said those remaining measures ""should no longer be set out in regulations"" and instead will be put in guidance issued to the public. He said he would be making an order on Tuesday to revoke the remaining rules. Remaining restrictions include: Requirements to wear face coverings in public places Business owners having measures in place to limit transmission of the virus The use of Covid certification at nightclubs and large unseated indoor events Limits on numbers meeting indoors in private homes Measures which had previously been guidance rather than law, such as working from home where possible, have not been changed. While in England there is a legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for Covid-19, in Northern Ireland this falls under ""very strong guidance"". Mr Swann said: ""This does not mean that Covid-19 has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm. ""It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others."" The health minister said it was important to retain the ability to reintroduce restrictions again in case of urgent need. As a result he said he will seek to extend the powers granted to the Department of Health by the Coronavirus Act 2020 by six months. Mr Swann confirmed on Sunday afternoon that he has tested positive for Covid-19 but he is carrying out his duties remotely Mr Swann had written to his ministerial colleagues asking for their views on removing remaining restrictions. The executive collapsed earlier in February but individual ministers are still in place. They can take some decisions, as long as the issues are not deemed ""significant or controversial"". Why are ministers still in place despite collapse? Swann waits for legal advice to remove restrictions Swann 'has authority' to lift Covid restrictions What are NI's Covid rules after new relaxations? Mr Swann's letter to other ministers, seen by the BBC, said government lawyers had told him relaxing Covid rules would fall into this category. He said the lawyers suggested he could therefore not remove the rules by himself, under the terms of Stormont's ministerial code. The full executive cannot meet becausePaul Givan resigned as first minister, forcing the resignation of Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill because of the joint nature of the office. The move was part of an ongoing protest by Mr Givan's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) against the Northern Ireland Protocol. Covid-passports in some settings are among the remaining Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland Mr Swann's letter to the ministers who remain in place was an attempt to gain wider approval to relax restrictions in the absence of the full executive. The current Covid 19 regulations would have been in place until 24 March, when the legislation underpinning them expired. It is understood ministers from the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in, SDLP and Alliance all supported Mr Swann - who is a member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) - and confirmed their positions. Hospitality Ulster welcomed Mr Swann's announcement. ""After nearly two long years, the hospitality industry will be relieved that they can begin to trade without pandemic restrictions limiting the viability of their businesses,"" the group's chief executive Colin Neill said. Retail NI said it was ""fantastic news for our members and the wider business community"". ""However, we are disappointed that the statement does not include a clear commitment to return to the workplace,"" said Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts. ""Safely reopening offices and workplaces is not only vital to boost footfall for our high streets, but also for our economy and returning our society to normal."" On Monday,two more Covid-related deaths were announced in Northern Irelandalong with 2,465 cases. There are currently 437 patients with the virus in hospital.

way to judge whether Russia's troop withdrawal is real is to watch
what happens over the next few days in Belarus, where Moscow and Minsk are currently conducting joint military drills. Russia
moved thousands of troops to Belarus from Siberia and the Far East for the exercises. The units include fighter jets, air defence systems, and some of Russia's most experienced paratroopers and marines. Those joint drills are due to finish on 20 February. If Russia withdraws its troops after that, it could be a sign that Moscow is serious about reducing its military build-up around Ukraine's borders. Away from the politicking, we've got a Eurovision Song Contest development to bring you. Alina Pash, Ukraine's Eurovision singer, has been ""suspended"" from competing at May's competition in Turin. Ukraine's national broadcaster UA:PBC took the actionafter it was revealed that authorities are investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. There are strict travel rules in place over how people enter Crimea. It's not illegal for Ukrainians to visit but it can be frowned upon. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that's now being scrutinised. While investigations continue, Alina says some people claim she's un-Ukrainian. ""I'm a Ukrainian girl. I'm talking in Ukrainian and my song is about Ukraine,"" she explains. We've now got some details of the phone call held between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. A statement from the foreign ministry in Moscow says Lavrov stressed the need for ""pragmatic dialogue over the entire range of issues raised by Russia"". He also told Blinken that ""aggressive rhetoric"" inflated by Washington was unacceptable. But said it was necessary to continue ""joint work"". Websites including the Ukrainian defence ministry and the banks PrivatBank and OshadBank have been subject to a cyber-attack, the Russia's Tass news agency reports. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre has said Russia could be to blame for the attack, according to Tass. The website of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has also been affected, the Unian news agency reports. Ukrainian websites have been affected by cyber-attacks before with Russia denying any involvement. Helen CattBBC political correspondent UK MPs have been briefed by the Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace this afternoon on the current situation around Russia and
Ukraine. It's understood he repeated the government's
assessment that it was not convinced Russia was standing down despite reports
of troops moving away That's because he said there had been an
uptick in other activity such as stepping up the preparedness of field
hospitals. He apparently warned that, while Russia
could launch an invasion within hours, it wasn't beyond the realms of possibility
that the current situation continues for weeks or months. He's also said to have told them that he
believes that President Putin has still not decided whether to launch an
invasion or not. Wallace is also said to have confirmed that UK troops who were involved in
training in Ukraine are now back in the UK. The UK should ""not believe anything that's coming out of Moscow"", the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Earlier today, Russia said some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine were returning to their bases. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""[Russia] have lied and lied and lied and, surprisingly, are continuing to lie."" Addressing whether Russia would invade Ukraine, he said:
""Only one person knows and he ain't speaking. And that's Vladimir
Putin. We're dealing with a one-man band here."" Tugendhat says Russia's foreign ministry is ""simply
the barking dog outside the house of a mafia don... It's just there to make a
noise"". Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian, Kyiv ""When I see Maxar [satellite] imagery prove the Russian troops' withdrawal, I will believe,"" says mother-of-three Alina Fediai-Zyrianska, from her home in a suburb of Kyiv. Her family were planning to launch a new business this month. But that has been put on hold because of their growing fears of war. Alina is critical of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but her feelings about the news of Russia withdrawing echo the reaction from authorities there. Mykhailo Podoliak, from the president's office, tells the BBC that state bodies need to assess the scale of the withdrawal in order to confirm if the situation is ""getting back to normal"". Yesterday, Zelensky published yet another video to reassure the nation and call for unity. Such messages are welcomed by his supporters, but some are keen to stress that a grassroots resistance is being formed, regardless of any official statements. Alina says the president's address didn't lift her spirits. Instead, she keeps tracking website FlightRadar open - watching American drones and British planes fly over Ukraine's borders has a soothing effect, she says. This video can not be played We heard earlier from UK PM Boris Johnson, who said tough sanctions were ready to go if Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a ""very tough line on sanctions"" from the government after today's Cobra meeting. He says this is important so that Russia ""knows there will be serious consequences"" for any action it chooses to take against Ukraine and called on ""allies to stand together in the face of Russian aggression"". He says ""it's not entirely clear what's happening on the border"". More diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine are under way between the US and Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov are on the phone, according to the US state department. We're also hearing that US President Joe Biden will speak on the phone later with France's President Emmanuel Macron. Western military analysts say they need more information
to judge the significance of Russia's movement of some troops back from the Ukrainian border. Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London tells Reuters news agency: One should maintain an air of cautious scepticism. There have been past discrepancies between Russia's official announcements and its actions on the ground.  Many of the Russian forces in Belarus for drills - due to end on Sunday - have come from thousands of miles away in Russia's central and eastern military districts. Rob Lee, a military analyst who specialises in Russia, tells Reuters the announcement was ""potentially good news"" but it was important to see where those forces went after the culmination of joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. As long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice.  Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, tells Reuters it would take several days to verify the latest moves via satellite imagery. It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

We've now got some details of the phone call held between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. A statement from the foreign ministry in Moscow says Lavrov stressed the need for ""pragmatic dialogue over the entire range of issues raised by Russia"". He also told Blinken that ""aggressive rhetoric"" inflated by Washington was unacceptable. But said it was necessary to continue ""joint work"". Websites including the Ukrainian defence ministry and the banks PrivatBank and OshadBank have been subject to a cyber-attack, the Russia's Tass news agency reports. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre has said Russia could be to blame for the attack, according to Tass. The website of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has also been affected, the Unian news agency reports. Ukrainian websites have been affected by cyber-attacks before with Russia denying any involvement. Helen CattBBC political correspondent UK MPs have been briefed by the Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace this afternoon on the current situation around Russia and
Ukraine. It's understood he repeated the government's
assessment that it was not convinced Russia was standing down despite reports
of troops moving away That's because he said there had been an
uptick in other activity such as stepping up the preparedness of field
hospitals. He apparently warned that, while Russia
could launch an invasion within hours, it wasn't beyond the realms of possibility
that the current situation continues for weeks or months. He's also said to have told them that he
believes that President Putin has still not decided whether to launch an
invasion or not. Wallace is also said to have confirmed that UK troops who were involved in
training in Ukraine are now back in the UK. The UK should ""not believe anything that's coming out of Moscow"", the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Earlier today, Russia said some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine were returning to their bases. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""[Russia] have lied and lied and lied and, surprisingly, are continuing to lie."" Addressing whether Russia would invade Ukraine, he said:
""Only one person knows and he ain't speaking. And that's Vladimir
Putin. We're dealing with a one-man band here."" Tugendhat says Russia's foreign ministry is ""simply
the barking dog outside the house of a mafia don... It's just there to make a
noise"". Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian, Kyiv ""When I see Maxar [satellite] imagery prove the Russian troops' withdrawal, I will believe,"" says mother-of-three Alina Fediai-Zyrianska, from her home in a suburb of Kyiv. Her family were planning to launch a new business this month. But that has been put on hold because of their growing fears of war. Alina is critical of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but her feelings about the news of Russia withdrawing echo the reaction from authorities there. Mykhailo Podoliak, from the president's office, tells the BBC that state bodies need to assess the scale of the withdrawal in order to confirm if the situation is ""getting back to normal"". Yesterday, Zelensky published yet another video to reassure the nation and call for unity. Such messages are welcomed by his supporters, but some are keen to stress that a grassroots resistance is being formed, regardless of any official statements. Alina says the president's address didn't lift her spirits. Instead, she keeps tracking website FlightRadar open - watching American drones and British planes fly over Ukraine's borders has a soothing effect, she says. This video can not be played We heard earlier from UK PM Boris Johnson, who said tough sanctions were ready to go if Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a ""very tough line on sanctions"" from the government after today's Cobra meeting. He says this is important so that Russia ""knows there will be serious consequences"" for any action it chooses to take against Ukraine and called on ""allies to stand together in the face of Russian aggression"". He says ""it's not entirely clear what's happening on the border"". More diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine are under way between the US and Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov are on the phone, according to the US state department. We're also hearing that US President Joe Biden will speak on the phone later with France's President Emmanuel Macron. Western military analysts say they need more information
to judge the significance of Russia's movement of some troops back from the Ukrainian border. Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London tells Reuters news agency: One should maintain an air of cautious scepticism. There have been past discrepancies between Russia's official announcements and its actions on the ground.  Many of the Russian forces in Belarus for drills - due to end on Sunday - have come from thousands of miles away in Russia's central and eastern military districts. Rob Lee, a military analyst who specialises in Russia, tells Reuters the announcement was ""potentially good news"" but it was important to see where those forces went after the culmination of joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. As long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice.  Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, tells Reuters it would take several days to verify the latest moves via satellite imagery. It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

Travel shares plunge,"Shares in IAG, owner of British Airways and Iberia, fell as much as 8%. Europe's stock markets closed sharply lower on Monday, but recouped some losses in afternoon trading on hopes of a deal to resolve Ukraine tensions. The FTSE 100 ended 1.7% down, and the main markets in Paris and Frankfurt 2% lower, with travel stocks hard hit. Reports from Russia that talks with the West over Ukraine should continue helped improve investor sentiment. That limited losses on Wall Street, where at lunchtime in New York the Dow Jones was down 0.5% and Nasdaq up 0.7%. According to reports, Sergei Lavrov has suggested to Russia's President Vladimir Putin that diplomatic efforts should continue because there might be a chance of doing a deal. On the FTSE 100, IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, fell 5.6%. Shares in the major banks closed between 4% and 5% down. The biggest loser was London-listed Russian mining company Evraz, which tumbled 29%. The FTSE 100's fall, the worst session in three weeks, followed a fall in Asian stock markets. ""The fact that the door has not been shut to further talks... is a good thing,"" said Patrick O'Hare, at Briefing.com. ""Hence, the negativity seen earlier has dissipated some, yet there is still a major cloud of uncertainty hanging over the market."" Oil initially rose sharply with Brent crude topping $95 (Â£70) per barrel, stoking fresh inflationary worries, although the price has eased back slightly. With oil demand high as global economies emerge from lockdown, there are fears a war or severe sanctions on Russia will cut supplies, sending the price above $100 a barrel, something not seen since 2014. ""Just as the storm of Covid appeared to be receding, the growing expectation of an invasion of Ukraine is the fresh threat now unnerving investors, with confidence plunging in many parts of the world,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter. She added: ""With worries that inflation is already running far too hot, the possibility Russian troops could move across the border has led to another surge in the oil price. Energy markets are clearly on edge and if supplies are threatened there is a risk oil will shoot up even higher."" Analysts at Capital Economics estimate war or sanctions could add to inflation in Europe, forcing central banks to lift interest rates faster and further. ""Over the longer term, whether Russia ends up invading or not, this geopolitical flare-up is likely to speed up the process of Russia's decoupling from the West,"" Capital Economics said in a research note. Moscow has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border but denies any intent to invade. Despite this, more than a dozen countries have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, with the US saying Moscow could begin an attack ""at any time"".

way to judge whether Russia's troop withdrawal is real is to watch
what happens over the next few days in Belarus, where Moscow and Minsk are currently conducting joint military drills. Russia
moved thousands of troops to Belarus from Siberia and the Far East for the exercises. The units include fighter jets, air defence systems, and some of Russia's most experienced paratroopers and marines. Those joint drills are due to finish on 20 February. If Russia withdraws its troops after that, it could be a sign that Moscow is serious about reducing its military build-up around Ukraine's borders. Away from the politicking, we've got a Eurovision Song Contest development to bring you. Alina Pash, Ukraine's Eurovision singer, has been ""suspended"" from competing at May's competition in Turin. Ukraine's national broadcaster UA:PBC took the actionafter it was revealed that authorities are investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. There are strict travel rules in place over how people enter Crimea. It's not illegal for Ukrainians to visit but it can be frowned upon. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that's now being scrutinised. While investigations continue, Alina says some people claim she's un-Ukrainian.

"Russia says diplomatic solution still possibleDiplomacy is ""far from being exhausted"" over Ukraine, Russia's foreign minister tells President Putin.","Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (L) and President Vladimir Putin sat metres apart during the televised meeting Russia has said that a diplomatic solution to its escalating standoff with the West is still possible. In a televised meeting, President Vladimir Putin was told that diplomatic talks had not yet been been exhausted. The comments come after more than a dozen nations urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, and the US said aerial bombardments could begin ""at any time"". Russia has always denied plans to invade Ukraine, despite massing more than 100,000 troops on the border. Separately,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was still time for Russia to ""step back"" from the situation with Ukraine,urging all sides to carry on talking. A statement said Mr Johnson would hold a Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the UK's response to the pressures. LIVE:Russian invasion fears grow as foreigners flee Ukraine EXPLAINER:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? ANALYSIS:Five ways out of conflict ON THE GROUND:A Ukrainian city unifies against Russia's threats During another socially-distanced TV appearanceon Monday, Mr Putin asked his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov if there was a chance to reach an agreement with the West, or whether the diplomacy was ""an attempt to drag us into an endless negotiation process?"" Mr Lavrov replied that the ""possibilities are far from being exhausted, they certainly should not continue indefinitely, but I would suggest continuing and ramping them up"". The comments are being seen as a clear concession that talks could ease the tensions. But analysts say that without either side moving over the thorny issue of Ukraine potentially joining Nato, there is still deadlock. The Kremlin says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join Nato, and has demanded that this be ruled out. Nato's members have rejected this request. Also at the Kremlin meeting - in what some observers see as another possible route to easing tensions - Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Mr Putin that some of the country's military drills near Ukraine's border had already ended and others were coming to a close. Russia is holding massive joint exercises with Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour. Moscow is also staging Navy shooting drills in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov - to the south of Ukraine. In some quarters of the world, President Putin's question would have elicited a collective intake of breath. The Russian President asked his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov whether there was a chance of reaching an agreement on Russia's security concerns or if this was simply endless negotiation. Many would fear what would happen if Mr Lavrov said no. His answer has made some feel slightly more reassured - there is a chance. Throughout the weeks of diplomacy, one of the West's biggest fears is what happens if Russia walks away from the diplomatic table. Politicians have been arriving in sequence in Moscow, creating a metaphorical human chain to keep the diplomatic ball in the air. However, it's still unclear what both sides can agree on to break the deadlock and deescalate the situation. Russia says it wants a guarantee Nato won't allow Ukraine to join the alliance, but Nato won't give in to that. Neither side has moved on this issue so while diplomacy continues, so does the deadlock on a deal. Meanwhile, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz landed in Kyiv on Monday for crisis talks - the latest Western leader to visit the region to show unity with Ukraine. Mr Scholz said there was ""no reasonable justification"" for the Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders and that Western countries would impose ""very far-reaching and effective sanctions"" against Russia if it invaded. Later Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelensky signed a decree declaring 16 February a day of unity,external. The date has been suggested by US officials as the earliest day for a potential attack by Russia. In a rousing statement, Mr Zelensky said that Ukrainians ""want freedom and are ready to fight for it"". BBC diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams says that the tone of the statement was markedly different from previous ones, in which the president has called for calm and warned against panic. Also on Monday the US said it had sent eight more F-15 fighter jets to Poland to take part in Nato air patrols. The US earlier said an extra 3,000 soldiers would be sent to Poland in the next few days to boost Nato military strength in the region.

A Ukrainian city unifies against Russia's threats Russia has long been opposed to the former Soviet republic of Ukraine growing closer to Europe and its institutions. President Vladimir Putin has demanded a guarantee from the West that Ukraine will not join Nato - a defensive alliance of 30 countries. But Nato has said it will not close down any future agreement with Ukraine. While the diplomatic row has played out, Russia has amassed 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border, with reports that a further 30,000 are engaged in military exercises in Belarus. Russia insists it is not planning to invade Ukraine, but European countries - including the UK - and the US have been providing support, such as training and weapons, and numerous governments have told their citizens to leave the country. Speaking to reporters on a visit to Scotland, Mr Johnson said the situation was ""very, very dangerous and difficult"", adding: ""We are on the edge of a precipice"". But he said there was ""still time for President Putin to step back"". The PM added: ""What we are urging is for everybody to engage in dialogue, for a conversation to take place and for the Russians to avoid what I think everybody, certainly everybody in the UK, would consider to be a disastrous mistake."" Mr Johnson has cut short planned visits in the north of England to return to London for security briefings and will hold a call with US President Joe Biden later on Monday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss held an emergency Cobra meeting on Monday afternoon. Afterwards, she tweeted: ""Latest information suggests Russia could invade at any moment and we urge the Kremlin to deescalate. ""Our focus is on prioritising the safety and security of British nationals in Ukraine."" The PM will hold another Cobra meeting on Tuesday. This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warns there could be a Russian invasion of Ukraine ""almost immediately"". Meanwhile, Labour's leader has given his backing to the government. On a visit to Sunderland, Sir Keir told reporters: ""Russia wants to see our allies divided, it wants to see division in the United Kingdom. ""And we are not going to divide and, therefore, we support the government in what it's doing."" But he did urge the PM to ""go further"" with sanctions in response to ""Russian aggression"". The government hasintroduced new powersto ""broaden the range"" of Russian people and businesses the UK could target with sanctions. But opposition MPs criticised a lack of debate in the Commons on the plans, as Parliament is now in recess. Some Tory MPs are also calling for tougher sanctions, such as blocking Russian banks from financial markets. Backbench MP Kevin Hollinrake said the West could bar the country from the Swift international payments messaging system, telling BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that if allies were determined, ""literally people would not be able to get money out of ATMs in Russia"".

Russia says diplomatic solution still possible,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (L) and President Vladimir Putin sat metres apart during the televised meeting Russia has said that a diplomatic solution to its escalating standoff with the West is still possible. In a televised meeting, President Vladimir Putin was told that diplomatic talks had not yet been been exhausted. The comments come after more than a dozen nations urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, and the US said aerial bombardments could begin ""at any time"". Russia has always denied plans to invade Ukraine, despite massing more than 100,000 troops on the border. Separately,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was still time for Russia to ""step back"" from the situation with Ukraine,urging all sides to carry on talking. A statement said Mr Johnson would hold a Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the UK's response to the pressures. LIVE:Russian invasion fears grow as foreigners flee Ukraine EXPLAINER:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? ANALYSIS:Five ways out of conflict ON THE GROUND:A Ukrainian city unifies against Russia's threats During another socially-distanced TV appearanceon Monday, Mr Putin asked his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov if there was a chance to reach an agreement with the West, or whether the diplomacy was ""an attempt to drag us into an endless negotiation process?"" Mr Lavrov replied that the ""possibilities are far from being exhausted, they certainly should not continue indefinitely, but I would suggest continuing and ramping them up"". The comments are being seen as a clear concession that talks could ease the tensions. But analysts say that without either side moving over the thorny issue of Ukraine potentially joining Nato, there is still deadlock. The Kremlin says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join Nato, and has demanded that this be ruled out. Nato's members have rejected this request. Also at the Kremlin meeting - in what some observers see as another possible route to easing tensions - Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Mr Putin that some of the country's military drills near Ukraine's border had already ended and others were coming to a close. Russia is holding massive joint exercises with Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour. Moscow is also staging Navy shooting drills in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov - to the south of Ukraine. In some quarters of the world, President Putin's question would have elicited a collective intake of breath. The Russian President asked his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov whether there was a chance of reaching an agreement on Russia's security concerns or if this was simply endless negotiation. Many would fear what would happen if Mr Lavrov said no. His answer has made some feel slightly more reassured - there is a chance. Throughout the weeks of diplomacy, one of the West's biggest fears is what happens if Russia walks away from the diplomatic table. Politicians have been arriving in sequence in Moscow, creating a metaphorical human chain to keep the diplomatic ball in the air. However, it's still unclear what both sides can agree on to break the deadlock and deescalate the situation. Russia says it wants a guarantee Nato won't allow Ukraine to join the alliance, but Nato won't give in to that. Neither side has moved on this issue so while diplomacy continues, so does the deadlock on a deal. Meanwhile, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz landed in Kyiv on Monday for crisis talks - the latest Western leader to visit the region to show unity with Ukraine. Mr Scholz said there was ""no reasonable justification"" for the Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders and that Western countries would impose ""very far-reaching and effective sanctions"" against Russia if it invaded. Later Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelensky signed a decree declaring 16 February a day of unity,external. The date has been suggested by US officials as the earliest day for a potential attack by Russia. In a rousing statement, Mr Zelensky said that Ukrainians ""want freedom and are ready to fight for it"". BBC diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams says that the tone of the statement was markedly different from previous ones, in which the president has called for calm and warned against panic. Also on Monday the US said it had sent eight more F-15 fighter jets to Poland to take part in Nato air patrols. The US earlier said an extra 3,000 soldiers would be sent to Poland in the next few days to boost Nato military strength in the region.

Who fancies a four-day working week?,"This video can not be played ""A happier team is a harder working team"" A four-day working week should be trialled in Wales, the Future Generations Commission has said. Shorter working weeks can make staff healthier and happier and businesses more productive, Wales' commissioner Sophie Howe said. Cutting hours but paying the same could help businesses retain staff and increase turnover, the report said. The Welsh government said it was considering the progress of pilots in other countries. It can change working patters in the public sector but not for private firms, but the report said the pilot could be used as a model there. 'Crazy' period for recruitment puts workers on top Welsh to be required for new Welsh government jobs Women 'not supported' to be business leaders Ms Howe wants a ""national conversation"" about working less and its potential to improve people's wellbeing. She urged the Welsh government to back pilots across different sectors. Wales' commissioner, Sophie Howe, wants a ""national conversation"" about working less ""There are different challenges in different sectors but let's try it,"" she said. Wales has high levels of sickness and relatively low productivity. Incomes are lower than in other parts of the UK. Many jobs have changed as a result of the pandemic and the drive to net zero - the term for when carbon emitted into the atmosphere equals that removed. That change is expected to accelerate as more jobs become automated. The Future Generations Commission's report argues by cutting hours but not pay absenteeism would fall and productivity increase, and a healthier population would then put less pressure on the NHS. Lily Champ works four days a week in a Cardiff hair salon ""The alternative is to keep working as normal, increase mental health (sickness) rates, increasing the cost of living crisis and not preparing for the changing nature of work,"" Ms Howe said. For years Lily Champ, 24, worked five days a week in city centre hair salons. ""Usually a five-day week is chaotic, it can feel quite rushed and there's not enough time for yourself,"" she said. Now she works four eight-hour days rather than five and her pay is the same. She said it makes a ""huge difference in and out of the salon"". ""I can suffer from anxiety a lot and it helps because I have time for myself, more time to chill but also to do things,"" Ms Champ said. She is one of a 10-strong team at Cardiff hair salon Slunks where a four-day week was introduced as a trial there after lockdown to maintain social distancing. Co-owner Chelsea Hobson, 28, said: ""We noticed a massive difference with the team's mental health and happiness."" She did not expect it to make the business more successful, but added: ""Takings-wise we are actually doing better than before."" Slunks co-owner Chelsea Hobson said reducing hours while maintaining pay rates led to increased takings Restaurants are often busiest at the weekend and staff most in demand, but Cardiff restaurant Cora closes on Friday, Saturday and Sunday so the chef can have a better work-life balance. ""I value my time with my family a lot more than I value cooking,"" said the restaurant's Lee Skeet. The business is also closed during Easter, summer and Christmas holidays. ""I really didn't want to get into the routine that chefs do of always being busy at weekends and holidays,"" he said. He urged others to ""focus more on themselves"". Chef Lee Skeet does not work weekends to improve his work-life balance Adam Bostock, sales director for Cardiff hearing healthcare company HearFocus, said a four-day week was beneficial for staff wellbeing and helped attract new employees in a ""competitive marketplace"". ""It's not a case of us losing 20% of our income, it's a case of us gaining clinical staff that we didn't have before,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. The report is not the first to suggest a shorter working week could benefit firms. The idea is being discussed in New Zealand, Ireland and Germany. In September 2021 the Scottish government announced it was trialling a four-day week. Business group CBI Wales' director Ian Price said: ""It might work for some organisations, and they will get more productivity, but it isn't practical for others. ""Businesses are already having to deal with the challenges of hybrid working and working from home."" He said it would be wrong to ""overload businesses with more changes"". Ms Howe said: ""The 37-hour working week hasn't changed in around 100 years. ""What I'm not saying is that suddenly overnight every business in Wales should be offering a reduced working week. ""What I'm saying is there should be some pilots across Wales with different types of businesses. ""Two years ago businesses said they couldn't afford a minimum wage, and now it's just become an absolutely standard thing."" The Welsh government said: ""We are considering the progress of pilots in other countries and examining the lessons Wales can learn. ""A shorter working week is just one example of flexible working and through our social partnership approach, we want to encourage more employers to provide workers with greater choice over where and when they work.""

"Air fare rises are unavoidable, warns airline boss","The cost of air travel is set to rise this year as airlines face soaring overheads, the UK boss of Air France-KLM has told the BBC. Fahmi Mahjoub said his airline faced significantly higher fuel and airport costs, and as a result higher air fares were ""quite unavoidable"". The airline advised people in the UK to book early as travel rules were eased and demand picked up. It said it was already seeing strong demand for Easter and summer. Mr Mahjoub told the BBC's Today programme: ""The increase in cost of living is a very concrete issue for many households but also the airline industry. ""So I think there is an expectation that airline tickets could become more costly as we move forward and I think the advice we have for customers is simply to plan earlier to be able to avoid those prices increases."" On Monday,oil priceshit their highest level since 2014 on fears that a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia could drive up costs in an already tight market. A barrel of benchmark Brent Crude reached $95.56 (Â£70.13) - up from under $65 a year ago. The rising price of oil has affected everything from heating bills to petrol prices, and Mr Mahjoub said the cost of jet fuel was also going up sharply. On top of this, Air France-KLM now has to pay 40% more to fly in and out of Heathrow airport, he said. Spain relaxes Covid restrictions for UK teenagers Ryanair: Holiday prices likely to rise sharply soon It is not the first travel firm to warn on prices. Last year, airline Ryanair and tour operator TUI both predicted holiday costs would be higher than in 2019 as the pandemic eased and demand rebounded. Despite the challenges, Air France-KLM says bookings from the UK have jumped since pre-departure and Day 2 Covid tests were scrapped for vaccinated travellers. Mr Mahjoub said bookings for winter sun destinations such as Dubai, the US and Thailand had been strong. Demand for half-term, Easter and summer flights was also healthy. Air France acquired the Dutch airline KLM to create Air France-KLM Group in 2004, one of the largest air carriers in the world. The deal allows the two airlines to operate as separate companies. On Sunday, KLM said it would stop services to Ukraine amid concerns Russia is preparing to invade. Germany's Lufthansa is also considering suspending flights.

"Post Office scandal ruined lives, inquiry hearsThe inquiry into wrongful convictions must put former sub-postmasters at its heart, a lawyer says.Business","Baljit Sethi, pictured here with his wife Anjana, was the first witness to speak at the inquiry The Post Office scandal that saw sub-postmasters wrongly convicted for fraud has ruined lives, a top lawyer has said. Barrister Jason Beer QC said former sub-postmasters and mistresses' stories should be at the heart of an inquiry. ""Lives were ruined, families torn apart, families were made homeless or destitute,"" he said. The cases constitute the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. Between 2000 and 2014, more than 700 sub-postmasters were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting due to a flaw in the Horizon accounting IT system. The inquiry - which is expected to run for the rest of this year - will look at whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system and will also ask how staff shouldered the blame. A total of 72 former sub-postmasters have had their names cleared so far. In his opening remarks, Sir Wyn Williams, the retired High Court judge who is leading the inquiry, expressed thanks to the 50 to 60 witnesses he expects to hear oral evidence from in the coming weeks. Sir Wyn said he sought to understand ""the scale and nature of the harm"" done to so many. ""These hearings would not be taking place at all were it not for the witnesses who have agreed to give up their valuable time to publicly relive what must be very distressing memories and events."" This video can not be played Watch: Tracy Felstead was sent to Holloway Prison for a crime she didn't commit Baljit Sethi was the first witness to give evidence on Monday. He had told the BBC beforehand he was looking forward to it. During his session, he described his long career spanning two decades, during which he ran two branches near Romford in Essex with his wife Anjana successfully using paper accounts. After Horizon was introduced, one branch had no problems at all, but the second one showed a hole in the accounts of Â£17,000, which they were asked to cover out of their own pocket. The Sethis were never charged, but still faced a financial and emotional nightmare. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? 'I want someone else jailed like I was' Listen: The Great Post Office Trial Mr Sethi said he tried to communicate with the head office in Chelmsford, Essex, after noticing a problem with the system. He broke down in tears and went on to say: ""I was the only man who ran the Post Office seven days a week. ""I used to open it at 8am and shut at 8pm. I was the only Post Office in the country running all seven days. ""I knew there was something wrong with the system but no-one wanted to know that,"" he added. ""We didn't take a single penny from the Post Office our entire life."" Mr Sethi has also told the BBC previously that the scandal meant he felt he was unable to be a good parent to his two sons and daughter. His son Amit said ahead of the session: ""I want accountability and those who suffered should be compensated appropriately. ""That's it - then we'll draw a line under it."" The judge will hear evidence on why sub-postmasters and postmistresses were singled out and whether they have been justly compensated, as well as analysing at least 100 written statements. Jason Beer QC said families had been ""torn apart"" because of the Post Office scandal Mr Beer, the counsel to the inquiry, pointed out that some former sub-postmasters had passed away before it started. ""It is about people whose mental and physical health has been impacted, people whose marriages and partnerships have deteriorated or failed, about people who have thought about taking their own lives and in some cases took their own lives,"" he said. The inquiry will also examine whether staff at software firm Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon software to complete tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking, knew the system had flaws while data from it was used in court to convict sub-postmasters. Evidence will be heard from witnesses in Leeds and Cardiff over the coming weeks. ""I cannot stress enough the importance of me understanding the scale and nature of the harm which has bee caused to so many individuals,"" Sir Wyn said.

Two green freeports to be established in ScotlandThe Scottish and UK governments agree the deal as Boris Johnson makes a visit to Scotland.Scotland politicsComments,"The Scottish and UK governments have agreed to establish two green freeports in Scotland. The special economic zones, offering tax breaks and lower business tariffs, are being promoted by the UK government as part of its ""levelling-up"" agenda. The Scottish Greens, the SNP's Scottish government partners, criticised the plans as ""greenwashing"" and said it was a ""corporate giveaway"". The deal comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson visits Scotland. A bidding process will begin in the spring and it is hoped the new sites will open in 2023. Green commitment demanded in freeport talks What are freeports and where will they be? Ministers from both the Scottish and UK governments will have a say in the assessment and selection process. The governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border,after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later saidthey would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. Freeports allow firms to import goods and then re-export them outside normal tax and customs rules Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said: ""We have been able to reach an agreement on a joint approach that enshrines the Scottish government's commitment to achieving net zero and embedding fair work practices through public investment. ""The establishment of green freeports will help us create new green jobs, deliver a just transition and support our economic transformation."" The UK government has committed funding of Â£52m to the project and bidders will have to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. However, in the first major split from the SNP since they signed a power-sharing deal last year, the Scottish Greens criticised the plans as ""greenwashing"". Finance spokesman Ross Greer toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme that his party wanted nothing to do with ""these so-called green freeports"". He said: ""There is nothing genuinely green about them. Freeports are a really effective way to give tax relief and throw public money at multinational companies who are already doing their best to avoid tax. ""The SNP used to oppose freeports for exactly the same reason the Scottish Greens still do. ""Internationally, freeports are associated with crime, money laundering, smuggling, low wages."" Mr Greer said that there was ""no actual solid requirements"" to meet climate targets or stick to fair work practices, and that it was ""naive"" to expect large corporations to adhere to these rules. The Prime Minister visited Rosyth dockyard in Fife Kate Forbes told BBC Scotland that all green freeport applicants would have to stick to their commitments to net zero targets and fair work. She said: ""If a bidder fails to do so, we would look at this very carefully. We would expect bidders who set out promises to meet those promises. ""They will be required to deliver robust decarbonisation plans, demonstrating how they will move to net zero. A bidder will not win without it."" Under the UK government's model, freeports are centred around at least one air, rail or sea port, but can extend up to 28 miles (45km) beyond. Forth Ports - which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland - said it would be bidding to create a Firth of Forth green freeport. While other bidders have not yet been announced, in July last year the Scottish government named nine areas being considered - Shetland, Orkney, Aberdeen with Peterhead, Montrose, Dundee, Cairnryan, the Firth of Forth and Glasgow city region. A Cromarty Firth consortium is also understood to be interested. Freeports are one of Boris Johnson's big ideas to ""level up"" the country. He thinks they'll bring new investment and jobs to areas that lag behind. But he's even had to change their name - they're now ""green freeports"" here - to win backing from the Scottish government. It sounds petty, but the name is the tip of a large iceberg. Why? Imagine what they might create. These low tax zones could give rise to a little Singapore on the Cromarty Firth, where goods can be imported, assembled and exported without the usual taxes and paperwork. Firms inside the freeport could pay lower rates of VAT and employment tax. Nicola Sturgeon's team warns that could give rise to low wage, low value zones, which water down workers' rights and rules which protect the environment. So she's insisted that firms inside green freeports should pay the living wage, and commit to net-zero targets on climate change, and inclusive growth in local communities. You might wonder if this compromise can work. If freeports don't offer incentives, why would employers want to move there at all? If Scottish freeports are regulated more, will they be able to create new jobs, or compete with their English counterparts? The Scottish government wants to avoid a stampede of firms moving into a low-tax zone, without adding anything to the Scottish economy. So it's happy to pour cold water on one of Boris Johnson's dreams. Ian Murray, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, said the agreement had been ""delayed for months because the two governments disagreed over the name. ""As a result of their petty point-scoring, regions in England already have a head start."" The Scottish government and the UK Treasury will use their tax powers, including rates relief, to support the freeports. Last year, the Scottish government said UK ministers risked undermining devolution if they set up the freeports in Scotland or Wales without the backing of devolved governments. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:  ""I am delighted that people across Scotland will reap the benefits that will come from having two new green freeports. ""Freeports will help to accelerate our plan to level up communities across the whole of the United Kingdom. ""They have the power to be truly transformational by creating jobs and investment opportunities to enable people to reach their potential."" Dundee has previously been suggested as a potential location for a freeport Also called free trade zones, they are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in the zone pay lower taxes, such as reduced VAT and lower rates of employment tax. Critics argue they simply defer the point when import tariffs are paid, which then still need to be paid at some stage. Will freeports help the economy? Mr Johnson began his trip to Scotland on Monday with a visit to Rosyth dockyard in Fife. He is not expected to meet Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross - who has called for him to stand down over parties held in Downing Street during lockdown - despite Mr Johnson beinginvited to address the Scottish Conservative conferencein Aberdeen next month. On his visit, Mr Johnson said he was ""working very hard with colleagues in Scotland"" on a joint agenda of ""uniting and levelling up"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford branded the trip ""a walking advert for Scottish independence"". He said Mr Johnson should ""apologise for the damage he has inflicted on Scotland and hand in his resignation"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's visit made ""the case for the Union harder"" and that ""this prime minister does not help that cause"".

Inquiry to examine Post Office wrongful convictions,"Sub-postmasters and mistresses celebrated the quashing of their convictions The wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses will be examined by a public inquiry starting on Monday. Between 2000 and 2014, more than 700 sub-postmasters were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting due to a flaw in a computer system Horizon. A total of 72 former sub-postmasters have had their names cleared so far. The cases constitute the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. The inquiry - which is expected to run for the rest of this year - will look at whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system and will also ask how staff shouldered the blame. It will also examine whether staff at software firm Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon software to complete tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking, knew the system had flaws while data from it was used in court to convict sub-postmasters. A judge will hear evidence on why sub-postmasters and postmistresses were singled out and whether they have been justly compensated. Ahead of the inquiry, Baljit Sethi, who will be the first witness to give evidence on Monday, told the BBC he was looking forward to it. ""What the Post Office has done to us - and to many of my colleagues - is unforgiveable,"" he said. ""The people who did this should be brought to justice."" Baljit Sethi (centre right) and his family spoke to the BBC ahead of the inquiry's start His wife Anjana, who also helped run two branches near Romford in Essex, said she now felt ""we can see some light at the end of this dark tunnel"". One branch had no problems at all, but the second one showed a hole in the accounts of Â£17,000, which they were asked to cover out of their own pocket. The Sethis were never charged but still faced a financial and emotional nightmare. Their son Amit added: ""I want accountability and those who suffered should be compensated appropriately. ""That's it - then we'll draw a line under it."" Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? 'I want someone else charged and jailed like I was' Harjinder Butoy, who ran the post office in the Nottinghamshire market town of Sutton-in-Ashfield along with his wife, said that he wanted to see ""someone on the other side to be charged and jailed like I was"". ""They are the ones who signed the final paper work off,"" he told the BBC. ""They are the ones who knew if there were any faults on the system or not."" Mr Butoy, who is thought to have been given the longest prison sentence at three years and four months, was wrongly convicted and jailed for stealing Â£208,000 and it took until last year to gethis conviction overturned in the Court of Appeal. Mr Butoy said he noticed the Horizon accounting software was not adding up properly. ""I was Â£500 short,"" he explained, even though a supervisor had been with him the entire time, making sure he got to grips in his new role. ""I didn't think anything of it. But ever since then, it happened a lot."" Thousands of others Post Office sub-postmasters lost huge sums of money as they tried to make up mysterious shortfalls at their shops, which the Post Office is only now beginning to refund. Many have described being shunned by their communities while some have since died. This video can not be played Watch: Tracy Felstead was sent to Holloway Prison for a crime she didn't commit The Post Office has said it is ""sincerely sorry"" for the impact of the Horizon scandal, adding it is ""in no doubt about the human cost"". It said the inquiry would enable ""many of those who were most deeply affected by Post Office's past failings to voice their experiences and their testimonies must and will ensure all lessons are learned so that such events can never happen again"". ""In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress,"" it added. The government has set aside funding to facilitate compensation payments. Meanwhile, Fujitsu said it was ""committed to providing the fullest and most transparent information so that key lessons are learned for the future"".

Petrol and diesel prices reach new record highThe price of fuel at the pump has risen with petrol at 148.02p a litre and diesel at 151.57p.Business,"Fuel prices have hit a new record high at the pump across the UK, tightening the squeeze on UK consumers, the motoring organisation the AA has said. Over the weekend petrol reached 148.02p a litre, while diesel hit a new record high of 151.57p a litre last Thursday. Fuel previously hit a record in November, before wholesale and retail prices fell back. ""The cost of living crisis has been ratcheted up yet another notch,"" said Luke Bosdet of the AA. The RAC's fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the price of filling a 55-litre family car was now an ""eye-watering"" Â£81.41. ""With the oil price teetering on the brink of $100 a barrel and retailers keen to pass on the increase in wholesale fuel quickly, new records could now be set on a daily basis in the coming weeks,"" he said. Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Are we paying too much at the pump? Fuel prices at the pump are driven largely by the wholesale price of energy which has shot up due to tensions over whether Russia will invade Ukraine. On Monday, oil prices hit their highest level since 2014, reaching $95.56 a barrel. If the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, oil and gas supplies from Russia to Europe may be interrupted, pushing up wholesale prices further. The supply of oil and gas has already struggled to keep up with growing demand as the global economy picked up in recent months as Covid restrictions eased. The RAC's Mr Williams said: ""On a positive note, retailer margins - which were the reason drivers paid overly high prices in December and January - have now returned to more normal levels of around 7p a litre."" He said the big four supermarkets, which dominate fuel sales, should ""play fair"" with drivers by keeping their profit margins low. Day-to-day prices for food, household bills and other items such as used cars, have risen sharply in recent months, in part due to rising energy prices. The Petrol Retailers' Association (PRA), which represents independent retailers, said it would continue to ensure that the price of fuel was ""as competitive as possible"". But tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as other key factors such as tightness in the oil market and the dollar-sterling exchange rate, were likely to cause further volatility in the oil price, said Gordon Balmer, PRA's executive director. UK inflation is now at a 30-year high of 5.4%. New inflation figures for January will be released by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday. Mr Bosdet said the AA had surveyed 15,000 of its members after prices spiked at the end of last year and found higher fuel prices were leading 43% of them to cut back on the amount they used their car as well as other areas of spending. Mike Johnson at the energy consultancy Portland Analytics said what happens to energy prices next depended both on the situation in Ukraine and whether the Organisation of Petrol Exporting Countries (Opec) was able to boost supply. ""Opec and its allies have struggled to increase production in line with their output targets due to a combination of production outages and technical issues, whilst demand continues to rise,"" he said. While oil producing nations had agreed to increase production by 400,000 barrels per day in February Mr Johnson said it seemed unlikely that target would be met. Why are petrol prices going back up?

HMRC seizes NFT for first time in Â£1.4m fraud caseThe tax authority says it is the first UK law enforcement body to seize a Non-Fungible Token.Business,"The UK tax authority has seized three Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) as part of a probe into a suspected VAT fraud involving 250 alleged fake companies. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said three people had been arrested on suspicion of attempting to defraud it of Â£1.4m. The authority said it was the first UK law enforcement to seize an NFT. NFTs are assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold, but which have no tangible form of their own. The digital tokens, which emerged in 2014, can be thought of as certificates of ownership for virtual or physical assets. NFTs have a unique digital signature so they can be bought and sold using traditional currency or crypto currency, such as Bitcoin. Where Bitcoin has been hailed as a digital answer to currency, NFTs have been touted as the digital answer to collectables, but plenty of sceptics fear they're a bubble waiting to burst. HMRC said the suspects in its fraud case were alleged to have used ""sophisticated methods"" to try to hide their identities including false and stolen identities, false addresses, pre-paid unregistered mobile phones, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), false invoices and pretending to engage in legitimate business activities. Nick Sharp, deputy director economic crime, said the first seizure of an NFT ""serves as a warning to anyone who thinks they can use crypto assets to hide money from HMRC"". ""We constantly adapt to new technology to ensure we keep pace with how criminals and evaders look to conceal their assets."" HMRC said it had secured a court order to detain the seized crypto assets worth about Â£5,000 and three digital artwork NFTs, which have not been valued, while its investigation continues. Traditional works of art such as paintings are valuable precisely because they are one of a kind, but digital files can be easily and endlessly duplicated. With NFTs, artwork can be ""tokenised"" to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought and sold. The tokens can represent a range of real-world objects such as artwork, music and videos. As with crypto-currency, a record of who owns what is stored on a shared ledger known asthe blockchain. The records cannot be forged because the ledger is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. An image of a popular internet meme, featuring two-year-old Chloe Clem, was sold as a NFT for about $74,000 (Â£54,000) in September last year.

LiveLiveRussian invasion fears grow as foreigners flee Ukraine2 minutes ago,"Russia's defence ministry says some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing drills It raises hopes that tensions could ease but military exercises continue and it's unclear how many units are being withdrawn The head of the Nato defence alliance says he hasn't seen de-escalation yet but that signals from Moscow give some cause for optimism President Vladimir Putin tells a news conference that Russia does not want war in Europe UK PM Boris Johnson says there are ""mixed signals"" coming from Russia and that the intelligence on Ukraine ""is still not encouraging"" The EU says it is willing to discuss Russia's security concerns but warns a key Russian gas pipeline to Germany would ""not become operational"" in the event of war Edited by Hugo Bachega We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a summary of the main developments today:  Today's live page was edited by Hugo Bachega and Lauren Turner and written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Jeremy Gahagan, James Harness and Leo Sands. You can keep up to date with all the latest developmentsin our main story. Olga IvshinaBBC Russian Service One
way to judge whether Russia's troop withdrawal is real is to watch
what happens over the next few days in Belarus, where Moscow and Minsk are currently conducting joint military drills. Russia
moved thousands of troops to Belarus from Siberia and the Far East for the exercises. The units include fighter jets, air defence systems, and some of Russia's most experienced paratroopers and marines. Those joint drills are due to finish on 20 February. If Russia withdraws its troops after that, it could be a sign that Moscow is serious about reducing its military build-up around Ukraine's borders. Away from the politicking, we've got a Eurovision Song Contest development to bring you. Alina Pash, Ukraine's Eurovision singer, has been ""suspended"" from competing at May's competition in Turin. Ukraine's national broadcaster UA:PBC took the actionafter it was revealed that authorities are investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. There are strict travel rules in place over how people enter Crimea. It's not illegal for Ukrainians to visit but it can be frowned upon. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that's now being scrutinised. While investigations continue, Alina says some people claim she's un-Ukrainian. ""I'm a Ukrainian girl. I'm talking in Ukrainian and my song is about Ukraine,"" she explains. We've now got some details of the phone call held between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. A statement from the foreign ministry in Moscow says Lavrov stressed the need for ""pragmatic dialogue over the entire range of issues raised by Russia"". He also told Blinken that ""aggressive rhetoric"" inflated by Washington was unacceptable. But said it was necessary to continue ""joint work"". Websites including the Ukrainian defence ministry and the banks PrivatBank and OshadBank have been subject to a cyber-attack, the Russia's Tass news agency reports. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre has said Russia could be to blame for the attack, according to Tass. The website of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has also been affected, the Unian news agency reports. Ukrainian websites have been affected by cyber-attacks before with Russia denying any involvement. Helen CattBBC political correspondent UK MPs have been briefed by the Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace this afternoon on the current situation around Russia and
Ukraine. It's understood he repeated the government's
assessment that it was not convinced Russia was standing down despite reports
of troops moving away That's because he said there had been an
uptick in other activity such as stepping up the preparedness of field
hospitals. He apparently warned that, while Russia
could launch an invasion within hours, it wasn't beyond the realms of possibility
that the current situation continues for weeks or months. He's also said to have told them that he
believes that President Putin has still not decided whether to launch an
invasion or not. Wallace is also said to have confirmed that UK troops who were involved in
training in Ukraine are now back in the UK. The UK should ""not believe anything that's coming out of Moscow"", the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Earlier today, Russia said some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine were returning to their bases. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""[Russia] have lied and lied and lied and, surprisingly, are continuing to lie."" Addressing whether Russia would invade Ukraine, he said:
""Only one person knows and he ain't speaking. And that's Vladimir
Putin. We're dealing with a one-man band here."" Tugendhat says Russia's foreign ministry is ""simply
the barking dog outside the house of a mafia don... It's just there to make a
noise"". Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian, Kyiv ""When I see Maxar [satellite] imagery prove the Russian troops' withdrawal, I will believe,"" says mother-of-three Alina Fediai-Zyrianska, from her home in a suburb of Kyiv. Her family were planning to launch a new business this month. But that has been put on hold because of their growing fears of war. Alina is critical of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but her feelings about the news of Russia withdrawing echo the reaction from authorities there. Mykhailo Podoliak, from the president's office, tells the BBC that state bodies need to assess the scale of the withdrawal in order to confirm if the situation is ""getting back to normal"". Yesterday, Zelensky published yet another video to reassure the nation and call for unity. Such messages are welcomed by his supporters, but some are keen to stress that a grassroots resistance is being formed, regardless of any official statements. Alina says the president's address didn't lift her spirits. Instead, she keeps tracking website FlightRadar open - watching American drones and British planes fly over Ukraine's borders has a soothing effect, she says. This video can not be played We heard earlier from UK PM Boris Johnson, who said tough sanctions were ready to go if Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a ""very tough line on sanctions"" from the government after today's Cobra meeting. He says this is important so that Russia ""knows there will be serious consequences"" for any action it chooses to take against Ukraine and called on ""allies to stand together in the face of Russian aggression"". He says ""it's not entirely clear what's happening on the border"". More diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine are under way between the US and Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov are on the phone, according to the US state department. We're also hearing that US President Joe Biden will speak on the phone later with France's President Emmanuel Macron. Western military analysts say they need more information
to judge the significance of Russia's movement of some troops back from the Ukrainian border. Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London tells Reuters news agency: One should maintain an air of cautious scepticism. There have been past discrepancies between Russia's official announcements and its actions on the ground.  Many of the Russian forces in Belarus for drills - due to end on Sunday - have come from thousands of miles away in Russia's central and eastern military districts. Rob Lee, a military analyst who specialises in Russia, tells Reuters the announcement was ""potentially good news"" but it was important to see where those forces went after the culmination of joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. As long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice.  Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, tells Reuters it would take several days to verify the latest moves via satellite imagery. It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

Inquiry to examine Post Office wrongful convictionsMore than 700 sub-postmasters and mistresses were wrongly convicted due to a flawed computer system.Business,"Sub-postmasters and mistresses celebrated the quashing of their convictions The wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses will be examined by a public inquiry starting on Monday. Between 2000 and 2014, more than 700 sub-postmasters were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting due to a flaw in a computer system Horizon. A total of 72 former sub-postmasters have had their names cleared so far. The cases constitute the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. The inquiry - which is expected to run for the rest of this year - will look at whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system and will also ask how staff shouldered the blame. It will also examine whether staff at software firm Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon software to complete tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking, knew the system had flaws while data from it was used in court to convict sub-postmasters. A judge will hear evidence on why sub-postmasters and postmistresses were singled out and whether they have been justly compensated. Ahead of the inquiry, Baljit Sethi, who will be the first witness to give evidence on Monday, told the BBC he was looking forward to it. ""What the Post Office has done to us - and to many of my colleagues - is unforgiveable,"" he said. ""The people who did this should be brought to justice."" Baljit Sethi (centre right) and his family spoke to the BBC ahead of the inquiry's start His wife Anjana, who also helped run two branches near Romford in Essex, said she now felt ""we can see some light at the end of this dark tunnel"". One branch had no problems at all, but the second one showed a hole in the accounts of Â£17,000, which they were asked to cover out of their own pocket. The Sethis were never charged but still faced a financial and emotional nightmare. Their son Amit added: ""I want accountability and those who suffered should be compensated appropriately. ""That's it - then we'll draw a line under it."" Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? 'I want someone else charged and jailed like I was' Harjinder Butoy, who ran the post office in the Nottinghamshire market town of Sutton-in-Ashfield along with his wife, said that he wanted to see ""someone on the other side to be charged and jailed like I was"". ""They are the ones who signed the final paper work off,"" he told the BBC. ""They are the ones who knew if there were any faults on the system or not."" Mr Butoy, who is thought to have been given the longest prison sentence at three years and four months, was wrongly convicted and jailed for stealing Â£208,000 and it took until last year to gethis conviction overturned in the Court of Appeal. Mr Butoy said he noticed the Horizon accounting software was not adding up properly. ""I was Â£500 short,"" he explained, even though a supervisor had been with him the entire time, making sure he got to grips in his new role. ""I didn't think anything of it. But ever since then, it happened a lot."" Thousands of others Post Office sub-postmasters lost huge sums of money as they tried to make up mysterious shortfalls at their shops, which the Post Office is only now beginning to refund. Many have described being shunned by their communities while some have since died. This video can not be played Watch: Tracy Felstead was sent to Holloway Prison for a crime she didn't commit The Post Office has said it is ""sincerely sorry"" for the impact of the Horizon scandal, adding it is ""in no doubt about the human cost"". It said the inquiry would enable ""many of those who were most deeply affected by Post Office's past failings to voice their experiences and their testimonies must and will ensure all lessons are learned so that such events can never happen again"". ""In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress,"" it added. The government has set aside funding to facilitate compensation payments. Meanwhile, Fujitsu said it was ""committed to providing the fullest and most transparent information so that key lessons are learned for the future"".

Ministers support removing Covid restrictionsMinisters in the executive have supported the health minister's plans to relax restrictions.Northern Ireland,"The regulations that are currently in place will become guidance on Tuesday All remaining Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland will be lifted, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced. A small number of restrictions are currently in place, including the wearing of face coverings and the use of Covid certification in nightclubs. Mr Swann said those remaining measures ""should no longer be set out in regulations"" and instead will be put in guidance issued to the public. He said he would be making an order on Tuesday to revoke the remaining rules. Remaining restrictions include: Requirements to wear face coverings in public places Business owners having measures in place to limit transmission of the virus The use of Covid certification at nightclubs and large unseated indoor events Limits on numbers meeting indoors in private homes Measures which had previously been guidance rather than law, such as working from home where possible, have not been changed. While in England there is a legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for Covid-19, in Northern Ireland this falls under ""very strong guidance"". Mr Swann said: ""This does not mean that Covid-19 has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm. ""It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others."" The health minister said it was important to retain the ability to reintroduce restrictions again in case of urgent need. As a result he said he will seek to extend the powers granted to the Department of Health by the Coronavirus Act 2020 by six months. Mr Swann confirmed on Sunday afternoon that he has tested positive for Covid-19 but he is carrying out his duties remotely Mr Swann had written to his ministerial colleagues asking for their views on removing remaining restrictions. The executive collapsed earlier in February but individual ministers are still in place. They can take some decisions, as long as the issues are not deemed ""significant or controversial"". Why are ministers still in place despite collapse? Swann waits for legal advice to remove restrictions Swann 'has authority' to lift Covid restrictions What are NI's Covid rules after new relaxations? Mr Swann's letter to other ministers, seen by the BBC, said government lawyers had told him relaxing Covid rules would fall into this category. He said the lawyers suggested he could therefore not remove the rules by himself, under the terms of Stormont's ministerial code. The full executive cannot meet becausePaul Givan resigned as first minister, forcing the resignation of Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill because of the joint nature of the office. The move was part of an ongoing protest by Mr Givan's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) against the Northern Ireland Protocol. Covid-passports in some settings are among the remaining Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland Mr Swann's letter to the ministers who remain in place was an attempt to gain wider approval to relax restrictions in the absence of the full executive. The current Covid 19 regulations would have been in place until 24 March, when the legislation underpinning them expired. It is understood ministers from the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in, SDLP and Alliance all supported Mr Swann - who is a member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) - and confirmed their positions. Hospitality Ulster welcomed Mr Swann's announcement. ""After nearly two long years, the hospitality industry will be relieved that they can begin to trade without pandemic restrictions limiting the viability of their businesses,"" the group's chief executive Colin Neill said. Retail NI said it was ""fantastic news for our members and the wider business community"". ""However, we are disappointed that the statement does not include a clear commitment to return to the workplace,"" said Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts. ""Safely reopening offices and workplaces is not only vital to boost footfall for our high streets, but also for our economy and returning our society to normal."" On Monday,two more Covid-related deaths were announced in Northern Irelandalong with 2,465 cases. There are currently 437 patients with the virus in hospital. ANALYSIS:Is it too soon to lift restrictions? SELF-ISOLATION:You test positive - what next?

HMRC seizes NFT for first time in Â£1.4m fraud case,"The UK tax authority has seized three Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) as part of a probe into a suspected VAT fraud involving 250 alleged fake companies. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said three people had been arrested on suspicion of attempting to defraud it of Â£1.4m. The authority said it was the first UK law enforcement to seize an NFT. NFTs are assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold, but which have no tangible form of their own. The digital tokens, which emerged in 2014, can be thought of as certificates of ownership for virtual or physical assets. NFTs have a unique digital signature so they can be bought and sold using traditional currency or crypto currency, such as Bitcoin. Where Bitcoin has been hailed as a digital answer to currency, NFTs have been touted as the digital answer to collectables, but plenty of sceptics fear they're a bubble waiting to burst. HMRC said the suspects in its fraud case were alleged to have used ""sophisticated methods"" to try to hide their identities including false and stolen identities, false addresses, pre-paid unregistered mobile phones, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), false invoices and pretending to engage in legitimate business activities. Nick Sharp, deputy director economic crime, said the first seizure of an NFT ""serves as a warning to anyone who thinks they can use crypto assets to hide money from HMRC"". ""We constantly adapt to new technology to ensure we keep pace with how criminals and evaders look to conceal their assets."" HMRC said it had secured a court order to detain the seized crypto assets worth about Â£5,000 and three digital artwork NFTs, which have not been valued, while its investigation continues. Traditional works of art such as paintings are valuable precisely because they are one of a kind, but digital files can be easily and endlessly duplicated. With NFTs, artwork can be ""tokenised"" to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought and sold. The tokens can represent a range of real-world objects such as artwork, music and videos. As with crypto-currency, a record of who owns what is stored on a shared ledger known asthe blockchain. The records cannot be forged because the ledger is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. An image of a popular internet meme, featuring two-year-old Chloe Clem, was sold as a NFT for about $74,000 (Â£54,000) in September last year.

way to judge whether Russia's troop withdrawal is real is to watch
what happens over the next few days in Belarus, where Moscow and Minsk are currently conducting joint military drills. Russia
moved thousands of troops to Belarus from Siberia and the Far East for the exercises. The units include fighter jets, air defence systems, and some of Russia's most experienced paratroopers and marines. Those joint drills are due to finish on 20 February. If Russia withdraws its troops after that, it could be a sign that Moscow is serious about reducing its military build-up around Ukraine's borders. Away from the politicking, we've got a Eurovision Song Contest development to bring you. Alina Pash, Ukraine's Eurovision singer, has been ""suspended"" from competing at May's competition in Turin. Ukraine's national broadcaster UA:PBC took the actionafter it was revealed that authorities are investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. There are strict travel rules in place over how people enter Crimea. It's not illegal for Ukrainians to visit but it can be frowned upon. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that's now being scrutinised. While investigations continue, Alina says some people claim she's un-Ukrainian. ""I'm a Ukrainian girl. I'm talking in Ukrainian and my song is about Ukraine,"" she explains. We've now got some details of the phone call held between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. A statement from the foreign ministry in Moscow says Lavrov stressed the need for ""pragmatic dialogue over the entire range of issues raised by Russia"". He also told Blinken that ""aggressive rhetoric"" inflated by Washington was unacceptable. But said it was necessary to continue ""joint work"". Websites including the Ukrainian defence ministry and the banks PrivatBank and OshadBank have been subject to a cyber-attack, the Russia's Tass news agency reports. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre has said Russia could be to blame for the attack, according to Tass. The website of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has also been affected, the Unian news agency reports. Ukrainian websites have been affected by cyber-attacks before with Russia denying any involvement. Helen CattBBC political correspondent UK MPs have been briefed by the Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace this afternoon on the current situation around Russia and
Ukraine. It's understood he repeated the government's
assessment that it was not convinced Russia was standing down despite reports
of troops moving away That's because he said there had been an
uptick in other activity such as stepping up the preparedness of field
hospitals. He apparently warned that, while Russia
could launch an invasion within hours, it wasn't beyond the realms of possibility
that the current situation continues for weeks or months. He's also said to have told them that he
believes that President Putin has still not decided whether to launch an
invasion or not. Wallace is also said to have confirmed that UK troops who were involved in
training in Ukraine are now back in the UK. The UK should ""not believe anything that's coming out of Moscow"", the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Earlier today, Russia said some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine were returning to their bases. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""[Russia] have lied and lied and lied and, surprisingly, are continuing to lie."" Addressing whether Russia would invade Ukraine, he said:
""Only one person knows and he ain't speaking. And that's Vladimir
Putin. We're dealing with a one-man band here."" Tugendhat says Russia's foreign ministry is ""simply
the barking dog outside the house of a mafia don... It's just there to make a
noise"". Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian, Kyiv ""When I see Maxar [satellite] imagery prove the Russian troops' withdrawal, I will believe,"" says mother-of-three Alina Fediai-Zyrianska, from her home in a suburb of Kyiv. Her family were planning to launch a new business this month. But that has been put on hold because of their growing fears of war. Alina is critical of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but her feelings about the news of Russia withdrawing echo the reaction from authorities there. Mykhailo Podoliak, from the president's office, tells the BBC that state bodies need to assess the scale of the withdrawal in order to confirm if the situation is ""getting back to normal"". Yesterday, Zelensky published yet another video to reassure the nation and call for unity. Such messages are welcomed by his supporters, but some are keen to stress that a grassroots resistance is being formed, regardless of any official statements. Alina says the president's address didn't lift her spirits. Instead, she keeps tracking website FlightRadar open - watching American drones and British planes fly over Ukraine's borders has a soothing effect, she says. This video can not be played We heard earlier from UK PM Boris Johnson, who said tough sanctions were ready to go if Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a ""very tough line on sanctions"" from the government after today's Cobra meeting. He says this is important so that Russia ""knows there will be serious consequences"" for any action it chooses to take against Ukraine and called on ""allies to stand together in the face of Russian aggression"". He says ""it's not entirely clear what's happening on the border"". More diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine are under way between the US and Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov are on the phone, according to the US state department. We're also hearing that US President Joe Biden will speak on the phone later with France's President Emmanuel Macron. Western military analysts say they need more information
to judge the significance of Russia's movement of some troops back from the Ukrainian border. Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London tells Reuters news agency: One should maintain an air of cautious scepticism. There have been past discrepancies between Russia's official announcements and its actions on the ground.  Many of the Russian forces in Belarus for drills - due to end on Sunday - have come from thousands of miles away in Russia's central and eastern military districts. Rob Lee, a military analyst who specialises in Russia, tells Reuters the announcement was ""potentially good news"" but it was important to see where those forces went after the culmination of joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. As long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice.  Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, tells Reuters it would take several days to verify the latest moves via satellite imagery. It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

Two 'green freeports' to be established in ScotlandThe Scottish and UK governments agree the deal as Boris Johnson is expected to visit Scotland.,"The Scottish and UK governments have agreed to establish two green freeports in Scotland. The special economic zones, offering tax breaks and lower business tariffs, are being promoted by the UK government as part of its ""levelling-up"" agenda. The Scottish Greens, the SNP's Scottish government partners, criticised the plans as ""greenwashing"" and said it was a ""corporate giveaway"". The deal comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson visits Scotland. A bidding process will begin in the spring and it is hoped the new sites will open in 2023. Green commitment demanded in freeport talks What are freeports and where will they be? Ministers from both the Scottish and UK governments will have a say in the assessment and selection process. The governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border,after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later saidthey would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. Freeports allow firms to import goods and then re-export them outside normal tax and customs rules Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said: ""We have been able to reach an agreement on a joint approach that enshrines the Scottish government's commitment to achieving net zero and embedding fair work practices through public investment. ""The establishment of green freeports will help us create new green jobs, deliver a just transition and support our economic transformation."" The UK government has committed funding of Â£52m to the project and bidders will have to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. However, in the first major split from the SNP since they signed a power-sharing deal last year, the Scottish Greens criticised the plans as ""greenwashing"". Finance spokesman Ross Greer toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme that his party wanted nothing to do with ""these so-called green freeports"". He said: ""There is nothing genuinely green about them. Freeports are a really effective way to give tax relief and throw public money at multinational companies who are already doing their best to avoid tax. ""The SNP used to oppose freeports for exactly the same reason the Scottish Greens still do. ""Internationally, freeports are associated with crime, money laundering, smuggling, low wages."" Mr Greer said that there was ""no actual solid requirements"" to meet climate targets or stick to fair work practices, and that it was ""naive"" to expect large corporations to adhere to these rules. The Prime Minister visited Rosyth dockyard in Fife Kate Forbes told BBC Scotland that all green freeport applicants would have to stick to their commitments to net zero targets and fair work. She said: ""If a bidder fails to do so, we would look at this very carefully. We would expect bidders who set out promises to meet those promises. ""They will be required to deliver robust decarbonisation plans, demonstrating how they will move to net zero. A bidder will not win without it."" Under the UK government's model, freeports are centred around at least one air, rail or sea port, but can extend up to 28 miles (45km) beyond. Forth Ports - which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland - said it would be bidding to create a Firth of Forth green freeport. While other bidders have not yet been announced, in July last year the Scottish government named nine areas being considered - Shetland, Orkney, Aberdeen with Peterhead, Montrose, Dundee, Cairnryan, the Firth of Forth and Glasgow city region. A Cromarty Firth consortium is also understood to be interested. Freeports are one of Boris Johnson's big ideas to ""level up"" the country. He thinks they'll bring new investment and jobs to areas that lag behind. But he's even had to change their name - they're now ""green freeports"" here - to win backing from the Scottish government. It sounds petty, but the name is the tip of a large iceberg. Why? Imagine what they might create. These low tax zones could give rise to a little Singapore on the Cromarty Firth, where goods can be imported, assembled and exported without the usual taxes and paperwork. Firms inside the freeport could pay lower rates of VAT and employment tax. Nicola Sturgeon's team warns that could give rise to low wage, low value zones, which water down workers' rights and rules which protect the environment. So she's insisted that firms inside green freeports should pay the living wage, and commit to net-zero targets on climate change, and inclusive growth in local communities. You might wonder if this compromise can work. If freeports don't offer incentives, why would employers want to move there at all? If Scottish freeports are regulated more, will they be able to create new jobs, or compete with their English counterparts? The Scottish government wants to avoid a stampede of firms moving into a low-tax zone, without adding anything to the Scottish economy. So it's happy to pour cold water on one of Boris Johnson's dreams. Ian Murray, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, said the agreement had been ""delayed for months because the two governments disagreed over the name. ""As a result of their petty point-scoring, regions in England already have a head start."" The Scottish government and the UK Treasury will use their tax powers, including rates relief, to support the freeports. Last year, the Scottish government said UK ministers risked undermining devolution if they set up the freeports in Scotland or Wales without the backing of devolved governments. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:  ""I am delighted that people across Scotland will reap the benefits that will come from having two new green freeports. ""Freeports will help to accelerate our plan to level up communities across the whole of the United Kingdom. ""They have the power to be truly transformational by creating jobs and investment opportunities to enable people to reach their potential."" Dundee has previously been suggested as a potential location for a freeport Also called free trade zones, they are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in the zone pay lower taxes, such as reduced VAT and lower rates of employment tax. Critics argue they simply defer the point when import tariffs are paid, which then still need to be paid at some stage. Will freeports help the economy? Mr Johnson began his trip to Scotland on Monday with a visit to Rosyth dockyard in Fife. He is not expected to meet Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross - who has called for him to stand down over parties held in Downing Street during lockdown - despite Mr Johnson beinginvited to address the Scottish Conservative conferencein Aberdeen next month. On his visit, Mr Johnson said he was ""working very hard with colleagues in Scotland"" on a joint agenda of ""uniting and levelling up"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford branded the trip ""a walking advert for Scottish independence"". He said Mr Johnson should ""apologise for the damage he has inflicted on Scotland and hand in his resignation"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's visit made ""the case for the Union harder"" and that ""this prime minister does not help that cause"".

"Big banks fund new oil despite net zero pledgesInvestors should force banks to demand green plans before funding fuel firms, campaigners say.Business","Big banks are pumping billions into new oil and gas production despite net zero pledges, campaigners have said. Banks including HSBC, Barclays and Deutsche Bank are still backing new oil and gas despite being part of a green banking group, ShareAction said. Investors should force banks to demand green plans from fossil fuel firms before funding them, it said. HSBC and Barclays said they were focused on achieving environmental goals. ""Net zero"" means not adding to greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere by cutting and trying to balance out emissions. If the Earth is to avoid damaging environmental effects, including more extreme weather, it needs to limit average global warming to below 1.5 degrees centigrade. To achieve this, we need to get to net zero by 2050,experts have said,external. As part of getting to net zero, the International Energy Agency has saidthere should be no new oil and natural gas fields,external. But big banks are continuing to fund oil and gas expansion with billions of dollars, ShareAction said, despite being part of a UN-led group calledthe Net Zero Banking Alliance,external. What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing? Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? HSBC put an estimated $8.7bn (Â£6.4bn) into new oil and gas in 2021, while Barclays put in $4.5bn, and Deutsche Bank loaned $5.7bn, the campaign group estimated. The fossil fuel giants receiving the funding included Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, and Saudi Aramco. This is a big drop from 2020, when HSBC alone pumped more than $18bn into new oil and gas, and there were big drops in funding across the board between 2020 and 2021, according to figures from consultancy Profundo. ShareAction said this was due to banks focussing on providing pandemic-related loans to keep fossil fuel firms afloat during the pandemic, and that in 2021 funding returned to pre-pandemic levels. Since joining the Net Zero Banking Alliance last year, 24 big banks have provided $33bn for new oil and gas projects, with more than half of that amount ($19bn) coming from four of the founding members - HSBC, Barclays, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, the campaigners said. ShareAction urged big investors to demand that banks restrict finance for oil and gas expansion, saying funding new oil and gas is a lose-lose for banks and investors. Xavier Lerin, ShareAction senior research manager, said: ""If oil and gas demand decreases in line with 1.5C scenarios, prices will fall and assets will become stranded. ""On the other hand, if demand does not fall enough to limit global warming to 1.5C, the economy will suffer from severe physical climate impacts. ""Either way, value will be destroyed for energy companies, banks and their investors."" The campaign group added: ""Banks say that they want to help their clients to transition away from fossil fuels, but there is little evidence for this claim."" ""Most banks - HSBC included - are not demanding transition plans from clients, raising doubts about their commitment to this transition,"" it added. But an HSBC spokesman said the bank was ""committed to working with our customers to achieve a transition towards a thriving low carbon economy"". The bank published its policy to phase out funding coal for energy production in December, and said its oil and gas net zero financing plans would be published on 22 February in its annual report. Barclays said it ""continues to engage with a broad range of stakeholders on climate and sustainability topics"". ""We continue to focus on our ambition to become a net zero bank by 2050, and our commitment to align our financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement,"" a spokeswoman said. Barclays has a target of a 15% reduction in financed emissions from energy, including coal, oil and gas, by 2025. ""We also have restrictions around the direct financing of new oil and gas exploration projects in the Arctic or financing for companies primarily engaged in oil and gas exploration and production in this region,"" the spokeswoman added. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said: ""Carbon intensive sectors account for only a small share of our loan book and based on publicly available data our lending and underwriting activity in fossil fuels is significantly smaller than global peers'. ""Moreover, our aim is to support all of our customers as we transition to a net zero world."" Deutsche Bank said it was ""well under way"" to hitting green and social targets of â¬200bn (Â£170bn) by 2023, including ""an intense dialogue with clients to move from high-carbon business models towards low and no-carbon ones"". The spokesman added: ""We have committed to align the operational and attributable emissions from our portfolio with pathways to net-zero by 2050 or sooner. ""This includes measuring and subsequently disclosing the carbon intensity of our loan portfolio and developing and disclosing plans to adjust its footprint in accordance with national and international climate targets by end of this year."" BNP Paribas, which was also named in the ShareAction report, said: ""As the leading bank in continental Europe, BNP Paribas is a major financier of European energy companies that are largely committed to transitioning their model through strong investments in developing renewable energies."" The bank said it is ""convinced that these players, due to their technical and financial capacities, have the levers necessary to accelerate transition by developing renewable energy and other transformative solutions"". Meanwhile, oil giant Exxon Mobil said that the International Energy Agency and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ""agree that significant investment in oil and gas is still needed in Paris-aligned scenarios"". It said that even in the IEA net zero scenario, ""additional investment of approximately $11tn through 2050 would be required in both oil and natural gas development to meet the world's energy demand"". BP said it ""has a net zero ambition and we have set out a strategy to deliver it"". ""Resilient hydrocarbons are a core part of our strategy, but we are not aiming to grow our oil and gas production - we expect to see production fall 40% from 2019 to 2030. ""We expect to hold investment in oil and gas flat over this decade as output falls, while at the same time expanding our spending in transition growth businesses - including EV charging, convenience, renewables, hydrogen and bioenergy -  to around 50% of the total by 2030,"" BP added.

Two 'green freeports' to be established in Scotland,"The Scottish and UK governments have agreed to establish two green freeports in Scotland. The special economic zones, offering tax breaks and lower business tariffs, are being promoted by the UK government as part of its ""levelling-up"" agenda. The Scottish Greens, the SNP's Scottish government partners, criticised the plans as ""greenwashing"" and said it was a ""corporate giveaway"". The deal comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson visits Scotland. A bidding process will begin in the spring and it is hoped the new sites will open in 2023. Green commitment demanded in freeport talks What are freeports and where will they be? Ministers from both the Scottish and UK governments will have a say in the assessment and selection process. The governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border,after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later saidthey would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. Freeports allow firms to import goods and then re-export them outside normal tax and customs rules Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said: ""We have been able to reach an agreement on a joint approach that enshrines the Scottish government's commitment to achieving net zero and embedding fair work practices through public investment. ""The establishment of green freeports will help us create new green jobs, deliver a just transition and support our economic transformation."" The UK government has committed funding of Â£52m to the project and bidders will have to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. However, in the first major split from the SNP since they signed a power-sharing deal last year, the Scottish Greens criticised the plans as ""greenwashing"". Finance spokesman Ross Greer toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme that his party wanted nothing to do with ""these so-called green freeports"". He said: ""There is nothing genuinely green about them. Freeports are a really effective way to give tax relief and throw public money at multinational companies who are already doing their best to avoid tax. ""The SNP used to oppose freeports for exactly the same reason the Scottish Greens still do. ""Internationally, freeports are associated with crime, money laundering, smuggling, low wages."" Mr Greer said that there was ""no actual solid requirements"" to meet climate targets or stick to fair work practices, and that it was ""naive"" to expect large corporations to adhere to these rules. The Prime Minister visited Rosyth dockyard in Fife Kate Forbes told BBC Scotland that all green freeport applicants would have to stick to their commitments to net zero targets and fair work. She said: ""If a bidder fails to do so, we would look at this very carefully. We would expect bidders who set out promises to meet those promises. ""They will be required to deliver robust decarbonisation plans, demonstrating how they will move to net zero. A bidder will not win without it."" Under the UK government's model, freeports are centred around at least one air, rail or sea port, but can extend up to 28 miles (45km) beyond. Forth Ports - which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland - said it would be bidding to create a Firth of Forth green freeport. While other bidders have not yet been announced, in July last year the Scottish government named nine areas being considered - Shetland, Orkney, Aberdeen with Peterhead, Montrose, Dundee, Cairnryan, the Firth of Forth and Glasgow city region. A Cromarty Firth consortium is also understood to be interested. Freeports are one of Boris Johnson's big ideas to ""level up"" the country. He thinks they'll bring new investment and jobs to areas that lag behind. But he's even had to change their name - they're now ""green freeports"" here - to win backing from the Scottish government. It sounds petty, but the name is the tip of a large iceberg. Why? Imagine what they might create. These low tax zones could give rise to a little Singapore on the Cromarty Firth, where goods can be imported, assembled and exported without the usual taxes and paperwork. Firms inside the freeport could pay lower rates of VAT and employment tax. Nicola Sturgeon's team warns that could give rise to low wage, low value zones, which water down workers' rights and rules which protect the environment. So she's insisted that firms inside green freeports should pay the living wage, and commit to net-zero targets on climate change, and inclusive growth in local communities. You might wonder if this compromise can work. If freeports don't offer incentives, why would employers want to move there at all? If Scottish freeports are regulated more, will they be able to create new jobs, or compete with their English counterparts? The Scottish government wants to avoid a stampede of firms moving into a low-tax zone, without adding anything to the Scottish economy. So it's happy to pour cold water on one of Boris Johnson's dreams. Ian Murray, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, said the agreement had been ""delayed for months because the two governments disagreed over the name. ""As a result of their petty point-scoring, regions in England already have a head start."" The Scottish government and the UK Treasury will use their tax powers, including rates relief, to support the freeports. Last year, the Scottish government said UK ministers risked undermining devolution if they set up the freeports in Scotland or Wales without the backing of devolved governments. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:  ""I am delighted that people across Scotland will reap the benefits that will come from having two new green freeports. ""Freeports will help to accelerate our plan to level up communities across the whole of the United Kingdom. ""They have the power to be truly transformational by creating jobs and investment opportunities to enable people to reach their potential.""

Rams beat Bengals for late Super Bowl win,"The Los Angeles Rams scored a late touchdown to beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 in Super Bowl 56. The Bengals looked set to win their first Super Bowl - just two years after being the NFL's worst team. But the Rams' star-studded roster produced when it mattered most, with quarterback Matthew Stafford leading a game-winning 15-play drive. With just one minute 25 seconds left, Cooper Kupp scored his second touchdown to give the Rams a second NFL title. The wide receiver, 28, was named the game's Most Valuable Player, adding to theOffensive Player of the Yearaward he won last week. Super Bowl 56 - as it happened With the game taking place at SoFi Stadium, the Rams are only the second team to win a Super Bowl in their own stadium after the Tampa Bay Buccaneersachieved the featlast year. Victory also vindicated their decision to return to Los Angeles from St Louis six years ago. Although they reached the NFL's championship game at the end of their third season back in California,losing to the New England Patriots,they then traded away a flurry of future draft picks to rebuild their squad. Built at a cost of $5bn (Â£3.7bn) by Rams and Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke, the SoFi Stadium earned the right to stage the first Super Bowl in the LA region since 1993 and the Rams went all in to ensure they were part of the big show. The gamble paid off as they not only reached their fifth Super Bowl but delivered a Hollywood ending. Cooper Kupp (left) finished the 2021 season with 178 catches, 2,425 yards and 22 touchdowns from 21 games The Rams gave up significant draft capital to bring in Stafford, linebacker Von Miller and cornerback Jalen Ramsey, while Odell Beckham Jr was picked up as a free agent in November. Stafford and Beckham, in particular, have enjoyed a new lease of life in LA after being starved of success with the Detroit Lions and New York Giants respectively. Stafford tied for a career-high 41 touchdowns in the regular season before claiming his first play-off win - in his 186th NFL game - while Beckham scored his first play-off touchdown. Beckham's second opened the scoring on the Rams' second possession of Super Bowl 56, before Stafford made an 11-yard touchdown pass to Kupp to give them a 13-3 lead early in the second quarter. The Bengals hit straight back to make it 13-10, but on the Rams' next possession Beckham dropped a catch and immediately clutched his left knee. Van Jefferson's wife leaves Super Bowl to give birth The receiver did not return to the game and, after the Bengals went 20-13 up early in the third quarter, the defences took charge. LA eked out a field goal and, with 6mins 13secs on the clock, Stafford knew this was the time to show the Rams were right to trade Jared Goff and three draft picks for him last March. With the Super Bowl on the line, the 34-year-old relied on the man he helped to secure the receiving triple crown of most catches, yards and touchdowns in the regular season. Stafford found Kupp five times on the drive, capped by his third touchdown pass, to put the Rams back in front and finish with 283 passing yards. Defensive tackle Aaron Donald then made a tackle to stop the Bengals getting a first down before forcing quarterback Joe Burrow to throw the ball away under pressure on fourth and one. The three-time Defensive Player of the Year finished with eight pressures, including two sacks. Donald and the Rams' defence piled the pressure on Burrow in the second half Unlike the Rams, Cincinnati used the draft to turn around their fortunes in the past couple of years, selecting Burrow with the first pick in 2020 and receiver Ja'Marr Chase, his former college team-mate, with the fifth pick in 2021. The Bengals opted for Chase rather than an offensive lineman, which would have given their franchise quarterback greater protection. Although Cincinnati still have one of the NFL's most porous offensive lines, Burrow became the first quarterback to reach the Super Bowl after leading the league in times sacked (51). That was mainly because of his connection with Chase, who claimed a rookie record for receiving yards this season and the Rookie of the Year award. After leading the Bengals to their first Super Bowl in 33 years, they connected again for 46 yards to set up a successful field-goal attempt late in the first quarter. When the Rams went 13-3 up, Cincinnati hit straight back with a 12-play scoring drive ending with a trick play, Burrow shovelling it off to running back Joe Mixon to find Tee Higgins for a six-yard touchdown. Higgins scored again with a huge play from the first play after half-time, although he appeared to pull Ramsey's facemask before catching Burrow's deep pass to the sideline and running in a 75-yard score. An interception on the next play resulted in another field goal to put the Bengals 20-13 up, but then LA began to capitalise on the visitors' Achilles heel. The Bengals offensive line allowed Burrow to be sacked seven times as defences forced a run of seven straight punts - four of them by the Bengals - before the Rams ended Cincinnati's hopes of completing their Cinderella story. Burrow was sacked 19 times in the play-offs, surpassing the previous record of 14 Burrow's average time to throw was 2.41 seconds, tied for his fastest of the season Kupp claimed the most catches in a single post-season (33) Kupp is the first player to hit the triple crown, win Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP in the same season At 36 year 20 days, Sean McVay became the youngest head coach to win a Super Bowl Rams head coach Sean McVay:""It feels outstanding. I am so proud of this team. We talk all the time about competitive greatness, about being your best when your best is required and Matt gets to finish it off - it is poetic. ""Those guys did a great job - they took over the game. World champs baby!"" Rams quarterback Matt Stafford:""I just thank the coach for saying 'you and Cooper Kupp go and get this thing done', and calling plays for him. ""I kept finding ways to get him the ball, and he kept making unbelievable plays. That is what he does."" Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp:""I'm just so thankful. These guys here, they challenge me, they push me and they make it so much fun coming into work every day."" Aaron Donald:""I wanted this so bad, I feel amazing. It was one last play to be world champs, and we made a play and won so that's all that matters."" Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (on Twitter):""Sorry we couldn't get it done. Proud of our team and our fans. Love these guys."" Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Dr Dre, Mary J Blige, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg performed at half-time By Steven McIntosh, Entertainment reporter With five joint headliners, the question hanging over 2022's hip-hop half-time show was how to do justice to the stars' sizeable back catalogues. But Dr Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Mary J Blige and Kendrick Lamar struck the perfect balance between packing in as many monster hits as possible, while also giving each one - and each other - time to breathe. Eminem takes the knee as Dr Dre plays Super Bowl And as if five headliners weren't enough, 50 Cent made his Super Bowl debut by hanging upside down, a recreation of his most famous music video for his most famous song, In Da Club. He might have been a little out of breath, but the crowd went wild. Curse words were replaced with family-friendly lyrics, and the only thing vaguely approaching controversy came when Eminem took to the stage, taking the knee towards the end of his performance.

What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing? Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? HSBC put an estimated $8.7bn (Â£6.4bn) into new oil and gas in 2021, while Barclays put in $4.5bn, and Deutsche Bank loaned $5.7bn, the campaign group estimated. The fossil fuel giants receiving the funding included Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, and Saudi Aramco.

Big banks fund new oil despite net zero pledges,"Big banks are pumping billions into new oil and gas production despite net zero pledges, campaigners have said. Banks including HSBC, Barclays and Deutsche Bank are still backing new oil and gas despite being part of a green banking group, ShareAction said. Investors should force banks to demand green plans from fossil fuel firms before funding them, it said. HSBC and Barclays said they were focused on achieving environmental goals. ""Net zero"" means not adding to greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere by cutting and trying to balance out emissions. If the Earth is to avoid damaging environmental effects, including more extreme weather, it needs to limit average global warming to below 1.5 degrees centigrade. To achieve this, we need to get to net zero by 2050,experts have said,external. As part of getting to net zero, the International Energy Agency has saidthere should be no new oil and natural gas fields,external. But big banks are continuing to fund oil and gas expansion with billions of dollars, ShareAction said, despite being part of a UN-led group calledthe Net Zero Banking Alliance,external. What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing? Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? HSBC put an estimated $8.7bn (Â£6.4bn) into new oil and gas in 2021, while Barclays put in $4.5bn, and Deutsche Bank loaned $5.7bn, the campaign group estimated. The fossil fuel giants receiving the funding included Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, and Saudi Aramco. This is a big drop from 2020, when HSBC alone pumped more than $18bn into new oil and gas, and there were big drops in funding across the board between 2020 and 2021, according to figures from consultancy Profundo. ShareAction said this was due to banks focussing on providing pandemic-related loans to keep fossil fuel firms afloat during the pandemic, and that in 2021 funding returned to pre-pandemic levels. Since joining the Net Zero Banking Alliance last year, 24 big banks have provided $33bn for new oil and gas projects, with more than half of that amount ($19bn) coming from four of the founding members - HSBC, Barclays, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, the campaigners said. ShareAction urged big investors to demand that banks restrict finance for oil and gas expansion, saying funding new oil and gas is a lose-lose for banks and investors. Xavier Lerin, ShareAction senior research manager, said: ""If oil and gas demand decreases in line with 1.5C scenarios, prices will fall and assets will become stranded. ""On the other hand, if demand does not fall enough to limit global warming to 1.5C, the economy will suffer from severe physical climate impacts. ""Either way, value will be destroyed for energy companies, banks and their investors."" The campaign group added: ""Banks say that they want to help their clients to transition away from fossil fuels, but there is little evidence for this claim."" ""Most banks - HSBC included - are not demanding transition plans from clients, raising doubts about their commitment to this transition,"" it added.

Two 'green freeports' to be established in ScotlandThe Scottish and UK governments agree the deal as Boris Johnson is expected to visit Scotland.Scotland politics,"The Scottish and UK governments have agreed to establish two green freeports in Scotland. The special economic zones, offering tax breaks and lower business tariffs, are being promoted by the UK government as part of its ""levelling-up"" agenda. The Scottish Greens, the SNP's Scottish government partners, criticised the plans as ""greenwashing"" and said it was a ""corporate giveaway"". The deal comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson visits Scotland. A bidding process will begin in the spring and it is hoped the new sites will open in 2023. Green commitment demanded in freeport talks What are freeports and where will they be? Ministers from both the Scottish and UK governments will have a say in the assessment and selection process. The governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border,after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later saidthey would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. Freeports allow firms to import goods and then re-export them outside normal tax and customs rules Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said: ""We have been able to reach an agreement on a joint approach that enshrines the Scottish government's commitment to achieving net zero and embedding fair work practices through public investment. ""The establishment of green freeports will help us create new green jobs, deliver a just transition and support our economic transformation."" The UK government has committed funding of Â£52m to the project and bidders will have to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. However, in the first major split from the SNP since they signed a power-sharing deal last year, the Scottish Greens criticised the plans as ""greenwashing"". Finance spokesman Ross Greer toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme that his party wanted nothing to do with ""these so-called green freeports"". He said: ""There is nothing genuinely green about them. Freeports are a really effective way to give tax relief and throw public money at multinational companies who are already doing their best to avoid tax. ""The SNP used to oppose freeports for exactly the same reason the Scottish Greens still do. ""Internationally, freeports are associated with crime, money laundering, smuggling, low wages."" Mr Greer said that there was ""no actual solid requirements"" to meet climate targets or stick to fair work practices, and that it was ""naive"" to expect large corporations to adhere to these rules. The Prime Minister visited Rosyth dockyard in Fife Kate Forbes told BBC Scotland that all green freeport applicants would have to stick to their commitments to net zero targets and fair work. She said: ""If a bidder fails to do so, we would look at this very carefully. We would expect bidders who set out promises to meet those promises. ""They will be required to deliver robust decarbonisation plans, demonstrating how they will move to net zero. A bidder will not win without it."" Under the UK government's model, freeports are centred around at least one air, rail or sea port, but can extend up to 28 miles (45km) beyond. Forth Ports - which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland - said it would be bidding to create a Firth of Forth green freeport. While other bidders have not yet been announced, in July last year the Scottish government named nine areas being considered - Shetland, Orkney, Aberdeen with Peterhead, Montrose, Dundee, Cairnryan, the Firth of Forth and Glasgow city region. A Cromarty Firth consortium is also understood to be interested. Freeports are one of Boris Johnson's big ideas to ""level up"" the country. He thinks they'll bring new investment and jobs to areas that lag behind. But he's even had to change their name - they're now ""green freeports"" here - to win backing from the Scottish government. It sounds petty, but the name is the tip of a large iceberg. Why? Imagine what they might create. These low tax zones could give rise to a little Singapore on the Cromarty Firth, where goods can be imported, assembled and exported without the usual taxes and paperwork. Firms inside the freeport could pay lower rates of VAT and employment tax. Nicola Sturgeon's team warns that could give rise to low wage, low value zones, which water down workers' rights and rules which protect the environment. So she's insisted that firms inside green freeports should pay the living wage, and commit to net-zero targets on climate change, and inclusive growth in local communities. You might wonder if this compromise can work. If freeports don't offer incentives, why would employers want to move there at all? If Scottish freeports are regulated more, will they be able to create new jobs, or compete with their English counterparts? The Scottish government wants to avoid a stampede of firms moving into a low-tax zone, without adding anything to the Scottish economy. So it's happy to pour cold water on one of Boris Johnson's dreams. Ian Murray, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, said the agreement had been ""delayed for months because the two governments disagreed over the name. ""As a result of their petty point-scoring, regions in England already have a head start."" The Scottish government and the UK Treasury will use their tax powers, including rates relief, to support the freeports. Last year, the Scottish government said UK ministers risked undermining devolution if they set up the freeports in Scotland or Wales without the backing of devolved governments. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:  ""I am delighted that people across Scotland will reap the benefits that will come from having two new green freeports. ""Freeports will help to accelerate our plan to level up communities across the whole of the United Kingdom. ""They have the power to be truly transformational by creating jobs and investment opportunities to enable people to reach their potential."" Dundee has previously been suggested as a potential location for a freeport Also called free trade zones, they are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in the zone pay lower taxes, such as reduced VAT and lower rates of employment tax. Critics argue they simply defer the point when import tariffs are paid, which then still need to be paid at some stage. Will freeports help the economy? Mr Johnson began his trip to Scotland on Monday with a visit to Rosyth dockyard in Fife. He is not expected to meet Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross - who has called for him to stand down over parties held in Downing Street during lockdown - despite Mr Johnson beinginvited to address the Scottish Conservative conferencein Aberdeen next month. On his visit, Mr Johnson said he was ""working very hard with colleagues in Scotland"" on a joint agenda of ""uniting and levelling up"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford branded the trip ""a walking advert for Scottish independence"". He said Mr Johnson should ""apologise for the damage he has inflicted on Scotland and hand in his resignation"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's visit made ""the case for the Union harder"" and that ""this prime minister does not help that cause"".

Rams beat Bengals for late Super Bowl winThe Los Angeles Rams claim a 23-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl 56.,"The Los Angeles Rams scored a late touchdown to beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 in Super Bowl 56. The Bengals looked set to win their first Super Bowl - just two years after being the NFL's worst team. But the Rams' star-studded roster produced when it mattered most, with quarterback Matthew Stafford leading a game-winning 15-play drive. With just one minute 25 seconds left, Cooper Kupp scored his second touchdown to give the Rams a second NFL title. The wide receiver, 28, was named the game's Most Valuable Player, adding to theOffensive Player of the Yearaward he won last week. Super Bowl 56 - as it happened With the game taking place at SoFi Stadium, the Rams are only the second team to win a Super Bowl in their own stadium after the Tampa Bay Buccaneersachieved the featlast year. Victory also vindicated their decision to return to Los Angeles from St Louis six years ago. Although they reached the NFL's championship game at the end of their third season back in California,losing to the New England Patriots,they then traded away a flurry of future draft picks to rebuild their squad. Built at a cost of $5bn (Â£3.7bn) by Rams and Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke, the SoFi Stadium earned the right to stage the first Super Bowl in the LA region since 1993 and the Rams went all in to ensure they were part of the big show. The gamble paid off as they not only reached their fifth Super Bowl but delivered a Hollywood ending. Cooper Kupp (left) finished the 2021 season with 178 catches, 2,425 yards and 22 touchdowns from 21 games The Rams gave up significant draft capital to bring in Stafford, linebacker Von Miller and cornerback Jalen Ramsey, while Odell Beckham Jr was picked up as a free agent in November. Stafford and Beckham, in particular, have enjoyed a new lease of life in LA after being starved of success with the Detroit Lions and New York Giants respectively. Stafford tied for a career-high 41 touchdowns in the regular season before claiming his first play-off win - in his 186th NFL game - while Beckham scored his first play-off touchdown. Beckham's second opened the scoring on the Rams' second possession of Super Bowl 56, before Stafford made an 11-yard touchdown pass to Kupp to give them a 13-3 lead early in the second quarter. The Bengals hit straight back to make it 13-10, but on the Rams' next possession Beckham dropped a catch and immediately clutched his left knee. Van Jefferson's wife leaves Super Bowl to give birth The receiver did not return to the game and, after the Bengals went 20-13 up early in the third quarter, the defences took charge. LA eked out a field goal and, with 6mins 13secs on the clock, Stafford knew this was the time to show the Rams were right to trade Jared Goff and three draft picks for him last March. With the Super Bowl on the line, the 34-year-old relied on the man he helped to secure the receiving triple crown of most catches, yards and touchdowns in the regular season. Stafford found Kupp five times on the drive, capped by his third touchdown pass, to put the Rams back in front and finish with 283 passing yards. Defensive tackle Aaron Donald then made a tackle to stop the Bengals getting a first down before forcing quarterback Joe Burrow to throw the ball away under pressure on fourth and one. The three-time Defensive Player of the Year finished with eight pressures, including two sacks. Donald and the Rams' defence piled the pressure on Burrow in the second half Unlike the Rams, Cincinnati used the draft to turn around their fortunes in the past couple of years, selecting Burrow with the first pick in 2020 and receiver Ja'Marr Chase, his former college team-mate, with the fifth pick in 2021. The Bengals opted for Chase rather than an offensive lineman, which would have given their franchise quarterback greater protection. Although Cincinnati still have one of the NFL's most porous offensive lines, Burrow became the first quarterback to reach the Super Bowl after leading the league in times sacked (51). That was mainly because of his connection with Chase, who claimed a rookie record for receiving yards this season and the Rookie of the Year award. After leading the Bengals to their first Super Bowl in 33 years, they connected again for 46 yards to set up a successful field-goal attempt late in the first quarter. When the Rams went 13-3 up, Cincinnati hit straight back with a 12-play scoring drive ending with a trick play, Burrow shovelling it off to running back Joe Mixon to find Tee Higgins for a six-yard touchdown. Higgins scored again with a huge play from the first play after half-time, although he appeared to pull Ramsey's facemask before catching Burrow's deep pass to the sideline and running in a 75-yard score. An interception on the next play resulted in another field goal to put the Bengals 20-13 up, but then LA began to capitalise on the visitors' Achilles heel. The Bengals offensive line allowed Burrow to be sacked seven times as defences forced a run of seven straight punts - four of them by the Bengals - before the Rams ended Cincinnati's hopes of completing their Cinderella story. Burrow was sacked 19 times in the play-offs, surpassing the previous record of 14 Burrow's average time to throw was 2.41 seconds, tied for his fastest of the season Kupp claimed the most catches in a single post-season (33) Kupp is the first player to hit the triple crown, win Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP in the same season At 36 year 20 days, Sean McVay became the youngest head coach to win a Super Bowl Rams head coach Sean McVay:""It feels outstanding. I am so proud of this team. We talk all the time about competitive greatness, about being your best when your best is required and Matt gets to finish it off - it is poetic. ""Those guys did a great job - they took over the game. World champs baby!"" Rams quarterback Matt Stafford:""I just thank the coach for saying 'you and Cooper Kupp go and get this thing done', and calling plays for him. ""I kept finding ways to get him the ball, and he kept making unbelievable plays. That is what he does."" Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp:""I'm just so thankful. These guys here, they challenge me, they push me and they make it so much fun coming into work every day."" Aaron Donald:""I wanted this so bad, I feel amazing. It was one last play to be world champs, and we made a play and won so that's all that matters."" Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (on Twitter):""Sorry we couldn't get it done. Proud of our team and our fans. Love these guys."" Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Dr Dre, Mary J Blige, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg performed at half-time By Steven McIntosh, Entertainment reporter With five joint headliners, the question hanging over 2022's hip-hop half-time show was how to do justice to the stars' sizeable back catalogues. But Dr Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Mary J Blige and Kendrick Lamar struck the perfect balance between packing in as many monster hits as possible, while also giving each one - and each other - time to breathe. Eminem takes the knee as Dr Dre plays Super Bowl And as if five headliners weren't enough, 50 Cent made his Super Bowl debut by hanging upside down, a recreation of his most famous music video for his most famous song, In Da Club. He might have been a little out of breath, but the crowd went wild. Curse words were replaced with family-friendly lyrics, and the only thing vaguely approaching controversy came when Eminem took to the stage, taking the knee towards the end of his performance.

Energy firm sorry for Â£2.3tn compensation errorCustomers hit by power cuts in Storm Arwen erroneously received cheques for trillions of pounds.,"Gareth Hughes received a cheque for more than Â£2.3tn An energy firm has apologised after 74 customers hit by power cuts during Storm Arwen accidentally received compensation cheques for trillions of pounds. Northern Powergrid is paying tens of thousands of pounds to customers hit by days of outages in November. But a number with Halifax and Newcastle postcodes received cheques made out for 13-figure sums. Northern Powergrid said a clerical error was to blame. Pictures of the erroneous cheques have been circulating on social media days after the firmwas criticised for taking months to process compensation claims. Gareth Hughes, 44, from Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, shared a picture of his cheque for more than Â£2.3tn. Mr Hughes, who was without power for more than three days, said he had been sent a previous cheque for Â£135 but had complained as he was told he was entitled to more. He said the new cheque made him smile, adding: ""But I knew it wasn't a value that could be realistic."" Mr Hughes was without power for more than three days during Storm Arwen A spokeswoman for Northern Powergrid said an electricity meter reference was incorrectly quoted as the payment sum.

LiveLiveSuper Bowl 56: Rams beat Bengals in dramatic finale - watch & follow text3 minutes ago,"Final score: Rams 23-20 Bengals Cooper Kupp scores two TDs - including winning score - as he is named Super Bowl MVP Bengals QB Joe Burrow brought down by Aaron Donald in dying seconds to seal Rams' second Super Bowl victory Rams lose wide receiver Odell Beckham Jnr to knee injury in first half Get involved: #BBCNFL Paul Higham and Ben Collins Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals What a season it's been, and what a victory that was for the Los Angeles Rams inside their own SoFi Stadium. They dominated early, lost Odell Beckham to injury, then were rocked by an early second-half blitz by the Cincinnati Bengals. Aaron Donald and the defence stopped Joe Burrow in his tracks though before Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp led the game-winning drive late one. It means vindication for owner Stan Kroenke for moving the team back to LA, splashing out 5bn on this stadium and sanctioning their ambitious plans of assembling their star-studded squad. Read our full report on Super Bowl 56and watch out for more highlights and reaction on the website. Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals Sean McVay is the youngest head coach ever to win a Super Bowl, and have his side just shown a new way to go about bringing success in the NFL? They've gone against the grain and used their draft picks in trades for older, established stars, and being fine with missing out on first round college players. It's hard to argue when Von Miller and Matthew Stafford both had such a huge impact on the game, while the free agent they brought in Odell Beckham Jr was also starring before he got injured. They say it's a copycat league in the NFL, so will teams try and win the Super Bowl the Rams way from now on? Watch this space. Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals Well, there we have it - the team built to win a Super Bowl claims the trophy in their stadium built to host it. It has kind of a nice ring to it as the Los Angeles Rams get their Hollywood ending to the season. They paid a high price for Matthew Stafford but their QB stepped up when he needed to right at the end, along with two players they drafted - Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald. It was a fine effort by Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase and the Bengals, who also played well on defence, but their downfall was exactly where we expected it to be - protecting Burrow. Burrow was sacked seven times tonight - and even with his obvious talents he just didn't have enough time to respond. You get the sense Burrow will be back though, and the Rams just about deserved to win overall. Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals Cooper Kupp has been a revelation this season and been the dominant receiver in the NFL - in just his first season playing with new QB Matthew Stafford. He could be even better next season... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals Matthew Staffordcame up huge in the fourth quarter making big throws in big moments, including the game-winning pass to Cooper Kupp. But he was full of praise for his team-mates following the win. ""I am so proud of this team,"" he said. ""There are so many guys that deserve this, so many guys who have given their hearts and souls to this team. ""I just thank for coach [McVay] for saying you and Cooper Kupp go and get this thing done and calling plays for him.

He's won plenty of individual honours but has always wanted a Super Bowl ring. ""I'm just so happy, I wanted this so bad, I feel amazing,"" Donald said on the field. ""It was one last play to be world champs, and we made a play and won so that's all that matters. ""This is the best feeling in the world, I don't know what to say."" There was talk of Donald retiring if the Rams won the Super Bowl, but he's not thinking about anything but celebrating. ""I'm in the moment, I just want to enjoy this right now with these guys and my kids and live in the moment for now."" Los Angeles Rams 23-20 Cincinnati Bengals That's the end of the game, and the Los Angeles Rams become the second straight team to win the Super Bowl in their home stadium after a tough old battle with the Cincinnati Bengals. It was mainly a defensive scuffle but that final drive led by Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp, then the final play aptly from Aaron Donald sealed a hard-fought victory. The Rams built this team for this moment, and they delivered when they had to.

Inquiry to examine Post Office wrongful convictionsMore than 700 sub-postmasters and mistresses were wrongly convicted due to a flawed computer system.,"Sub-postmasters and mistresses celebrated the quashing of their convictions The wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses will be examined by a public inquiry starting on Monday. Between 2000 and 2014, more than 700 sub-postmasters were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting due to a flaw in a computer system Horizon. A total of 72 former sub-postmasters have had their names cleared so far. The cases constitute the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. The inquiry - which is expected to run for the rest of this year - will look at whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system and will also ask how staff shouldered the blame. It will also examine whether staff at software firm Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon software to complete tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking, knew the system had flaws while data from it was used in court to convict sub-postmasters. A judge will hear evidence on why sub-postmasters and postmistresses were singled out and whether they have been justly compensated. Ahead of the inquiry, Baljit Sethi, who will be the first witness to give evidence on Monday, told the BBC he was looking forward to it. ""What the Post Office has done to us - and to many of my colleagues - is unforgiveable,"" he said. ""The people who did this should be brought to justice."" Baljit Sethi (centre right) and his family spoke to the BBC ahead of the inquiry's start His wife Anjana, who also helped run two branches near Romford in Essex, said she now felt ""we can see some light at the end of this dark tunnel"". One branch had no problems at all, but the second one showed a hole in the accounts of Â£17,000, which they were asked to cover out of their own pocket. The Sethis were never charged but still faced a financial and emotional nightmare. Their son Amit added: ""I want accountability and those who suffered should be compensated appropriately. ""That's it - then we'll draw a line under it."" Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? 'I want someone else charged and jailed like I was' Harjinder Butoy, who ran the post office in the Nottinghamshire market town of Sutton-in-Ashfield along with his wife, said that he wanted to see ""someone on the other side to be charged and jailed like I was"". ""They are the ones who signed the final paper work off,"" he told the BBC. ""They are the ones who knew if there were any faults on the system or not."" Mr Butoy, who is thought to have been given the longest prison sentence at three years and four months, was wrongly convicted and jailed for stealing Â£208,000 and it took until last year to gethis conviction overturned in the Court of Appeal. Mr Butoy said he noticed the Horizon accounting software was not adding up properly. ""I was Â£500 short,"" he explained, even though a supervisor had been with him the entire time, making sure he got to grips in his new role. ""I didn't think anything of it. But ever since then, it happened a lot."" Thousands of others Post Office sub-postmasters lost huge sums of money as they tried to make up mysterious shortfalls at their shops, which the Post Office is only now beginning to refund. Many have described being shunned by their communities while some have since died. This video can not be played Watch: Tracy Felstead was sent to Holloway Prison for a crime she didn't commit The Post Office has said it is ""sincerely sorry"" for the impact of the Horizon scandal, adding it is ""in no doubt about the human cost"". It said the inquiry would enable ""many of those who were most deeply affected by Post Office's past failings to voice their experiences and their testimonies must and will ensure all lessons are learned so that such events can never happen again"". ""In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress,"" it added. The government has set aside funding to facilitate compensation payments. Meanwhile, Fujitsu said it was ""committed to providing the fullest and most transparent information so that key lessons are learned for the future"".

"Chinese streaming sites accused of censoring FriendsFans say key scenes have been deleted from the hit US sitcom, which has been re-released in China.","Friends ended in 2004 after 10 seasons but has remained hugely popular worldwide since then Several Chinese streaming platforms have been accused of censoring LGBT plotlines from hit US sitcom Friends. The show was re-released in China earlier this week on Tencent, Bilibili, Sohu, iQiyi and Alibaba's Youku. But Chinese fans have complained of scenes being deleted, including those that reference a lesbian character, and another featuring a same-sex kiss. It is unclear why the scenes have been removed, and none of the platforms have responded publicly to the accusations. The show, which ran from 1994-2004, is based in New York City and centres around a group of friends played by Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. Friends has a massive following in China, with many Chinese millennials crediting the show with teaching them English and introducing them to US culture. Sohu held broadcast rights between 2012 and 2018, and aired full, uncensored episodes at the time. China TV blurs Western brands over Xinjiang cotton Can Western brands recover in China after backlash? China changes Fight Club film ending But Chinese fans shared their dismay on social media about the re-release and its omissions. In one instance, dialogue was axed about the ex-wife of one character, Ross, who left him after she realised she was a lesbian. Incorrect subtitles were also used to downplay sexual references, the South China Morning Post reports. In one scene, the phrase ""multiple orgasms"" was translated to the Chinese phrase for ""women have endless gossips"". ""Not only does it ignore women's sexual desire and enjoyment... [it] also reinforces the gender stereotype of women,"" one user wrote on social media site Weibo, according to CNN. ""If you can't show the complete version under the current atmosphere, then don't import it,"" wrote another. Several users have called for a boycott of the show in protest. The hashtag #FriendsCensored has became a popular term on Weibo in recent days. But on Sunday, searches for the hashtag and other variations produced either zero or limited results - indicating discussions may have caught the attention of Chinese censors. Lady Gaga's appearance at a Friends reunion was cut from Chinese broadcasts last year In recent years, China has shut down tens of thousands of websites and social media accounts containing ""vulgar"" and pornographic content, and other material deemed illegal or anti-Chinese. Scenes featuring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and K-Pop band BTS were cut froma Friends reunion special aired last year. It's unclear why the musicians were removed from the final broadcast, but all three have previously been accused of insulting China. Lady Gaga, for example, has been banned from touring in the country after meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2016.
