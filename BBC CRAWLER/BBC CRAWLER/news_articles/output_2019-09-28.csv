Yemeni rebels claim mass capture of Saudi troops,"This video can not be played Unverified Houthi footage broadcast Houthi rebels in Yemen have released footage which they say shows a major attack on Saudi forces near the border between the two countries. On Saturday, a Houthi spokesman said three Saudi brigades had surrendered near the Saudi town of Najran. Saudi officials have not commented on the alleged assault. The video shows an attack on armoured vehicles, but there is so far no verification of the Houthi claim of a major military success. Colonel Yahiya Sarea alleged on Saturday that Saudi forces had suffered ""huge losses in life and machinery"", including ""thousands"" of its troops. All those captured would be paraded on the Houthi-run Al Masirah TV network, he said. Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? But the video broadcast on Sunday instead shows what appear to be rebels firing at vehicles on a road. This is followed by footage of several burnt-out vehicles, as well as assorted light weaponry laid out on the ground and a group of men not in military uniforms marching down a dirt road. Houthi rebels control much of northern Yemen In a news conference on Sunday, Col Sarea did not give a date for when the video was taken. He said the evidence of the attack could not be shown for security reasons. The Iran-aligned Houthis say they launched a drone and missile attack on Saudi oil facilities on 14 September which affected global markets. But the Saudis - backed by the US, UK, France and Germany - have all publicly blamed Iranfor the strike, allegations Tehran denies. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and his cabinet were forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis - which hold much of the north of the country. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries in air strikes against the rebels. The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. The civil war has triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with 80% of the population - more than 24 million people - requiring humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive. More than 70,000 people are believed to have died since 2016 as a result of the conflict, according to UN estimates.

PM's referral to watchdog 'politically motivated',"Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 A move to refer Boris Johnson to the police watchdog is ""a politically motivated attack"", a senior government source has said. The watchdog will decide whether or not to investigate the prime minister for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was London mayor. It is alleged businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. Mr Johnson has denied any impropriety. He was referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on Friday by the Greater London Authority's monitoring officer - whose job it is to oversee the conduct of the mayor and other members. The allegations regarding Mr Johnson's friendship with technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri first emerged last weekend inthe Sunday Times.,external They refer to claims that Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London and that her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. A senior government source said the timing of the referral, coming days before the start of the Conservative Party conference, was ""overtly political"". Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers said the issue had been ""blown out of all proportion"" and the complaint against Mr Johnson was ""politically motivated"". However, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn rejected the claim, saying the monitoring officer had made a ""wholly independent assessment"" and decided there were ""serious questions to answer"". PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims PM will explain Jennifer Arcuri links to City Hall The GLA's monitoring officer said it had referred the PM to the IOPC ""so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office"". It said it had recorded a ""conduct matter"" against Mr Johnson, which happens when there is information that indicates a criminal offence may have been committed. But it does not mean that a criminal offence is proved in any way, the monitoring officer added. The reason the IOPC is involved is because the role of the mayor of London is also London's police and crime commissioner. The IOPC deals with complaints against police forces in England and Wales. In a letter to Mr Johnson setting out the referral, the monitoring officer said it related to his time as London mayor between 2008 to 2016. ""During this time it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits,"" it said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Everything done in the proper way"" Responding to the referral, No 10 said: ""The prime minister, as Mayor of London, did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK. ""Everything was done with propriety and in the normal way."" A senior government source said ""no evidence of any allegations"" had been provided by the monitoring officer, nor was the prime minister given an opportunity to respond before a press release was published on Friday night. ""The public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job,"" the source added. Ms Villiers told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Prime Minister is very clear that proprieties were observed."" ""I do feel this is a distraction and it is people seeking to use the complaints process in a highly political way,"" the environment secretary added. By the BBC's Home Affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Ms Arcuri appearing on the BBC's Talking Business programme in 2013 The BBC has now spoken to several people who went on the overseas ""trade missions"" with Boris Johnson to Malaysia and Singapore, to New York, and to Tel Aviv. They said that Jennifer Arcuri seemed a bit out of place on the trips, as her companies were much less substantial than those of the other participants, Jennifer Arcuri was originally turned down for the trip to Malaysia and Singapore, but then re-applied using a different company and was accepted. She was told her companies were not relevant for the trip to New York, but she went under her own steam and was allowed into some of the events. She was also turned down for the Tel Aviv trip, but Boris Johnson's office intervened and she was allowed to join the trade mission. She paid for her own flight, and although the organisers of the trip, London & Partners, booked a hotel for her, she settled the bill. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson denied any wrongdoing, telling the BBC: ""All I can say is I am very proud of what we did as mayor of London... particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world."" He added: ""I can tell you that absolutely everything was done entirely in the proper way."" On Friday,Mr Johnson saidhe would comply with an order from the London Assembly to explain his links to Ms Arcuri. Separately, a junior minister, Matt Warman, has said the government has launched a ""review"" of the Â£100,000 award made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's training company Hacker House. But he insisted it had been an ""open, transparent and competitive process"".

"Wrightbus owners say they have had death threatsAbout 1,200 people lost their jobs when the Ballymena firm was placed into administration.Northern Ireland","Deaths threats have been issued against the family that owned Wrightbus following its collapse, a former director has said. About 1,200 people lost their jobswhen the Ballymena firm was placed into administration earlier this week. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it does not discuss the security of individuals. However, it is understood to be investigating the threats. In a statement, former director Jeff Wright called for an end to ""this intimidation and fear"". ""There have been sinister developments involving threats to the life of Wright family members and I am asking all elected representatives and those with influence in the community to help end this intimidation and fear,"" he said. The family have not given any more details of where the threats came from, or to whom they were issued. The Wright family, who founded Wrightbus in 1946, said global changes from diesel to electric caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. Jeff Wright, who is the son of Wrightbus founder Sir William Wright, spoke of the impact of the closure of the business on his family, in a statement issued through his solicitor. Buyers were asked to lease Wrightbus property for Â£1m Boris Johnson pledges government support Wrightbus: Family deny blocking factory deal Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure ""The closure of our family business has been devastating to our loyal and highly skilled workforce and the loss of the company my father and I have grown and nurtured for over 70 years has been shattering for our family,"" he said. Wrightbus's majority shareholder is Jeff Wright ""Generations of families have worked alongside our own family over all these years and so this is deeply and personally felt by everyone. ""We are here to provide our administrators, Deloitte's, with all information, order books, financial records and whatever is needed to establish a future plan for the bus manufacturing operation. ""Our commitment to supporting all efforts is unwavering."" On Friday, the family denied they had acted unreasonably during attempts to sell the business. It is understood that potential buyers were being asked for about Â£1m a year to lease the property. The Wrightbus factory is owned separately from the manufacturing company by a firm called Whirlwind Property Two, which is controlled by Jeff Wright. This is understood to have been a sticking point during the sales negotiation and was alluded to by the prime minister ina BBC interview on Thursday. The Wright family said that one bidder had agreed to rent the factory but later withdrew the offer. Meanwhile, a church led by Jeff Wright has said it understands ""the hurt, anger and confusion felt by so many"" at the loss of jobs in Ballymena. The Green Pastures charity received Â£15m in donations from Wrightbus over six years. On Friday, a Green Pastures Church spokesperson said that many of its congregation ""have been personally affected by these job losses"". Mid and East Antrim Council have held a redundancy clinic at The Braid in Ballymena. It said it had identified 250 job vacancies that could be suitable for former workers.

Ireland suffer shock defeat by JapanHosts Japan produce the biggest surprise of the Rugby World Cup by beating hotly-tipped Ireland 19-12.,"Ireland led 12-3 but were eventually outplayed by the tournament hosts 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool A: Japan v Ireland Japan:(9) 19 Try:FukuokaCon:TamuraPens:Tamura 4 Ireland:(12) 12 Tries:Ringrose, R KearneyCon:Carty Hosts Japan pulled off one of the biggest upsets in Rugby World Cup history as they beat world number two-ranked Ireland 19-12 in Shizuoka. Tries from Garry Ringrose and Rob Kearney saw Ireland lead at the break, although three Yu Tamura penalties kept the game to within one score. Replacement Kenki Fukuoka dived over in the corner on 59 minutes to put the Brave Blossoms in front. Tamura's 72nd-minute penalty sealed a monumental win. Not since Japan's win over South Africa four years ago in Brighton has rugby witnessed a result that will resound around the world in the way this one will. This was not a result borne of Irish indiscipline or stage fright, but of a truly stunning Japanese performance in front of a cacophonous crowd that lifted their side with a stunning noise that greeted every metre gained, tackle made and turnover won. It is a result that will, regardless of what happens in the next six weeks of rugby, leave a legacy for generations to come, and will send rugby into a new stratosphere of popularity within the country. Team will be judged by its response - Schmidt Ireland back row Conan to miss rest of tournament 'Seismic' Japan victory 'will ignite World Cup' 'What an amazing game' - how the match unfolded This video can not be played Argentina win big and Japan pull off a huge shock against Ireland at the Rugby World Cup From the start, it became clear that Japan had no interest in curtailing their fast-paced, free-moving gameplan against one of the rugby's most-respected defences. Only a bad bounce denied Kotaro Matsushima an opening try after four minutes as the hosts stretched Ireland's defence from left to right before Tamura's kick behind nearly paid off. It looked as though Ireland had weathered an early storm, as Ringrose and Kearney's tries eight minutes apart looked to have bought the favourites some breathing space that could have quietened the Japanese majority inside Stadium Ecopa. However the fans, and the team, were unrelenting and Japan did not turn to a Plan B. Another lightning-fast move from left to right, a slick one-handed offload from Timothy Lafaele and a kick in-behind saw Matsushima again denied by a bouncing ball which this time favoured Josh van der Flier, who did well to set up an Irish exit from under their own posts. The introduction of Michael Leitch, Japan's already legendary captain whose relegation to the bench was the cause of some controversy in the build-up, sent excitement levels in the stadium to a new level after 31 minutes. Ireland are ranked number two in the world but proved no match for the tournament hosts Leitch responded immediately with a shuddering clear-out of Kearney as Japan pressed forward, carrying the momentum towards half-time. The pressure was eventually rewarded as Van der Flier was pinged for impatience at the breakdown, allowing Tamura to narrow the gap to three points at half-time. The second half carried on in the same way the first had ended: Japan attack, Ireland repel. The familiar signs that tend to crop up when Ireland are not functioning began to re-appear - missed line-outs, dropped catches and a knock-on after winning a scrum inside their own 22 as the pressure continued to build. From the scrum, Japan went left and Fukuoka was sent over in the corner. This video can not be played 'We didn't have an answer to Japan' - Ireland's Luke McGrath From an Irish perspective, there was little to fear off the back of a physically dominant performance over Scotland a week ago. The feeling, after a year of struggling to hit the heights of 2018, was that Joe Schmidt's side were nearing at peak at just the right time. Indeed, even an injury to long-time talisman Johnny Sexton did little to halt the feel-good factor in the camp. Jack Carty, on only his second international start, began well and showed little fear with his nerveless kicks from hand leading to the two Irish tries. The shock result in Shizuoka was Japan's first-ever Test win over Ireland Inside the opening 20 minutes, Rory Best was on target with all six of his line-out throws. Everything that had to go to plan was going that way - but what followed was not something that many could have expected. Aside from their two scores, the vast majority of Ireland's time was spent in defence in the energy-sapping afternoon heat. What began as a typically efficient performance began to unravel as errors slipped into their the game. Carty was guilty of kicking a restart dead before the Irish pack, totally dominant six days ago, were turned over on their own scrum as Japan began to smell blood. Ireland's front-loaded schedule meant that wins in their opening two fixtures would allow some senior players a rest before the probable semi-final. However, the five-day turnaround before Thursday's match against Russia now becomes a much more daunting task, and the fitness of Sexton, whose composure and defensive solidity was badly missed in the second half, will be placed under the microscope far more than it would have been had they got the job done in Shizuoka. This was Japan's first ever victory against Ireland in Test rugby. They had lost each of their previous seven by an average margin of 31 points. Three of Ireland's last four pool stage defeats at the Rugby World Cup have come against the host nation, also losing to Australia in 2003 and France in 2007 (also v Argentina in 2007). Japan have won five of their last six matches at the Rugby World Cup, this after winning just one of their initial 24 matches at the tournament. Ireland lost to a non-Tier One nation at the Rugby World Cup for the first time, having won each of their previous 15 such games. Japan won a Rugby World Cup match after trailing at half-time for just the second time in 24 attempts. Rob Kearney has scored four tries in his last five Rugby World Cup games. He has five tries in the tournament overall, only Keith Earls (8) and Brian O'Driscoll (7) have more for Ireland. Garry Ringrose has scored in each of his three Test appearances against Japan, crossing three times in total, more than he's scored against any other nation. No side has lost a match at the Rugby World Cup and gone on to lift the Webb Ellis Cup.

"Labour promises to scrap universal creditLeader Jeremy Corbyn announces an overhaul to the welfare scheme as his party calls it ""inhumane"".UK Politics","Mr Corbyn made the announcement at a rally in the constituency of Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, who originally implemented the universal credit scheme A future Labour government would scrap universal credit - which merges six benefits into one payment, the party's leader Jeremy Corbyn has announced. He promised an interim benefit payment after two weeks, across the UK, to replace a five-week waiting period. Labour has branded universal credit ""cruel and inhumane"". The government said Labour's plans were ""reckless"" and amounted to ""political point-scoring"", but acknowledged there was work to do to improve the system. Universal credit is being introduced in stages across the UK. What is universal credit? Supporters of the welfare reform say it helps to simplify a complicated benefits system - and ensures no-one would be better off claiming benefits than working. But it has been controversial since its introduction in 2013, with critics saying it has made life harder for those receiving it. Some women have described beingforced into sex workbecause of the failings of the scheme, while landlords have said some tenants haveslipped into rent arrearssince being put on universal credit. A loophole in the online system has been exploited to make fraudulent applicationsand claim advance loans, with millions of pounds stolen as a result.

"Labour promises to scrap universal creditLeader Jeremy Corbyn announces an overhaul to the welfare scheme as his party calls it ""inhumane"".","Mr Corbyn made the announcement at a rally in the constituency of Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, who originally implemented the universal credit scheme A future Labour government would scrap universal credit - which merges six benefits into one payment, the party's leader Jeremy Corbyn has announced. He promised an interim benefit payment after two weeks, across the UK, to replace a five-week waiting period. Labour has branded universal credit ""cruel and inhumane"". The government said Labour's plans were ""reckless"" and amounted to ""political point-scoring"", but acknowledged there was work to do to improve the system. Universal credit is being introduced in stages across the UK. What is universal credit? Supporters of the welfare reform say it helps to simplify a complicated benefits system - and ensures no-one would be better off claiming benefits than working. But it has been controversial since its introduction in 2013, with critics saying it has made life harder for those receiving it. Some women have described beingforced into sex workbecause of the failings of the scheme, while landlords have said some tenants haveslipped into rent arrearssince being put on universal credit. A loophole in the online system has been exploited to make fraudulent applicationsand claim advance loans, with millions of pounds stolen as a result.

Tycoon ready to resume shipyard involvementJim McColl is ready to retain involvement in the Port Glasgow yard weeks after handing it to administrators.Scotland business,"Ferguson Marine in Inverclyde was nationalised by the Scottish government in August The former owner of the nationalised Ferguson shipyard has said he is ready to resume involvement in the yard. Engineering tycoon Jim McColl was forced to hand the business to administrators five weeks ago. Since then the Scottish government has operated the yard under a management agreement with administrators. Mr McColl said he was happy to talk to ministers about some sort of ""joint arrangement"" for the yard, which currently owestaxpayers about Â£50m. Ministers are hoping a private buyer will take over the business. Ferguson shipyard nationalised by Scottish government Buyers express interest in nationalised shipyard Lifeline ferry deal that went adrift The Inverclyde shipyard ran into trouble after failing to complete a Â£97m order to build two ferries for Scottish government owned CalMac. Jim McColl has blamedrepeated design changes and other bureaucracyfor the spiralling costs of the unfinished order. Jim McColl said he would be happy to talk with the Scottish government about a joint arrangement He said that since the yard had been taken over by the Scottish government, he had been part of a joint venture - along with a major overseas shipbuilder - considering a bid to take the yard out of administration. However, that plan was abandoned last week due to a lack of time to prepare the bid. It is understood there are two other private bidders still interested. A statement about the bids has been expected from Deloitte, the administrator, for some days. Mr McColl said he would be ""happy to talk to the Scottish government about some sort of joint arrangement"". He said this would involve the Scottish government setting up a separate company to complete the two CalMac ferries. Mr McColl, who controls the investment company Clyde Blowers, said this would allow the firm to focus on other contracts that could otherwise be lost to the yard. The contract to build two ferries for CalMac remains unfinished The billionaire suggested these could include a project with several industrial partners and St Andrews University to develop hydrogen-powered ferries. Ferguson shipyard was part of the winning partnership in bidding to win the Â£1.25bn contract to build five Type 31 frigates for the Royal Navy. Babcock was lead partner and named as the sole preferred bidder. Mr McColl said he wanted to ensure the Inverclyde yard was included in the military order, securing up to 10 years' worth of work to build the bow sections. Such a business model - splitting the CalMac ferries from other marine engineering work - was proposed by Mr McColl and Clyde Blowers before its subsidiary was taken over by administrators. At the time, the Scottish government said it would be illegal to bail it out, or to meet the rapidly increasing cost of finishing the two ferries, on what had been a fixed price contract. However, Mr McColl said that would not apply to a company buying assets out of administration, and Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has said he would welcome private sector investment in the yard. Mr Mackay has set out his determination to ensure the ferries - which are due to operate in Arran and Skye are completed - and says he will outline the timetable and cost of doing so by the end of next month. Mr McColl also denied reports earlier this week, based on Deloitte's assessment of Ferguson's finance, that Clyde Blowers had left some of the yard's 300 workers unpaid. He said staff pay was brought forward when it was clear the company was heading into administration, and that holiday pay and pensions would be honoured through the administration process. In response to opposition MSP calls for an inquiry into the funding of Ferguson shipyard and the CalMac ferries, Mr McColl said he was eager to contribute.

LiveLiveScottish Premiership latest updatesChampions Celtic visit Hibernian in the early Premiership kick-off before more games in all four divisions from 15:00.BBC Sport,"FT: Hamilton (Alston, Cunningham) 2-1 Livingston (Lithgow) FT: Kilmarnock 0-0 Ross County FT: Rangers (Tavernier PEN X2, Stewart, Morelos, Defoe) 5-0 Aberdeen FT: St Johnstone 0-1 Motherwell (Cole) FT: St Mirren 0-0 Hearts FT: Hibernian (Ajer OG) 1-1 Celtic (Christie) Colin Moffat No Scottish football tomorrow. You'll need to wait until next Saturday for another Premiership helping but Celtic and Rangers are in Europa League action on Thursday. Neil Lennon's side are on a revenge mission against Cluj, while the Ibrox side are away to Swiss side Young Boys of Bern. Join us then if you can. FT: Rangers 5-0 Aberdeen ""Very pleasing,"" managerSteven Gerrardtells RangersTV. ""We kept Aberdeen quiet for the majority of the game. ""We wanted to play with intensity and a high tempo, to take advantage of Aberdeen playing for 120 minutes in midweek. We wanted to ask them a lot of questions and we did that. ""We scored some excellent goals today. There were a lot of positives. ""The lads have been outstanding since the Old Firm (loss to Celtic). The belief is there, the confidence is there. We're in a good place with a lot of challenges to come. We just need to take each game as it comes and try to keep up the momentum."" Rangers captain James Tavernier netted two penalties at Ibrox FT: Kilmarnock 0-0 Ross County Ross County co-manager Steven Fergusonspoke to BBC Sport after drawing 0-0 against Kilmarnock: ""We'll take that as a good point away from home on the Astroturf which has posed us problems in the past. Our shape was decent and we fought hard for the point today, so we'll dust ourselves down and go again."" ""It says it all about our progress. We're only looking for marginal gains and the fact we've kept a clean sheet down here on the Astroturf is something we've not done for a while. FT: Hamilton 2-1 Livingston Livingston manager Gary Holtis unhappy with his side's defending today as they let slip a lead in South Lanarkshire. Speaking to BBC Scotland shortly after today's 2-1 defeat, Holt said: âIâm not going to make excuses. Iâm not going to stand here and say we were unlucky. If you donât defend your box you arenât going to win games. First and foremost, no matter how well you play. ""Hamilton have put two balls in to our box today and they got a penalty and a goal. People need to take responsibility. They need to put demands on each other. Youâre not friends when you cross the white line. Iâm very disappointed with the two goals because we were well on top of the game."" FT: St Johnstone 0-1 Motherwell St Johnstone manager Tommy Wrightis fed up seeing the same costly mistakes week after week. He tells BBC Sportsound: ""It's a game we should have got something out of, without a doubt. We were on top for long spells but it's the same old story - people not doing their jobs from set-plays. ""We didn't make enough opportunities from our possession but you get the penalty and we should score - then the tails are up and the game is totally different. ""It's not a good start. We know that and we need to get better. I don't think confidence is the problem. It's just that in certain situations players are not standing up and being counted."" FT: Hamilton 2-1 Livingston FT: Kilmarnock 0-0 Ross County Kilmarnock manager Angelo Alessioon BBC Sportsound: ""It was a good performance by the team after 120 minutes on Wednesday. We deserved the win but at the end we only get one point. It's frustrating but I saw a good spirit from the team - we played well. We will continue in this way - I have trust in my team. ""I don't blame Osman Sow - we missed two penalties on Wednesday. Maybe in the training sessions we will practice penalties!"" Osman Sow rolled a tame penalty kick straight at Ross Laidlaw in the second half FT: Hamilton 2-1 Livingston Hamilton took all three points at the Fountain of Youth Stadium today andmanager Brian Ricecouldn't be more delighted to have put a difficult run of form to bed. Speaking to BBC Scotland, Rice said: âI have to be positive. I think weâve only gotten beat once since the Motherwell game and weâve been to Tynecastle, played Celtic and a tough game at Paisley last week and a very tough game today. So Iâm delighted with what the lads have given me. Yes, we can play better. We know that but at the end of the day itâs a massive three points for us. ""I said to the lads in the changing room that it's a great three points. We had to dig deep, work hard as we always do but against Livingston itâs very, very difficult. Iâm absolutely delighted."" FT: St Mirren 1-1 Hearts Hearts boss Craig Levein thinks his side deserved more from their visit to Paisley and he is in gloomy mood about the injury to defender Craig Halkett, who was the visitors' captain today. ""Loic Damour hasn't played a lot of football, so his injury is nothing serious at all, he just felt his hamstring get tight and was worried about it,"" he tells BBC Sportsound. ""The one with Craig Halkett is a real body blow. He went in for a challenge and got caught. He's opened up the medial knee ligament in a challenge and damaged the medial ligament, so he could be out for a little while. Possibly a long while."" Craig Halkett receives treatment for a first-half knee injury FT: St Johnstone 0-1 Motherwell Motherwell manager Stephen Robinsontells BBC Scotland: ""When you don't play well and you win football matches, it's the sign of a good squad. It was a gritty performance ""We had chances to kill the game off but a brilliant penalty save from Mark Gillespie kept us in front and we hung on."" On Liam Donnelly's late dismissal, he says: ""He did land on him (Chris Kane) in full stride but I don't think he had anywhere else to put his foot. You can usually tell when footballers are lying because they are not that bright. We can't have any complaints about it but from Liam's point of view I don't think there's any malice or intent."" FT: St Mirren 0-0 Hearts St Mirren manager Jim Goodwintells BBC Scotland: ""It's the fourth game at home and a third clean sheet, so defensively we're solid, but the bottom line is we've not got enough at the other end to go and win the game. We had a couple of good chances in the first half. Ilkay Durmus got in a good position, but ultimately we've not worked the goalkeeper. ""The only teams in the league with a better defensive record are Rangers and Celtic and we've only conceded one more goal than those teams. There's no getting away from the fact that we've scored the least amount of goals, and that's the bit we need to do better that, and we know that as a group."" FT: St Johnstone 0-1 Motherwell Tyrone SmithBBC Scotland at McDiarmid Park A pretty poor game but Motherwell will not care one jot about that. They ground out a win which moves them up to third in the table. The only black mark was a late red card for in-form Liam Donnelly. Another poor display from struggling St Johnstone and the Perth side remain bottom still without a win in the league this season. Liam Donnelly was shown a red card for a bad challenge on Chris Kane in stoppage time FT: Rangers 5-0 Aberdeen Aberdeen won twice at Ibrox last season but Derek McInnes' side were well beaten this afternoon. The Dons are down to fourth place - eight points off the top and eight above the bottom. Rangers' goal difference is up to +16, just one behind Celtic as the title tussle closes to one point. Scottish League Two Scottish League One Scottish Championship The points are shared in Paisley and Hearts striker Steven MacLean may struggle to get to sleep tonight after a glaring miss. Another clean sheet at home for the Buddies but there are problems at the other end for Jim Goodwin to address. St Johnstone 0-1 Motherwell Seconds before full-time, Motherwell's Liam Donnelly is sent packing for a horrible hack. That's the kind of thing that has managers' pulling their hair out. The Steelmen are up to third thanks to Devante Cole's first-half tap-in. It made up for a quite shocking miss earlier. St Johnstone remain bottom of the Premiership pile, with Scott Tanser failing to level from the penalty spot after the interval. Kilmarnock will be kicking themselves after not making the most of several good chances. The best of those came the way of Osman Sow but his weak penalty miss was laughable. Well, you're definitely not laughing if you're a Killie fan. Honking... Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Plan to end long journeys to slaughter for animals,"Transporting animals on long journeys for slaughter could be banned, under animal welfare plans unveiled by the Conservative party. Under the move, livestock would have to be sent to the closest abattoir - effectively banning most live exports. It is one of a number of animal welfare and environmental policies set to be discussed at the Tory party conference. Others include creating a Â£1bn fund to boost the electric motor industry and a pledge to plant one million new trees. Does the EU stop the UK improving animal welfare? On the trail of the live calf export lorries Tree planting rise 'needs to happen quickly' The party said the earlier attempts to restrict the journey time for live animals had been ""prevented by EU single market rules"". Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers said the proposals would ""choke off"" the live exports trade and help protect animals. Other animal welfare measures to be discussed at the conference, which begins in Manchester on Sunday, include: a move to ban all trophy hunting imports making micro-chipping for domestic cats compulsory an outright ban on keeping primates as pets Labour has already pledged similar reforms in its animal welfare manifesto, published last month. In the UK, primates which are not considered to be dangerous can be bought and sold freely. The RSPCA estimates that thousands of primates are kept as pets in the UK. Would-be owners must apply for a licence to purchase species considered more dangerous, including apes, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans and gorillas. Government guidelines,externaldetail the environment, diet and other criteria an owner should consider to meet the needs of a primate. Breaching this code is not illegal, but a court may take into account whether owners have complied with advice when deciding if they have committed an offence under the Animal Welfare Act. Meanwhile, ministers have committed Â£1bn to help boost the production of key ""green"" technologies in the motor industry, such as batteries, electric motors, power electronics and hydrogen fuel cells. The government has also pledged to invest Â£220m to help develop a fusion power station by 2040, which ministers said could offer ""limitless electrical power with minimal waste"". They said the investment would help to create thousands of skilled, well-paid jobs. The five major challenges facing electric vehicles Thunberg to leaders: 'You've failed us on climate' The Tories also plan to plant up to one million trees in three new forests in Northumberland by 2024, in addition to creating more so-called ""pocket parks"" on small pieces of derelict or undeveloped land in towns and cities. Ministers said the measures were part of a package to help make the UK carbon neutral by 2050. Ms Villiers said the party's proposals ""will enhance our landscape, improve our quality of life and protect the climate for future generations"". But Friends of the Earth said the propositions were ""nowhere near"" enough to to tackle the scale of climate change. ""If the government is serious about slashing climate pollution, it needs to stop fracking, stop filling the skies with more planes, and stop funding oil and gas projects abroad and instead invest in public transport, renewable energy and doubling UK tree cover,"" said chief executive Craig Bennett.

ThePM was given a two-week deadlineon Tuesday to provide ""details and a timeline of contact"" with Ms Arcuri. In a letter addressed to Mr Johnson and dated 23 September, chairman of the Greater London Assembly oversight committee Len Duvall, said he wanted the ""details and a timeline of all contact"" with Ms Arcuri. He added this would include ""social, personal and professional during his period of office as Mayor of London"". Mr Johnson has been asked to provide ""details and a timeline of all contact"" with Ms Arcuri Mr Duvall also asked for ""an explanation of how that alleged personal relationship was disclosed and taken into account in any and all dealings with the GLA"".

'Debt was a circle I could not get out of',"It is estimated people in Stoke-on-Trent owe Â£80m to high-cost lenders One in every 200 adults in Stoke-on-Trent became insolvent in 2018 - the highest rate in England and Wales. The BBC spoke to some who are managing to claw their way out of debt, and to those helping to fight the epidemic. The haunted face of a new client arriving at the door has become a familiar sight to Anne Riddle. ""They're very frightened, and usually carrying a big bag - very occasionally carrying a suitcase - of unopened letters. Letters that they recognise the shape and colour or the print on so they haven't opened them. Because that's very often what happens - burying their heads."" The independent money adviser has seen her client list rise across Stoke in the past 10 years, as more people across the city are stifled by debts. She's also lost a few: those who could see only one way out. ""Suicide is as bad as it gets, when people can't face living because it just gets too much."" For two years running, Stoke-on-Trent had the largest proportion of people becoming insolvent - being unable to pay their debts - anywhere in England and Wales. Debt adviser Anne Riddle says talking about debt with loved ones is an important first step In 2018, almost 52 in every 10,000 adults in the city - a total of 1,029 people - had either an individual voluntary arrangement, a debt relief order (DRO) or went bankrupt. Scarborough had the next highest rate of insolvency with just under 48 in every 10,000 adults, followed by Torbay in Devon at just under 46 in every 10,000 adults. Clare, a care assistant on a basic wage, became insolvent and took out loan after loan to make ends meet. By the time she went to see Anne Riddle, she didn't even know how many thousands of pounds in debt she had mounted up. She lives near Bentilee, in the most deprived ward of Stoke-on-Trent, where 45% of households have an income of under Â£15,000. Her problems began with a loan when she was a single mum in her early 20s. ""They say you can borrow Â£50, and then if you pay that back you can borrow Â£100. It keeps going up. And I thought I could do it, but then I realised I couldn't."" Panicking as the interest she owed rose, Clare took out more loans to try to pay off her escalating debts. ""When you've got a little 'un who comes home from school saying 'we're going on this trip, can I go?', you do what you have to do. It was very easy to get more credit. And I just used to ignore how bad it was getting. I couldn't sleep with worry, it made me ill. And then I had to take time off work - it was a circle I could not get out of."" The city has the highest rate in England and Wales 1,029People became insolvent in 2018 52in every 10,000 adults 27%above average for England and Wales 223were women aged  25-34, the group with the most insolvencies A candid report into Stoke's debt situation by the Financial Inclusion Group (FIG) estimates about 100,000 people in the area owe a total of Â£80m to high-cost, short-term credit lenders. It identified low wages, poverty, poor health, and low levels of literacy, numeracy and IT skills as reinforcing ""financial exclusion, trapping far too many people in a spiral of debt and deprivation"". ""The debt and general personal financial position of many people in Stoke is extremely fragile,"" says Alan Turley, a former Stoke city council boss and FIG member. ""Many people are living on the very edge of financial catastrophe."" Tell someone you trust - be open and honest with your loved ones. They might be able to help you deal with letters you've been receiving, and help you put together a budget Prioritise - work out which of your debts should be paid off first, i.e. the ones with the most serious consequences.

For decades, it was powered by industry, with tens of thousands working in mining and pottery. But when the mines and factories closed, generations of people were left out of work, creating a culture of not working that has trickled down to ""third, fourth generations of people"", says Ms Riddle. In place of the lost industry, minimum wage-paying distribution centres are emerging as the big employers. The average full-time salary for workers in the city is Â£24,907, almost Â£5,000 less than the national average. Many people simply don't earn enough to keep themselves afloat, according to Julie Prendergast of the city's Citizen's Advice Bureau, which sees people every day with money worries. ""It used to be all credit cards and unsecured loans, but now we see more and more people who haven't got enough money for the priorities - so it's mortgage arrears, council tax arrears,"" she says. ""Changes to the benefits system haven't helped. Even if someone has a job, they can't always manage the basics."" 'The buses are so bad, going out is pointless' How ceramics are powering your car and phone Cafes where the lonely find friendship Joe knows that feeling. The 22-year-old warehouse operative was tempted by a type of lender that has replaced many payday loan companies - one that had teamed up with his employer. ""It was so easy,"" he says. ""I applied through a place where I was working for a loan that would be taken out through my wages and by the end of the week I had Â£3,000 in my bank."" Joe got his car fixed and took his first holiday. But he then began to borrow more until his debts grew to about Â£8,500. ""That's where my problems came in really because when I found myself struggling to pay them back that's when they really increased. I wasn't letting my family know that I was in debt;  I was really on my own with it because I was embarrassed. Every morning I'd wake up worried I would get found out."" One in every 200 adults in Stoke-on-Trent became insolvent in 2018 Clare's family only realised the extent of her problems after she suffered a stroke brought on by ill health at the age of 45 - it was at this point they started opening the many threatening letters that came through her letterbox. ""They said 'you've got to do something about this' and that's how I met Anne,"" she said. ""I don't know how I would have coped without her. Many of my friends are in the same situation and I've just told them they need to get help. ""I am so relieved now - I can sleep, and I'm a calmer person. It was a terrible time and I wish it hadn't got so bad."" Joe and Clare both eventually sought help and are both clients of Ms Riddle's. They now have debt relief orders, which could eventually see what they owe written off, although this will affect their credit rating. It is five years since the Financial Conduct Authority introduced stricter affordability checks for payday loan customers. It also set a price cap that slashed the typical interest rate, and said nobody should ever have to repay more than twice the amount borrowed. The result was an immediate contraction in the industry which saw numerous outfits collapse,including one of the most well-known, Wonga. But this created a gap in the market for more sinister lenders, says Ms Riddle. ""By closing a lot of those down, we've got loan sharks back in business again who are very heavy-handed, who work on the black market, who aren't regulated and it's a very dangerous situation for people."" In Stoke, the age group with the highest rise of personal insolvency in 2018 was 25-34, and 58% of those declaring insolvency were women. Many fit a ""low wages, low literacy"" profile, while others are of a generation that is impatient and overspends, says Ms Riddle. ""I think people have got more flippant about borrowing money. I think there's a more serious problem today. ""So many people seem to have got a culture of borrowing without responsibility. Younger people want it now, they'd rather pay for it and have it now than save for it and get it later."" The Rev Malcolm Mycock fell into this trap. In 2007, when he was 36, he left a career working with animals to run his own company providing equipment to zoos. His attitude to money at the time cost him his business and he almost lost everything. This video can not be played 'It's fatal - people lose lives through debt' ""The business grew and developed quickly and was fairly successful [but] very quickly I realised even money didn't make me happy. ""I started to spend more and more to find happiness. I was living a life beyond my means - not paying tax on time, not paying VAT on time, generally overspending in the household, too many holidays. ""I believe it could have been very successful if it wasn't for me."" After two years Mr Mycock had no choice but to go into liquidation and he was declared bankrupt. He says there is a misconception that it is an easy way of wiping debt clear. ""This is not the case. Often the debt will still follow you or be passed on to your spouse, my wife in this case. We still had to pay the money back."" In the end, it was attending Alcoholics Anonymous that helped Mr Mycock. ""I remember feeling very scared, guilty, ashamed, broken,"" he says. ""The drinking got worse and my mental health suffered. I could not see any way out, life seemed pointless at that time."" After getting his life back on track he embarked on a new career in the church. He is now the vicar of Bentilee, where many in the community are living in debt. To combat the wider issue of indebtedness across the city, FIG has a five-year plan. The group, alongside 14 partners, says the scale of the problem is so large, any significant impact is ""through a response that is bold, innovative and above all on an unprecedented scale"". Its business development plan includes working with schools to ensure financial matters are an integral part of the curriculum, ensuring children leave education with a sound knowledge of banking and the risks of taking out credit. FIG also plans to target those who might be struggling by going out into the community - rather than assume they might one day seek out help - by having a presence at gyms, or the school gates, for example. ""We want to work on all the things that contribute to the problem, from better education for the next generations to up-skilling adults that missed out on that, from helping people start saving to getting them out of the trauma of facing the bailiff,"" says Mr Turley. Mr Turley points out that some people manage to live within their means - however limited those may be. ""We must recognise that many people in Stoke have managed to cope with very low household income over many years and never been in debt that they couldn't manage - amazing people."" Bentilee is among several areas of Stoke-on-Trent where low-income families are at risk of falling into debt But until the dangers of taking out credit are made transparent at the point of sale, those who are naive to the risks - or desperate enough to ignore them - will always be vulnerable, according to Mr Mycock. ""There's still adverts on the telly and the radio that say 'we don't care about your credit rating, you can buy a car from us', or 'we'll give you a loan, you can have a credit card at 50% APR',"" he says. ""People are still being taken advantage of. I think people think 'well that's normal'. We're in a society where if you want something, you think you should have it now. ""I think I was there - this is just how we live today.""

Afghans vote in shadow of violence,"This video can not be played Election officials say only votes verified by biometric devices will be counted People have voted in Afghanistan's presidential poll amid heavy security and deadly bomb attacks from militants. Low turnout was widely reported, as many voters were worried about security following threats from the Taliban. The twice-delayed vote on Sunday took place after Taliban-US peace talks had collapsed earlier this month. The two main candidates are the incumbent, Ashraf Ghani, and chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, who shared power since 2014. The Afghan war: The short and long story Who are the Taliban? More than 70,000 members of the security forces were deployed across the country to protect voters. Despite the increased security, at least four people were killed and 80 wounded in bomb and mortar attacks on voting centres. But in the southern city of Kandahar, women were seen standing in queues to vote, despite a bomb attack on a polling station. Women voters make up 35% of the more than nine million Afghans registered to vote. Security is tight at polling stations throughout Afghanistan Women make up about 35% of those registered to vote The Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan expects to announce the results in three weeks. Turnout is thought to have been low, but one voter said she would cast her vote even if it meant standing in long queues for hours. ""Bravery is defined when one musters the courage to cast their vote in Afghanistan,"" said Roya Jahangir, a doctor based in the capital, Kabul. ""We hope this time there is no fraud - otherwise voters will feel cheated once again,"" she told Reuters news agency. Authorities extended voting hours to ensure those queuing would have a chance to cast their ballot. By Martin Patience in Kabul It is perhaps a sign of how bad security has become in Afghanistan that officials hailed today's election as success because there was no major Taliban attack.  Those that voted did so in defiance of the militants' threats. But many people appear to have stayed away out of security concerns or because they've lost faith in a process that has previously been mired in vote-rigging. The official results will not be known for several weeks. But if the candidates do not accept them, they could trigger a political crisis that crushes this country's fragile democracy. Afghanistan's next president will lead a country devastated by four decades of war. The conflict continues to kill thousands of people every year, drawing in forces from around the world. Afghanistan country profile Nearly two decades since the international community intervened, the US has been trying to negotiate an end to the conflict with the Taliban. The US currently has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, and there are thousands more from countries part of a Nato mission to train, advise and assist the country's security forces. Whoever is elected president in the fourth election since US-led troops ousted the Taliban in 2001 should have a key role to play. However, the Taliban currently refuse to negotiate directly with the Afghan government, saying it is illegitimate. They say they will only talk to Afghan authorities after a deal with the US is agreed. Who sits at the head of Afghanistan's government matters to the people caught in the crossfire between the army, the Taliban and other insurgents. BBC research found an average of 74 men, women and children died in the conflict every dayduring the month of August across Afghanistan. A fifth of those killed were civilians. According to the United Nations,more civilians were killed by Afghan and US forces in the first half of this yearthan by insurgents. Five years ago, the presidential election was mired by allegations of fraud and vote-rigging. It took months to reach a result, with a deal between the two main contenders negotiated by the US ending in a ""national unity government"". Hopes are not high that things will be better this time. Afghanistan war: Tracking the killings in August 2019 Has the war cost America $500bn? Out of a population of about 37 million, fewer than 10 million are registered to vote - and even fewer are expected to cast a ballot.  A poll carried out by the Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan found more than half of respondents were not planning to vote. This is in part due to threats of violence from the Taliban, who have said they will attack polling booths and have already targeted election rallies. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? There are also large areas of the country under Taliban control, where the Kabul government has little to no power, and voting is all but impossible. But a perceived lack of enthusiasm among voters is also attributed to a feeling things may not change for the better - not helped by the fact the same two men who fought for months over the top job in 2014 are the front-runners once again. Both have been accused of corruption while in office. Meanwhile, unemployment stands at about 25%, according to the UN, and almost 55% of Afghans are living below the poverty line. Eighteen men - including former warlords, ex-spies and members of the country's former communist government - initially put themselves forward to fight the election, but five have dropped out. Not one woman is running for president, and only three women appear on the tickets of others. Read more: Who is Ashraf Ghani? Who is Abdullah Abdullah?

Avoid skin-lightening creams 'at all costs',"Consumers are being warned to steer clear of skin lightening creams that can ""act like paint stripper"". The Local Government Association warns the products should be ""avoided at all costs"" after recent seizures by trading standards officers. Many contained the bleaching agent hydroquinone - the creams can also contain mercury. The British Skin Foundation said people should speak to a doctor if they had any concerns about their skin. The LGA says the toxic products are being sold by rogue retailers, as well as online and at car boot sales and market stalls. And they do not always spell out the correct levels of ingredients, putting consumers at risk. Hydroquinone, described by the LGA as ""the biological equivalent of paint stripper"", can remove the top layer of skin, increasing the risk of skin cancer, and cause fatal liver and kidney damage. Mercury can cause similar life-threatening health problems. Unless they are issued on prescription by a doctor, creams containing hydroquinone, steroids or mercury are banned in the UK - because of their potentially serious side-effects. The LGA highlighted several recent seizures including - The seizure of 360 products from a store in Dagenham, some of which contained hydroquinone. Ingredients were listed incorrectly and failed to meet EU regulations. The store's owners were fined Â£6,500 and ordered to pay Â£8,010 to the council Southwark Council seized about 2,900 skin-whitening products, most of which had been imported directly from Nigeria, in a single raid in 2018. It also sawwhat is believed to be the UK's first jail sentence for the sale of dangerous skin lightening products A quarter of a tonne of illegal skin lightening products were seized at Gatwick Airport after arriving from Cameroon. Samples were found to contain hydroquinone But the LGA said the ability of trading standards officers to keep on top of the problem was being threatened by cuts to council budgets. Simon Blackburn, chairman of the LGA's Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said: ""Skin creams containing banned ingredients are very dangerous and could seriously damage your health, scar you for life and even kill you, so they should be avoided at all costs. ""Consumers should always check the ingredients of their skin creams, be suspicious of very low prices which are likely to indicate the lotion is fake and potentially harmful, and never use a product containing hydroquinone. ""If the product doesn't display the ingredients at all, then don't use it."" He added: ""Councils have been targeting rogue retailers selling these banned creams and people should report any concerns so that town halls can take action to prevent anyone from buying these lotions, potentially ruining their looks forever."" Lisa Bickerstaffe, a spokeswoman for the British Skin Foundation, said the issue of illegal skin lightening creams came up ""year after year"". She added: ""It's difficult to know whether the problem is increasing due to the illicit way the products are sold under the counter and online. ""Ingredients in these cosmetics can cause serious health problems and the British Skin Foundation strongly advises against using them. ""Speak to your dermatologist or GP if you have any concerns about your skin tone and they will be able to advise accordingly.""

FT: St Mirren 0-0 Hearts St Mirren manager Jim Goodwintells BBC Scotland: ""It's the fourth game at home and a third clean sheet, so defensively we're solid, but the bottom line is we've not got enough at the other end to go and win the game. We had a couple of good chances in the first half. Ilkay Durmus got in a good position, but ultimately we've not worked the goalkeeper. ""The only teams in the league with a better defensive record are Rangers and Celtic and we've only conceded one more goal than those teams. There's no getting away from the fact that we've scored the least amount of goals, and that's the bit we need to do better that, and we know that as a group."" FT: St Johnstone 0-1 Motherwell Tyrone SmithBBC Scotland at McDiarmid Park A pretty poor game but Motherwell will not care one jot about that. They ground out a win which moves them up to third in the table. The only black mark was a late red card for in-form Liam Donnelly. Another poor display from struggling St Johnstone and the Perth side remain bottom still without a win in the league this season. Liam Donnelly was shown a red card for a bad challenge on Chris Kane in stoppage time FT: Rangers 5-0 Aberdeen Aberdeen won twice at Ibrox last season but Derek McInnes' side were well beaten this afternoon. The Dons are down to fourth place - eight points off the top and eight above the bottom. Rangers' goal difference is up to +16, just one behind Celtic as the title tussle closes to one point. Scottish League Two Scottish League One Scottish Championship The points are shared in Paisley and Hearts striker Steven MacLean may struggle to get to sleep tonight after a glaring miss. Another clean sheet at home for the Buddies but there are problems at the other end for Jim Goodwin to address. St Johnstone 0-1 Motherwell Seconds before full-time, Motherwell's Liam Donnelly is sent packing for a horrible hack. That's the kind of thing that has managers' pulling their hair out. The Steelmen are up to third thanks to Devante Cole's first-half tap-in. It made up for a quite shocking miss earlier. St Johnstone remain bottom of the Premiership pile, with Scott Tanser failing to level from the penalty spot after the interval. Kilmarnock will be kicking themselves after not making the most of several good chances. The best of those came the way of Osman Sow but his weak penalty miss was laughable. Well, you're definitely not laughing if you're a Killie fan. Honking... Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Avoid skin-lightening creams 'at all costs'Consumers are being warned to steer clear of skin-lightening creams that can ""act like paint stripper"".","Consumers are being warned to steer clear of skin lightening creams that can ""act like paint stripper"". The Local Government Association warns the products should be ""avoided at all costs"" after recent seizures by trading standards officers. Many contained the bleaching agent hydroquinone - the creams can also contain mercury. The British Skin Foundation said people should speak to a doctor if they had any concerns about their skin. The LGA says the toxic products are being sold by rogue retailers, as well as online and at car boot sales and market stalls. And they do not always spell out the correct levels of ingredients, putting consumers at risk. Hydroquinone, described by the LGA as ""the biological equivalent of paint stripper"", can remove the top layer of skin, increasing the risk of skin cancer, and cause fatal liver and kidney damage. Mercury can cause similar life-threatening health problems. Unless they are issued on prescription by a doctor, creams containing hydroquinone, steroids or mercury are banned in the UK - because of their potentially serious side-effects. The LGA highlighted several recent seizures including - The seizure of 360 products from a store in Dagenham, some of which contained hydroquinone. Ingredients were listed incorrectly and failed to meet EU regulations. The store's owners were fined Â£6,500 and ordered to pay Â£8,010 to the council Southwark Council seized about 2,900 skin-whitening products, most of which had been imported directly from Nigeria, in a single raid in 2018. It also sawwhat is believed to be the UK's first jail sentence for the sale of dangerous skin lightening products A quarter of a tonne of illegal skin lightening products were seized at Gatwick Airport after arriving from Cameroon. Samples were found to contain hydroquinone But the LGA said the ability of trading standards officers to keep on top of the problem was being threatened by cuts to council budgets. Simon Blackburn, chairman of the LGA's Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said: ""Skin creams containing banned ingredients are very dangerous and could seriously damage your health, scar you for life and even kill you, so they should be avoided at all costs. ""Consumers should always check the ingredients of their skin creams, be suspicious of very low prices which are likely to indicate the lotion is fake and potentially harmful, and never use a product containing hydroquinone. ""If the product doesn't display the ingredients at all, then don't use it."" He added: ""Councils have been targeting rogue retailers selling these banned creams and people should report any concerns so that town halls can take action to prevent anyone from buying these lotions, potentially ruining their looks forever."" Lisa Bickerstaffe, a spokeswoman for the British Skin Foundation, said the issue of illegal skin lightening creams came up ""year after year"". She added: ""It's difficult to know whether the problem is increasing due to the illicit way the products are sold under the counter and online. ""Ingredients in these cosmetics can cause serious health problems and the British Skin Foundation strongly advises against using them. ""Speak to your dermatologist or GP if you have any concerns about your skin tone and they will be able to advise accordingly.""

Tycoon ready to resume shipyard involvement,"Ferguson Marine in Inverclyde was nationalised by the Scottish government in August The former owner of the nationalised Ferguson shipyard has said he is ready to resume involvement in the yard. Engineering tycoon Jim McColl was forced to hand the business to administrators five weeks ago. Since then the Scottish government has operated the yard under a management agreement with administrators. Mr McColl said he was happy to talk to ministers about some sort of ""joint arrangement"" for the yard, which currently owestaxpayers about Â£50m. Ministers are hoping a private buyer will take over the business. Ferguson shipyard nationalised by Scottish government Buyers express interest in nationalised shipyard Lifeline ferry deal that went adrift The Inverclyde shipyard ran into trouble after failing to complete a Â£97m order to build two ferries for Scottish government owned CalMac. Jim McColl has blamedrepeated design changes and other bureaucracyfor the spiralling costs of the unfinished order. Jim McColl said he would be happy to talk with the Scottish government about a joint arrangement He said that since the yard had been taken over by the Scottish government, he had been part of a joint venture - along with a major overseas shipbuilder - considering a bid to take the yard out of administration. However, that plan was abandoned last week due to a lack of time to prepare the bid. It is understood there are two other private bidders still interested. A statement about the bids has been expected from Deloitte, the administrator, for some days. Mr McColl said he would be ""happy to talk to the Scottish government about some sort of joint arrangement"". He said this would involve the Scottish government setting up a separate company to complete the two CalMac ferries. Mr McColl, who controls the investment company Clyde Blowers, said this would allow the firm to focus on other contracts that could otherwise be lost to the yard. The contract to build two ferries for CalMac remains unfinished The billionaire suggested these could include a project with several industrial partners and St Andrews University to develop hydrogen-powered ferries. Ferguson shipyard was part of the winning partnership in bidding to win the Â£1.25bn contract to build five Type 31 frigates for the Royal Navy. Babcock was lead partner and named as the sole preferred bidder. Mr McColl said he wanted to ensure the Inverclyde yard was included in the military order, securing up to 10 years' worth of work to build the bow sections. Such a business model - splitting the CalMac ferries from other marine engineering work - was proposed by Mr McColl and Clyde Blowers before its subsidiary was taken over by administrators. At the time, the Scottish government said it would be illegal to bail it out, or to meet the rapidly increasing cost of finishing the two ferries, on what had been a fixed price contract. However, Mr McColl said that would not apply to a company buying assets out of administration, and Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has said he would welcome private sector investment in the yard. Mr Mackay has set out his determination to ensure the ferries - which are due to operate in Arran and Skye are completed - and says he will outline the timetable and cost of doing so by the end of next month. Mr McColl also denied reports earlier this week, based on Deloitte's assessment of Ferguson's finance, that Clyde Blowers had left some of the yard's 300 workers unpaid. He said staff pay was brought forward when it was clear the company was heading into administration, and that holiday pay and pensions would be honoured through the administration process. In response to opposition MSP calls for an inquiry into the funding of Ferguson shipyard and the CalMac ferries, Mr McColl said he was eager to contribute.

PM's links to Arcuri referred to police watchdog,"Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 The police watchdog is to decide whether or not to investigate Boris Johnson for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was London mayor. It is alleged businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. The prime minister was referred by the Greater London Authority on Friday. Mr Johnson has denied any impropriety, while a government source described the referral as ""politically motivated"". The allegations regarding Mr Johnson's friendship with technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri first emerged last weekend inthe Sunday Times.,external They refer to claims that Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London and that her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims PM will explain Jennifer Arcuri links to City Hall The Greater London Authority's monitoring officer - whose job it is to monitor the conduct of the mayor and other members - said it had written to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). It said it had referred the PM to the IOPC ""so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office"". It added that it has recorded a ""conduct matter"" against Mr Johnson which happens when there is information that indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed. But it does not mean that a criminal offence is proved in any way, the GLA's monitoring officer added. ""The IOPC will now consider if it is necessary for the matter to be investigated."" The reason the IOPC is involved is because the role of the mayor of London is also London's police and crime commissioner. The IOPC deals with complaints against police forces in England and Wales In a letter to the PM setting out the referral, the monitoring officer says: ""The conduct matter relates to your time as mayor of London between 2008 and 2016. ""During this time it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits."" Responding to the referral, No 10 said: ""The prime minister, as Mayor of London, did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK. ""Everything was done with propriety and in the normal way."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Everything done in the proper way"" A senior government source said the timing of the referral, coming days before the start of the Conservative Party conference, was ""overtly political"" and ""a politically motivated attack"". ""No evidence of any allegations has been provided by the monitoring officer nor was the PM given any opportunity to respond to the monitoring officer prior to the publishing of a press release late on a Friday night,"" the source said. ""The public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnelltweeted:,external""It's important to note that this was a decision by the GLA monitoring officer, who is a completely, independent non political official."" By the BBC's Home Affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Ms Arcuri appearing on the BBC's Talking Business programme in 2013 The BBC has now spoken to several people who went on the overseas ""trade missions"" with Boris Johnson to Malaysia and Singapore, to New York, and to Tel Aviv. They said that Jennifer Arcuri seemed a bit out of place on the trips, as her companies were much less substantial than those of the other participants, Jennifer Arcuri was originally turned down for the trip to Malaysia and Singapore, but then re-applied using a different company and was accepted. She was told her companies were not relevant for the trip to New York, but she went under her own steam and was allowed into some of the events. She was also turned down for the Tel Aviv trip, but Boris Johnson's office intervened and she was allowed to join the trade mission. She paid for her own flight, and although the organisers of the trip, London & Partners, booked a hotel for her, she settled the bill. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson denied any wrongdoing, telling the BBC's John Pienaar: ""All I can say is I am very proud of what we did as mayor of London... particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world."" He added: ""I can tell you that absolutely everything was done entirely in the proper way."" On Friday,Mr Johnson saidhe would comply with an order from the London Assembly to explain his links to Ms Arcuri. However he added: ""But on this particular matter, I think they are barking up the wrong tree."" Separately, a junior minister, Matt Warman, has said the government has launched a ""review"" of the Â£100,000 award made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's training company Hacker House. But he insisted it had been an ""open, transparent and competitive process"".

In the UK, primates which are not considered to be dangerous can be bought and sold freely. The RSPCA estimates that thousands of primates are kept as pets in the UK.

Heavy security as Afghans elect president,"This video can not be played Election officials say only votes verified by biometric devices will be counted People have voted in Afghanistan's presidential poll amid heavy security and deadly bomb attacks from militants. Low turnout was widely reported, as many voters were worried about security following threats from the Taliban. The twice-delayed vote on Sunday took place after Taliban-US peace talks had collapsed earlier this month. The two main candidates are the incumbent, Ashraf Ghani, and chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, who shared power since 2014. The Afghan war: The short and long story Who are the Taliban? More than 70,000 members of the security forces were deployed across the country to protect voters. Despite the increased security, at least four people were killed and 80 wounded in bomb and mortar attacks on voting centres. But in the southern city of Kandahar, women were seen standing in queues to vote, despite a bomb attack on a polling station. Women voters make up 35% of the more than nine million Afghans registered to vote. Security is tight at polling stations throughout Afghanistan Women make up about 35% of those registered to vote The Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan expects to announce the results in three weeks. Turnout is thought to have been low, but one voter said she would cast her vote even if it meant standing in long queues for hours. ""Bravery is defined when one musters the courage to cast their vote in Afghanistan,"" said Roya Jahangir, a doctor based in the capital, Kabul. ""We hope this time there is no fraud - otherwise voters will feel cheated once again,"" she told Reuters news agency. Authorities extended voting hours to ensure those queuing would have a chance to cast their ballot. By Martin Patience in Kabul It is perhaps a sign of how bad security has become in Afghanistan that officials hailed today's election as success because there was no major Taliban attack.  Those that voted did so in defiance of the militants' threats. But many people appear to have stayed away out of security concerns or because they've lost faith in a process that has previously been mired in vote-rigging. The official results will not be known for several weeks. But if the candidates do not accept them, they could trigger a political crisis that crushes this country's fragile democracy. Afghanistan's next president will lead a country devastated by four decades of war. The conflict continues to kill thousands of people every year, drawing in forces from around the world. Afghanistan country profile Nearly two decades since the international community intervened, the US has been trying to negotiate an end to the conflict with the Taliban. The US currently has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, and there are thousands more from countries part of a Nato mission to train, advise and assist the country's security forces. Whoever is elected president in the fourth election since US-led troops ousted the Taliban in 2001 should have a key role to play. However, the Taliban currently refuse to negotiate directly with the Afghan government, saying it is illegitimate. They say they will only talk to Afghan authorities after a deal with the US is agreed. Who sits at the head of Afghanistan's government matters to the people caught in the crossfire between the army, the Taliban and other insurgents. BBC research found an average of 74 men, women and children died in the conflict every dayduring the month of August across Afghanistan. A fifth of those killed were civilians. According to the United Nations,more civilians were killed by Afghan and US forces in the first half of this yearthan by insurgents. Five years ago, the presidential election was mired by allegations of fraud and vote-rigging. It took months to reach a result, with a deal between the two main contenders negotiated by the US ending in a ""national unity government"". Hopes are not high that things will be better this time. Afghanistan war: Tracking the killings in August 2019 Has the war cost America $500bn? Out of a population of about 37 million, fewer than 10 million are registered to vote - and even fewer are expected to cast a ballot.  A poll carried out by the Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan found more than half of respondents were not planning to vote. This is in part due to threats of violence from the Taliban, who have said they will attack polling booths and have already targeted election rallies. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? There are also large areas of the country under Taliban control, where the Kabul government has little to no power, and voting is all but impossible. But a perceived lack of enthusiasm among voters is also attributed to a feeling things may not change for the better - not helped by the fact the same two men who fought for months over the top job in 2014 are the front-runners once again. Both have been accused of corruption while in office. Meanwhile, unemployment stands at about 25%, according to the UN, and almost 55% of Afghans are living below the poverty line. Eighteen men - including former warlords, ex-spies and members of the country's former communist government - initially put themselves forward to fight the election, but five have dropped out. Not one woman is running for president, and only three women appear on the tickets of others. Read more: Who is Ashraf Ghani? Who is Abdullah Abdullah?

The two main candidates are the incumbent, Ashraf Ghani, and chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, who shared power since 2014. The Afghan war: The short and long story Who are the Taliban? More than 70,000 members of the security forces were deployed across the country to protect voters. Despite the increased security, at least four people were killed and 80 wounded in bomb and mortar attacks on voting centres. But in the southern city of Kandahar, women were seen standing in queues to vote, despite a bomb attack on a polling station. Women voters make up 35% of the more than nine million Afghans registered to vote. Security is tight at polling stations throughout Afghanistan Women make up about 35% of those registered to vote The Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan expects to announce the results in three weeks. Turnout is thought to have been low, but one voter said she would cast her vote even if it meant standing in long queues for hours. ""Bravery is defined when one musters the courage to cast their vote in Afghanistan,"" said Roya Jahangir, a doctor based in the capital, Kabul. ""We hope this time there is no fraud - otherwise voters will feel cheated once again,"" she told Reuters news agency. Authorities extended voting hours to ensure those queuing would have a chance to cast their ballot. By Martin Patience in Kabul It is perhaps a sign of how bad security has become in Afghanistan that officials hailed today's election as success because there was no major Taliban attack.  Those that voted did so in defiance of the militants' threats. But many people appear to have stayed away out of security concerns or because they've lost faith in a process that has previously been mired in vote-rigging. The official results will not be known for several weeks. But if the candidates do not accept them, they could trigger a political crisis that crushes this country's fragile democracy. Afghanistan's next president will lead a country devastated by four decades of war. The conflict continues to kill thousands of people every year, drawing in forces from around the world. Afghanistan country profile Nearly two decades since the international community intervened, the US has been trying to negotiate an end to the conflict with the Taliban. The US currently has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, and there are thousands more from countries part of a Nato mission to train, advise and assist the country's security forces. Whoever is elected president in the fourth election since US-led troops ousted the Taliban in 2001 should have a key role to play. However, the Taliban currently refuse to negotiate directly with the Afghan government, saying it is illegitimate. They say they will only talk to Afghan authorities after a deal with the US is agreed. Who sits at the head of Afghanistan's government matters to the people caught in the crossfire between the army, the Taliban and other insurgents. BBC research found an average of 74 men, women and children died in the conflict every dayduring the month of August across Afghanistan. A fifth of those killed were civilians. According to the United Nations,more civilians were killed by Afghan and US forces in the first half of this yearthan by insurgents. Five years ago, the presidential election was mired by allegations of fraud and vote-rigging. It took months to reach a result, with a deal between the two main contenders negotiated by the US ending in a ""national unity government"". Hopes are not high that things will be better this time. Afghanistan war: Tracking the killings in August 2019 Has the war cost America $500bn? Out of a population of about 37 million, fewer than 10 million are registered to vote - and even fewer are expected to cast a ballot.  A poll carried out by the Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan found more than half of respondents were not planning to vote. This is in part due to threats of violence from the Taliban, who have said they will attack polling booths and have already targeted election rallies.

There are also large areas of the country under Taliban control, where the Kabul government has little to no power, and voting is all but impossible. But a perceived lack of enthusiasm among voters is also attributed to a feeling things may not change for the better - not helped by the fact the same two men who fought for months over the top job in 2014 are the front-runners once again. Both have been accused of corruption while in office. Meanwhile, unemployment stands at about 25%, according to the UN, and almost 55% of Afghans are living below the poverty line. Eighteen men - including former warlords, ex-spies and members of the country's former communist government - initially put themselves forward to fight the election, but five have dropped out. Not one woman is running for president, and only three women appear on the tickets of others. Read more: Who is Ashraf Ghani? Who is Abdullah Abdullah?
