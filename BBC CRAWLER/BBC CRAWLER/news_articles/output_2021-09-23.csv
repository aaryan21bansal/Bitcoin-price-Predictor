Ministers weigh up visa changes to fix staff shortage,"Farmers' leaders say the food and farming sector is on a ""knife edge"" due to labour shortages The environment secretary has said the government is looking at different options on how to fix labour shortages in the food sector. George Eustice said the government was considering whether changes could be made to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme (SAWS). SAWS is a quota-based scheme that allows farmers to recruit overseas. Trade bodies have warned of panic-buying this Christmas unless action is taken to address the lack of staff. Those shortages have been made worse by Covid and Brexit. Mr Eustice acknowledged ""the reality that there is an acute labour shortage at the moment across the UK economy"". The SAWS scheme saw 30,000 temporary workers admitted to the UK this year to fill vacancies in agriculture - mostly working on fruit and vegetable farms - helping with the picking and packing of produce. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Food firms warn of panic-buying this Christmas How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Speaking on a visit to an agricultural show in Northern Ireland, Mr Eustice said there are ""some real concerns about how we'll deal with that spike in demand in the two weeks up to Christmas"". ""We have SAWS and we're looking at options as to how we can change the focus of that and we hope to be able to say something on this shortly,"" he continued. When asked if he would be looking at changes to visas to address workforce shortages, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: ""If that was actually the solution, I'm sure we would move to it quickly and I don't rule out anything."" The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has called for another emergency visa to allow firms to recruit from outside the UK. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he does ""not believe people will be short of food"" this autumn and winter, amid reports of some gaps on supermarket shelves. This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Government sources told the BBC discussions were ongoing to ""look at where the gaps are"". Asked if that meant action might be taken before Christmas they indicated ""realistically, yes, before Christmas"". Earlier this month, Mr Eustice said the government wanted to monitor whether workers who may be made redundant when the furlough schemes finish at the end of September could instead enter the labour market where there are shortages. Those include areas such as lorry driving or meat processing. However, he said if that did not happen ""then the beauty of a controlled immigration system is you can take steps to allow people to come in on temporary visas should you want"". NFU head Minette Batters wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday, warning that the food and farming sector is on a ""knife edge"" because of labour shortages across the entire supply chain. The letter, signed on behalf of a number of food and drink trade bodies, called for the introduction of a Covid-19 recovery visa to open up new recruitment opportunities. ""Without it, more shelves will go empty and consumers will panic buy to try to get through the winter,"" Ms Batters wrote. Referring to an earlier NFU report, Ms Batters said that there were an estimated 500,000 unfilled vacancies in the industry. Due to the shortages, some farmers haveresorted to giving fruit and vegetables awayrather than let it rot in their fields. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? What's CO2 used for in food and drink?

BP closes some sites due to lorry driver shortage,"A BP garage showing out of use signs today in Sherborne BP has warned it has had to ""temporarily"" close some of its petrol stations due to a shortage of lorry drivers. The oil firm said only ""a handful"" of sites were affected by the fuel supply issues, which have led to a lack of unleaded and diesel fuel. There are around 1,200 BP branded petrol stations around the UK, of which 300 are operated by BP themselves. The company said it was working hard to address the issues. Supply chain delays had been ""impacted by industry wide driver shortages across the UK"" and that the company was working hard to address the issues, BP said in a statement. ""We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries,"" the company added. Other petrol station operators have been approached by the BBC for comment. Esso said that a ""small number"" of its 200 Tesco Alliance retail sites have been affected. ""We are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimise supplies and minimise any inconvenience to customers. We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience,"" a spokesperson from Esso added. However, supermarket Morrisons, which operates 338 petrol stations across the UK, said it was not seeing any similar issues at the moment. Co-op runs 130 petrol stations in the country, and said it has a ""full complement"" of fuel delivery drivers. Tesco also said that they have a ""good availability of fuel"" and both Sainsbury's and Asda said there are no current issues in their fuel supplies. A BP petrol station in Worcester was closed due a lack of fuel Downing Street has said people should continue buying fuel as normal. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was no shortage of fuel in the UK, adding: ""We obviously recognise the challenges faced by the industry and we're taking steps to support them."" He pointed to changes made by the Department for Transport to make it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences and said that this is a problem several countries are facing. Grant Shapps also told the BBC's Question Time on Thursday that he believed the shortages had also been caused because of working conditions that ""hadn't been pleasant"" and that higher salaries offered to drivers was something the government was ""happy to see"". He also said that improvements in the availability of tests were ""coming in prior to Christmasâ¦ so these are things that will resolve the issues in the lead up to Christmas"". The temporary closures come just months after BPhad to close a ""handful"" of its UK sites in Julybecause of lorry driver shortages. At the time, BP said its supply chain issues had also been exacerbated by the closure of a distribution terminal due to staff being told to isolate. Paul Cheema's petrol station is just about to run out of unleaded petrol Paul Cheema has run a petrol station in Coventry since 2013, and says he's never experienced a situation like this before. ""We used to be able to put orders in for next day delivery. Now we have to do it a week in advance, but we're ordering blind. We don't know how much fuel we're going to sell in that time. If we'll have enough, or even too much,"" says Paul. ""Last week we put in an order for a delivery to arrive today. That was pushed back until tomorrow, and now we've been told it won't arrive until Saturday."" ""So that means we won't have any unleaded petrol to sell tomorrow,"" he said. Paul says that fuel delivery delays have been happening all summer, but it's been particularly bad in the last couple of weeks. ""We're a petrol station. We should have availability 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I'm not blaming our fuel supplier. It's not their fault. It's the bigger driver shortage problem behind it."" He sells thousands of litres of unleaded every day, so the cost implications for him are huge. ""There could be a 40% impact on sales with this week's delivery problems. If I haven't got any liquid in the ground, I'm not making money. I can't operate the site at a loss."" ""If I haven't got fuel to sell, that customer isn't coming into my petrol station shop either, so I'm losing money there too,"" says Paul. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents petrol station operators across the UK, said that some sites across the UK were seeing delivery delays, but that they were largely confined to London and the South East, and were ""temporary by nature"". Gordon Balmer from the PRA said that petrol station closures were rare, and that the fuel supply chain was resilient enough to cope. ""Fuel demand is still only at 92% of pre-pandemic levels so we believe there should be ample stock available at refineries and delivery terminals throughout the UK."" Many businesses have been complaining about the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, which is still causing serious supply chain problems. The coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have all contributed to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers. Logistics UK, which represents the haulage industry, said it was ""aware of reports that petrol supplies are currently being affected"" by the lack of drivers. ""The driver shortage is a very serious issue that needs urgent government and industry action to resolve, however, we urge people not to panic buy; the logistics industry is resilient and has proven capable of supporting shops, families and businesses during Covid-19, border closures and the first stages of Brexit, and will continue to serve the needs of the nation,"" the industry body said.

Fuel issues spark row over lorry drivers shortage,"This video can not be played ""The fuel is there, it can continue to flow"" â Transport Secretary Grant Shapps People should carry on buying petrol as normal, despite supply problems that have closed some stations, the government has said. A ""handful"" of BP stations, and a small number of Esso-owned Tesco Alliance stations, were closed on Thursday because of a lack of delivery drivers. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said refineries had ""plenty of petrol"". He told the BBC that the government could bring in the army to drive fuel tankers if it would help. It is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with gaps made worse by the pandemic and Brexit. Other industries such as food processing have been impacted. Britain's biggest baker Warburtons has confirmed that the company is facing challenges recruiting lorry drivers and that the shortage is causing some disruption to its supply chain. The baker delivers to around 18,500 stores and says it can't deliver to a number of them. ""The national driver shortage continues to place a strain on the Warburtons distribution network but we are working incredibly hard to maintain a good level of service for our customers nationwide."" Reports in several newspapers have suggested that the government is considering getting soldiers to drive fuel tankers under emergency plans. When questioned about this on BBC Breakfast, Mr Shapps said: ""If it can actually help, we will bring them in."" However, he said there would be ""technicalities"" as to whether military personnel could switch to driving civilian vehicles. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Are there problems at the forecourt you use? Send your pictures toyourpics@bbc.co.uk,externalorupload your pictures/video here The AA said that most of the UK's forecourts were working as they should. ""There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of forecourts are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week."" Mr King said drivers should not fill up outside their normal routines, because even if the occasional petrol station was temporarily closed, others just down the road would be open. ""It is now clear that there have been occasional delays over recent weeks that have been managed with hardly anyone noticing. This was a manageable problem."" There are about 8,380 petrol stations in the UK, according to the Petrol Retailers Association. Of these, about 1% are believed to be closed at the moment. It is understood that about 50 to 100 BP forecourts are affected by shortages, while Esso said ""a small number"" of its Tesco Alliance retail sites had been hit. Helena Wright is part of family firm W's Transport, based in north Norfolk Helena Wright, transport manager for Norfolk-based firm W's Transport, told the BBC her company had sold two lorries after advertising for HGV drivers and not getting a single applicant. ""Normally we would have people on record to call who had left their details,"" she said. ""This is the first time for our firm that that's happened, but it's a problem that has been a long time coming. ""I've got a lot of drivers that are over the age of 50, 55 and looking to retire and we are not attractive as an industry for the younger generation."" She said younger people were not prepared to spend four to five nights a week away from home and were not ready to put up with ""inhumane"" conditions. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has urged the government to relax visa restrictions for foreign workers in the short term to ease the driver shortage. But Mr Shapps told the BBC he did not want UK lorry drivers to ""drop out"" because of being ""undercut"" by cheaper EU labour. He said there were ""systemic problems"" in the haulage industry that needed to be resolved, pointing out that the profession was ""99% white male"" with an average age of 55, facing poor conditions and wages. Now, he said, pay was rising and there was ""a gradual increase"" in new drivers. While the UK does not lack petrol and diesel at refineries, getting it to forecourts has been difficult in some areas. It is the latest problem caused by driver shortages, which have already led to supply squeezes in other industries, including supermarkets. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""The supply issues affecting a small number of petrol forecourts shouldn't impact the prices drivers pay to fill up. ""But unfortunately the price of oil, which has the biggest influence on what drivers pay at the pumps, is continuing to rise at the moment. ""This may lead to fuel prices going up in the coming days, which would be yet more bad news for drivers, as a litre of unleaded is already over 21p a litre more expensive than a year ago."" The RHA's Rod McKenzie told BBC Breakfast more lorry drivers were leaving the profession each week than joining it. He said: ""It's as simple as this: everything we get in Britain comes on the back of a truck. ""So if there is a shortage of HGV drivers - and there is by 100,000 - then it is inevitable that we are not going to get all the things we want when we want them."" ""It is not a case of running out - and people should not panic buy,"" he added. He warned there would be glitches ""because the supply chain on which we all depend is creaking"". Supermarket Iceland - which is about 100 drivers short - joined Morrisons and Ocado in calling for the government to add HGV drivers tothe list of shortage occupations,external. That would allow foreign workers to apply for skilled worker visas to fill the current gaps. ""I think the solution - even if it's temporary - is very, very simple,"" said Iceland managing director Richard Walker. ""Let's get HGV drivers on to the skilled worker list."" The RHA's Mr McKenzie said that on top of a historic shortage of drivers, the industry had lost 20,000 European drivers because of Brexit, while the pandemic had forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled. Ina recent RHA survey,externalof 616 hauliers, retiring colleagues and Brexit topped the list of reasons behind the driver shortages. Respondents also cited tax changes to rules known as IR35, which have made it more expensive for hauliers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. Businesses across the food, fuel and construction sectors have been warning about driver shortages for months. BP temporarily closed a number of petrol stations earlier in summer, when driver shortages also caused short-term supply problems for McDonald's, Nandos, and the pub chain Wetherspoons. Speaking on BBC Question Time on Thursday, Mr Shapps suggested visa changes would not solve the problem, but said nothing had been ruled out. But shadow justice secretary David Lammy said visas were needed in various sectors, telling Mr Shapps: ""You promised that immigration would come down and you know that it will need to go up if we are to deal with these problems."" Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said there was ""an endemic problem with retention and recruitment"" in the industry. ""We're actually not short of HGV drivers per se - we've got 600,000 people who are qualified to drive those big trucks, but only 300,000 people chose to work in the industry,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bridgen suggested the industry needed to modernise and improve working conditions to retain young drivers. In recent weeks, the Department for Transport has made it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences, butthe RHA criticisedthe changes as a risk to road safety.

Restaurants set to be banned from withholding tips,"Restaurant, cafÃ© and pub bosses are set to be banned from keeping tips left for staff by customers in Britain. The government plans to make it illegal for hospitality firms to withhold tips from workers, who often rely on them to top up their income. Labour Markets Minister Paul Scully said the plans would ""ensure tips will go to those who worked for it"". If an employer breaks the new rules they can be taken to an employment tribunal. In that instance, bosses may be forced to compensate workers or face fines. In a statement, the Department for Business said that the new legislation would help about two million people working in the hospitality industry. It is expected to come into force within the next year. But it comes some time after the practice was reported to have taken place at High Street chains such asPizza Express, Cote Brasserie and Bill's. In 2015, the restaurants were accused of keeping tips or charging 10% ""administrative costs"" on processing the service charge payments if they were made by debit or credit card. Although they denied any wrongdoing, the reports drew a huge backlash from unions and the public. Bullying culture and low pay blamed for staff shortage Should you tip the takeaway delivery driver? Restaurants offer perks to beat staffing crisis Conservative MP Paul Scully said on Tuesday: ""Unfortunately, some companies choose to withhold cash from hardworking staff who have been tipped by customers as a reward for good service. ""Our plans will make this illegal and ensure tips will go to those who worked for it"". He added that the move would also reassure customers that their money is going to ""those who deserve it"". Ministers also pointed towards research that suggests most tips are now paid by card in the UK, rather than in cash. Currently, businesses who receive tips by card have the choice of whether to keep it or pass it on to workers. Cash tips, on the other hand, are legally the property of staff. Fewer tips are being paid in cash due to the rise in contactless payments As well as requiring all employers to pass on all tips, service charges and gratuities in full without any deductions, the new legislation will introduce a code of practice, which will set out exactly how tips should be distributed fairly. Workers will also get the right to request information on their boss's tipping record, in case they want to bring a claim to an employment tribunal. While the move was welcomed by the Living Wage Foundation, it said that the focus should be on improving wages in lower-paid sectors instead. Its interim director, Graham Griffiths, said: ""If this work is to be truly valued we need to see more people lifted onto a real Living Wage. ""To build a stronger and more dynamic economy, our focus should be on increasing the number of businesses doing the right thing and committing to pay a Living Wage"". Kate Nicholls, UKHospitality chief executive, added the new rules would strengthen the sector's ability to create jobs. But she pointed out: ""For hospitality businesses, though, customers tipping with a card incurs bank charges for the business, and many also employ external partners to ensure tips are fairly distributed among staff. ""With restaurants, pubs and other venues struggling to get back on their feet... we urge the government to continue to work closely with the sector as it introduces this legislation to ensure this works for businesses and employees.""

Labour promises cap on foreign sales of new homes,"Labour says it would cap the amount of property overseas investors can purchase in new developments, in a bid to help first-time buyers. Under plans to be outlined at its annual conference, the party would also give first-time buyers ""first dibs"" on new builds for six months. It will also pledge to reform rules governing how developers contribute towards affordable housing. And it will pledge to give councils new powers to buy land for homes. The conference, starting in Brighton on Saturday, will give party leader Sir Keir Starmer his first chance to set out his stall to members in person. It comes amid an ongoing policy review, where the party will decide how much of its policy offering it should change from the Jeremy Corbyn era. Where can I afford to live? Are second home owners really pricing locals out? Party conferences: What to expect this year Keir Starmer is taking a big risk In a speech on Sunday, Labour's shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell will set out the party's plans to build ""more truly affordable homes"". ""Our country is facing a housing crisis with the link between hard work and getting on the housing ladder broken for many,"" she will say. She is expected to accuse the Conservatives of becoming the ""party of speculators and developers"", treating property ""as a commodity, not the bedrock of stable lives and life chances"". And in a move to occupy traditional Tory territory, she will call Labour the ""party of home ownership"". She will pledge to change England's planning rules, so that half of the homes in new developments cannot be sold to foreign investors. The party says this will help first-time buyers by preventing properties being sold off-plan to developers before local residents can buy them. The policy is an evolution of the party's position at the 2019 election under Jeremy Corbyn, when it proposed a new tax on foreign buyers. In its 2019 manifesto, the party also promised first-time buyers ""first dibs"" on new housing - but did not specify for how long. Boosting home ownership is expected to be a key focus of the conference this weekend Ms Powell will also recommit to several Corbyn-era housing policies, including linking the definition of ""affordable"" homes to average wages, not rents. The party is critical of the government's current definition, which allows affordable rents to be set at up to 80% of the local market rate. She will also set out plans to allow local authorities to buy land more cheaply from private owners when completing a compulsory purchase. Councils are currently not allowed to buy such land at agricultural value - instead having to factor in the prospect of future planning permission, which makes it more expensive. Labour believes changing this could enable councils to buy more land for affordable housing, and give them a stronger hand with developers. The party had proposals in this area under its previous leadership, when it proposed setting up a ""sovereign land trust"" to buy property. It will also renew its criticism of rules under which developers negotiate with councils to build affordable homes, or contribute cash towards them. The party has criticised the current system as too lax and favourable to developers. The government itself plans to replace the current system with a new levy as part of itswider proposals to change the planning systemin England. A Conservative spokesman said Ms Powell's housing speech ""amounts to a series of rehashed and failed policies from Jeremy Corbyn or Sadiq Khan"". ""It once again goes to show Labour under Keir Starmer have absolutely nothing new to offer our country,"" he added. Are second home owners really pricing locals out?

Ministers weigh up options to fix labour shortages,"Farmers' leaders say the food and farming sector is on a ""knife edge"" due to labour shortages The environment secretary has said the government is looking at different options on how to fix labour shortages in the food sector. George Eustice said the government was considering whether changes could be made to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme (SAWS). SAWS is a quota-based scheme that allows farmers to recruit overseas. Trade bodies have warned of panic-buying this Christmas unless action is taken to address the lack of staff. Those shortages have been made worse by Covid and Brexit. Mr Eustice acknowledged ""the reality that there is an acute labour shortage at the moment across the UK economy"". The SAWS scheme saw 30,000 temporary workers admitted to the UK this year to fill vacancies in agriculture - mostly working on fruit and vegetable farms - helping with the picking and packing of produce. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Food firms warn of panic-buying this Christmas How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Speaking on a visit to an agricultural show in Northern Ireland, Mr Eustice said there are ""some real concerns about how we'll deal with that spike in demand in the two weeks up to Christmas"". ""We have SAWS and we're looking at options as to how we can change the focus of that and we hope to be able to say something on this shortly,"" he continued. When asked if he would be looking at changes to visas to address workforce shortages, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: ""If that was actually the solution, I'm sure we would move to it quickly and I don't rule out anything."" The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has called for another emergency visa to allow firms to recruit from outside the UK. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he does ""not believe people will be short of food"" this autumn and winter, amid reports of some gaps on supermarket shelves.

Government sources told the BBC discussions were ongoing to ""look at where the gaps are"". Asked if that meant action might be taken before Christmas they indicated ""realistically, yes, before Christmas"". Earlier this month, Mr Eustice said the government wanted to monitor whether workers who may be made redundant when the furlough schemes finish at the end of September could instead enter the labour market where there are shortages. Those include areas such as lorry driving or meat processing. However, he said if that did not happen ""then the beauty of a controlled immigration system is you can take steps to allow people to come in on temporary visas should you want"". NFU head Minette Batters wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday, warning that the food and farming sector is on a ""knife edge"" because of labour shortages across the entire supply chain. The letter, signed on behalf of a number of food and drink trade bodies, called for the introduction of a Covid-19 recovery visa to open up new recruitment opportunities.

US Haiti envoy quits over 'inhumane' deportations,"This video can not be played Watch: Thousands at Haitian migrant camp in Texas The US special envoy for Haiti has resigned in protest over the deportation of Haitian migrants. The decision to return migrants fleeing an earthquake and political instability was ""inhumane"", senior diplomat Daniel Foote said in a damning letter. Last weekend, the US started deportation flights from a Texas border town, where about 13,000 migrants had gathered under a bridge. They have been waiting in a makeshift camp in temperatures of 37C (99F). Local officials have struggled to provide them with food and adequate sanitation. Since Sunday, the US has returned to Haiti 1,401 migrants from the Texas camp on the border with Mexico. Inhis resignation letter,external, Mr Foote said Haiti was a ""collapsed state"" that ""simply cannot support the forced infusion of thousands of returned migrants lacking food, shelter, and money without additional, avoidable human tragedy"". White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki responded in a press conference: ""Special Envoy Foote had ample opportunity to raise concerns about immigration during his tenure. He never once did so."" Ms Psaki also described images from the border - showing horse-mounted US officers corralling the migrants - as horrific and said horses would no longer be used in the area. Images showed US Border Patrol agents charging at Haitian migrants by Rio Grande river that divides Texas and Mexico. The widely shared pictures, taken by an AFP photographer earlier this week, have evoked grim comparisons to US slavery and the country's historical mistreatment of black people. That led to pressure on President Joe Biden's administration, and prompted calls from within his Democratic Party to give the Haitians asylum rather than fly them back to their home country. Why are so many Haitians at the US-Mexico border? Images of Haitians at US border echo grim past What is Biden doing differently at US border? Many Haitians left after a devastating earthquake struck the country in 2010. A large number of those in the camp had been living in Brazil or other South American countries and travelled north after being unable to secure jobs or legal status. This year has brought further hardship for the impoverished country. In July, President Jovenel MoÃ¯se was assassinated - and in August it suffered another deadly earthquake. Mr Foote said Haitians needed ""immediate assistance"", and criticised the US and other countries for interfering in the country's politics. ""What our Haitian friends really want, and need, is the opportunity to chart their own course, without international puppeteering and favoured candidates but with genuine support for that course,"" he said. Mr Foote has served in the role since MoÃ¯se's assassination in July. A state department spokesperson thanked the ambassador for his work, and insisted that the US remained ""committed to supporting safe, orderly, and humane migration throughout our region"". But in a later statement, a department spokesperson hit back at Mr Foote's claim he had been ignored by officials. ""It is unfortunate that, instead of participating in a solutions-oriented policy process, Special Envoy Foote has both resigned and mischaracterised the circumstances,"" Ned Price said. President Biden has been accused of having an incoherent policy on migration. On the campaign trail, he vowed to reverse President Donald Trump's policies - which he deemed too harsh - and he put Vice-President Kamala Harris in charge of the issue in March. But critics say they have failed to come up with a concrete plan for the near future, with thenumbers of migrants coming into the country reaching record highs. On the US side of the Mexican border in Del Rio, teams of police and National Guard agents have ""completely blocked off"" the area, according to immigrant rights activist Jenn Budd, who is at the scene. ""You cannot breathe here without law enforcement knowing what you're doing,"" Ms Budd, a former Border Patrol agent, told the BBC. ""They're cleaning it up and getting rid of everything, and they have shut down access to the river itself."" On the Mexican side of the river, migrants in a camp in Ciudad AcuÃ±a are voicing concern about potential expulsions. ""I have nothing in my country. What are they going to do?"" one tearful Haitian woman asked an AFP reporter. Separately, nearly 19,000 mostly Haitian migrants are in Colombia, waiting to cross the border with Panama on the journey to the US, officials say. ""We want them to let us cross, from here to Panama, before the United States closes its border,"" one migrant said. ""They are going to take away our dreams. I come from Peru, I've been struggling."" As monthly border-crossings continue to surge, Joe Biden has been caught between conservatives who say he is weak on undocumented migrants and liberal activists who view his policies as too much like those of his predecessor, Donald Trump. Now the criticism of Biden's actions are coming from inside his own administration - a development that could encourage more to speak out. The images of uniformed border patrol agents on horseback accosting black Haitians have drawn comparisons to dark chapters of slavery and discrimination in American history. Immigration activists say the border episode provides evidence of the harsher treatment dark-skinned migrants receive in this country. The US has a process by which it can give undocumented migrants ""temporary protected status"" from deportation if government officials determine that it would not be safe to return them to their home country. Haitians, as well as citizens from a handful of Central American countries, enjoy this protection - and it's cited as one of the reasons migrants brave the hazardous journey to the US, even though new arrivals do not qualify for the protections. Instead, the Haitians at the border are being sent back to a homeland where, according to Daniel Foote in his resignation letter, they face inhumane treatment and grave danger.

Waiting times records broken again in Wales,"The Grange Hospital, in Cwmbran, opened in November and posted the worst A&E performance figures on record in Wales for August The worst ever performance figures have again been recorded by hospital A&E units in Wales, reflecting the enormous pressure on emergency care in the NHS. The Grange hospital in Cwmbran, which has been open less than a year, had the worst performance on record of any Welsh hospital. Only 40.7% of people were seen within four hours at its A&E unit Figures also show another record-breaking month for people on NHS waiting lists. Those waiting more than nine months were at record levels. The figures also show the Welsh Ambulance Service recorded its second worst response times to the most critical calls since new targets were introduced in 2015. The figures show that in August, accident and emergency departments in Welsh hospitals recorded their worst ever performance figures with just 68.7% of patients spending less than four hours before being admitted, transferred or discharged. This was down from 69.8% in July which was itself a record. This dropped to 40.7% at the Â£350m Grange, which was worse than the 41% at Wrexham Maelor hospital in February 2020, just before the pandemic. The target is that 95% of patients should wait no longer than four hours in A&E. The figures also show in August 7,982 people had to wait more than 12 hours in urgent care departments - the highest number recorded, up from 7,084 the month before. The target is that nobody should be waiting that long. The performance by the Welsh Ambulance Service with response times to its ""red"" priority calls was the second worst on record. Only 57.6% of these immediately life-threatening calls arrived on scene within eight minutes. The target of 65% has not been met for over a year. Welsh people facing GP access crisis, says watchdog Waiting times in Wales hit record levels again Ambulance service 'under unprecedented pressure' Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales The figures covering July 2021 show: The overall waiting list for treatment is a record 643,108 - this equates to just over 20% of the Welsh population. Numbers of patients waiting more than 36 weeks - nine months - to start treatment in hospital have grown from 25,634 in February 2020 to 239,195 (an increase of 833%) The longest waits included 55,488 people due for orthopaedic or trauma treatment There were still more than 500 waiting for cardiothoracic surgery, although those waiting longest for cardiology is down by 171. There has also been a fall in performance over the month relating to cancer patients waiting to start treatment. Overall in Wales, 62% of people started treatment within 62 days of cancer first being suspected; the target is 75%. But this is down from 67% in the previous month. In Cwm Taf Morgannwg, only half of people with suspected cancer started treatment within the 62-day period. The figure also dropped over the month from 67% to 55% in Swansea Bay. The Welsh government said although those waiting the longest continued to be at a record high, a higher proportion were waiting less than 26 weeks and the median waiting time fell slightly. It announced plans to invest almost Â£25m in new PET-CT scanners to improve access to diagnostic technology and another Â£25m funding to improve delivery of urgent and emergency care services. ""The system is under huge pressure at the moment and that pressure is worse than anything we've seen at any point during the pandemic,"" said Health Minister Eluned Morgan. ""Of course, we are determined to try to work through the enormous backlog that has been built up during the pandemic, but it's very difficult to do that when the pressure on the system is coming at us from so many directions."" NHS in Wales is under ""huge pressure"" says Health Minister Eluned Morgan Ms Morgan said the Welsh government had published its Covid recovery plan in March, and had made Â£240m additional funding available for health boards across Wales. But she added: ""I think we have to be honest with people, and I do think people do have to brace themselves for the fact that this is not something we are going to be able to turn around."" She said her predecessor in the job, Vaughan Gething, was ""very clear that it would take at least five years to clear the backlog built up during the pandemic"". The Welsh Conservative's health spokesman Russell George said:  ""This is not the new normal. Not long before the pandemic, the Labour-run NHS was regularly breaking all the wrong records. ""Among the Covid-related issues affecting public services, there are deep-rooted problems that have not been tackled in the devolution era."" The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health boards, said the health service was ""working relentlessly"" to ensure those waiting would be seen as soon as possible. ""Although average waiting times for treatment remain above pre-pandemic levels, we are seeing a downward trend,"" said Darren Hughes, director. But he added that Covid was continuing to have a ""significant impact"" and rising cases had compounded existing pressures, meaning some difficult decisions were having to be made. The Royal College of Surgeons said the figures would be ""distressing for patients who continue to be left suffering in pain"" but that cancelling surgery, with a difficult winter ahead, must be a ""last resort"". ""It will be imperative to plan ahead for this winter to keep surgical services up and running,"" said Sue Hill, its director and a vascular surgeon. ""It is critical that Covid-light surgical hubs receive the investment and staff they need to tackle this growing backlog and support patients throughout the winter."" Richard Pugh, Head of Partnerships for Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, said: ""People are simply not getting vital cancer treatments in time. ""Wales desperately needs a detailed plan for managing our cancer care services out of this crisis."" Vice President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine Wales, Dr Suresh Pillai, said: ""We are heading into what will likely be the most difficult winter ever with consistently deteriorating performance, high numbers of patients, burned out staff, and an ambulance service on the brink of a crisis. ""It is only September and the military have already been called upon and drafted in to assist the Welsh Ambulance Service."" Diana Goldstraw says she feels like her life is on hold while she waits for a hip replacement Diana Goldstraw, 64, from Swansea, has been told she will have to wait four years to get a hip replacement. She said she broke down in tears in the waiting room when she was given the news. She said: ""I've been very, very upset because I can't do many of the things I want to do and am used to doing, like walking up the Brecon Beacons, I bought a bike last year that's never been used, I can't go out walking with my friends. ""My hip can be very unstable and on Saturday I couldn't walk at all. ""It is horrendous. I've always been a runner, a cyclist and a very keen hill walker. I've had to finish work."" Ms Goldstraw said this will be her second hip replacement, she had the first in 2015 when living in the Midlands and said that was done within six months. ""I feel that my life is on hold for four years,"" she said. Janet Harris, from Llanmaes, Vale of Glamorgan, has been on a waiting list for breast reconstruction surgery for two years. ""About 10 minutes after I was given a diagnosis of breast cancer and told I needed a mastectomy this [reconstructive reconstruction] was offered, with this as an end goal, and end point,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""It is as much as anything the distress that one lives with - there are issues with body image and things which I think tend to be considered as secondary but they're not. ""It is impossible to move on and find closure on bad experiences."" Alyson Thomas, chief executive of the Community Health Councils in Wales, said longer waiting lists meant increased demand on GPs, while there were people waiting in hospital because support was not ready in the community. ""We know there are far too many people well enough to leave hospital after having treatment but they are still in hospital because the social care that they need after leaving hospital is not available because of the pressures in social care,"" she said. ""It is very important that the health and care system work together to tackle the pressures across the whole system.""

Firms' collapse hits 1.5 million,"Ofgem acknowledged that ""this is a worrying time for many people"" Nearly 1.5 million customers have been hit in just two weeks by energy firms collapsing under soaring gas prices. Avro Energy and Green ceased trading on Wednesday and their 830,000 combined customers face being switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider. Green's boss, Peter McGirr, told the BBC he had done nothing wrong and said bigger firms would soon face problems. However, the government has cooled on the idea of loans to the industry, says BBC business editor Simon Jack. Mr McGirr predicted: ""You will see larger suppliers feeling the pain as well and they will come cap in hand for a bailout."" He criticised the government for supportingUS fertiliser firm CF Industries to restart its fertiliser factory, which produced carbon dioxide used in the food industry as a by-product, while allowing energy firms to fail. Its closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry. ""Why do they need a bailout and we don't?"" he asked. He apologised to staff and customers, but said: ""I don't think we did anything wrong as a supplier."" Small business minister Paul Scully told the BBC that the government had not treated CF Industries and Green in the same way because there were ""different solutions to different problems"". He said there was ""a mature system"" in place to deal with the collapse of energy firms, ""protecting customers both in continuity of supply and prices"". This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills Mr McGirr's comments came amid signs of a change of direction in government policy on the energy crisis. The BBC's Simon Jack says that while the government had been talking of state-backed loans for larger energy firms, that idea is now ""very much on the back burner"" and its intention is to ""tough this one out"". The BBC has been told that ministers believe the current system for managing the failure of energy companies, which allows companies to recoup losses through an industry-wide levy, is working satisfactorily, even though it will add costs to millions of customers' bills. Our business editor says ministers do accept that the existing system of reallocating customers would not work if one of the bigger challenger firms went bust. In that case, the government has the power to appoint a special administrator, in what would be a quasi-temporary nationalisation. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is having daily calls with the chief executive of Ofgem to monitor which firm might be next, a government spokesperson said. Where does the UK get its gas and is it facing a shortage this winter? What is the energy price cap and what if my supplier goes bust? Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' It is not yet clear which supplier will take on the 580,000 customers from Avro Energy, the biggest firm to fail so far. Regulator Ofgem has also not yet appointed a new provider for Green customers either. All affected customers will still receive energy while a new supplier is appointed by Ofgem. Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said its ""number one priority is to protect customers"". The regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on some tariffs by limiting how much firms can charge per unit of gas. But providers have complained that they are unable to pass on rising costs to customers because of the cap on energy bills. The plight of Avro customers is a good illustration of what may befall hundreds of thousands of people in the coming weeks. An Avro customer in a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, who got a fixed rate deal in August, would have been paying Â£1,087 a year, according to price comparison site Uswitch. In March, they could have got a deal costing Â£920 a year. Now Avro has collapsed, they are likely to be paying Â£1,277 a year at their new supplier from 1 October, in line with Ofgem's price cap. The price cap does not mean it is impossible to pay more than Â£1,277 a year. It is a cap on the price, not the final bill. That figure is an illustration of the cap's effect on a gas and electricity customer's annual bill, assuming they have an average level of energy consumption. So, a household with heavy energy use will have a higher annual bill. Price comparison site Uswitch has acknowledged there is currently no point in energy customers shopping around. Justina Miltienyte, the site's energy policy expert, said: ""Rising wholesale costs are putting a big strain on suppliers, which has had a knock-on effect on the value of the deals available in the market. ""What we're able to offer is constantly changing and will vary by customer. ""If you are coming to the end of your fixed deal, our advice is to hold tight, stay put and be rolled over on to your supplier's standard variable rate. Your supplier may try to offer you a new fixed deal, but this is unlikely to be the best option right now. ""However, people can leave their contact details so we could contact them once the situation improves. They can still head to Uswitch.com to compare deals across the whole of the energy market."" Sara Pilgrim was originally an Npower customer but has changed supplier twice since then One Green customer, 52-year-old Sara Pilgrim of North Lincolnshire, switched to the firm just a week ago. ""My contract switched on the 16 September. I went from E.On. I was with Npower, who transferred to E.On,"" she told the BBC. ""When my contract was due to renew a couple of weeks ago, E.On had really hiked their prices up. ""I went around and looked at different companies. Green weren't the lowest, but I decided to go with them. ""How can they have been allowed to take on new contracts that close to them going bust? They must have known something was going on six days ago. ""I'm just angry really that they've been allowed to do that. You know if you have to cease trading. That's my gripe really, that they've been allowed to take on new contracts so close to them ceasing trading."" Since wholesale gas prices have started to spike, a number of firms have collapsed. People's Energy, Utility Point, PfP Energy and MoneyPlus Energy ceased trading in September. These smaller companies, including Avro Energy and Green Supplier Limited, account for more than 5% of the UK energy market - about 1.5 million customers. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back.

Other small companies could fold in the coming days and weeks. Igloo, for example, has said it is working with restructuring consultants Alvarez & Marsal, although it told the BBC it had not appointed administrators. Bulb, the UK's sixth largest energy company with 1.7 million customers, is also seeking additional financing. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, told the BBC there had been a big increase in people seeking their help. ""We're seeing people come to us because they're seeing family finances being really squeezed,"" she added. Smaller providers launched in recent years have been overwhelmed by a spike in the cost of wholesale gas prices as economies have reopened from lockdowns and high demand from Asia pushed down supplies to Europe. Gas prices are rising all across Europe, but Britain has also been affected by lower winds than usual - denting renewable energy supplies - as well asa recent fire at a National Grid sitein Kent. In the UK, firms had already been hit by a jump in costs even before the recent spike. From more than 70 suppliers in 2018, there are just over 30 now. Industry sources fear there may be as few as 10 suppliers left by the end of the year. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?

What if my energy supplier fails?,"Thirty energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August 2021, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. What happens when a supplier goes bust, and what should consumers do? More than four million households have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. Ofgem automatically moves customers to a new provider, and their supply will continue without interruption. The companies which have gone out of business are: Ampoweruk, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice Energy, Goto Energy, Green, Green Network Energy, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy, MoneyPlus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Simplicity, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Together Energy, Utility Point, Whoop Energy, Xcel Power, Zebra Power and Zog Energy. Firms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices, which have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies. The wholesale price of gas - the price that UK fuel companies pay gas suppliers - has also gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. How high could my energy bills go? Why are prices rising so quickly? Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? If your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. Because of its size, Bulbwas put into an arrangement called ""special administration"". The company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it meansBulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything,external. The accounts held by the other failed firmsare automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.,external You can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff. Ofgemhas sent customers,externalto the following suppliers: British Gas:Bluegreen Energy Services, MoneyPlus Energy, Neon Reef, People's Energy, PFP Energy, Social Energy Supply, Together Energy and Zebra Power British Gas Evolve: Simplicity Energy EDF:Green Network, Utility Point, Zog Energy Eon:Enstroga, Hub Energy, Igloo and Symbio Octopus:Avro Energy Pozitive Energy:CNG Energy Scottish Power:Entice Energy, Orbit Energy Shell:Colorado Energy, Daligas, Goto Energy, Green, Pure Planet SmartestEnergy:MA Energy Utilita:Omni Energy YÃ¼ Energy:Ampoweruk, Xcel Power, Whoop Energy Ofgem andCitizens Advice,externalboth recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch. There's no need to cancel direct debits. If you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks. If you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business. It's unlikely. Usually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. But at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put. Those coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs. A tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive. Instead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust sayssimple changes to our homes and energy habits,externalcould help offset the current price rises. How to save energy at home and help the planet The price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months. It's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases. The energy cap rose sharply in October 2021 and again in April 2022. Ofgem has warned thata typical energy is likely to rise by a further Â£800 in Octoberwhen the cap is next reviewed. After reviewing the cap,the regulator has also proposed that in future the cap should be updated quarterly,externalrather than every six months. The price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, buta number of suppliers there have also announced price increases. How much are energy bills going up?

Why are gas prices so high?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

Ministers prepare for worst in gas price crisis,"The government has said it has to ""prepare for the worst"" as the UK's energy firms continue to come under pressure from soaring gas prices. Small business minister Paul Scully told the BBC his department was working closely with regulator Ofgem to protect customers if more firms went bust. Nearly 1.5 million customers have been hit in just two weeks by energy firms collapsing under soaring gas prices. Among them are Avro Energy and Green, which ceased trading on Wednesday. Their 830,000 combined customers face being switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider. All affected customers will still receive energy while a new supplier is appointed by Ofgem. Smaller providers launched in recent years have been overwhelmed by a global spike in wholesale gas prices, as economies have reopened from lockdowns and high demand from Asia has pushed down supplies to Europe. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills Mr Scully said he would not speculate about what might happen to gas prices next. But when asked what the government would do if prices did not come down again, he said: ""We have to prepare for the worst... We need to plan for that situation."" He added: ""We will work with each company and look at their particular circumstances to make sure we can get through this difficult time."" Despite Mr Scully's comments, the government has cooled on the idea of loans to the industry, says BBC business editor Simon Jack. He says that while the government had been talking of state-backed loans for larger energy firms, that idea is now ""very much on the back burner"" and its intention is to ""tough this one out"". Energy firms' collapse hits 1.5 million customers Where does the UK get its gas and is it facing a shortage this winter? What is the energy price cap and what if my supplier goes bust? Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' The BBC has been told that ministers believe the current system for managing the failure of energy companies, which allows companies to recoup losses through an industry-wide levy, is working satisfactorily, even though it will add costs to millions of customers' bills. Our business editor says ministers do accept that the existing system of reallocating customers would not work if one of the bigger challenger firms went bust. In that case, the government has the power to appoint a special administrator, in what would be a quasi-temporary nationalisation. The plight of Avro customers is a good illustration of what may befall hundreds of thousands of people in the coming weeks. An Avro customer in a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, who got a fixed rate deal in August, would have been paying Â£1,087 a year, according to price comparison site Uswitch. In March, they could have got a deal costing Â£920 a year. Now Avro has collapsed, they are likely to be paying Â£1,277 a year at their new supplier from 1 October, in line with Ofgem's price cap. The price cap does not mean it is impossible to pay more than Â£1,277 a year. It is a cap on the price, not the final bill. That figure is an illustration of the cap's effect on a gas and electricity customer's annual bill, assuming they have an average level of energy consumption. So, a household with heavy energy use will have a higher annual bill. The boss of failed firm Green, Peter McGirr, told the BBC he had done nothing wrong and said bigger firms would soon face problems and ""come cap in hand for a bailout."" Why are gas prices high and what's the energy price cap? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? But his firm faced criticism from one angry customer, 52-year-old Sara Pilgrim of North Lincolnshire, who switched to Green just a week ago. ""Green weren't the lowest, but I decided to go with them. ""How can they have been allowed to take on new contracts that close to them going bust? They must have known something was going on six days ago,"" she told the BBC. Price comparison site Uswitch has acknowledged there is currently no point in energy customers shopping around. Justina Miltienyte, the site's energy policy expert, said: ""If you are coming to the end of your fixed deal, our advice is to hold tight, stay put and be rolled over on to your supplier's standard variable rate."" Ofgem's price cap protects customers on some tariffs by limiting how much firms can charge per unit of gas. But providers have complained that this means they are unable to pass on their rising costs to customers. In the past two weeks, the number of firms which have collapsed account for more than 5% of the UK energy market. Other small companies could fold in the coming days and weeks. Igloo, for example, has said it is working with restructuring consultants Alvarez & Marsal, although it told the BBC it had not appointed administrators. Bulb, the UK's sixth largest energy company with 1.7 million customers, is also seeking additional financing. Dorset-based Utility Point, which had already ceased trading, said it had now gone into administration. Its 220,000 customers have been transferred to EDF. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says.

Fortnite banned from Apple App Store indefinitely,"Apple has banned Fortnite from its App Store until a legal battle with the game's maker Epic has concluded, according to Tim Sweeney, chief executive of Epic Games. This means the popular game won't be available for new users to download on iPhones or other Apple devices. Mr Sweeney called out Apple in a series of tweets and said the appeals process may take about five years to complete. The BBC has approached Apple for comment. People who already have the game downloaded on their Apple devices will be able to carry on playing it, but will not receive any updates. Fortnite was originally removed from Apple's App Store last year for violating its policies by launching its own in-app payment system. Apple charges a 30% commission on all in-app purchases, but this feature tried to bypass that. The move triggered a legal battle brought by Epic Games, which accused Apple of running the App Store as a monopoly. In September,a US court ruled that Apple could not stop app developers directing users to third-party payment options. But the judge also said that Epic failed to demonstrate Apple was operating an illegal monopoly. Both Epic and Apple are appealing respective parts of the judgement. ""Apple spent a year telling the world, the court, and the press they'd 'welcome Epic's return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else',"" Mr Sweeney wrote on Twitter. ""Epic agreed, and now Apple has reneged in another abuse of its monopoly power over a billion users."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Bank of England: Price rises to top 4% by year-end,"UK inflation is expected to rise above 4% by the end of the year, fuelled by rising energy costs, the Bank of England has warned. The Bank also said that there were signs the supply chain crisis was starting to hamper the economic recovery, and revised down its growth forecast for the third quarter by 1%. It came as the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee held interest rates at 0.1% Despite the inflation forecast a rate rise was not yet needed, the MPC said. Factors driving higher inflation were still expected to moderate next year, the policymakers said. Supply constraints were hitting recovery and there are signs ""cost pressures may prove more persistent."" Food firms warn of panic-buying this Christmas HGV driver shortage: Patient care risk over NHS deliveries Energy firms' collapse hits 1.5 million customers Supply chain challenges evident in shops, ports and forecourts are now having a material impact on the recovery from the pandemic. The Bank of England has revised down its expectations for economic growth in the current three month period. In addition to these supply challenges, there are shortages from workers to microchips, which may mean inflation proves to be ""more persistent"". Interest rates were unanimously kept on hold at the record low level of 0.1%. But two of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee, including a deputy governor, voted to stop the Bank buying government bonds on account of inflation worries. Supply chain factors now holding growth back and there is also renewed concern that more than a million workers are stuck on the furlough scheme. The Bank will wait to see the impact of the end of furlough at least before turning off the tap of funds it is pumping into the economy. The Bank said that supply constraints were ""evident in surveys showing historically lengthy supplier delivery times and backlogs of work, significant material and labour shortages in a number of sectors, and lower levels of inventories"". Developments over the past month have ""strengthened"" the case made in August that some tightening of monetary policy could be necessary to meet the central bank's 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term, policymakers said. The MPC added that ""considerable uncertainties remain"". It said Consumer Prices Index inflation, currently at 3.2%, could remain above 4% into the second quarter of next year. Hinesh Patel, a portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said the Bank ""clearly expects the inflation rate to be higher than previously feared"". ""While they reiterate it will be transitory, it will no doubt be of major concern. ""Ultimately what is flowing through the system right now is 'bad inflation', that is: price rises are hitting the most vulnerable households, alongside the impacts of furlough on unemployment uncertainty,"" he said. Last month, the Bank said it expected the economy to regain its pre-pandemic size in the final three months of 2021 and inflation to hit a 10-year high of 4% at the same time.

""It's time for humanity to grow up,"" he added ahead of the UK hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The prime minister also said it was time to listen to the warnings of scientists. ""Look at Covid if you want an example of gloomy scientists being proved right."" Boris Johnson at the UN fact-checked What do world leaders need to agree to stop climate change? World on course to heat up to dangerous levels Setting the tone for November's meeting, he said countries must make ""substantial changes"" by the end of the decade if the world is to stave off further temperature rises. ""I passionately believe that we can do it by making commitments in four areas - coal, cars, cash and trees,"" he said. Mr Johnson praised China's President Xi Jinping for hisrecent pledgeto stop building new coal-fire energy plants abroad. But he called on the country - which produces 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions - to go further and end its domestic use of coal, saying the UK was proof that it could be done. The UK used coal to generate 25% of its electricity five years ago - but that is now down to 2%. Mr Johnson said it would be ""gone altogether"" by 2024. But Labour's shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband accused the UK government of ""facing both ways"" on climate change, urging other nations to take action while it considered plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria and cut money for improving home insulation. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that a UK trade deal had also allowed Australia to renege on their climate commitments. ""It undermines our moral standing as the host. I want the prime minister to succeed, but I'm afraid he's left it very late and he's not handled this presidency well,"" he said. In his speech, the prime minister also said he did not see a conflict between the green movement and capitalism, saying: ""The whole experience of the Covid pandemic is that the way to fix the problem is through science and innovation, the breakthroughs and the investment that are made possible by capitalism and by free markets."" ""We have the tools for a green industrial revolution but time is desperately short,"" he added. Elsewhere, the prime minister made a series of calls for action to his fellow leaders, including: to allow only zero-emission vehicles to be on sale across the world by 2040 for every country to cut carbon emissions by 68% by 2030, compared to levels in 1990 to pledge collectively to achieve carbon neutrality - ornet zero- by the middle of the century to end the use of coal power in the developing world by 2040 and in the developed world by 2030 to halt and reverse the loss of trees and biodiversity by 2030. Amid the serious warnings, Mr Johnson also attempted to strike a humorous note at points, including saying Kermit the Frog had been wrong when he sang It's Not Easy Bein' Green. The prime minister reiterated that the world must curb the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5C - the stricter of the two targets set by the UN in the 2015 Paris agreement. However, the world is already 1C hotter compared with pre-industrial levels. ""If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century,"" Mr Johnson said. ""And never mind what that will do to the ice floes... we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before, not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster but because of us, because of what we are doing now. ""And our grandchildren will know that we are the culprits and... that we were warned and they will know that it was this generation that came centre stage to speak and act on behalf of posterity and that we missed our cue and they will ask themselves what kind of people we were to be so selfish and so short sighted."" Boris Johnson is fashioning himself as a leader on climate change. He has set a benchmark by phasing out sales of most new conventional vehicles by 2030. The international alliance he's formed to get rid of coal power is gathering support - though not yet enough. And by setting aggressive targets to cut carbon emissions overall (78% by 2035) he is encouraging others to follow. Yet, in his own backyard, the prime minister is stumbling. He previously pledged ""never to be lagging on lagging"". But his plan for insulating homes is badly delayed - along with other vital initiatives on issues including aviation, farming and financing the low carbon revolution. Recent research showed his government had imposedless than a quarter of the policies neededto clean up the economy. And some policies - likenot opposing a coal mine in Cumbria,cutting taxes on flyingandbuilding HS2- will send emissions up when they are supposed to be going down. At COP26, leaders from 196 countries will be asked to agree action to limit climate change and its effects, like rising sea levels and extreme weather. A recent report from UN scientists warned that global temperatures have risen faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2,000 years.

What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?,"Thirty energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August 2021, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. What happens when a supplier goes bust, and what should consumers do? More than four million households have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. Ofgem automatically moves customers to a new provider, and their supply will continue without interruption. The companies which have gone out of business are: Ampoweruk, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice Energy, Goto Energy, Green, Green Network Energy, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy, MoneyPlus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Simplicity, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Together Energy, Utility Point, Whoop Energy, Xcel Power, Zebra Power and Zog Energy. Firms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices, which have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies. The wholesale price of gas - the price that UK fuel companies pay gas suppliers - has also gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. How high could my energy bills go? Why are prices rising so quickly? Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? If your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. Because of its size, Bulbwas put into an arrangement called ""special administration"". The company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it meansBulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything,external. The accounts held by the other failed firmsare automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.,external You can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff. Ofgemhas sent customers,externalto the following suppliers: British Gas:Bluegreen Energy Services, MoneyPlus Energy, Neon Reef, People's Energy, PFP Energy, Social Energy Supply, Together Energy and Zebra Power British Gas Evolve: Simplicity Energy EDF:Green Network, Utility Point, Zog Energy Eon:Enstroga, Hub Energy, Igloo and Symbio Octopus:Avro Energy Pozitive Energy:CNG Energy Scottish Power:Entice Energy, Orbit Energy Shell:Colorado Energy, Daligas, Goto Energy, Green, Pure Planet SmartestEnergy:MA Energy Utilita:Omni Energy YÃ¼ Energy:Ampoweruk, Xcel Power, Whoop Energy Ofgem andCitizens Advice,externalboth recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch. There's no need to cancel direct debits. If you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks. If you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business. It's unlikely. Usually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. But at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put. Those coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs. A tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive. Instead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust sayssimple changes to our homes and energy habits,externalcould help offset the current price rises. How to save energy at home and help the planet The price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months. It's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases. The energy cap rose sharply in October 2021 and again in April 2022. Ofgem has warned thata typical energy is likely to rise by a further Â£800 in Octoberwhen the cap is next reviewed. After reviewing the cap,the regulator has also proposed that in future the cap should be updated quarterly,externalrather than every six months. The price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, buta number of suppliers there have also announced price increases. How much are energy bills going up?

Regulator warns bills may rise,"The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC. It comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices. ""As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up"", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said. The government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers. If an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust. Mr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's ""number one priority"". However, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way. Peter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis. Mr McGirr said the firm was in ""deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface"". Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? What happens if my energy supplier goes bust? Why are gas prices rising? Green has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers. Mr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an ""advisory and restructuring"" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks. ""We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support"", he added. The company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support. Mr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall. Asked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: ""We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications."" Customers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas. The price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. Industry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January. But Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. When asked if Ofgem was ""asleep at the wheel"" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: ""No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies. ""We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: ""I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run."" However, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust. ""If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,"" he added. Mr Kwarteng alsowarned many UK households could face a ""very difficult winter"",with fuel prices surging and the Â£20-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October. How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull The government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the ""clear and agreed position"". The price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. When fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. Mr Brearley said the industry had seen ""an unprecedented rise in gas prices"". ""They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,"" he added. The government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources ""that can more than meet demand"". However, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France. The International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying ""it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels"", in preparation for the winter. It added: ""Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level. ""This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market."" Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.""

City boss: 'People abuse working from home',"Andrew Monk says employees abuse working from home Andrew Monk, a City chief executive, is not a fan of government proposals for new staff to have the right to ask to work from home. ""People abuse it,"" and are less productive, at least in financial services, he told the BBC. His view is that a lot of people who ask for flexible working want to work part-time but on a full-time salary. The government, however, says that allowing flexible working makes businesses more productive. It is proposing that from the first day of employment new starters can request flexible working, rather than having to wait at least six months, as is the case at the moment. Under the proposals people can request flexible working such as job sharing, flexi-time, or working from home. Employers won't have to agree to the request. Staff to gain right to request flexible working from first day Should I be working from home or going back to the office? Job vacancies: How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Nevertheless, any legislation is ""setting a tone that is almost making people think they can do part-time work but on full-time salaries"", Mr Monk told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. He is chief executive of investment firm VSA Capital, which employs about 20 people in the City of London. ""Pretty much we are all back at work, because I think that's what we need to be in our particular industry,"" he says. ""Obviously it varies from industry to industry, but in financial services it's more important to be in the office because its a very live industry"". Some big firms, including accountancy giants PwC and Deloitte, have gone the other way from VSA Capital, however, and have embraced flexible working. Mr Monk said: ""What you'll find is that audit work is taking significantly longer than it used to take, and of course when things take longer, it means they cost more as well, because these people tend to charge by the hour."" ""Actually, although they are all working from home and say it's all fine, it's not fine."" Mr Monk said the time it takes for firms to set up a stock market flotation has jumped from three months on average to six. ""London is very lucky - we have a financial centre that is the pride of the world, and you have to work long hours,"" he said. ""But we're also paid very high salaries, and so you can't expect to be paid a good salary and then not work hard."" The number of people working from home jumped dramatically during coronavirus lockdowns in the UK, and may businesses are gearing up to let employees work from home at least some of the time. However, some big City firms, such as Goldman Sachs, are opposed to working from home, with its boss David Solomon labelling it as an ""aberration"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak has also warned that working from home can damage young people's careers. However, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said: ""Empowering workers to have more say over where and when they work makes for more productive businesses and happier employees. ""It was once considered a 'nice to have', but by making requests a day one right, we're making flexible working part of the DNA of businesses across the country."" Kate Hulley, the owner and manager of cardboard box manufacturer Belmont Packaging, recently switched her factory to a four-day week. ""We've never looked back,"" she told the BBC Radio 5Live's Wake Up to Money programme. ""Productivity went up."" The firm compressed the week, doing the same amount of hours in four days. ""It has worked extremely well. The customers haven't seen any difference in service."" Stephen Warnham, head of content at UK jobs site Totaljobs.com, earlier told the BBC that firms competing for staff needed to trust people ""to work in the way that best gets the job done"". As part of a survey of 200,000 staff worldwide, published in March this year, Totaljobs found that nine in 10 employees wanted partial flexibility to choose where they work. ""From a legislative perspective this is long overdue as a third of employers we speak to are already doing this anyway, so it is a really critical change,"" said Mr Warnham. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy also said that flexible working leads to a workforce that is more productive and highly motivated,pointing to a 2017 study by HSBC,external. There have been a number of studies which indicate that employees are more productive if they are allowed to work flexibly,including a remote working experiment in China. Some people find it easier to focus without distractions from colleagues in the office. More recently,a University of Southampton study,externalof work during Covid lockdowns suggested that 90% of people thought their productivity had stayed the same or improved by working from home.

"BP closes some sites due to lorry driver shortageThe oil firm said only ""a handful"" of sites are affected by the fuel supply issues.Business","A BP garage showing out of use signs today in Sherborne BP has warned it has had to ""temporarily"" close some of its petrol stations due to a shortage of lorry drivers. The oil firm said only ""a handful"" of sites were affected by the fuel supply issues, which have led to a lack of unleaded and diesel fuel. There are around 1,200 BP branded petrol stations around the UK, of which 300 are operated by BP themselves. The company said it was working hard to address the issues. Supply chain delays had been ""impacted by industry wide driver shortages across the UK"" and that the company was working hard to address the issues, BP said in a statement. ""We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries,"" the company added. Other petrol station operators have been approached by the BBC for comment. Esso said that a ""small number"" of its 200 Tesco Alliance retail sites have been affected. ""We are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimise supplies and minimise any inconvenience to customers. We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience,"" a spokesperson from Esso added. However, supermarket Morrisons, which operates 338 petrol stations across the UK, said it was not seeing any similar issues at the moment. Co-op runs 130 petrol stations in the country, and said it has a ""full complement"" of fuel delivery drivers. Tesco also said that they have a ""good availability of fuel"" and both Sainsbury's and Asda said there are no current issues in their fuel supplies. A BP petrol station in Worcester was closed due a lack of fuel Downing Street has said people should continue buying fuel as normal. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was no shortage of fuel in the UK, adding: ""We obviously recognise the challenges faced by the industry and we're taking steps to support them."" He pointed to changes made by the Department for Transport to make it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences and said that this is a problem several countries are facing. Grant Shapps also told the BBC's Question Time on Thursday that he believed the shortages had also been caused because of working conditions that ""hadn't been pleasant"" and that higher salaries offered to drivers was something the government was ""happy to see"". He also said that improvements in the availability of tests were ""coming in prior to Christmasâ¦ so these are things that will resolve the issues in the lead up to Christmas"". The temporary closures come just months after BPhad to close a ""handful"" of its UK sites in Julybecause of lorry driver shortages. At the time, BP said its supply chain issues had also been exacerbated by the closure of a distribution terminal due to staff being told to isolate. Paul Cheema's petrol station is just about to run out of unleaded petrol Paul Cheema has run a petrol station in Coventry since 2013, and says he's never experienced a situation like this before. ""We used to be able to put orders in for next day delivery. Now we have to do it a week in advance, but we're ordering blind. We don't know how much fuel we're going to sell in that time. If we'll have enough, or even too much,"" says Paul. ""Last week we put in an order for a delivery to arrive today. That was pushed back until tomorrow, and now we've been told it won't arrive until Saturday."" ""So that means we won't have any unleaded petrol to sell tomorrow,"" he said. Paul says that fuel delivery delays have been happening all summer, but it's been particularly bad in the last couple of weeks. ""We're a petrol station. We should have availability 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I'm not blaming our fuel supplier. It's not their fault. It's the bigger driver shortage problem behind it."" He sells thousands of litres of unleaded every day, so the cost implications for him are huge. ""There could be a 40% impact on sales with this week's delivery problems. If I haven't got any liquid in the ground, I'm not making money. I can't operate the site at a loss."" ""If I haven't got fuel to sell, that customer isn't coming into my petrol station shop either, so I'm losing money there too,"" says Paul. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents petrol station operators across the UK, said that some sites across the UK were seeing delivery delays, but that they were largely confined to London and the South East, and were ""temporary by nature"". Gordon Balmer from the PRA said that petrol station closures were rare, and that the fuel supply chain was resilient enough to cope. ""Fuel demand is still only at 92% of pre-pandemic levels so we believe there should be ample stock available at refineries and delivery terminals throughout the UK."" Many businesses have been complaining about the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, which is still causing serious supply chain problems. The coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have all contributed to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers. Logistics UK, which represents the haulage industry, said it was ""aware of reports that petrol supplies are currently being affected"" by the lack of drivers. ""The driver shortage is a very serious issue that needs urgent government and industry action to resolve, however, we urge people not to panic buy; the logistics industry is resilient and has proven capable of supporting shops, families and businesses during Covid-19, border closures and the first stages of Brexit, and will continue to serve the needs of the nation,"" the industry body said.

US Haiti envoy quits over migrant deportations,"This video can not be played Watch: Thousands at Haitian migrant camp in Texas The US special envoy for Haiti has resigned in protest over the deportation of Haitian migrants. The decision to return migrants fleeing an earthquake and political instability was ""inhumane"", senior diplomat Daniel Foote said in a damning letter. Last weekend, the US started deportation flights from a Texas border town, where about 13,000 migrants had gathered under a bridge. They have been waiting in a makeshift camp in temperatures of 37C (99F). Local officials have struggled to provide them with food and adequate sanitation. Since Sunday, the US has returned to Haiti 1,401 migrants from the Texas camp on the border with Mexico. Inhis resignation letter,external, Mr Foote said Haiti was a ""collapsed state"" that ""simply cannot support the forced infusion of thousands of returned migrants lacking food, shelter, and money without additional, avoidable human tragedy"". White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki responded in a press conference: ""Special Envoy Foote had ample opportunity to raise concerns about immigration during his tenure. He never once did so."" Ms Psaki also described images from the border - showing horse-mounted US officers corralling the migrants - as horrific and said horses would no longer be used in the area. Images showed US Border Patrol agents charging at Haitian migrants by Rio Grande river that divides Texas and Mexico. The widely shared pictures, taken by an AFP photographer earlier this week, have evoked grim comparisons to US slavery and the country's historical mistreatment of black people. That led to pressure on President Joe Biden's administration, and prompted calls from within his Democratic Party to give the Haitians asylum rather than fly them back to their home country. Why are so many Haitians at the US-Mexico border? Images of Haitians at US border echo grim past What is Biden doing differently at US border? Many Haitians left after a devastating earthquake struck the country in 2010. A large number of those in the camp had been living in Brazil or other South American countries and travelled north after being unable to secure jobs or legal status. This year has brought further hardship for the impoverished country. In July, President Jovenel MoÃ¯se was assassinated - and in August it suffered another deadly earthquake. Mr Foote said Haitians needed ""immediate assistance"", and criticised the US and other countries for interfering in the country's politics. ""What our Haitian friends really want, and need, is the opportunity to chart their own course, without international puppeteering and favoured candidates but with genuine support for that course,"" he said. Mr Foote has served in the role since MoÃ¯se's assassination in July. A state department spokesperson thanked the ambassador for his work, and insisted that the US remained ""committed to supporting safe, orderly, and humane migration throughout our region"". But in a later statement, a department spokesperson hit back at Mr Foote's claim he had been ignored by officials. ""It is unfortunate that, instead of participating in a solutions-oriented policy process, Special Envoy Foote has both resigned and mischaracterised the circumstances,"" Ned Price said. President Biden has been accused of having an incoherent policy on migration. On the campaign trail, he vowed to reverse President Donald Trump's policies - which he deemed too harsh - and he put Vice-President Kamala Harris in charge of the issue in March. But critics say they have failed to come up with a concrete plan for the near future, with thenumbers of migrants coming into the country reaching record highs. On the US side of the Mexican border in Del Rio, teams of police and National Guard agents have ""completely blocked off"" the area, according to immigrant rights activist Jenn Budd, who is at the scene. ""You cannot breathe here without law enforcement knowing what you're doing,"" Ms Budd, a former Border Patrol agent, told the BBC. ""They're cleaning it up and getting rid of everything, and they have shut down access to the river itself."" On the Mexican side of the river, migrants in a camp in Ciudad AcuÃ±a are voicing concern about potential expulsions. ""I have nothing in my country. What are they going to do?"" one tearful Haitian woman asked an AFP reporter. Separately, nearly 19,000 mostly Haitian migrants are in Colombia, waiting to cross the border with Panama on the journey to the US, officials say. ""We want them to let us cross, from here to Panama, before the United States closes its border,"" one migrant said. ""They are going to take away our dreams. I come from Peru, I've been struggling."" As monthly border-crossings continue to surge, Joe Biden has been caught between conservatives who say he is weak on undocumented migrants and liberal activists who view his policies as too much like those of his predecessor, Donald Trump. Now the criticism of Biden's actions are coming from inside his own administration - a development that could encourage more to speak out. The images of uniformed border patrol agents on horseback accosting black Haitians have drawn comparisons to dark chapters of slavery and discrimination in American history. Immigration activists say the border episode provides evidence of the harsher treatment dark-skinned migrants receive in this country. The US has a process by which it can give undocumented migrants ""temporary protected status"" from deportation if government officials determine that it would not be safe to return them to their home country. Haitians, as well as citizens from a handful of Central American countries, enjoy this protection - and it's cited as one of the reasons migrants brave the hazardous journey to the US, even though new arrivals do not qualify for the protections. Instead, the Haitians at the border are being sent back to a homeland where, according to Daniel Foote in his resignation letter, they face inhumane treatment and grave danger.

"'Side-eyeing Chloe', 10, to sell viral meme as NFTThe image of Chloe Clem could fetch her tens of thousands of dollars at auction.US & Canada","Chloe Clem's disapproving look when she was two years old has become an internet sensation A young girl who became an internet sensation when a photo of her went viral is now selling an NFT for thousands of dollars at auction. NFTs are unique digital tokens which are often attributed to art that has no physical representation. Chloe Clem, now 10, became famous in 2013 when her mother shared her unimpressed reaction to a surprise Disneyland trip online. The image has become a popular meme for expressing concern. An NFT provides a digital certificate of ownership for the piece, but bears no copyright. Therefore the winner of the auction will own the digital token representing the meme, but not the meme itself. EXPLAINER:What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? NFTs are usually bought in cryptocurrencies, so the transaction is recorded on a publicly available ledger called the blockchain. The digital artworks have come under fire recently due to environmental concerns, as vast amounts of energy are required to mine cryptocurrencies, process transactions and maintain the blockchain. In September 2013, Chloe's motherKatie uploaded a video,externalfeaturing her two daughters reacting to the Disneyland surprise. One of the girls, Lily, started crying, she said, ""but then the camera panned over and Chloe made her cute little buck-toothed side-eye face and the internet did the rest."" The video has been watched more than 20 million times, while the image of Chloe's reaction became an internet sensation. ""I opened up Tumblr and there were just pages and pages of Chloe's face,"" her mother told the BBC. ""It was very weird, very overwhelming. I had my family, friends sending me these memes - till this day they still send me the memes of Chloe they see on the internet.""

Now the Utah family has decided to auction off the image as an NFT. Bids start at 5 Ethereum - a form of cryptocurrency worth roughly $15,000 (Â£11,000). Ms Clem said that after learning about the NFT market, selling the meme was a ""no brainer"". ""It's a cool opportunity, especially if there's a Chloe fan out there who loves this meme they'll be able to own it. Even Chloe has said 'that's pretty cool' - it's a typical 10-year-old thing to say."" The market for ownership rights to digital art has boomed recently after several multi-million-dollar NFT sales. In March, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey sold his first ever tweet for the equivalent of $2.9m to a Malaysia-based businessman.

"BP closes some sites due to lorry driver shortageThe oil firm said only ""a handful"" of sites are affected by the fuel supply issues.","A BP garage showing out of use signs today in Sherborne BP has warned it has had to ""temporarily"" close some of its petrol stations due to a shortage of lorry drivers. The oil firm said only ""a handful"" of sites were affected by the fuel supply issues, which have led to a lack of unleaded and diesel fuel. There are around 1,200 BP branded petrol stations around the UK, of which 300 are operated by BP themselves. The company said it was working hard to address the issues. Supply chain delays had been ""impacted by industry wide driver shortages across the UK"" and that the company was working hard to address the issues, BP said in a statement. ""We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries,"" the company added. Other petrol station operators have been approached by the BBC for comment. Esso said that a ""small number"" of its 200 Tesco Alliance retail sites have been affected. ""We are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimise supplies and minimise any inconvenience to customers. We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience,"" a spokesperson from Esso added. However, supermarket Morrisons, which operates 338 petrol stations across the UK, said it was not seeing any similar issues at the moment. Co-op runs 130 petrol stations in the country, and said it has a ""full complement"" of fuel delivery drivers. Tesco also said that they have a ""good availability of fuel"" and both Sainsbury's and Asda said there are no current issues in their fuel supplies. A BP petrol station in Worcester was closed due a lack of fuel Downing Street has said people should continue buying fuel as normal. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was no shortage of fuel in the UK, adding: ""We obviously recognise the challenges faced by the industry and we're taking steps to support them."" He pointed to changes made by the Department for Transport to make it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences and said that this is a problem several countries are facing. Grant Shapps also told the BBC's Question Time on Thursday that he believed the shortages had also been caused because of working conditions that ""hadn't been pleasant"" and that higher salaries offered to drivers was something the government was ""happy to see"". He also said that improvements in the availability of tests were ""coming in prior to Christmasâ¦ so these are things that will resolve the issues in the lead up to Christmas"". The temporary closures come just months after BPhad to close a ""handful"" of its UK sites in Julybecause of lorry driver shortages. At the time, BP said its supply chain issues had also been exacerbated by the closure of a distribution terminal due to staff being told to isolate. Paul Cheema's petrol station is just about to run out of unleaded petrol Paul Cheema has run a petrol station in Coventry since 2013, and says he's never experienced a situation like this before. ""We used to be able to put orders in for next day delivery. Now we have to do it a week in advance, but we're ordering blind. We don't know how much fuel we're going to sell in that time. If we'll have enough, or even too much,"" says Paul. ""Last week we put in an order for a delivery to arrive today. That was pushed back until tomorrow, and now we've been told it won't arrive until Saturday."" ""So that means we won't have any unleaded petrol to sell tomorrow,"" he said. Paul says that fuel delivery delays have been happening all summer, but it's been particularly bad in the last couple of weeks. ""We're a petrol station. We should have availability 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I'm not blaming our fuel supplier. It's not their fault. It's the bigger driver shortage problem behind it."" He sells thousands of litres of unleaded every day, so the cost implications for him are huge. ""There could be a 40% impact on sales with this week's delivery problems. If I haven't got any liquid in the ground, I'm not making money. I can't operate the site at a loss."" ""If I haven't got fuel to sell, that customer isn't coming into my petrol station shop either, so I'm losing money there too,"" says Paul. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents petrol station operators across the UK, said that some sites across the UK were seeing delivery delays, but that they were largely confined to London and the South East, and were ""temporary by nature"". Gordon Balmer from the PRA said that petrol station closures were rare, and that the fuel supply chain was resilient enough to cope. ""Fuel demand is still only at 92% of pre-pandemic levels so we believe there should be ample stock available at refineries and delivery terminals throughout the UK."" Many businesses have been complaining about the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, which is still causing serious supply chain problems. The coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have all contributed to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers. Logistics UK, which represents the haulage industry, said it was ""aware of reports that petrol supplies are currently being affected"" by the lack of drivers. ""The driver shortage is a very serious issue that needs urgent government and industry action to resolve, however, we urge people not to panic buy; the logistics industry is resilient and has proven capable of supporting shops, families and businesses during Covid-19, border closures and the first stages of Brexit, and will continue to serve the needs of the nation,"" the industry body said.

Extremists using video-game chats to spread hate,"A user-built Nazi concentration camp in Minecraft Extremists are using mainstream video games and gaming chat platforms to spread hate, BBC Click has found. Over three months, researchers found anti-Semitism, racism and homophobia on platforms, including DLive and Odysee, where users stream and chat about games such as Call of Duty and Minecraft. Campaigners say including extremist narratives among everyday conversations can be a pathway to radicalisation. These conversations then move to spaces such as private Telegram channels. ""Once you're in that world, then the radicalisation starts to happen,"" Joe Mulhall, of anti-fascist organisation Hope Not Hate, said. ""That's when you start to go to other meetings, to smaller groups that aren't necessarily playing games, talking about politics more explicitly."" In response, Telegram told BBC News it used a ""combination of proactive monitoring of public spaces and user reports"" to remove content breaching its terms of service. DLive and Odysee have not responded to BBC News's requests for comment. Their policies cite zero tolerance against hate and violent extremism and both say they are proactive at removing any content violating guidelines. Extreme view were slipped into chats on DLive and Odysee Call of Duty said: ""The actions we have taken to confront racist behaviour include banning players for racist and hate-oriented names, implementing new technology and making it easier for players to report offensive in-game behaviour."" But the researchers also found extremist ""roleplay"" scenarios within games on various platforms that let players create and share their own custom maps and environments. These included Nazi concentration camps and a Uyghur detainment camp in games such as Roblox and Minecraft. One Roblox driving game invited players to ""become a racist"" and simulate the murder of people belonging to ethnic minorities by running them over in a car. A user-generated game in Roblox let players run over non-white characters ""These are small and not played by a huge amount of people but what they do is allow extremists to create role-playing experiences... to live out radicalised fantasies online,"" Jacob Davey, from the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, said. Roblox said: ""We work relentlessly to ensure our platform remains a safe and civil space, and with a combination of machine learning and a team of over 2,000 moderators, we monitor for safety 24-7 to detect and swiftly act on any inappropriate content or behaviour."" Minecraft said: ""Terrorist or violent extremist content is strictly forbidden by our community standards and we take action to remove such content if it appears on our systems."" But extremists may have turned to gaming spaces after the social-media giants increased enforcement of their rules, according to the researchers. Mr Davey said: ""The extreme right-wing have potentially found safe harbours to broadcast their ideology or to engage in more traditional propagandising - the sorts of things that they would have done a few years ago on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. ""Online gaming basically forms a means for people to connect over a shared hobby online, and this includes extremists. ""It's a way for them to connect with like-minded individuals, to socialise and ultimately form firmer social bonds, which can be really important in terms of advancing and furthering extremist movements globally."" Mr Mulhall said: ""You sit at home after school and play games, so the gaming element can create a sense that it's normal, not extremist, not dangerous."" The Royal United Services Institute is part of a team of counter-extremism experts launching a large-scale investigation into online gaming. The defence think tank' s Dr Jessica White said: ""The online and chat space where moderation tends to be poor is being increasingly encroached upon by extremists but we need to get widespread evidence of its scale."" The government is also in talks with industry bodies to discuss steps to tackle the exploitation of gaming spaces by extremists. A representative of Ukie, the UK's gaming trade body, said:  ""We use sophisticated AI [artificial-intelligence] moderation tools and trained community managers to build safe spaces. ""We also work closely with government and law enforcement to further protect players. ""We know the challenges we face are shared by other forms of digital entertainment and we continue to adopt a positive and proactive approach to protecting players.""

Food firms face CO2 price rise,"The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. The government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. The closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry. US-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills Farms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. The Times also reported,externalthat ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. The government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the ""low tens of millions"" and will be below Â£50m. Mr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries ""will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs"". At the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. Mr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept ""a big, sharp rise"" carbon dioxide prices from Â£200 to Â£1,000 a tonne. ""The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,"" he said. ""But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing."" Mr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a ""significant impact"" on food prices. He said that while food prices were increasing ""due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages"", carbon dioxide was ""a tiny proportion"" of the industry's overall costs. CF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices. Carbon dioxide is used in the slaughter of animals such as chickens CF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. The company told the BBC it had ""no estimate"" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. The British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a ""huge relief"" and said it was now ""focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down"". Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide ""will still be tight"". He told the BBC's Today programme: ""Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the ""exceptional short-term arrangement"" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 ""have the resources they require to avoid disruption"". He said: ""With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened."" The government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support. Commenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: ""In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement. ""It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. Mr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a ""perfect storm"" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because ""an increase in gas price means they are not profitable"", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance. But the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. ""Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,"" the BMPA said. ""If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas."" Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2. Mr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: ""We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market."" Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Gas price crisis: Government poised to step in The BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull. This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worryabout putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit. Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Mr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit. The government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. It had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. But the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. Now there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a ""sustainable market-based solution"". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers.

"PM: Humanity reaching a turning point on climateWorld leaders must make major changes in four areas - ""coal, cars, cash and trees"", Boris Johnson says.UKComments","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: It's time for humanity to grow up A climate summit of world leaders in 40 days' time will be the ""turning point for humanity"", PM Boris Johnson has said in a speech to the United Nations. He warned that global temperature rises were already inevitable, but called on his fellow leaders to commit to major changes to curb further warming. Four areas needed tackling - ""coal, cars, cash and trees"", he said. Countries must take responsibility for ""the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves"". ""It's time for humanity to grow up,"" he added ahead of the UK hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The prime minister also said it was time to listen to the warnings of scientists. ""Look at Covid if you want an example of gloomy scientists being proved right."" Boris Johnson at the UN fact-checked What do world leaders need to agree to stop climate change? World on course to heat up to dangerous levels Setting the tone for November's meeting, he said countries must make ""substantial changes"" by the end of the decade if the world is to stave off further temperature rises. ""I passionately believe that we can do it by making commitments in four areas - coal, cars, cash and trees,"" he said. Mr Johnson praised China's President Xi Jinping for hisrecent pledgeto stop building new coal-fire energy plants abroad. But he called on the country - which produces 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions - to go further and end its domestic use of coal, saying the UK was proof that it could be done. The UK used coal to generate 25% of its electricity five years ago - but that is now down to 2%. Mr Johnson said it would be ""gone altogether"" by 2024. But Labour's shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband accused the UK government of ""facing both ways"" on climate change, urging other nations to take action while it considered plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria and cut money for improving home insulation. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that a UK trade deal had also allowed Australia to renege on their climate commitments. ""It undermines our moral standing as the host. I want the prime minister to succeed, but I'm afraid he's left it very late and he's not handled this presidency well,"" he said. In his speech, the prime minister also said he did not see a conflict between the green movement and capitalism, saying: ""The whole experience of the Covid pandemic is that the way to fix the problem is through science and innovation, the breakthroughs and the investment that are made possible by capitalism and by free markets."" ""We have the tools for a green industrial revolution but time is desperately short,"" he added. Elsewhere, the prime minister made a series of calls for action to his fellow leaders, including: to allow only zero-emission vehicles to be on sale across the world by 2040 for every country to cut carbon emissions by 68% by 2030, compared to levels in 1990 to pledge collectively to achieve carbon neutrality - ornet zero- by the middle of the century to end the use of coal power in the developing world by 2040 and in the developed world by 2030 to halt and reverse the loss of trees and biodiversity by 2030. Amid the serious warnings, Mr Johnson also attempted to strike a humorous note at points, including saying Kermit the Frog had been wrong when he sang It's Not Easy Bein' Green. The prime minister reiterated that the world must curb the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5C - the stricter of the two targets set by the UN in the 2015 Paris agreement. However, the world is already 1C hotter compared with pre-industrial levels. ""If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century,"" Mr Johnson said. ""And never mind what that will do to the ice floes... we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before, not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster but because of us, because of what we are doing now. ""And our grandchildren will know that we are the culprits and... that we were warned and they will know that it was this generation that came centre stage to speak and act on behalf of posterity and that we missed our cue and they will ask themselves what kind of people we were to be so selfish and so short sighted."" Boris Johnson is fashioning himself as a leader on climate change. He has set a benchmark by phasing out sales of most new conventional vehicles by 2030. The international alliance he's formed to get rid of coal power is gathering support - though not yet enough. And by setting aggressive targets to cut carbon emissions overall (78% by 2035) he is encouraging others to follow. Yet, in his own backyard, the prime minister is stumbling. He previously pledged ""never to be lagging on lagging"". But his plan for insulating homes is badly delayed - along with other vital initiatives on issues including aviation, farming and financing the low carbon revolution. Recent research showed his government had imposedless than a quarter of the policies neededto clean up the economy. And some policies - likenot opposing a coal mine in Cumbria,cutting taxes on flyingandbuilding HS2- will send emissions up when they are supposed to be going down. At COP26, leaders from 196 countries will be asked to agree action to limit climate change and its effects, like rising sea levels and extreme weather. A recent report from UN scientists warned that global temperatures have risen faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2,000 years.

Evergrande shares jump as debt deadline looms,"Shares in Evergrande have jumped in Hong Kong after the troubled property giant struck an agreement with Chinese bond holders on Wednesday. The announcement helped to calm some investor concerns over debts of more than $300bn (Â£220bn). But the world's most indebted developer is also due to make a $83.5m interest payment on an overseas bond on Thursday. The Hong Kong market was closed on Wednesday when the deal was announced. After a volatile day of trading, Evergrande shares closed more than 17% higher. The firm's shares have lost more than 80% of their value on the Hong Kong stock market so far this year as it struggles to raise money to meet its obligations. What is Evergrande and is it too big to fail? The company had moved to placate investors, saying in a statement on Wednesday that it would pay interest payments for its domestic bonds. The amount due for the domestic bond is estimated to be $35.9m (Â£26.3m). However, the statement did not reveal how much interest would be paid or when any payment would be made, saying only that the bond ""has already been resolved through private negotiations"". The filing also did not mention the separate foreign bond. Under agreements with investors, the company has a 30-day grace period before a missed payment on the offshore bond would become a default. Some analysts have cautioned that the failure of such a large and heavily-indebted property developer could have a major impact on the Chinese economy, which could potentially spread to the global financial system. Asian stocks mixed as Evergrande fears persist And while Wednesday's deal was seen by some investors as a positive development, others remain wary. ""It's too soon to say whether this is just a brief respite or it signifies that a rescue plan is in the works,"" Donald Low, Director of the Institute for Emerging Market Studies at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said. Investment experts are looking for clarity over what the Chinese government may do to resolve the firm's debt crisis. ""Until there is certainty regarding how the government will deal with Evergrande, investors are likely to remain jittery,"" Catherine Yeung, Investment Director, Fidelity International told the BBC. Ms Yeung also pointed that Beijing' business crackdown - which has seen it increasingly tightening its grip on big businesses, including tech giant Alibaba and ride-sharing app Didi Chuxing- may add to uncertainty. China says crackdown on business to go on for years ""Investors can usually deal with different standalone issues but the regulatory changes we have seen so far this year, coupled with the fast evolving Evergrande situation, has seen investor sentiment weaken,"" she said.

"'Side-eying Chloe', 10, to sell viral meme","Chloe Clem's disapproving look when she was two years old has become an internet sensation A young girl who became an internet sensation when a photo of her went viral is now selling an NFT for thousands of dollars at auction. NFTs are unique digital tokens which are often attributed to art that has no physical representation. Chloe Clem, now 10, became famous in 2013 when her mother shared her unimpressed reaction to a surprise Disneyland trip online. The image has become a popular meme for expressing concern. An NFT provides a digital certificate of ownership for the piece, but bears no copyright. Therefore the winner of the auction will own the digital token representing the meme, but not the meme itself. EXPLAINER:What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? NFTs are usually bought in cryptocurrencies, so the transaction is recorded on a publicly available ledger called the blockchain. The digital artworks have come under fire recently due to environmental concerns, as vast amounts of energy are required to mine cryptocurrencies, process transactions and maintain the blockchain. In September 2013, Chloe's motherKatie uploaded a video,externalfeaturing her two daughters reacting to the Disneyland surprise. One of the girls, Lily, started crying, she said, ""but then the camera panned over and Chloe made her cute little buck-toothed side-eye face and the internet did the rest."" The video has been watched more than 20 million times, while the image of Chloe's reaction became an internet sensation. ""I opened up Tumblr and there were just pages and pages of Chloe's face,"" her mother told the BBC. ""It was very weird, very overwhelming. I had my family, friends sending me these memes - till this day they still send me the memes of Chloe they see on the internet."" Chloe Clem, now 10, and her mother Katie Within weeks,a Buzzfeed article had declared Chloe ""the patron saint of Tumblr"",externaland ""the queen and goddess of the internet"". Now the Utah family has decided to auction off the image as an NFT. Bids start at 5 Ethereum - a form of cryptocurrency worth roughly $15,000 (Â£11,000). Ms Clem said that after learning about the NFT market, selling the meme was a ""no brainer"". ""It's a cool opportunity, especially if there's a Chloe fan out there who loves this meme they'll be able to own it. Even Chloe has said 'that's pretty cool' - it's a typical 10-year-old thing to say."" The market for ownership rights to digital art has boomed recently after several multi-million-dollar NFT sales. In March, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey sold his first ever tweet for the equivalent of $2.9m to a Malaysia-based businessman. And in April, the woman featured in the so-called Disaster Girl meme sold it for $500,000. Weeks later, another image called the Overly Attached Girlfriend meme sold for $411,000. In August, however,a fan of British graffiti artist Banksy was tricked into buying a fake NFTby a hacker, off the artist's website. Luckily for him, the hacker returned most of what he paid - more than $336,000. The Disaster Girl meme, featuring ZoÃ« Roth won a photography prize in 2008 and went viral when it was posted online Ms Clem says she would like to use any money made from the sale to help pay for her daughters' education. ""Chloe is like, 'I'd like to buy a horse, I'd like to build a Walt Disney World,' but I'd just like to put her through college,"" she says. Chloe has amassed over 500,000 followers on Instagram, and has even featured in a Google advert in Brazil. ""We've been able to travel to Brazil and do all these amazing things,"" Ms Clem says. ""[But] at the end of the day I'm just a stay at home mom with my girls.""

"'Side-eying Chloe', 10, to sell viral memeThe image of Chloe Clem could fetch her tens of thousands of dollars at auction.US & Canada","Chloe Clem's disapproving look when she was two years old has become an internet sensation A young girl who became an internet sensation when a photo of her went viral is now selling an NFT for thousands of dollars at auction. NFTs are unique digital tokens which are often attributed to art that has no physical representation. Chloe Clem, now 10, became famous in 2013 when her mother shared her unimpressed reaction to a surprise Disneyland trip online. The image has become a popular meme for expressing concern. An NFT provides a digital certificate of ownership for the piece, but bears no copyright. Therefore the winner of the auction will own the digital token representing the meme, but not the meme itself. EXPLAINER:What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? NFTs are usually bought in cryptocurrencies, so the transaction is recorded on a publicly available ledger called the blockchain. The digital artworks have come under fire recently due to environmental concerns, as vast amounts of energy are required to mine cryptocurrencies, process transactions and maintain the blockchain. In September 2013, Chloe's motherKatie uploaded a video,externalfeaturing her two daughters reacting to the Disneyland surprise. One of the girls, Lily, started crying, she said, ""but then the camera panned over and Chloe made her cute little buck-toothed side-eye face and the internet did the rest."" The video has been watched more than 20 million times, while the image of Chloe's reaction became an internet sensation. ""I opened up Tumblr and there were just pages and pages of Chloe's face,"" her mother told the BBC. ""It was very weird, very overwhelming. I had my family, friends sending me these memes - till this day they still send me the memes of Chloe they see on the internet."" Chloe Clem, now 10, and her mother Katie Within weeks,a Buzzfeed article had declared Chloe ""the patron saint of Tumblr"",externaland ""the queen and goddess of the internet"". Now the Utah family has decided to auction off the image as an NFT. Bids start at 5 Ethereum - a form of cryptocurrency worth roughly $15,000 (Â£11,000). Ms Clem said that after learning about the NFT market, selling the meme was a ""no brainer"". ""It's a cool opportunity, especially if there's a Chloe fan out there who loves this meme they'll be able to own it. Even Chloe has said 'that's pretty cool' - it's a typical 10-year-old thing to say."" The market for ownership rights to digital art has boomed recently after several multi-million-dollar NFT sales. In March, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey sold his first ever tweet for the equivalent of $2.9m to a Malaysia-based businessman. And in April, the woman featured in the so-called Disaster Girl meme sold it for $500,000. Weeks later, another image called the Overly Attached Girlfriend meme sold for $411,000. In August, however,a fan of British graffiti artist Banksy was tricked into buying a fake NFTby a hacker, off the artist's website. Luckily for him, the hacker returned most of what he paid - more than $336,000. The Disaster Girl meme, featuring ZoÃ« Roth won a photography prize in 2008 and went viral when it was posted online Ms Clem says she would like to use any money made from the sale to help pay for her daughters' education. ""Chloe is like, 'I'd like to buy a horse, I'd like to build a Walt Disney World,' but I'd just like to put her through college,"" she says. Chloe has amassed over 500,000 followers on Instagram, and has even featured in a Google advert in Brazil. ""We've been able to travel to Brazil and do all these amazing things,"" Ms Clem says.

What must leaders agree on?,"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

Kuenssberg: Contrasting characters do business,"In the run up to this trip Boris Johnson and Joe Biden had already shared a big political and diplomatic moment - anew security pact with Australiato share nuclear submarine propulsion technology. The prime minister confessed to a huddle of hacks on the train from Washington back to New York that they also shared surprise at the level of French outrage when that emerged. In theirOval Office talksit is understood they spoke of their astonishment, and how the tension could be soothed, but neither saw them inviting France to join the pact as a solution. When asked if he understood why Emmanuel Macron might be hurt, the prime minister seemed to compare leaving France out of the pact to some kind of awkward break up saying, it was ""a very human thing to delay the frank conversation until the last possible moment. I don't know if anyone has been in that situation in their emotional life but it's very human to put it off"". That came on top ofMr Johnson resorting to Franglaisto tell the French to ""donnez moi un break"" - give me a break - and relax about the whole thing. The manner of his appeal makes that seem not quite so likely. Irrespective of the Gallic outrage, which some on the UK side suggested might perhaps be rather overblown to maximise the chances of compensation, for Downing Street the security deal and the president and the prime minister's talks on that subject are an important achievement. Along with the United States promise of billions extra to help developing countries go green, there are markers of a relationship in good health. Remember, on the way to the US Mr Johnson put the chances of achieving his goal of a cheque for $100bn to fight climate change by next month as just""six out of 10"". President Biden's announcement this week,was not something No 10 was sure would happen at this stage. It takes the UK a long way to meeting that that total, and officials hope the American vow will unlock other finance from other nations. Remember too how, so often on big foreign trips, a slight, or a stumble can send things into a terrible spin -Gordon Brown's attempt to see President Obama,externalwhich ended awkwardly in a kitchen andDonald Trump grasping Theresa May's hand. And of course, Mr Johnson himself is not exactly a stranger to a gaffe or a glitch. But as I write, shortly before he and the press pack fly back there hasn't been any major slips or surprises - at least not that we know about yet. The very obvious lack of progress on a big trade deal however is much less comfortable for Downing Street. It does matter that the trade pact Mr Johnson himself used to talk up so enthusiastically is nowhere to be seen. It's not a surprise that the Biden White House isn't keen but it became very plain this week that the chances are faint and far in the future. Additionally there's frustration among some senior Conservatives that suggestions were made that it would be easy to start with. ""I told colleagues ever since 2016 just how difficult a trade deal would be but of course they didn't want to listen,"" one of them said. President Biden obviously still places huge importance on how the UK seeks to resolve problems with the EU over Northern Ireland. But there's no doubt that No 10 regards these frantic few days as a success. When Mr Biden won the White House there were nerves in some quarters that the relationship could be awkward, and the differences profound. President Biden and Mr Johnson certainly are contrasting political characters. But this week has provided plenty of diplomatic evidence that they can do business when it counts.

There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?
