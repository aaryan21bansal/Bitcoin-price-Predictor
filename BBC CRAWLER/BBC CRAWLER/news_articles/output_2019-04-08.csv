Man pleads guilty to mosque bomb plot,"Steven Bishop changed his plea as his trial had been due to start A man has admitted planning a bomb attack on a south London mosque. Steven Bishop, 41, admitted buying fireworks and possessing instructions on how to make an explosive. Bishop, of Thornton Heath, was believed to have been targeting Morden Mosque when his home was raided by police on 29 October last year. He will be sentenced on Wednesday after changing his plea on the opening day of his trial at Kingston Crown Court. He had originally been charged with preparing an act of terrorism, but prosecutors accepted a plea to a charge of possession of an explosive substance with intent to endanger life or property on Monday. Bishop previously pleaded guilty to possession of information likely to be useful to a person preparing an act of terrorism, specifically a handwritten note on how to make explosives. When he was arrested he told the police he wanted revenge for the death of eight-year-old Saffie Roussos who died in the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017. The court heard Bishop has a history of mental health problems and a number of psychiatric reports had been prepared ahead of his trial.

Lloyd's calls time on drink and drugs,"For most workers, telling them they can't roll into the office stinking of alcohol or high on drugs is unnecessary - because it's taken as read. This week, though, the giant Lloyd's of London insurance market, in the City of London, is setting out a new code of conduct: it felt it needed to remind people. The 331-year-old institution, where brokers and insurers meet to do business, is regarded as the last bastion of the financial district's boozy culture. But after recent revelations of sexual harassment and general boorish behaviour, Lloyd's has decided to act. Two years ago the institution banned its staff from drinking between 9am and 5pm. But this only covered about 800 direct employees. Lloyd's is made up of thousands more people and independent operators. The organisation says there are about 40,000 pass holders who have access to the building. Now, anyone deemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs will be barred from the building. Security guards will have the right to confiscate passes of anyone breaching the new rule. The on-site bar will become a coffee shop. A hotline is being set up to expose bad behaviour. Anyone found responsible for sexual harassment risks being banned for life. But not everyone sees this as the answer. ""The problem has been exaggerated and the response is unnecessary,"" says a smoker loitering not too far from Lloyd's landmark building. Tom wouldn't give his surname, and wouldn't even confirm that he worked at Lloyd's. But he certainly knew about the recent reports of sexual misconduct and the new promise to act. ""You're telling people they can't have a couple of pints at lunchtime,"" he says. ""Lloyd's is a people business. We don't operate dangerous machinery."" And yet, that there was something rotten going on inside Lloyd's isn't in doubt. Last month,the Bloomberg news agency revealed a catalogue of sexual and verbal misconduct claims,external, with many fuelled by alcohol abuse. A picture was painted of an archaic institution whose culture was out-of-date, even by the standards of its neighbours in the financial district. Lloyd's boss John Neal, who took over six months ago, called the reports ""distressing"", adding: ""No one should be subjected to this sort of behaviour, and if it does happen, everyone has the right to be heard and for those responsible to be held to account."" The organisation knows that banning booze won't stop bad behaviour. It is, though, seen as an important signal in what Lloyd's says is a ""bigger action plan"" to improve the culture over time. Lloyd's vows action over sexual harassment Hurricanes behind insurer Lloyd's Â£1bn loss Lloyd's of London chief to step down Although some people might argue Lloyd's is over-reacting, in the City of London there are plenty of workers who agree that the organisation needs to modernise. In a square near the firm's headquarters, a group of young men are playing table tennis. Well-dressed, in regulation dark suits, they say they work in banking, not insurance. They point to their takeaway sandwiches as evidence. ""Lloyd's has a bit of a reputation for long lunches,"" says one. ""A lot of that disappeared years ago in other parts of the City."" Many objections seem to focus on a resentment at being told what to do. In a nearby pub, three men are drinking - one a large glass of wine and the other two have pints, but they're of orange juice and Coca-Cola. ""We're having a [computer] screen break - but we are discussing business. We're adults. If we drink responsibly, why should our employer lay down the law on what we do?"" There's a divide between generations too they point out: younger professionals avoid alcohol so they can go to the gym after work, or simply because they lead healthier lifestyles. At another local pub the assistant manager agrees habits have changed in the 15 years she's worked in the trade. ""I see far more men drinking soft drinks, not just at lunchtimes but after work,"" she says. There is still a hardcore, though, who drink. Her pub - she didn't want it identified - actually opens at 7am. ""There will be people - regulars - waiting outside at opening time to come in for a drink,"" she says. Having a drink after work, perhaps? No, she says. There's a man who has a couple of pints of lager, and a woman who downs a couple of vodkas (not so easy to smell on her breath, apparently) before work. ""It's more common than you might think."" These people may be functioning alcoholics, whose behaviour may not be affected by a booze ban at work. But it's not just drink, she says. ""I've seen more responsible drinking over the years, but a rise in drugs. If you don't take cocaine, people these days seem to think there's something wrong with you."" What does she think of the Lloyd's security guards who will be on the frontline of trying to impose a no drink or drugs policy? It could be a challenge. ""It's not always easy to spot, and it's not always easy to deal with when you do spot it.""

Victoria writer rues Line of Duty battle,"Daisy Goodwin said Victoria was ""nothing more than a line of sandbags"" against Line of Duty The writer of ITV's Victoria has said it's ""demoralising"" to go up against Line of Duty in the TV schedules. The dramas have gone head-to-head at 21:00 on Sunday for two weeks, but the BBC show has come out on top so far. Scheduling is a ""dark art"" practised by ""Machiavellian types"", Daisy Goodwin wrote in Radio Times magazine. Victoria's third season premiered in the US before its recent UK debut, and Goodwin said she hoped the fourth would go out simultaneously around the world. She told Radio Times the staggered release felt ""analogue"", urging broadcasters to echo streaming services with ""a truly global shared experience"". Her show, which traces the life of Queen Victoria, haslost out in the overnight ratings to Line of Dutysince the fifth series of the BBC police drama began on 31 March. Adrian Dunbar, Martin Compston and Vicky McClure all returned for the new series of Line of Duty The opening episode of Line of Duty pulled in an average of 7.8 million viewers, compared with 3.1 million for Victoria. On 7 April, Line of Duty dropped slightly to 7.1 million, but was still significantly ahead of Victoria's 3.0 million audience. Goodwin said: ""It's a dark art, scheduling, and it can be very demoralising for people who have dedicated themselves to making something special to realise that for the scheduler your carefully-honed drama is nothing more than a line of sandbags against Bodyguard 2 or, in Victoria's case, Line of Duty."" Goodwin's comments come as the divide between traditional and digital release schedules has come under the spotlight in recent weeks. The second series of BBC hit Killing Eve has already begun in the US on BBC America - a subscription television network jointly owned by BBC Studios and AMC -but a date for the UK premiere is yet to be announced. This contrasts with release strategies in which entire series are released in full around the world on streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. Jenna Coleman plays Queen Victoria Goodwin said that while she understood that ""die-hard"" fans of her ITV show may have already streamed the complete series online in the UK ""in ways that are quite possibly illegal"", she hoped many would still watch in the ""old-fashioned way"". ""In these days of the box-set binge, where you can emerge bleary-eyed, wondering where the last six hours went, I rather love a dainty morsel of television that leaves you wanting more,"" she said. Goodwin also revealed that the next series of Victoria - starring Jenna Coleman - is already in production and will be ""the darkest yet"". The writer said she hopes ""the gods of scheduling look favourably upon it and decide to put it out simultaneously with the US broadcast"".

TV channel run by prisoners praised,"Prisoners have been learning new skills by working on Inside TV A prison TV channel run by inmates that has featured a drama showing the impact of crime on victims has been praised by inspectors. Inside TV, which is led by prisoners at HMP Lowdham Grange in Nottinghamshire, aims to give new skills to criminals and steer them away from reoffending. Other programmes have included a cookery show, games reviews and items on drugs and Islamist extremism. Aninspection in January,externaldescribed the channel as ""a well-resourced facility"". Inside TV was praised by inspectors In January HMP Lowdham Grange - a category B prison run by private company Serco that can hold up to 920 inmates - was criticised by inspectors after it found the use of force by officers had doubled since 2015. However, inspectors praised a photo booth allowing inmates to take pictures with family members during visits. Inmates can watch Inside TV from their cells As well as providing programming for prisoners, staff can use the channel to issue newsflash alerts if the prison enters lockdown. Prison director Mark Hanson said the channel ""helps us to be able to communicate effectively with the prison population"" and gives inmates the chance to learn practical skills that benefit them once they leave prison. Prison director Mark Hanson said the jail's job was to rehabilitate prisoners so they stopped committing crimes ""The get valuable communication skills and they actually get a qualification,"" he said. ""Our job is to rehabilitate [prisoners], and part of that rehabilitation journey has got to be about giving them skills, giving them hope and aspirations so that when they're released from prison they're less likely to commit a crime.""

'Lost' Beatles TV performance unearthed,"This video can not be played Part of a performance by The Beatles on Top of the Pops in 1966 (This video has no sound) An 11-second clip of the Beatles' only live appearance on Top of the Pops, which was thought to have been be lost, has been unearthed in Mexico. The silent snippet is all that exists of the Fab Four miming to Paperback Writer on the BBC pop show in 1966. The original tapes were not kept, but it was recorded by a viewer filming their TV set with an 8mm camera. The footage was shot by a family in Liverpool and eventually fell into the hands of a collector in Mexico. The collector contacted Kaleidoscope, a Birmingham-based organisation specialising in locating previously missing TV footage. ""I think if you're a Beatles fans, it's the holy grail,"" Kaleidoscope's Chris Perry told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson. ""People thought it was gone forever because videotape wasn't kept in 1966. To find it all these years later was stunning."" The Beatles in the Top of the Pops studio in 1966 The band pre-recorded songs for Top of the Pops on several occasions, but only appeared live once, on 16 June 1966. The performance itself has long-been a talking point for Beatles obsessives. In 2000,a BBC spokeswoman said,external: ""We don't know whether or not this particular piece of Top of the Pops history has disappeared forever, but unfortunately there was a time when BBC programmes were not archived as carefully as they are today and some programmes were sadly lost."" The rediscovered clip will be screened at the BFI in London as part of the Music Believed Wiped programme on 20 April. Lennon's rare Beatles record to be sold Speaking about the discovery, Dr Dori Howard, a lecturer in The Beatles and Popular Music at Liverpool Hope University, said: ""It's crazy, what are the chances? I would say it's a really big find."" A missing episode of Top of the Pops from 1969, featuring an early cut of The Beatles' promotional video for their single Something, has also been discovered. The Beatles famously never toured again after playing live at their last ever gig at San Francisco's Candlestick Park in 1966, at the height of Beatlemania. They reunited for a one-off performance on the rooftop of Apple Records in London in 1969. The Music Believed Wiped screening will include highlights of 240 musical performances that have recently been found by Kaleidoscope. They include Elton John singing Rocket Man on Top of the Pops in 1972, T Rex's fourth and final UK number one Metal Guru, and a pieced-together Slade performance from 1975.

Huffman to plead guilty in college scandal,"Felicity Huffman said she was ""ashamed"" of the pain she had caused US actress Felicity Huffman has said she will plead guilty to charges in a cheating scam aimed at acquiring places for children at elite US universities. The Desperate Housewives star said she had ""betrayed"" her daughter and was ""ashamed"" of the pain she had caused. Ms Huffman is accused of paying $15,000 (Â£11,500) to have her daughter's exam answers covertly corrected in 2017. The 56-year-old is one of 14 people set to plead guilty among the 50 charged, who include college athletic coaches. As part of her plea deal, prosecutors are recommending a prison term of four to 10 months. She has also agreed to pay a $20,000 fine. Ex-Yale coach pleads guilty in college scam Celebrity parents and the bizarre 'cheating' scandal The extreme lengths parents go to for college admissions In a statement, she said: ""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions. ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. ""I want to apologise to them and, especially, I want to apologise to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly."" She added in the statement that her daughter had known nothing about her actions: ""In my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her. This transgression toward her and the public, I will carry for the rest of my life."" This video can not be played How US university admissions are broken The FBI code-named the investigation ""Operation Varsity Blues"" - ironically named after a 1990s film about the pressures of sports scholarships. The case relates to the period between 2011 and 2018, when investigators say parents tried to cheat the usual US admission process. They say parents paid bribes, had exams altered and even had their children edited on to stock photos to pretend they played sports. Ms Huffman and another Hollywood actress, Lori Loughlin, are the most high-profile figures indicted, but others charged include prominent business executives. Ms Loughlin is accused along with her husband of paying nearly $500,000 in bribes to get their two daughters admitted to the University of Southern California. They are not among those who have agreed to plead guilty and have not publicly addressed the allegations, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reports. Investigators say they helped them get in on rowing scholarships, even though neither student had actually participated in the sport. Spotlight on Loughlin's daughters after college probe Students react to college cheating scam Ms Huffman was accused of paying $15,000 to William ""Rick"" Singer - the confessed mastermind of the alleged scam - to have her daughter's exam answers covertly corrected in 2017.

UN condemns strike on Tripoli airport,"This video can not be played No casualties were reported in the air strike The UN has condemned an air strike that closed the only functioning airport in Libya's capital, Tripoli, on Monday. Flights at Mitiga International Airport were suspended and passengers were evacuated. No casualties were reported. The UN blamed the air strike on forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar, a commander from the east who is trying to seize the capital. A spokesman for Gen Haftar's forces said civilian planes had not been targeted, Reuters news agency reports. Gen Haftar, who leads the Libyan National Army (LNA), declared an offensive to take control of Tripoli from Libya's UN-backed government last week. Why is Libya so lawless? Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj has accused him of attempting to carry out a coup. At least 2,800 people have so far fled fighting around Tripoli, the UN says. The UN also warns that those who remain risk being cut off from vital services because of the clashes. A crew member and passenger seen outside the international airport Libya has been torn by violence, political instability and power struggles since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. International powers have started evacuating personnel from the country in recent days as the situation has deteriorated. The UN's Libya envoy, Ghassan Salame, said Monday's  air strike violated humanitarian law which prohibited attacks against civilian infrastructure. Mr Salame said the bombing marked an ""escalation of violence on the ground"". LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari was quoted by Reuters as saying ""only a MiG [aircraft] parked at Mitiga airport"" had been targeted. The airport is also the base for a powerful militia, loosely under the control of the government's ministry of interior, says the BBC's North Africa correspondent, Rana Jawad. An older, inactive airport, Tripoli International, has also been a focal point for clashes recent days. The Libyan health ministry said at least 25 people had been killed and 80 wounded so far, including civilians and government fighters. Gen Haftar's forces said they had lost at least 19 fighters. The UN appealed for a two-hour truce on Sunday to allow for the evacuations of casualties and civilians, but fighting continued. Libya has been a hotbed of unrest since Gaddafi was overthrown eight years ago. The Government of National Accord (GNA) was created from peace talks in 2015, but has struggled to take control despite UN backing. Gen Haftar is allied to a rival government in the eastern city of Tobruk which has refused to cede power to Tripoli. Gen Haftar has ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli The general helped Gaddafi seize power in 1969 before falling out with him and going into exile in the US. He then returned when the uprising against Gaddafi began and became a rebel commander. His LNA troops have continued to make advances, seizing the south of Libya and its oil fields earlier this year. UN-backed talks between the rival governments had been scheduled for 14-16 April to discuss a roadmap for new elections, but it is now unclear if these will still take place. Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj said he had offered concessions to Gen Haftar to avoid bloodshed, only to be ""stabbed in the back"". Much of the international community, including the US, have called for a ceasefire to hostilities. ""This unilateral military campaign against Tripoli is endangering civilians and undermining prospects for a better future for all Libyans,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday. The US military is among those to withdraw its supporting forces based in the country,external, blaming the ""complex and unpredictable"" situation and ""increased unrest"" on the ground. The UN is also due to pull out non-essential staff. A market in Tripoli. Residents are said to be stocking up on supplies Residents of Tripoli have reportedly begun stocking up on food and fuel. The BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says some residents fear a long operation such as that which Gen Haftar mounted to take the eastern city of Benghazi from Islamist fighters in 2017. Analysis by Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent, in Tunis The rogue general's defiance suggests that, despite international condemnation of his recent moves, he believes he can only secure a place in Libya's future political makeup through military means. Diplomats are worried because the manner and timing of the attack mean he is unlikely to back down unless he is defeated. Few thought he would go ahead and launch this operation - which he has long threatened to do - because they believed ongoing talks that saw him go from Paris to Palermo and the UAE for more than a year would buy time until a new political settlement was reached through negotiations and an eventual electoral process. Today, Western nations have few cards to play to de-escalate the violence and once again find themselves in a position where they may need to start from scratch.

Novichok victim 'wants to meet Putin',"Charlie Rowley said he cannot see the Russian president ""taking the blame"" A man who was exposed to Novichok wants to meet Vladimir Putin in order to ""get to the bottom"" of the poisonings. Charlie Rowley, 45, said Russia's ambassador has agreed to try to arrange a meeting with the country's president. Mr Rowley's partner Dawn Sturgess died after being exposed to the nerve agent used to attack former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. He said previously that he""didn't really get any answers""when he met the Russian ambassador. Mr Rowley told BBC Wiltshire he wanted to meet the Russian president to ""get to the bottom of things"". He said: ""That would be great, yeah, I'd like to see him, get some face-to-face and ask him on a one-to-one basis, just sort of tick it off the list, say I've done it."" The Skripals were exposed to the nerve agent in in March last year. Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess, 44, fell ill in Amesbury months later after coming into contact with a perfume bottle believed to have been used in the poisonings and then discarded. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. Charlie Rowley was exposed to the same poison used to attack Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia Asked if the question of meeting Mr Putin had arisen during his meeting with the ambassador, Mr Rowley said: ""It did. He did say he's going to try and push forward, try and get some results, get back in contact with my brother."" His brother Matthew added: ""He couldn't say yes or no, but said if he was to say yes, where would you like to meet. ""I said on our behalf it would be better on his own home turf, in Russia, and he said he would try and organise it for us."" Mr Rowley also said that an apology ""would be great"" but that he could not see Mr Putin ""taking the blame"". In September, Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service said there was sufficient evidence to charge two Russians - known as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - with offences including conspiracy to murder.

Actress to plead guilty in college scandal,"Felicity Huffman said she was ""ashamed"" of the pain she had caused US actress Felicity Huffman has said she will plead guilty to charges in a cheating scam aimed at acquiring places for children at elite US universities. The Desperate Housewives star said she had ""betrayed"" her daughter and was ""ashamed"" of the pain she had caused. Ms Huffman is accused of paying $15,000 (Â£11,500) to have her daughter's exam answers covertly corrected in 2017. The 56-year-old is one of 14 people set to plead guilty among the 50 charged, who include college athletic coaches. As part of her plea deal, prosecutors are recommending a prison term of four to 10 months. She has also agreed to pay a $20,000 fine.

British Gas boss gets 44% pay rise,"The chief executive of the company which owns British Gas received a 44% rise in his pay last year to Â£2.4m. It means Iain Conn, who runs Centrica, is paid 72 times that of an employee in the lower quartile of its salary range - a smart energy expert paid Â£33,718. The pay deal comes in what the company described as ""challenging year"" andafter it warned profits this year would be hit by the energy price cap. The energyprice cap rose to Â£1,254 at the start of April. Mr Conn's pay rose from Â£1.7m in 2017 because he did not receive a bonus that year, while in 2016 he received Â£4m. In the annual report, Centrica said Mr Conn had been ""reshaping"" the company against ""the challenge of a constantly shifting operating environment"". ""Iain has shown significant resilience in the face of this challenge and has led the business through the shifting context, keeping the strategic objectives in sight and ensuring that the organisation remains adaptable and innovative"". The company's shares fell to near 20-year lows after the warning in February that profits would be knocked by Ofgem's price cap, amid fears it would cut its dividend. A year ago, Mr Connannounced 4,000 job cuts, while British Gas has lost 742,000 energy supply accounts, as it rarely appears among the cheapest deals on price comparison websites when customers look to switch suppliers. Energy prices to increase for millions as Ofgem raises cap Centrica says 2019 profit to be hit by energy price cap The company said it was reducing the pension contributions of senior managers - which are subject to scrutiny by fund managers - to 15% from 1 June, It said this represented a reduction of between a half and a quarter in the pension benefit for affected executives and ""represents appropriate alignment with the wider workforce"". The company also measured Mr Conn's pay alongside that of an employee in the median salary range - Â£41,239 - which gave a ratio of 59:1, and in the upper band, a technical engineer receiving Â£55,107 - which was 44:1. Last month,energy company Shellsaid its chief executive Ben van Beurden's pay was 143 times larger than that of the average Shell employee in the UK.

Johnson rebuked over income rule breach,"Boris Johnson breached Commons rules by not declaring a financial interest in time, a committee of MPs has found. The Committee on Standards said the former foreign secretary had failed to register a share of a Somerset property within 28 days of acquiring it. The committee accepted he had not intended to conceal his interest and had apologised. But it added the Conservative MP had shown an ""an over-casual attitude"" to parliamentary rules. The reprimand follows a similar finding in December, when Mr Johnson was ordered to apologise over thelate declarationof Â£52,000 in book royalty payments. In its latest report, the committee said the failure to declare the property interest in time revealed a ""pattern of behaviour"" regarding respect for rules on declarations. It added that Mr Johnson had given an assurance as part of the previous investigation that his interests declaration was up to date, but this ""proved not to be the case"". Itrecommended,externalMr Johnson, MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, should receive a briefing from the Registrar of Members' Financial Interests on his obligations. It added a further breach might lead to a ""more serious sanction"". Boris Johnson under fire over clearance for newspaper column According to the committee's report, Mr Johnson acquired his share in the property in January 2018 but only registered it a year later. He told the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards he had not thought it necessary to register it, as he had initially misinterpreted the rules relating to the threshold above which an interest has to be declared. The commissioner, Kathryn Stone, said she accepted this explanation but that Mr Johnson ""should have checked more carefully what was required of him"". ""That does not demonstrate the leadership which one would expect of a long-standing and senior member of the House,"" she added. In a letter to the commissioner, Mr Johnson said he accepted ""full responsibility for the error"". But he added: ""Having now carefully reviewed the rules again... I do feel that they could be clarified so as to reduce the possibility of confusion."" The committee rejected this, concluding the issue was not the rules themselves, but Mr Johnson's failure to consult the accompanying guide for MPs. His brother Jo, a former minister and current Conservative MP for Orpington, has also been found to have made a late declaration for his share in the property. He apologised to the commissioner in February, afteradmitting the fault,externaland saying he had found the rules on declarations ""ambiguous"". He had been allowed to correct his financial interests register by way of a Commons procedure intended to rectify minor breaches. The commissioner concluded that Boris Johnson should not be afforded the same opportunity, because he had failed to check his entry properly during the previous probe into his book royalties. This showed an ""additional lack of care and attention to the rules which apply"", she found.

Campaign to 'debunk silent 999 call myth'Police watchdog says it is 'not true' that a silent 999 call will automatically bring police help.UK,"Miss Power's family described her as ""happy, fun-loving and considerate... the consummate mum"". A campaign has been launched to raise awareness of how to call 999 when you are too frightened to speak out loud. The Independent Office for Police Conduct watchdog warns it is ""not true"" that a silent 999 call alone will automatically bring help. Around 5,000 of the 20,000 silent 999 calls made daily are put through to an automated system. Callers are then led through a series of prompts and asked to press 55 to confirm there is a genuine emergency. The system has been in operation since 2002 but police say many callers don't understand, or use it correctly. The system, called Silent Solution,external, filters out thousands of accidental or hoax silent 999 calls made daily - but it also could lead to genuine calls being terminated if the callers do not respond to the prompts. The Independent Office for Police Conduct's campaign is being supported by the family of Kerry Power, 36, who was killed by her ex-partner in Plymouth, in December 2013. She had made a silent 999 call but did not respond to the BT operator and so was transferred to Silent Solution. As 55 was not pressed, the call was terminated and Devon and Cornwall Police were not notified of Kerry's call. The IOPC is launching a poster campaign, backed by ahow-to guide,external, aimed at ""debunking the myth"" that a silent 999 call alone will automatically bring help. Silent 999 call 'myth must be debunked' Behind the scenes of your 999 calls When are silent 999 calls cut off?,external Regional director Catrin Evans said: ""It is always best to actually speak to a police call handler if you can, even if by whispering, but if you are putting yourself or someone else in danger by making a sound, there is something you can do. ""Make yourself heard by coughing, tapping the handset or - once prompted by the automated system - by pressing 55."" Miss Power's family said in a statement: ""Although she was not able to speak for the fear of alerting the intruder to her actions, she followed the advice given by a police officer during an earlier visit."" However, the family said she had not been told to press 55. ""A short while after the call, she was strangled,"" their statement added. David Wilder, 44 at the time, was jailed for life over her death. However, the subsequentinvestigation into the police responsefound Miss Power might have been wrongly advised by a police officer about when assistance would be sent. Ms Evans said the inquiry identified a ""lack of public awareness"" about the method of alerting police that ""could potentially save a life"". The Make Yourself Heard campaign is being backed by the charities Women's Aid and Welsh Women's Aid, and the National Police Chiefs' Council. Lucy Hadley, from Women's Aid, said: ""We need to look at all ways we can raise awareness and make the system work better for the people it's designed for, which are people in extreme distress and fear, and might not necessarily remember everything... on a poster or advertising campaign.""

US labels Iran Guards force as terrorist,"The US has sanctioned parts of the IRGC before US President Donald Trump has designated Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organisation. It is the first time the US has labelled another nation's military as a terrorist organisation. Iran retaliated by declaring US forces in the Middle East as a terrorist organisation, Iran state news reported. Washington-Tehran tensions have risen since Mr Trump withdrew the US from the international Iran nuclear pact. Labelling the Guards as a terrorist organisation will allow the US to impose further sanctions - particularly affecting the business sector, given the IRGC's involvement in Iran's economy. A number of IRGC and affiliated entities have already been targeted by US sanctions for alleged proliferation activities, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Mr Trump's statement on Monday said: ""This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognises the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft."" This video can not be played Pompeo announces the ""historic step"" against Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corp The president added that the move was meant to ""significantly expand the scope and scale"" of pressure on Iran. ""If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism,"" Mr Trump said. The measure will take effect in one week's time, according to the State Department. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, both Iran hawks, championed the decision, but not all US officials were so supportive. Mr Pompeo told reporters on Monday the US will continue to sanction and pressure Iran to ""behave like a normal nation"" and urged America's allies to take similar action. ""The leaders of Iran are not revolutionaries and people deserve better,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""They are opportunists."" In a later tweet, he added: ""We must help the people of Iran get back their freedom."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But some Pentagon officials, including Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen Joe Dunford, had expressed concerns about troop safety,the Wall Street Journal reported,external. Military officials cautioned the designation could incite violence against US forces in the Middle East without severely impacting Iran's economy. The Central Intelligence Agency had also reportedly opposed the move. Iran's national security council declared US Central Command (Centcom) a terrorist organisation after Foreign Minister Javad Zarif wrote to President Hassan Rouhani urging such a response, state news channel IRINN said. Centcom is the Pentagon wing that oversees Washington's security interests across the central area of the world map, most notably Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Syria. The Islamic Republic had warned it would retaliate in kind last week, after reports of the Trump administration plan first surfaced. ""We will answer any action taken against this force with a reciprocal action,"" a statement issued by 255 out of the 290 Iranian MPs said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is battling for political survival in Tuesday's elections, cheered the US move. Allow Twitter content?

This move underscores the Trump administration's desire to isolate and stigmatise Iran, though it is unlikely to have a significant impact upon the Revolutionary Guard Corps' activities. Few Western commentators would disagree that the IRGC is responsible for all sorts of disruptive activities in the region and beyond. But many - including it seems some officials in the US Department of State and the Pentagon  - fear that this step could simply backfire. The fear is that it could encourage the IRGC or its proxies to take action against US personnel or other targets in places where they might be vulnerable, for example in Iraq. What this move does do is signal the unremitting desire of the Trump Administration to ramp up its battle with Tehran which some fear may, one day, spill into open military conflict. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani (left) seen at the 21st Nationwide Assembly of the IRGC in 2015 Iran's most elite military unit, the IRGC was set up shortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution to defend the country's Islamic system, and to provide a counterweight to the regular armed forces. It has since become a major military, political and economic force in Iran, with close ties to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and many other senior figures hailing from its ranks. The IRGC is estimated to have more than 150,000 active personnel, boasts its own ground forces, navy and air force, and oversees Iran's strategic weapons, including its ballistic missiles. The IRGC exerts influence elsewhere in the Middle East by providing money, weapons, technology, training and advice to allied governments and armed groups through its shadowy overseas operations arm, the Quds (Jerusalem) Force.

Italy stops UK tourist with Pompeii mosaic tiles,"Many of Pompeii's ruins have floor mosaics (file pic) Italian police have detained a British woman suspected of removing some small Roman tiles from a mosaic at Pompeii. Italian media say she was spotted cutting tiles - called tesserae - from a floor mosaic inthe world-famous site's House of the Anchor,external. She was with her father and sister at the time. The damage was estimated at â¬3,000 (Â£2,600) by the site's manager. Nearby Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, killing many Pompeii residents and entombing a thriving city. The 20-year-old woman had crossed a guard rail around the mosaic, police said. Last year police arrested two French tourists found stealing pieces of marble and earthenware at Pompeii, Italy's Il Giornale daily reports. And in 2016 an American took a piece of marble off the floor of the House of the Small Fountain, the paper said.

Precise brain stimulation boosts memory,"Using electricity to precisely stimulate the brain can boost people's working memory, a study suggests. The team at Boston University, in the US, gave people in their sixties and seventies the working memory of someone in their twenties. The effect lasted at least 50 minutes after the stimulation stopped. But larger studies are now needed to see if stimulation could help people in the ""real world"" or in treating brain diseases like Alzheimer's. Working memory is where your mind keeps temporary information, and has been described as the ""sketch pad of the mind"". You need your working memory to write down a phone number as someone reads it out to you. Problem-solving, mathematical calculations and decision-making all involve working memory too. Robert Reinhart, an assistant professor at Boston University, and one of the researchers, says: ""It's essentially where consciousness lives."" Working memory is different to long-term memory, which is how you recall your first day at school, wedding day, childhood pet etc. But working memory declines naturally with age. The research tried to coordinate people's brainwaves. The study,published in Nature Neuroscience,external, took 42 people in their twenties, and 42 in their sixties or seventies. They played a glorified game of spot-the-difference between two images shown one after the other. The young adults were faster and more accurate without any brain stimulation. But the older adults' performance improved with brain stimulation. Dr Reinhart said: ""We can bring back the more superior working memory function that you had when you were much younger. ""This is important because the global population is rapidly ageing, and the elderly struggle with many real-world activities that critically rely on their memories."" These included ""recognizing human faces, navigating the physical environment, remembering to take their medication and making financial decisions"", he said. Warning over electrical brain stimulation The researchers were focused on brainwaves in two regions of the brain involved in working memory - the temporal and prefrontal brain regions. ""The brain is like a conductor of an orchestra, and it's using low frequency rhythms [brainwaves] to communicate information,"" says Dr Reinhart. But the study showed that brainwaves become out of sync - like musicians giving a disjointed performance - as we age. The team at Boston University started by recording people's brainwaves with an electroencephalogram. They used electricity stimulation - specifically high definition transcranial alternating current - to strengthen and resynchronise the brainwaves. Travel sickness study: Brain zaps 'may ease symptoms' The researchers and other scientists want to see the experiments repeated with larger groups of people in order to be certain of the results. The other issue is whether the kind of boost reported in this study would make a meaningful difference in people's day-to-day lives. And it is uncertain how long any benefit lasts, as the study only tested people for up to 50 minutes. To be useful in real life would need either a long-term benefit or a way of making the technology portable. The researchers hope brain stimulation will eventually be used for a range of neurological disorders. The research was conducted only in healthy people, so it is impossible to draw conclusions about diseases like Alzheimer's. The researchers hope that one day brain stimulation will find a role in a range of brain disorders from dementia to autism and ADHD to epilepsy. The Alzheimer's Society welcomed the report: ""Altering and correcting the circuitry of the brain with technology is a new exciting avenue of research for dementia."" The technology has only been tested for restoring lost ability, but could the same approach be used for enhancement? Dr Reinhart says: ""I think it is possible to sort of turbocharge even normal, healthy, cognitive functioning people, including young people. ""But the largest improvements appear in the people with the greatest deficit at baseline... people who are struggling the most."" Thinking caps and superbrains Dorothy Bishop, a professor of developmental neuropsychology from the University of Oxford, says: ""It would be premature to extrapolate the findings to everyday functioning in individuals with clinically significant memory problems. ""There is no indication that any beneficial effects of stimulation persist beyond the experimental session. ""Considerably more research would need to be done before concluding that this method had clinical application.""

UK plans social media and internet watchdog,"Internet sites could be fined or blocked if they fail to tackle ""online harms"" such as terrorist propaganda and child abuse, under government plans. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has proposed an independent watchdog that will write a ""code of practice"" for tech companies. Senior managers could be held liable for breaches, with a possible levy on the industry to fund the regulator. But critics say the plans threaten freedom of speech. TheOnline Harms White Paper,externalis a joint proposal from the DCMS and the Home Office. Apublic consultation,externalon the plans will run for 12 weeks. The paper suggests: establishing an independent regulator that can write a ""code of practice"" for social networks and internet companies giving the regulator enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules considering additional enforcement powers such as the ability to fine company executives and force internet service providers to block sites that break the rules Outlining the proposals, Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said: ""The era of self-regulation for online companies is over. ""Voluntary actions from industry to tackle online harms have not been applied consistently or gone far enough."" Discussing potential penalties on BBC Breakfast, he said: ""If you look at the fines available to the Information Commissioner around the GDPR rules, that could be up to 4% of company's turnover... we think we should be looking at something comparable here."" The plans cover a range of issues that are clearly defined in law such as spreading terrorist content, child sex abuse, so-called revenge pornography, hate crimes, harassment and the sale of illegal goods. But it also covers harmful behaviour that has a less clear legal definition such as cyber-bullying, trolling and the spread of fake news and disinformation. It says social networks must tackle material that advocates self-harm and suicide, which became a prominent issue after 14-year-old Molly Russell took her own life in 2017. After she died her family found distressing material about depression and suicide on her Instagram account. Molly's father Ian Russell holds the social media giant partly responsible for her death. Mr Russell told the BBC that the white paper was ""a very important step"" towards making the internet a safer place. ""I think after what we've been through and sadly what so many families go through, the urgency is huge,"" he said. However he added that the paper could have contained more specific guidance for parents. ""For example, there's not very much about age limits and ratings - it seems to me lots of companies self-rate their apps and their content and that makes it very difficult for a parent to know how much they can trust those platforms,"" he said. This video can not be played Ian Russell partly blames Instagram for his daughter taking her own life and says ""the urgency is huge"" to protect children online Home Secretary Sajid Javid said tech giants and social media companies had a moral duty ""to protect the young people they profit from"". ""Despite our repeated calls to action, harmful and illegal content - including child abuse and terrorism - is still too readily available online. The plans call for an independent regulator to hold internet companies to account. It would be funded by the tech industry. The government has not decided whether a new body will be established, or an existing one handed new powers. The regulator will define a ""code of best practice"" that social networks and internet companies must adhere to. CBBC's tips for staying safe online How can I keep my children safe online? Storyville: The Internet's Dirtiest Secrets What do other governments do about social media? As well as Facebook, Twitter and Google, the rules would apply to messaging services such as Snapchat and cloud storage services. The regulator will have the power to fine companies and publish notices naming and shaming those that break the rules. The government says it is also considering fines for individual company executives and making search engines remove links to offending websites. It is also consulting over blocking harmful websites. On the face of it, this is a tough new regime - and ministers have acted upon the demands of charities like the NSPCC which want what they regard as the ""Wild West Web"" to be tamed. But a closer look reveals all sorts of issues yet to be settled. Will a whole new organisation be given the huge job of regulating the internet? Or will the job be handed to the media regulator Ofcom? What sort of sanctions will be available to the regulator? And will they apply equally to giant social networks and to small organisations such as parents' message boards? Most tricky of all is how the regulator is going to rule on material that is not illegal but may still be considered harmful. Take this example. Misinformation is listed as a potential harm, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock has talked about the damaging effects anti-vaccination campaigners have had. So will the regulator tell companies that their duty of care means they must remove such material? The government now plans to consult on its proposals. It may yet find that its twin aims of making the UK both the safest place in the world online and the best to start a digital business are mutually incompatible. The white paper offers some suggestions that could be included in the code of best practice. It suggests the spread of fake news could be tackled by forcing social networks to employ fact-checkers and promote legitimate news sources. But the regulator will be allowed to define the code by itself. The white paper also says social media companies should produce annual reports revealing how much harmful content has been found on their platforms. The children's charity NSPCC has been urging new regulation since 2017 and has repeatedly called for a legal duty of care to be placed on social networks. A spokeswoman said: ""Time's up for the social networks. They've failed to police themselves and our children have paid the price."" Rebecca Stimson,Facebook's head of UK policy, said in a statement: ""New regulations are needed so that we have a standardised approach across platforms and private companies aren't making so many important decisions alone. ""New rules for the internet should protect society from harm while also supporting innovation, the digital economy and freedom of speech."" Twitter's head of UK public policy Katy Minshall said in a statement: ""We look forward to engaging in the next steps of the process, and working to strike an appropriate balance between keeping users safe and preserving the open, free nature of the internet."" TechUK, an umbrella group representing the UK's technology industry, said the government must be ""clear about how trade-offs are balanced between harm prevention and fundamental rights"". Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, said the government's proposals would ""create state regulation of the speech of millions of British citizens"". Matthew Lesh, head of research at free market think tank the Adam Smith Institute, went further. He said: ""The government should be ashamed of themselves for leading the western world in internet censorship. ""The proposals are a historic attack on freedom of speech and the free press. ""At a time when Britain is criticising violations of freedom of expression in states like Iran, China and Russia, we should not be undermining our freedom at home."" And freedom of speech campaigners Article 19 warned that the government ""must not create an environment that encourages the censorship of legitimate expression"". A spokesman said it opposed any duty of care being imposed on internet platforms. They said that would ""inevitably require them to proactively monitor their networks and take a restrictive approach to content removal"". ""Such actions could violate individuals' rights to freedom of expression and privacy,"" they added.

Cross-party Brexit talks to continue,"Ministers and their shadow counterparts will continue cross-party talks on Tuesday, Downing Street has said, as they try to break the Brexit deadlock. ""Technical"" discussions among officials took place on Monday evening. Sources indicated the PM had not accepted Labour's customs union demand, but there was a move towards changing the non-binding political declaration. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there had been no change in the government's ""red lines"". A Downing Street spokesman said the government was ""committed to finding a way through"" which requires both sides ""to work at a pace"". The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday. So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Theresa May reached with other European leaders last year. Kuenssberg: Significant hurdles for cross-party talks Brexit explained in flowcharts A really simple guide to Brexit Brexit Basics: The customs union She is due to attend an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday, where EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans aimed at ending the impasse in Parliament. Ahead of this, Mrs May will hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin and Paris on Tuesday. On Monday evening, Parliament passed a bill brought by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which aims to force the prime minister to request a Brexit extension rather than leave the EU without a deal. However, the final decision on an extension lies with the EU. The bill received Royal Assent from the Queen on Monday night and has become law. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom told MPs that if this happens on Monday evening, there will be a government motion on Tuesday asking the House to approve the PM's request to the EU to delay Brexit until 30 June. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button During the cross-party Downing Street talks, the government reportedly suggested offering Labour a guarantee that any deal they reached could not be undone, creating a ""lock"". This would aim to ease Labour concerns that any promises could be unpicked by the next Conservative leader. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was ""deep concern"" on the Labour side that any legal promise could be undone by further legislation. However, the prime minister was warned by members of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers that agreeing a customs union with the EU in Brexit talks would be ""unacceptable"". The MPs met Mrs May in Downing Street and it is understood they were more open to the idea of a customs arrangement, which would allow the UK to do its own trade deals. Talks between Labour and the government began last week, with Mrs May saying only a cross-party pact would see MPs agree a deal in Parliament. This video can not be played Corbyn: No change in government's Brexit 'red lines' If no compromise can be reached between the parties, Mrs May has committed to putting a series of Brexit options to the Commons and being bound by the result. Mr Corbyn said: ""Talks have to mean a movement and so far there's been no change in those red lines."" The Labour leader said there were ""many concerns"" his party had over the political declaration - a plan for the future relationship with the EU - which it planned to put to the government in their discussions. Meanwhile, the government has taken steps to ensure the UK can take part in European Parliament elections on 23 May. A Day of Poll Order has been laid in Parliament, which is required by law for the vote to take place. The Cabinet Office said it was taking responsible steps, but the move did not make participation in the elections inevitable. On Monday, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barniermet Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublinand told reporters he hoped the UK's cross-party talks would ""produce a positive outcome"". But he said that, if the UK left the EU without a deal, ""we will not discuss anything with the UK until there is an agreement for Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as for citizens' rights and for the financial settlement"". The EU would ""stand fully behind Ireland"" regardless of what happens with Brexit, he added. Mr Varadkar said he was open to extending the Brexit deadline to allow discussions to ""continue their course"".

Eight tips for staying safe online,"Find out more about keeping things fun, safe and respectful when you're online. The internet is an amazing place to be creative, chat with friends and find interesting fun stuff. You may spend a lot of time online, so itâs important to make the most of it and enjoy it whilst also being safe, sensible and respectful to others too. Hereâs our guide to being smart about who you meet and what you do online. Try to think of your online world as an extension of your offline friendships. Include friends in your activities, it can feel just as hurtful to be left out of online games or chat as offline ones. Be careful how you word things too, sometimes the written word can be misinterpreted. So whether itâs emails, texts or posts, be considerate to how they may come across. Save your important conversations, like resolving conflicts, for face to face meetings. Be respectful of your friends on social media. Donât post photos of them they might find embarrassing without asking first â and take them down straight away if someone asks you to. Try to be mindful of how your posts will make people feel before you put them up. Youâll care about what other people post about you â so be courteous to others too. Every time you go online you leave whatâs called a digital footprint which shows others where you are and what you have been doing. So while posting pictures and videos is great for sharing with friends and being creative, always remember that once an image or file is online itâs likely to stay there forever. Donât post anything you wouldnât want your grandmother to see. Social media and some websites are great for airing your opinions and making the world a better place. However, be wary of writing negative posts. Ranting on the spur of the moment might feel good at the time but you may regret it later. Instead, try to put your point across in a positive or neutral way, itâll have more impact and shouldnât cause offence. Always remember that when you respond to something someoneâs said, thereâs a person at the other end who has feelings, just like you do. Socialising online can be fun, itâs a great way to keep in touch with friends and family. Lots of people only play or chat with people they know in person, and thatâs a sensible approach. But if you do meet people you donât know, use the same caution that you would offline. Always remember people may not be who they say they are, so be mindful about what you say about yourself. Keep chat general and if you are concerned that someoneâs asking for personal details, then stop contact and tell a trusted adult. Never arrange to meet someone you only know online. This video can not be played Chavala and the team talk about staying safe online When using the internet never give out personal information, such as your number, where you live or what school you go to â itâs a big no-no. If you are using social media check your privacy settings and make sure only friends can see your posts. Always bear in mind that photos and posts can exaggerate real life. Think about it - we usually select the prettiest, happiest pictures (you rarely see posts about going to the supermarket with your mum or photos of a massive spot). Images of other peopleâs (carefully chosen) perfect lives can leave you feeling low, but they donât tell the whole story, so try not to compare yourself. The internet is a fantastic resource for research and schoolwork, but make sure you take regular breaks away from the screen. If you find yourself spending a lot of time online and even thinking about it when youâre offline (instead of spending time with friends or family) then maybe itâs time to back off a bit. Thereâs a whole world out there â and while the internet can be fun, creative and social, you could be missing out on real life, like hanging out with your real mates. Itâs all about striking a good balance. For information about organisations which can offer more advice on a range of issues, check out theadvice helplines page.

'Lost' Beatles TV performance unearthedA clip of The Beatles' only live performance on Top of the Pops is unearthed in Mexico.,"This video can not be played Part of a performance by The Beatles on Top of the Pops in 1966 (This video has no sound) An 11-second clip of the Beatles' only live appearance on Top of the Pops, which was thought to have been be lost, has been unearthed in Mexico. The silent snippet is all that exists of the Fab Four miming to Paperback Writer on the BBC pop show in 1966. The original tapes were not kept, but it was recorded by a viewer filming their TV set with an 8mm camera. The footage was shot by a family in Liverpool and eventually fell into the hands of a collector in Mexico. The collector contacted Kaleidoscope, a Birmingham-based organisation specialising in locating previously missing TV footage. ""I think if you're a Beatles fans, it's the holy grail,"" Kaleidoscope's Chris Perry told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson. ""People thought it was gone forever because videotape wasn't kept in 1966. To find it all these years later was stunning."" The Beatles in the Top of the Pops studio in 1966 The band pre-recorded songs for Top of the Pops on several occasions, but only appeared live once, on 16 June 1966. The performance itself has long-been a talking point for Beatles obsessives. In 2000,a BBC spokeswoman said,external: ""We don't know whether or not this particular piece of Top of the Pops history has disappeared forever, but unfortunately there was a time when BBC programmes were not archived as carefully as they are today and some programmes were sadly lost."" The rediscovered clip will be screened at the BFI in London as part of the Music Believed Wiped programme on 20 April. Lennon's rare Beatles record to be sold Speaking about the discovery, Dr Dori Howard, a lecturer in The Beatles and Popular Music at Liverpool Hope University, said: ""It's crazy, what are the chances? I would say it's a really big find."" A missing episode of Top of the Pops from 1969, featuring an early cut of The Beatles' promotional video for their single Something, has also been discovered. The Beatles famously never toured again after playing live at their last ever gig at San Francisco's Candlestick Park in 1966, at the height of Beatlemania. They reunited for a one-off performance on the rooftop of Apple Records in London in 1969. The Music Believed Wiped screening will include highlights of 240 musical performances that have recently been found by Kaleidoscope. They include Elton John singing Rocket Man on Top of the Pops in 1972, T Rex's fourth and final UK number one Metal Guru, and a pieced-together Slade performance from 1975.

'Ball in governmentÃ¢ÂÂs court' on Brexit talks,"This video can not be played Starmer: ""We haven't seen change of Brexit position"" ""The ball is in the government's court"" when it comes to a way forward with Brexit, Labour's Sir Keir Starmer says. Talks between Labour and the government began last week, with Theresa May saying only a cross-party pact would see MPs agree a deal in Parliament. But the shadow Brexit secretary said Mrs May's team had ""not changed its position"" on her existing plan. The PM will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. Mrs May's spokesman said she was also making calls to other European leaders from Downing Street on Monday afternoon. She is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday, where EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans ahead of the UK's scheduled exit date - Friday at 23:00 BST. Meanwhile, peers are continuing to examine a bill brought by senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which aims to force the PM to request a Brexit extension rather than leave the EU without a deal. Live updates: Lords scrutinise Brexit bill Brexit explained in flowcharts A really simple guide to Brexit Brexit Basics: The customs union Despite communications over the weekend, there were no further talks with Labour scheduled for Monday. However, Sir Keir - who is part of Labour's negotiating team - added: ""I have no doubt things will develop today."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the party was now ""expecting [an] updated proposal"" from the government, and more formal talks could take place this afternoon. Allow Twitter content?

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was leaving ""no stone unturned"" to try and resolve Brexit, while Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that all sides needed to be ""prepared to compromise"" to ""fulfil the primary objective"" of leaving the EU. But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told BBC's Radio 4's Today programme that talks between the parties had ""not been entirely productive"". Several Conservatives have also strongly criticised the move, with the former Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson using his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph,externalto warn that Tory MPs would not allow Mrs May to ""surrender"" to Mr Corbyn. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier,is in Dublin for talkswith the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The pair are expected to discuss developments in London, as well as ongoing planning for a possible no-deal scenario.

""And I think members of the public want to see their politicians working together more often."" If no compromise can be reached with Labour, Mrs May has committed to putting a series of Brexit options to the Commons and being bound by the result. Sir Keir said the talks had been taking place ""in good faith"" and that ""both sides... have approached this in the spirit of trying to find a way forward"". But he added: ""At the moment we are waiting to see what the government is putting on the table as a proposal. ""All they have done so far is indicate various things but not to change the political declaration [the non-legally binding document setting out the UK's future relationship with the EU] so the ball is in the government's court. ""We need to see what they come back with and when we do we will take a collective position on that."" This video can not be played Labour would consider voting to revoke Article 50 to avoid no deal - shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is also a member of Labour's negotiating team, described the mood as ""positive and hopeful"" - but she told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the government's proposals ""have not been compliant with the definition of a customs union"", which is her party's key demand. That would allow tariff-free trade in goods with the EU but limit the UK from striking its own deals. Leaving the arrangement was a Conservative manifesto commitment. However, Solicitor General Robert Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that ""something approximating a customs arrangement or customs union"" was the most likely outcome of the talks. ""In this particular hung Parliament none of us can get perfection, we need to compromise,"" he added. Ms Long-Bailey also suggested Labour could be prepared to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 - the legal mechanism through which Brexit is taking place - if the UK was heading towards a no-deal scenario on Friday. This video can not be played Brexit: 'It's like the playground, really' Although 12 April remains, in law, the date the UK will leave the EU, Mrs May has already requested that be rescheduled until the end of June. BBC political correspondent Vicki Young said if EU leaders did not think she had a credible plan to get Parliament behind a deal, they might refuse or insist on a much lengthier extension to the Brexit process. This outcome is opposed by some Tory Brexiteers as it would mean the UK having to take part in European Parliamentary elections. Monday:Possible resumption of talks between the government and Labour; House of Lords to examine bill proposed by Labour's Yvette Cooper aimed at extending Article 50 Brexit process Wednesday: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider UK request for further extension until 30 June, with the option of an earlier Brexit day if a deal can be agreed Friday:Brexit day, if UK is not granted a further delay Are you putting any important plans or decisions on hold due to Brexit negotiations?

Campaign to 'debunk silent 999 call myth',"Miss Power's family described her as ""happy, fun-loving and considerate... the consummate mum"". A campaign has been launched to raise awareness of how to call 999 when you are too frightened to speak out loud. The Independent Office for Police Conduct watchdog warns it is ""not true"" that a silent 999 call alone will automatically bring help. Around 5,000 of the 20,000 silent 999 calls made daily are put through to an automated system. Callers are then led through a series of prompts and asked to press 55 to confirm there is a genuine emergency. The system has been in operation since 2002 but police say many callers don't understand, or use it correctly. The system, called Silent Solution,external, filters out thousands of accidental or hoax silent 999 calls made daily - but it also could lead to genuine calls being terminated if the callers do not respond to the prompts. The Independent Office for Police Conduct's campaign is being supported by the family of Kerry Power, 36, who was killed by her ex-partner in Plymouth, in December 2013. She had made a silent 999 call but did not respond to the BT operator and so was transferred to Silent Solution. As 55 was not pressed, the call was terminated and Devon and Cornwall Police were not notified of Kerry's call. The IOPC is launching a poster campaign, backed by ahow-to guide,external, aimed at ""debunking the myth"" that a silent 999 call alone will automatically bring help. Silent 999 call 'myth must be debunked' Behind the scenes of your 999 calls When are silent 999 calls cut off?,external Regional director Catrin Evans said: ""It is always best to actually speak to a police call handler if you can, even if by whispering, but if you are putting yourself or someone else in danger by making a sound, there is something you can do. ""Make yourself heard by coughing, tapping the handset or - once prompted by the automated system - by pressing 55."" Miss Power's family said in a statement: ""Although she was not able to speak for the fear of alerting the intruder to her actions, she followed the advice given by a police officer during an earlier visit."" However, the family said she had not been told to press 55. ""A short while after the call, she was strangled,"" their statement added. David Wilder, 44 at the time, was jailed for life over her death. However, the subsequentinvestigation into the police responsefound Miss Power might have been wrongly advised by a police officer about when assistance would be sent. Ms Evans said the inquiry identified a ""lack of public awareness"" about the method of alerting police that ""could potentially save a life"". The Make Yourself Heard campaign is being backed by the charities Women's Aid and Welsh Women's Aid, and the National Police Chiefs' Council. Lucy Hadley, from Women's Aid, said: ""We need to look at all ways we can raise awareness and make the system work better for the people it's designed for, which are people in extreme distress and fear, and might not necessarily remember everything... on a poster or advertising campaign.""

Thousands flee clashes in Libya,"This video can not be played No casualties were reported in the air strike The UN has condemned an air strike that closed the only functioning airport in Libya's capital, Tripoli, on Monday. Flights at Mitiga International Airport were suspended and passengers were evacuated. No casualties were reported. The UN blamed the air strike on forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar, a commander from the east who is trying to seize the capital. A spokesman for Gen Haftar's forces said civilian planes had not been targeted, Reuters news agency reports. Gen Haftar, who leads the Libyan National Army (LNA), declared an offensive to take control of Tripoli from Libya's UN-backed government last week. Why is Libya so lawless? Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj has accused him of attempting to carry out a coup. At least 2,800 people have so far fled fighting around Tripoli, the UN says. The UN also warns that those who remain risk being cut off from vital services because of the clashes. A crew member and passenger seen outside the international airport Libya has been torn by violence, political instability and power struggles since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. International powers have started evacuating personnel from the country in recent days as the situation has deteriorated. The UN's Libya envoy, Ghassan Salame, said Monday's  air strike violated humanitarian law which prohibited attacks against civilian infrastructure. Mr Salame said the bombing marked an ""escalation of violence on the ground"". LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari was quoted by Reuters as saying ""only a MiG [aircraft] parked at Mitiga airport"" had been targeted. The airport is also the base for a powerful militia, loosely under the control of the government's ministry of interior, says the BBC's North Africa correspondent, Rana Jawad. An older, inactive airport, Tripoli International, has also been a focal point for clashes recent days. The Libyan health ministry said at least 25 people had been killed and 80 wounded so far, including civilians and government fighters. Gen Haftar's forces said they had lost at least 19 fighters. The UN appealed for a two-hour truce on Sunday to allow for the evacuations of casualties and civilians, but fighting continued. Libya has been a hotbed of unrest since Gaddafi was overthrown eight years ago. The Government of National Accord (GNA) was created from peace talks in 2015, but has struggled to take control despite UN backing. Gen Haftar is allied to a rival government in the eastern city of Tobruk which has refused to cede power to Tripoli. Gen Haftar has ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli The general helped Gaddafi seize power in 1969 before falling out with him and going into exile in the US. He then returned when the uprising against Gaddafi began and became a rebel commander. His LNA troops have continued to make advances, seizing the south of Libya and its oil fields earlier this year. UN-backed talks between the rival governments had been scheduled for 14-16 April to discuss a roadmap for new elections, but it is now unclear if these will still take place. Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj said he had offered concessions to Gen Haftar to avoid bloodshed, only to be ""stabbed in the back"". Much of the international community, including the US, have called for a ceasefire to hostilities. ""This unilateral military campaign against Tripoli is endangering civilians and undermining prospects for a better future for all Libyans,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday. The US military is among those to withdraw its supporting forces based in the country,external, blaming the ""complex and unpredictable"" situation and ""increased unrest"" on the ground. The UN is also due to pull out non-essential staff. A market in Tripoli. Residents are said to be stocking up on supplies Residents of Tripoli have reportedly begun stocking up on food and fuel. The BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says some residents fear a long operation such as that which Gen Haftar mounted to take the eastern city of Benghazi from Islamist fighters in 2017. Analysis by Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent, in Tunis The rogue general's defiance suggests that, despite international condemnation of his recent moves, he believes he can only secure a place in Libya's future political makeup through military means. Diplomats are worried because the manner and timing of the attack mean he is unlikely to back down unless he is defeated. Few thought he would go ahead and launch this operation - which he has long threatened to do - because they believed ongoing talks that saw him go from Paris to Palermo and the UAE for more than a year would buy time until a new political settlement was reached through negotiations and an eventual electoral process. Today, Western nations have few cards to play to de-escalate the violence and once again find themselves in a position where they may need to start from scratch.

Film festival cancels Wyman appearance,"Bill Wyman met Mandy Smith when she was 13 and they married five years later A film festival has dropped ex-Rolling Stone Bill Wyman from its bill after protests stemming from his relationship with a teenage girl in the 1980s. The bassist had been due to do a Q&A session at June's Sheffield Doc/Fest and appear at the European premiere of a documentary about him, The Quiet One. The festival pulled the plug on both after receiving an online backlash. The rocker courted controversy after he met Mandy Smith in 1984, when she was 13 and he was 47. Prosecutors considered bringing charges against him two years later, but decided to not take action. The pair married in 1989, when she was 18, but divorced two years later. Representatives for Wyman are yet to respond to a request for comment about Sheffield Doc/Fest's decision. Wyman and Smith were interviewed together by Terry Wogan in 1989 The Quiet One, directed by Oliver Murray, documents Wyman's life as one of the original members of The Rolling Stones. Responding to criticism of the line-up announcement on the festival's Facebook page, organisers said: ""We truly appreciate you alerting us to the issue.

Ofcom investigates Snow 'white people' remark,"Channel 4 News said it regrets any offence caused by the remarks Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow is being investigated by Ofcom afterhe said he had ""never seen so many white people in one place"" at a Brexit rally. The broadcasting watchdog received 2,644 complaints about his comments on 29 March. Mr Snow was signing off from the evening bulletin when he made the unscripted remark. Ofcom will also investigate Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage for his response to Mr Snow. Mr Snow's remarks came as the news bulletin showed protesters in Westminster on the day the UK was due to leave the EU. He said: ""It's been the most extraordinary day. A day which has seen... I have never seen so many white people in one place, it's an extraordinary story."" Channel 4 said it was a ""spontaneous comment"" noting that ethnic minorities were under-represented for a London demonstration of this size, and said the channel regretted any offence caused. In an exchange on LBC radio two days after the protest, Mr Farage was asked to condemn people who attacked journalists and police. He said: ""Well, I think Jon Snow should be attacked without doubt, but that's a slightly separate issue."" Asked to explain, Mr Farage said: ""Because of his terrible condescending bias, but that's a separate issue"". He said later in the same programme that he only meant a verbal attack, not a physical one but the remarks prompted five complaints to Ofcom. An Ofcom spokeswoman said of both incidents: ""We're investigating whether comments made by the presenters on these programmes broke our rules on offensive content.""

Home Office admits Windrush data breach,"Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes has apologised for the data breach The Home Office has admitted breaching data protection rules when it launched the Windrush compensation scheme. The department sent information to Windrush migrants in a way that meant their email addresses could be seen by other people. An internal review has been launched and the matter has been referred to the Information Commissioner. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes apologised ""unreservedly"" for what she said was an ""administrative error"". The data breach affected five batches of emails, each with 100 recipients, Ms Nokes added. Home Office 'complacent' over Windrush 'No cap' on Windrush compensation claims The recipients included Windrush migrants and other people who had asked to be kept informed about the compensation scheme, which was launched last week. The Home Office revealed the error in a written statement, which also clarified other details about the scheme. This video can not be played Windrush scandal made me want to end my life, says Glenda Caesar An estimated 500,000 people now living in the UK who arrived between 1948 and 1971 from countries in the Commonwealth, including the Caribbean, have been called the Windrush generation, in reference to a ship which brought workers to the UK in 1948. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971 but thousands were children travelling on their parents' passports, without their own documents. Some later encountered difficulties proving their entitlement to live in the UK.  The problems intensified after changes to immigration law in 2012 which meant those without documents were asked for evidence to continue working, access services or stay in Britain. Some were held in detention or removed despite living in the country for decades, resulting in a furious backlash over their treatment.

Clutha inquiry hears about those who died,"This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded Eyewitnesses have described hearing noises coming from a police helicopter before it crashed into the Clutha pub. The final seconds of the flight in Glasgow city centre on 29 November 2013 were described at the opening day of a hearing into the tragedy. Statements on behalf of six of the 10 victims were also read out after a minute's silence was observed. The Fatal Accident Inquiry heard from a number of people, including a taxi driver and pedestrians. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street. They were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. In his evidence, Ernest Docherty, 64, told the inquiry - which is being held in a temporary court at Hampden Park football ground - that the Police Scotland helicopter ""was like an old car trying to start but a thousand times louder"". The retired transport worker said the noise grew louder as it flew overhead, causing him to hunch in the street. (Top: left to right) David Traill; PC Kirsty Nelis; PC Tony Collins; Gary Arthur; Samuel McGhee (Bottom: left to right) Colin Gibson; Robert Jenkins; Mark O'Prey; John McGarrigle; Joe Cusker Andrew Bergen, 30, was walking along the river bank when he saw the helicopter flying normally. The solicitor added: ""It made what I can only describe as a spluttering noise."" Mr Bergen said the helicopter's tail dipped and pointed toward the ground. He went on: ""Simultaneously the lights went out and it seemed to me that the rotor stopped spinning. It was still turning but not under power."" Taxi driver Tariq Malik, 41, was having a cigarette in the car park of the Grand Mosque on the opposite side of the river Clyde, when he spotted the helicopter. He recalled it was a clear night and everything initially seemed normal until it suddenly lost power. He told the court: ""All I could hear was a swooshing sound as it fell through the sky."" Christopher Jarvie, 36, described a ""stuttering noise"" while Brian Stewart, 50, said the sound from the helicopter was similar to a car stalling. Another witness, Craig Welsh, 42, talked of hearing a ""whining sound and then there were two distinct thuds"". The police helicopter crashed into The Clutha roof on 29 November 2013 Earlier, statements from six of the families of those killed were read out by their legal representatives. Testimonies came from the families of Mr McGhee, Mr Arthur, Mr Jenkins, Mr Gibson, Mr McGarrigle and Mr O'Prey. No statement was provided by relatives of Mr Cusker or the pilot and his two crew. Mr McGhee's daughter Kerry told how her father was born and bred in Castlemilk. The bus driver had to take early retirement to care for his partner, who died of cancer in 2007. She wrote: ""He was a good friend, neighbour and a sad loss to our close-knit community."" Colin Gibson was celebrating a friend's birthday on the night of the tragedy. He had never been in the bar before. In a statement, his family said: ""We will never know what he would have went on to achieve. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time."" This video can not be played Families of Clutha victims on fatal accident inquiry Mark O'Prey's father, Ian, said his ""wonderful son"" had ""many virtues"" and ""loved life and lived it to the full"". He thanked the hearing for the minute's silence, but said added: ""After five and a half years of silence from the Crown Office it is of no consequence to me personally."" Mary Kavanagh's partner, 61-year-old Robert Jenkins, was the oldest to die. Donald Findlay QC read out a statement on behalf of Ms Kavanagh, which said the father-of-two had many friends and was a keen football fan who would have loved to work at the Scottish Football Museum, based at Hampden Park. He said: ""Mary finds it very ironic that the FAI is taking place at a venue that Robert held in such high esteem."" Mary Kavanagh last saw her partner, Robert Jenkins, when he went to the bar to buy her a drink The couple were in The Clutha on the night of the disaster. She last saw Mr Jenkins as he went to the bar to buy her a cranberry juice. Mr Findlay concluded: ""All Mary wants to know is why she went into the bar with the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with and came out alone."" Follow the BBC's Paul O'Hare who is tweeting from the inquiry,external Clutha survivor: 'Going back to pub helped my recovery' Date announced for Clutha helicopter crash inquiry Clutha families 'punished again' over FAI The sisters of Gary Arthur described him as a ""joker"" and a ""loveable rogue"", and said the disaster had robbed him of so much. Their statement concluded: ""Nothing will ever bring our brother back, but hopefully we will be given the chance to have closure over the last five years and remember Gary as a much loved person and not just a victim from The Clutha."" John McGarrigle's son, John, described his father as his ""hero"". The court heard he was a writer and a Clutha regular who always used to sit in the same seat. The statement said: ""His talent was immense and his take on things was wry and humorous."" More than 100 people were in the bar when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof at 22:22. As well as the 10 who died, 31 people were injured. The Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, had been returning to its base on the banks of the River Clyde. The inquiry will not sit every day and is expected to hear about three months' worth of evidence between now and August. The first four weeks will involve eyewitnesses and representatives of the the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and Airbus.

"Vegan protests 'un-Australian', PM says","This video can not be played A protester being arrested in Melbourne, Australia Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has criticised animal rights activists as ""shameful and un-Australian"" after dozens were arrested in nationwide protests. On Monday, activists broke into abattoirs and chained themselves up to protest against the meat industry. More than 100 protesters also blocked one of Melbourne's main intersections, before many were forcibly removed. Mr Morrison said the activism was damaging to farmers' livelihoods. ""This is just another form of activism that I think runs against the national interest, and the national interest is [farmers] being able to farm their own land,"" he told radio station 2GB. He later called on state authorities to bring ""the full force of the law... against these green-collared criminals"". Australia is second only to the US for meat consumption per person,according to the World Economic Forum,external. Which countries eat the most meat? The nation's livestock industry accounts for more than 40% of its agricultural output. The activists say eating meat is unethical The protests took place in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and aimed to raise publicity about animal treatment and the ethics of eating meat. ""We want people to go vegan - we want people to stop supporting animal abuse,"" one campaigner, Kristin Leigh, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""Animals are suffering in ways that most of us could never imagine. It is not about bigger cages - it is about animal liberation."" Would you eat slaughter-free meat? Police said 38 protesters were arrested in Melbourne. A further nine were arrested at an abattoir in Goulburn, 168km (104 miles) south of Sydney, after chaining themselves to machinery. The Australian Meat Industry Council said butcher shops had been under a sustained ""attack"" by campaigners. ""This has to stop and stop now. We need to look at the 99% of people in Australia that are looking to and wanting to consume red meat products,"" said chief executive Patrick Hutchinson. Global meat consumption has increased rapidly over the past 50 years. Meat production today is nearly five times higher than in the early 1960s- from 70 million tonnes to more than 330 million tonnes in 2017, according to the Our World in Data project.

London's new pollution charge begins,"About 40,000 vehicles a day are expected to be affected by the charge The Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) has come into force in central London. Drivers of older, more polluting vehicles are being charged to enter the congestion zone area at any time. Transport for London (TfL) hopes the move will reduce the number of polluting cars in the capital, and estimates about 40,000 vehicles will be affected every day. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said it was ""important we make progress"" in tackling the capital's toxic air. However, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said many small firms were ""very worried about the future of their businesses"" as a result of the ""additional cost burden"". This video can not be played London's ULEZ: What you need to know Most vehicles which are not compliant will have to pay Â£12.50 for entering the area each day, in addition to the congestion charge. Vehicles can be checked usingTfL's online checker,externalbut broadly speaking, those which are non-compliant are: Motorbikes that do not meet Euro 3 standards (pre-2007 vehicles) Petrol cars and vans that do not meet Euro 4 standards (vehicles pre-2006) Diesel cars and vans that do not meet Euro 6 standards (vehicles pre-2015) Buses, coaches and lorries will need to meet or exceed the Euro 6 standards or pay Â£100 a day Anybody who does not pay the charge will face a fine of Â£160, although a first offence may result in only a warning letter. The ULEZ is set to be expanded to cover the entire area between the North and South Circular roads in 2021. London's ULEZ: How does it compare? What does air pollution do to our bodies? ULEZ: The politics of pollution TfL estimates the initial scheme will lead to a reduction in toxic emissions from road transport by about 45% in two years. Mr Khan said London's air pollution was a ""public health emergency"" and it was the ""poorest Londoners that suffer the worst quality air"". This video can not be played Air pollution: what are the effects on humans? Analysis Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent A very damp misty morning in London and most people probably won't notice anything has changed. But London has taken a big step in trying to clean up its air. Given the go-ahead in 2013 by the previous mayor Boris Johnson, Sadiq Khan brought the ULEZ forward a year and is planning to expand it in 2021. City hall says the ULEZ has already changed behaviour, with a fall in vehicles in central London and a rise in compliant vehicles ahead of launch. The plan is that London's air will be compliant with legal limits by 2025. Other cities are talking about diesel bans but London has taken the radical step that puts it in the vanguard of clean-air schemes. Other cities are watching closely. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sandra Green from the Clear Air Parents Network said the scheme was a ""really big step forward"". ""Air pollution caused by traffic, caused by individual cars - is causing problems for health for the next generation... and it's about time we did something about it,"" she said. Figures from City Hall show more than 60% of all vehicles driving through the charging zone in March were already compliant with the new restrictions. Nearly 27,000 non-compliant vehicles have been taken off the roads in the last two months, and there has been an 11% drop in the total number of cars entering central London. However,some drivers have spoken about their angerthat governments had previously recommended buying diesel cars which are now being targeted by the charge. Jim Parker, managing director at car recovery company Boleyn, said the charge was ""really unfair"". ""It's not just us, it is across the industry - everybody that owns a van or a truck and earns a living with it,"" he said. ""We've had a local business, where the margins are so tight, they've now had to cease trading because they can't get a retrofit kit and they can't afford new vehicles.""

Watchdog warns over web rules,"Government regulation of social media and the internet could have ""unintended consequences"" for victims of sexual abuse, a charity has warned. The Internet Watch Foundation said that ""knee-jerk regulation"" in response to a string of data and privacy scandals could come at a ""heavy cost"". The UK government is expected to publish a White Paper that will lay out how it plans to tackle ""online harms"". Culture Minister Jeremy Wright said it would be published in the coming weeks. He told the BBC's Dave Lee: ""We are taking our time to get it right"". The White Paper will detail new rules that the government wants introduced for social networks and web giants if they want to operate in the UK, or target services at British citizens. Mr Wright told the BBC that the White Paper would lay out a ""scheme"" and ""how it can be paid for"". There has been speculation that the government is going to announce an internet regulator, similar to the one for TV and telecoms, Ofcom. ""The period of time that we've been through, where we simply urged social media companies to do better and left them to regulate themselves, is a period that is now coming to an end,"" Mr Wright said. The full details of the White Paper will not be published for another few weeks. Culture secretary Jeremy Wright will meet Mark Zuckerberg for 30 minutes But there are suggestions the government plans to: force websites to remove illegal hate speech within a specific time period or face penalties. A similar law is in force in Germany make social networks verify the age of their users punish social networks that fail to remove terror content or child abuse images restrict advertisements online for food and soft drink products that are high in salt, fat or sugar The Internet Watch Foundation aims to stop the exchange of child sexual abuse images online. It has urged the government to take a ""balanced approach to internet regulation"", warning that badly-planned legislation could have unexpected results. It has previously criticised the European Commission's e-privacy proposals,external, suggesting they would help abusers hide their illegal activity online. Mr Wright told the BBC he had a ""scheme"" in mind, and that it would not be optional for the tech companies. He spoke to the BBC while on a visit to Silicon Valley, California, where he was meeting some of the tech industry's biggest names, including Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. Mr Wright said: ""If we do it effectively, as we seek to do, and we construct a system that will work, then it may be that other countries will look carefully at that model and seek to do something similar. ""So there's good reason for these companies, be it Facebook or any other, to engage with us.""

Governments v social media,"The government is to outline new powers for the media regulator Ofcom to police social media. It is supposed to make the companies protect users from content involving things like violence, terrorism, cyber-bullying and child abuse. Companies will have to ensure that harmful content is removed quickly and take steps to prevent it appearing in the first place. They had previously relied largely on self-governance. Sites such as YouTube and Facebook have their own rules about what is unacceptable and the way that users are expected to behave towards one another. YouTube releases atransparency report,external, which gives data on its removals of inappropriate content. The video-sharing site owned by Google said that 8.8m videos were taken down between July and September 2019, with 93% of them automatically removed by machines, and two thirds of those clips not receiving a single view. It also removed 3.3 million channels and 517 million comments. Globally, YouTube employs 10,000 people in monitoring and removing content, as well as policy development. Facebook, which owns Instagram, told Reality Check it has more than 35,000 people around the world working on safety and security, and italso releases statistics,externalon its content removals. Between July and September 2019 it took action on 30.3 million pieces of content of which it found 98.4% before any users flagged it. If illegal content, such as ""revenge pornography"" or extremist material, is posted on a social media site, it has previously been the person who posted it, rather than the social media companies, who was most at risk of prosecution. But that may now change. So if the UK has previously mainly relied on social media platforms governing themselves, what do other countries do? Germany's NetzDG law came into effect at the beginning of 2018, applying to companies with more than two million registered users in the country. They were forced to set up procedures to review complaints about content they were hosting, remove anything that was clearly illegal within 24 hours and publish updates every six months about how they were doing. Individuals may be fined up to â¬5m ($5.6m; Â£4.4m) and companies up to â¬50m for failing to comply with these requirements. The government issued its first fine under the new law to Facebook in July 2019. The company had to pay â¬2m (Â£1.7m) for under-reporting illegal activity on its platforms in Germany, although the company complained that the new law had lacked clarity. The EU is considering a clampdown, specifically on terror videos. Social media platforms face finesif they do not delete extremist content within an hour. The EU also introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which set rules on how companies, including social media platforms, store and use people's data. It has also taken action on copyright.Its copyright directive puts the responsibility on platformsto make sure that copyright infringing content is not hosted on their sites. Previous legislation only required the platforms to take down such content if it was pointed out to them. Member states have until 2021 to implement the directive into their domestic law. Australia passed the Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material Act in 2019, introducing criminal penalties for social media companies, possible jail sentences for tech executives for up to three years and financial penalties worth up to 10% of a company's global turnover. It followed thelive-streaming of the New Zealand shootingson Facebook. In 2015, the Enhancing Online Safety Act created an eSafety Commissioner with the power to demand that social media companies take down harassing or abusive posts. In 2018, the powers were expanded to include revenge porn. The eSafety Commissioner's office can issue companies with 48-hour ""takedown notices"", and fines of up to 525,000 Australian dollars (Â£285,000). But it can also fine individuals up to A$105,000 for posting the content. The legislation was introduced after the death of Charlotte Dawson, a TV presenter and a judge on Australia's Next Top Model, who killed herself in 2014 following a campaign of cyber-bullying against her on Twitter. She had a long history of depression. Cardboard cut-outs were used at demonstrations over Facebook in Washington and Brussels last year A law came into force in Russia in Novembergiving regulators the power to switch off connections to the worldwide web ""in an emergency"" although it is not yet clear how effectively they would be able to do this. Russia's data laws from 2015 required social media companies to store any data about Russians on servers within the country. Its communications watchdogblocked LinkedInand fined Facebook and Twitter for not being clear about how they planned to comply with this. Sites such as Twitter, Google and WhatsApp are blocked in China. Their services are provided instead by Chinese providers such as Weibo, Baidu and WeChat. Chinese authorities have also had some success in restricting access to the virtual private networks that some users have employed to bypass the blocks on sites. The Cyberspace Administration of China announced at the end of January,external2019 that in the previous six months it had closed 733 websites and ""cleaned up"" 9,382 mobile apps, although those are more likely to be illegal gambling apps or copies of existing apps being used for illegal purposes than social media. China has hundreds of thousands of cyber-police, who monitor social media platforms and screen messages that are deemed to be politically sensitive. Some keywords are automatically censored outright, such as references to the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident. New words that are seen as being sensitive are added to a long list of censored words and are either temporarily banned, or are filtered out from social platforms. This piece was originally published in April 2018 and has been updated to reflect the Ofcom proposals and more recent statistics. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Armed forces clash at Sudan protest,"This video can not be played Sudan protest: some soldiers protect demonstrators Elements of Sudan's military moved to protect demonstrators during deadly clashes in Khartoum between security forces and protesters, witnesses say. Soldiers tried to chase away pick-up trucks firing tear gas, on the second night of a sit-in protest calling for President Omar al-Bashir to resign. Protesters sought shelter in a navy facility, a witness said, as tension among the armed forces was laid bare. Seven protesters have been killed since Saturday, officials say. Mr Bashir, who has been in power for nearly 30 years, has so far refused demands to make way for a transitional government. One protester told the BBC's Newsday programme that a number of pick-up trucks arrived and began firing tear gas and live ammunition at the thousands of sit-in protesters in the Sudanese capital. She said the military was at first neutral but then tried to chase other security force groups away. Sudan's unrest in 300 words 'Why Sudan is shooting medics' It is unclear who the security forces were but BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane says reports indicate they included agents from the powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS). The eyewitness said some members of the security forces returned for a second attack and people then ran towards a navy facility to seek shelter from the prolonged firing. An army vehicle passes protesters near the military HQ on Monday morning Ali Ibrahim, of the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which has organised the protest, told EFE news agency that military units had fired into the air to prevent some members of the security forces from dispersing the sit-in. Video on social media showed protesters hiding behind walls as shots ran out. Sudan's secret hit squads Why people keep cash under the mattress in Sudan What is Sudan like? The sit-in has been taking place outside the army HQ and AFP news agency quotes witnesses as saying the army has now deployed troops around the building and is setting up barricades in nearby streets. The army's intentions surrounding the protest remain unclear. Information Minister Hassan Ismail said the protesters in front of the HQ had been ""cleared completely"". Analysis by James Copnall, BBC's former Sudan correspondent The Sudanese state has numerous armed groups and there are signs of tensions between them. The demonstrators accuse the NISS and a militia supporting President Bashir of trying to drive them away. The militia is made up of former members of the Janjaweed, the fighters accused of carrying out many atrocities in Darfur. Over the past 48 hours, several protesters have said members of the Sudanese Armed Forces have protected them. However, many Sudanese still distrust the armed forces, because of their role in keeping President Bashir in power and their conduct in the country's succession of civil wars. Some analysts believe that mid-ranking army officers are sympathetic to the protesters, with the top brass more likely to be loyal to the president. But the position of all the armed groups is now one of the key questions in Sudan. It started on Friday when protesters descended on the zone outside the HQ to call for the removal of Mr Bashir and his government. It was the biggest protest against the president since unrest began in December and marked the 34th anniversary of the coup that overthrew the regime of former President Jaafar Nimeiri. President Bashir declared a state of national emergency in February The demonstrators appear to be hoping for an internal coup, pleading with the army command to remove Mr Bashir and open the way for a transitional government. 'We're not cleaners' - sexism amid protests How 'cheating husbands' are linked to protests Since the unrest began, Human Rights Watch says protest-related violence has killed 51 people, although officials put the figure at 32, AFP reports. The protests were originally sparked by a hike in the cost of living but demonstrators are now calling for the president to go. Sudan's economy has long been strained since the US imposed sanctions more than 20 years ago, accusing Khartoum of sponsoring terror groups. This video can not be played Sudan protests: The second day of demonstrations in Khartoum In December, the government announced the price of fuel and bread would rise. In the year leading up to this, inflation had risen while the Sudanese pound fell rapidly in value. Mr Bashir's rule has been blighted by accusations of human rights abuses. In 2009 and 2010, the International Criminal Court (ICC) charged him with counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. A warrant for his arrest has been issued. In February, it looked as though he might give in to protests and step down, but insteadMr Bashir declared a state of national emergency. He says the protesters have legitimate grievances but should only replace him through elections. The SPA - a collaboration of health workers and lawyers - has been organising the protests. This video can not be played Sudan protests: ""No amount of beating will make us stop"" Doctors have emerged as a leading force and as a result are being targeted by the authorities. It is estimated that up two thirds of the protesters are women, who say they are demonstrating against Sudan's sexist and patriarchal society. Have you recently taken part in the demonstrations?

Woman faces Dubai jail over horse insult,"Laleh Shahravesh faces prosecution over two Facebook comments she posted on pictures of her husband remarrying in 2016 A British woman is facing two years in jail in Dubai for calling her ex-husband's new wife a ""horse"" on Facebook, campaigners have said. Laleh Shahravesh, 55, was arrested at a Dubai airport after flying there to attend her former husband's funeral. She faces prosecution over two Facebook comments she posted on pictures of her husband remarrying in 2016. Ms Shahravesh's 14-year-old daughter, Paris, has written to Dubai's ruler asking for her mother's release. The Foreign Office said it was supporting the mother-of-one. UAE spy-accused recovery will 'take years' Ms Shahravesh was married to her ex-husband for 18 years, during which time she lived in the United Arab Emirates for eight months, according to the campaign group Detained in Dubai. While she returned to the UK with her daughter, her husband stayed in the United Arab Emirates, and the couple got divorced. Ms Shahravesh discovered her ex-husband was remarrying when she saw photos of the new couple on Facebook. She posted two comments in Farsi, including one that said: ""I hope you go under the ground you idiot. Damn you. You left me for this horse."" Under the UAE's cyber-crime laws, a person can be jailed or fined for making defamatory statements on social media. Detained in Dubai said Ms Shahravesh could be sentenced to up to two years in prison or fined Â£50,000, despite the fact the 55-year-old wrote the Facebook posts while in the UK. The organisation said Ms Shahravesh's ex-husband's new wife, who lives in Dubai, had reported the comments. It said Ms Shahravesh and her daughter flew to the UAE on 10 March to attend the funeral of their husband and father, who had died of a heart attack. At the time of her arrest, Ms Shahravesh was with her daughter Paris, who later had to fly home on her own, it added. In a letter to to the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Paris said her mother had been forced to sign a statement by police that was ""written in Arabic, which she did not understand"". She added: ""I cannot emphasise enough how scared I felt, especially after losing my father just a week before, as I was having to worry about losing my mother as well."" Closing the letter, she wrote: ""I ask kindly: please, please return my mother's passport, and let her come home."" The chief executive of Detained in Dubai, Radha Stirling, told BBC News that both her organisation and the Foreign Office (FCO) had asked the complainant to withdraw the allegation, but she had refused. The decision ""seems quite vindictive really"", she added. Ms Stirling said her client had been bailed, but her passport had been confiscated and she was currently living in a hotel. She said Ms Shahravesh was ""absolutely distraught"" and it was going to take her a long time to recover from her ordeal. Her daughter was ""very upset"" and had ""been through really what you would call hell"", she said. ""All she wants is to be reunited with her mother,"" Ms Stirling added. UAE 'fines' suspicious phone-check wife The 14-year-old was putting together an appeal in her mother's case, Ms Stirling said. She added that ""no-one would really be aware"" of the severity of cyber-crime laws in the UAE, and the FCO had failed to adequately warn tourists about them. The FCO said in a statement: ""Our staff are supporting a British woman and her family following her detention in the UAE. ""We are in contact with the UAE authorities regarding her case.""

Democrats have protested against the move, and declared the emergency unconstitutional. Mr McAleenan, 47, was confirmed as the nation's top border protection officer in 2018 with bipartisan support. He previously served as Customs and Border Protection (CBP)'s deputy commissioner under the Obama administration. In 2015, Mr McAleenan received the highest civil service award from then-President Barack Obama. Last year, he faced criticism in the media for carrying out Mr Trump's zero tolerance policy that led to the family separation crisis, but he has maintained his agency's duty is to carry out the laws, not create them. Mr McAleenan is married to Corina McAleenan, an El Salvadoran immigrant, according to the Times, who worked for several years with the US Secret Service. He is a graduate of Amherst College - where his honours thesis was on marriage equality, the New York Times reported - and he helped develop antiterrorism border security strategies after the 9/11 attacks. Mr McAleenan received a law degree from the University of Chicago and worked in California before CBP.

"Vegan protests 'un-Australian', PM saysScott Morrison rebukes animal rights activists after dozens are arrested in nationwide protests.Australia","This video can not be played A protester being arrested in Melbourne, Australia Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has criticised animal rights activists as ""shameful and un-Australian"" after dozens were arrested in nationwide protests. On Monday, activists broke into abattoirs and chained themselves up to protest against the meat industry. More than 100 protesters also blocked one of Melbourne's main intersections, before many were forcibly removed. Mr Morrison said the activism was damaging to farmers' livelihoods. ""This is just another form of activism that I think runs against the national interest, and the national interest is [farmers] being able to farm their own land,"" he told radio station 2GB. He later called on state authorities to bring ""the full force of the law... against these green-collared criminals"". Australia is second only to the US for meat consumption per person,according to the World Economic Forum,external. Which countries eat the most meat? The nation's livestock industry accounts for more than 40% of its agricultural output. The activists say eating meat is unethical The protests took place in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and aimed to raise publicity about animal treatment and the ethics of eating meat. ""We want people to go vegan - we want people to stop supporting animal abuse,"" one campaigner, Kristin Leigh, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""Animals are suffering in ways that most of us could never imagine. It is not about bigger cages - it is about animal liberation."" Would you eat slaughter-free meat? Police said 38 protesters were arrested in Melbourne. A further nine were arrested at an abattoir in Goulburn, 168km (104 miles) south of Sydney, after chaining themselves to machinery. The Australian Meat Industry Council said butcher shops had been under a sustained ""attack"" by campaigners. ""This has to stop and stop now. We need to look at the 99% of people in Australia that are looking to and wanting to consume red meat products,"" said chief executive Patrick Hutchinson. Global meat consumption has increased rapidly over the past 50 years. Meat production today is nearly five times higher than in the early 1960s- from 70 million tonnes to more than 330 million tonnes in 2017, according to the Our World in Data project.

Home Office admits Windrush data breachThe immigration minister says email addresses of individuals and organisations were shared by mistake.UK,"Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes has apologised for the data breach The Home Office has admitted breaching data protection rules when it launched the Windrush compensation scheme. The department sent information to Windrush migrants in a way that meant their email addresses could be seen by other people. An internal review has been launched and the matter has been referred to the Information Commissioner. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes apologised ""unreservedly"" for what she said was an ""administrative error"". The data breach affected five batches of emails, each with 100 recipients, Ms Nokes added. Home Office 'complacent' over Windrush 'No cap' on Windrush compensation claims The recipients included Windrush migrants and other people who had asked to be kept informed about the compensation scheme, which was launched last week. The Home Office revealed the error in a written statement, which also clarified other details about the scheme. This video can not be played Windrush scandal made me want to end my life, says Glenda Caesar An estimated 500,000 people now living in the UK who arrived between 1948 and 1971 from countries in the Commonwealth, including the Caribbean, have been called the Windrush generation, in reference to a ship which brought workers to the UK in 1948. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971 but thousands were children travelling on their parents' passports, without their own documents. Some later encountered difficulties proving their entitlement to live in the UK.  The problems intensified after changes to immigration law in 2012 which meant those without documents were asked for evidence to continue working, access services or stay in Britain. Some were held in detention or removed despite living in the country for decades, resulting in a furious backlash over their treatment.

'Shoddy' Huawei work risks Westminster banGCHQ suggests Huawei's 5G kit could be banned from Westminster and other sensitive areas.Technology,"A top cyber-security official has said Huawei's ""shoddy"" engineering practices mean its mobile network equipment could be banned from Westminster and other sensitive parts of the UK. GCHQ's Dr Ian Levy told BBC Panorama the Chinese telecom giant also faced being barred from what he described as the ""brains"" of the 5G networks. The UK government is expected to reveal in May whether it will restrict or even ban the company's 5G technology. Huawei said it would address concerns. Last month, a GCHQ-backed security review of the company said it would be difficult to risk-manage Huawei's future products until defects in its cyber-security processes were fixed. It added that technical issues with the company's approach to software development had resulted in vulnerabilities in existing products, which in some cases had not been fixed, despite having being identified in previous versions. In his first broadcast interview, the executive in charge of the firm's telecoms equipment division said he planned to spend more than the $2bn (Â£1.5bn) already committed to a ""transformation programme"" to tackle the problems identified. This video can not be played WATCH: Spencer Kelly visited Huawei's giant theme park-like campus near Shenzhen for Panorama ""We hope to turn this challenge into an opportunity moving forward,"" said Ryan Ding, chief executive of Huawei's carrier business group. ""I believe that if we can carry out this programme as planned, Huawei will become the strongest player in the telecom industry in terms of security and reliability."" However, Dr Levy - the technical director of GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre - said he had yet to be convinced. ""The security in Huawei is like nothing else - it's engineering like it's back in the year 2000 - it's very, very shoddy. ""We've seen nothing to give us any confidence that the transformation programme is going to do what they say it's going to do."" He added that ""geographic restrictions - maybe there's no Huawei radio [equipment] in Westminster"" was now one option for ministers to consider. This video can not be played What could happen if the UK's 5G networks suffered a major cyber-attack? Mobile UK - an industry group representing Vodafone, BT, O2 and Three -has warned that preventing Huawei from being involved in the UK's 5G rollout,externalcould cost the country's economy up to Â£6.8bn and delay the launch of its next-generation networks by up to two years. Huawei kit pulled from Pakistan CCTV system Huawei sales top $100bn despite backlash Huawei: The story of a controversial company Those already using Huawei's equipment have opted to keep it out of what is known as the core of their networks, where tasks such as checking device IDs and deciding how to route voice and data take place. EE used to make use of Huawei's gear in its 3G and 4G core, but BT is currently stripping it out after buying the business. The industry does, however, want to use Huawei's radio access network (Ran) equipment - including its antennae and base stations. These allow individual devices to wirelessly connect to their mobile data networks via radio signals transmitted over the airwaves. The US has concerns about any deployment of Huawei's products. Huawei is under pressure to tighten up its software engineering and cyber-security processes ""You would never know when the Chinese government decide to force Huawei... to do things that would be in the best interests of the Communist party, to eavesdrop on the US,"" claimed Mike Conaway, a member of the House Intelligence Committee. The Republican drafted a bill last year to ban the US government from doing business with firms that use the company's equipment. It was later adapted to become part of the National Defense Authorization Act, which was signed into law by President Trump. The effect has been to deter the country's major telecoms networks from working with Huawei. The Chinese companyis now suing the US government claiming the move is unconstitutional,external. The congressman now has his sights on the UK. ""Obviously, the terrific relationship between the UK and the United States - English-speaking countries - is important to maintain,"" Mr Conaway told Panorama. Huawei's 5G equipment is already being installed in China ""But as a part of that we will have to assess what kind of risks we would have in sharing... secrets that would go across Huawei equipment, Huawei networks. ""We can always share things old-school ways by, you know, paper back and forth. But, in terms of being able to electronically communicate, across Huawei gear, Huawei networks, would be risky at best."" This is a matter that crosses political divides. Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also cautioned against allowing Huawei to be part of the UK's 5G networks. ""I think that the consequences could be dramatic,"" he said. ""I think there could be a real concern about the ability to fully share information because of the fear that the network that would undergird 5G in the UK, that there might be a vulnerability."" GCHQ's Dr Levy, however, played down such fears saying that efforts to digitally scramble communications meant that even if someone was able to intercept them, they would only get ""gobbledygook"". ""Anything sensitive from a company or government or defence is independently encrypted of the network,"" he explained. ""You don't trust the network to protect you, you protect yourself."" He added that despite finding vulnerabilities in some of Huawei's kit ""we don't believe the things we are reporting on is the result of Chinese state malfeasance"". For its part, Huawei says the Chinese government would never ask it to install backdoors or other vulnerabilities into its foreign clients' systems, and even if such a request were made it would refuse. Ryan Ding heads up Huawei's carrier business group, which is responsible for making and selling its mobile telecoms network kit And Mr Ding dismissed suggestions that this commitment would fall by the wayside if the US and China were to go to war. ""We have a country here that virtually uses no Huawei equipment and doesn't even know whether our 5G equipment is square or round, and yet it has been incessantly expressing security concerns over Huawei,"" he said. ""I don't want to speculate on whether they have other purposes with this kind of talk. I would rather focus the limited time that I have on making better products.""

'Ball in governmentâs court' on Brexit talks,"This video can not be played Starmer: ""We haven't seen change of Brexit position"" ""The ball is in the government's court"" when it comes to a way forward with Brexit, Labour's Sir Keir Starmer says. Talks between Labour and the government began last week, with Theresa May saying only a cross-party pact would see MPs agree a deal in Parliament. But the shadow Brexit secretary said Mrs May's team had ""not changed its position"" on her existing plan. The PM will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. Mrs May's spokesman said she was also making calls to other European leaders from Downing Street on Monday afternoon. She is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday, where EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans ahead of the UK's scheduled exit date - Friday at 23:00 BST. Meanwhile, peers are continuing to examine a bill brought by senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which aims to force the PM to request a Brexit extension rather than leave the EU without a deal. Live updates: Lords scrutinise Brexit bill Brexit explained in flowcharts A really simple guide to Brexit Brexit Basics: The customs union Despite communications over the weekend, there were no further talks with Labour scheduled for Monday. However, Sir Keir - who is part of Labour's negotiating team - added: ""I have no doubt things will develop today.""

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was leaving ""no stone unturned"" to try and resolve Brexit, while Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that all sides needed to be ""prepared to compromise"" to ""fulfil the primary objective"" of leaving the EU. But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told BBC's Radio 4's Today programme that talks between the parties had ""not been entirely productive"". Several Conservatives have also strongly criticised the move, with the former Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson using his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph,externalto warn that Tory MPs would not allow Mrs May to ""surrender"" to Mr Corbyn. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier,is in Dublin for talkswith the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.

""And I think members of the public want to see their politicians working together more often."" If no compromise can be reached with Labour, Mrs May has committed to putting a series of Brexit options to the Commons and being bound by the result. Sir Keir said the talks had been taking place ""in good faith"" and that ""both sides... have approached this in the spirit of trying to find a way forward"". But he added: ""At the moment we are waiting to see what the government is putting on the table as a proposal. ""All they have done so far is indicate various things but not to change the political declaration [the non-legally binding document setting out the UK's future relationship with the EU] so the ball is in the government's court. ""We need to see what they come back with and when we do we will take a collective position on that."" This video can not be played Labour would consider voting to revoke Article 50 to avoid no deal - shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is also a member of Labour's negotiating team, described the mood as ""positive and hopeful"" - but she told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the government's proposals ""have not been compliant with the definition of a customs union"", which is her party's key demand. That would allow tariff-free trade in goods with the EU but limit the UK from striking its own deals. Leaving the arrangement was a Conservative manifesto commitment. However, Solicitor General Robert Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that ""something approximating a customs arrangement or customs union"" was the most likely outcome of the talks. ""In this particular hung Parliament none of us can get perfection, we need to compromise,"" he added. Ms Long-Bailey also suggested Labour could be prepared to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 - the legal mechanism through which Brexit is taking place - if the UK was heading towards a no-deal scenario on Friday. This video can not be played Brexit: 'It's like the playground, really' Although 12 April remains, in law, the date the UK will leave the EU, Mrs May has already requested that be rescheduled until the end of June. BBC political correspondent Vicki Young said if EU leaders did not think she had a credible plan to get Parliament behind a deal, they might refuse or insist on a much lengthier extension to the Brexit process. This outcome is opposed by some Tory Brexiteers as it would mean the UK having to take part in European Parliamentary elections.

Minute's silence begins Clutha inquiry,"This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded Eyewitnesses have described hearing noises coming from a police helicopter before it crashed into the Clutha pub. The final seconds of the flight in Glasgow city centre on 29 November 2013 were described at the opening day of a hearing into the tragedy. Statements on behalf of six of the 10 victims were also read out after a minute's silence was observed. The Fatal Accident Inquiry heard from a number of people, including a taxi driver and pedestrians. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street. They were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. In his evidence, Ernest Docherty, 64, told the inquiry - which is being held in a temporary court at Hampden Park football ground - that the Police Scotland helicopter ""was like an old car trying to start but a thousand times louder"". The retired transport worker said the noise grew louder as it flew overhead, causing him to hunch in the street. (Top: left to right) David Traill; PC Kirsty Nelis; PC Tony Collins; Gary Arthur; Samuel McGhee (Bottom: left to right) Colin Gibson; Robert Jenkins; Mark O'Prey; John McGarrigle; Joe Cusker Andrew Bergen, 30, was walking along the river bank when he saw the helicopter flying normally. The solicitor added: ""It made what I can only describe as a spluttering noise."" Mr Bergen said the helicopter's tail dipped and pointed toward the ground. He went on: ""Simultaneously the lights went out and it seemed to me that the rotor stopped spinning. It was still turning but not under power."" Taxi driver Tariq Malik, 41, was having a cigarette in the car park of the Grand Mosque on the opposite side of the river Clyde, when he spotted the helicopter. He recalled it was a clear night and everything initially seemed normal until it suddenly lost power. He told the court: ""All I could hear was a swooshing sound as it fell through the sky."" Christopher Jarvie, 36, described a ""stuttering noise"" while Brian Stewart, 50, said the sound from the helicopter was similar to a car stalling. Another witness, Craig Welsh, 42, talked of hearing a ""whining sound and then there were two distinct thuds"". The police helicopter crashed into The Clutha roof on 29 November 2013 Earlier, statements from six of the families of those killed were read out by their legal representatives. Testimonies came from the families of Mr McGhee, Mr Arthur, Mr Jenkins, Mr Gibson, Mr McGarrigle and Mr O'Prey. No statement was provided by relatives of Mr Cusker or the pilot and his two crew. Mr McGhee's daughter Kerry told how her father was born and bred in Castlemilk. The bus driver had to take early retirement to care for his partner, who died of cancer in 2007. She wrote: ""He was a good friend, neighbour and a sad loss to our close-knit community."" Colin Gibson was celebrating a friend's birthday on the night of the tragedy. He had never been in the bar before. In a statement, his family said: ""We will never know what he would have went on to achieve. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.""

He thanked the hearing for the minute's silence, but said added: ""After five and a half years of silence from the Crown Office it is of no consequence to me personally."" Mary Kavanagh's partner, 61-year-old Robert Jenkins, was the oldest to die. Donald Findlay QC read out a statement on behalf of Ms Kavanagh, which said the father-of-two had many friends and was a keen football fan who would have loved to work at the Scottish Football Museum, based at Hampden Park. He said: ""Mary finds it very ironic that the FAI is taking place at a venue that Robert held in such high esteem."" Mary Kavanagh last saw her partner, Robert Jenkins, when he went to the bar to buy her a drink The couple were in The Clutha on the night of the disaster. She last saw Mr Jenkins as he went to the bar to buy her a cranberry juice. Mr Findlay concluded: ""All Mary wants to know is why she went into the bar with the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with and came out alone."" Follow the BBC's Paul O'Hare who is tweeting from the inquiry,external Clutha survivor: 'Going back to pub helped my recovery' Date announced for Clutha helicopter crash inquiry Clutha families 'punished again' over FAI The sisters of Gary Arthur described him as a ""joker"" and a ""loveable rogue"", and said the disaster had robbed him of so much. Their statement concluded: ""Nothing will ever bring our brother back, but hopefully we will be given the chance to have closure over the last five years and remember Gary as a much loved person and not just a victim from The Clutha."" John McGarrigle's son, John, described his father as his ""hero"". The court heard he was a writer and a Clutha regular who always used to sit in the same seat. The statement said: ""His talent was immense and his take on things was wry and humorous."" More than 100 people were in the bar when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof at 22:22. As well as the 10 who died, 31 people were injured. The Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, had been returning to its base on the banks of the River Clyde. The inquiry will not sit every day and is expected to hear about three months' worth of evidence between now and August. The first four weeks will involve eyewitnesses and representatives of the the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and Airbus. In October 2015 areport from the AAIBconcluded the pilot did not follow emergency protocol and flew on despite low fuel warnings. It also found fuel transfer pumps were turned off and a controlled landing was not achieved for ""unknown reasons"".

Jury dismissed in Barclays fraud trial,"Former chief executive of Barclays, John Varley The jury in the fraud trial against four former Barclays bankers - including the former chief executive, John Varley - has been discharged. The case dated back to the financial crisis, when the bank raised billions of pounds from Middle East investors. The others charged were investment banker Roger Jenkins, head of wealth management Thomas Kalaris and Richard Boath, former head of Barclays' European Financial Institutions Group. The four denied the charges. Reporting restrictions are in place. All four were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to Barclays' June 2008 capital-raising. Mr Varley and Mr Jenkins were charged with a second count of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to Barclays' October 2008 capital-raising. The high-profile case, the first jury trial involving such senior bankers, took place at Southwark Crown Court before the jury was dismissed on Monday.

ATM stolen from Dungiven filling station,"The robbery took place at O'Kane's Filling Station just outside Dungiven Thieves have used a digger to steal a cash machine from a shop in County Londonderry. The incident at a shop outside Dungiven happened at about 04:30 BST on Sunday. According to the garage owners, CCTV revealed the raid, carried out by men in balaclavas, lasted just over four minutes. It is the latest in a series of ATM thefts on both sides of the Irish border, with the PSNI saying it was the eighth such incident in 2019. The digger was stolen from a building site further down the road before being driven to the garage. The owner of the garage said the CCTV footage showed thieves lowering the cash machine into a Citroen Berlingo car which had its roof cut off and driving away, with the machine protruding out of the top of the vehicle. Last week, there were two separate incidents of cash machine thefts - one outside a shop in County Antrim and thethe wall of a bank in County Monaghan in the Irish Republic. Police warned there could beseveral gangs involved in the theft of cash machines in Northern Ireland. Shop owner Martin O'Kane said: ""There are going to be less and less ATMs about now because of these attacks. There is one basically happening every week now. ""I probably won't get another cash machine in again, and that will be the local community losing out."" Police have appealed for anyone with information on the Dungiven incident to come forward. Det Insp Richard Thornton said a digger taken from a site close to the shop had been used to rip the machine from the wall. ""On this occasion, the digger was not set alight and was located at the scene."" He added: ""As in all of these ATM thefts, the actions of these criminals have not only caused immediate financial harm to the business targeted, but they have understandably caused fear in the community and impacted upon a vital service many local people rely on,"" he said. ""We are doing all we can to catch the people responsible - it is a key priority for us - however, I want to reiterate that the key to stopping these crimes and getting ahead of these criminals is information from the public. In March, the PSNI announced the creation of anew team of detectives to investigate cash machine thefts, following an upsurge in the number of built-in cash machines being ripped from the walls of commercial properties by plant machinery. One customer at the garage on Sunday told BBC News NI the theft of the cash machine was a big loss, especially following closures of banks in the area.

8 things we learned at the Olivier Awards,"Beverley Knight opened the ceremony and performed again during the In Memoriam section Often at the Olivier Awards, a box office smash like Hamilton or Harry Potter will sweep the board. But it was a different story this year, with several shows sharing the top prizes. Come From Away, The Inheritance and Company each took home four trophies at Sunday night's ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall. Company wins big at Olivier Awards Summer and Smoke, Caroline or Change, All About Eve and Tina: The Musical were also recognised at the event. Here are eight things we learned - including the best acceptance speeches, jokes, and backstage quotes. Host Jason Manford may not be a West End star by trade - but he certainly embraced the theatrical theme with an impressive opening musical performance. Manford has fronted the Oliviers once before, in 2017. His best gags this year included: ""A wonderful performance there from The King And I. Or, if you went to a normal school, Me And The King."" ""In my experience, theatre ushers are the greatest actors in the West End. How they manage to keep a straight face when charging Â£35 for two drinks, a programme and a packet of Revels is beyond me."" ""Between me and Sally Field, we've won two Oscars, a Golden Globe, and a Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year Award."" ""When the Royal Albert Hall was first built in 1871, it had an 8,000-seater capacity. Today, it's 5,400. And if that doesn't tell you that people in this country have been getting fatter over the last 100 years, nothing will."" Patsy Ferran (left) with Summer and Smoke director Rebecca Frecknall Ferran won best actress for her role in a revival of the Tennessee Williams play Summer and Smoke - a part which required her to learn a huge amount of dialogue. She also had to master the accent of the play's Mississippi-born lead character Alma. ""I'm not good at all accents, but I think I find the American accent quite easy because we hear it a lot,"" Ferran tells BBC News backstage. At 30 years old, the actress is of the generation who grew up with the hugely popular sitcom Friends, which she says may have helped her not just with the US accent, but acting techniques in general. ""I genuinely will say this, any comic timing that I might have, I learned from that show, 100%"" she says. Kelsey Grammer presented the best new play award to writer Matthew Lopez ""I have to thank my husband Brandon, who read more drafts of this play than anybody else,"" said The Inheritance writer Matthew Lopez as he accepted the award for best new play. Which left us wondering just how many drafts of the two-part play he wrote. ""To various degrees, whether big changes or small, I have probably over 200 drafts of each play in my hard drive,"" he explains after his speech. In a world of smartphones and short attention spans, we ask, did he ever worry about whether audiences could stomach a seven-hour play? ""We did wonder that, actually. We were sort of curious as to whether or not they were going to stay with us,"" Lopez says. ""That's one of the reasons there are two intervals in each play. ""I don't think we engineered it that way, but we realised we had essentially made a Netflix series on stage. And so we thought, 'hey, we're gonna go with it'."" Sharon D Clarke also performed during the ceremony Clarke took home the best actress in a musical prize for her leading role in Caroline or Change. She also was responsible for one of the night's best acceptance speeches - where she balanced being funny and entertaining with a touching tribute to her parents. ""For my mum and dad who are no longer with usâ¦ mummy god bless you,"" she said from the stage. ""Caroline's strength, dignity and love comes from my mum,"" she added, before dedicating the trophy ""to every mother who is out there doing the best for her child"". Jade Anouka (left) and Art Malik (right) presented Monica Dolan with her trophy Monica Dolan took home the prize for best supporting actress for her role in All About Eve, in which she starred alongside Gillian Anderson and Lily James. But TV audiences might know her better for roles like Rose West in Appropriate Adult and the BBC press officer Tracey Pritchard in W1A (""I'm not being funny or anything..."") What would Tracey make of her win at the Oliviers? ""I think she'd be pleased for me, but that wouldn't last very long,"" laughs Dolan of her usually-panicking alter-ego. ""She'd be thinking of the best statement to put out to the press straightaway, and if she was here she'd be managing me and pushing me along to the next journalist, but in a very amenable way. ""And if there were any crises she'd deal with them straight away as only she can."" LuPone may have won best supporting actress on Sunday, but surely a far more significant milestone for her this week wasdeciding to join Twitter,external. ""Ha! Yes, Staci Levine convinced me to join Twitter,"" the actress explains, referring to the theatre producer she's worked with several times. But despite attracting 18,000 followers in her first week, LuPone has yet to follow anyone back. Is she planning to change that anytime soon? ""Don't know yet! But I'm enjoying it, I'm having fun,"" she says, before promptly tweeting a picture of her Olivier Award from her new account. The double Tony-winning actress adds she plans to keep her Olivier trophy in her husband's ""man cave"". ""Tony's in there, now Larry is going to be in there too!"" she laughs. Incredibly, the young actor landed the role that won him this year's Olivier for best supporting actor shortly after leaving drama school. Walley starred opposite Aidan Turner last year in The Lieutenant of Inishmore - a play by Three Billboards writer Martin McDonagh. Is this setting a dangerously high standard for the rest of his career? ""I probably have peaked! Maybe I'll just retire now, never do a play again - one hit wonder,"" he joked backstage. ""I feel so lucky to have gotten this. I can't imagine I'll be in this position again so I'm going to cherish this, I'm just so grateful."" Dyer rubbed shoulders with Tom Hiddleston and Zawe Ashton backstage You could easily have missed this because he's tried to keep it on the down-low, but EastEnders actor Danny Dyer is part of a Royal blood-line. The star found out he was related to Edward III in 2016 after taking part in the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? Manford referred to this early in the show, joking that the ""Regal presence"" at the Royal Albert Hall was Dyer rather than the Duchess of Cornwall. When he took to the stage later in the night to present an award, Dyer took the opportunity to say hello to her as well. ""Shout out to the Duchess up there,"" he shouted. ""No Charlie tonight I see. I'll pop up and see you later."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Labour hopes for No 10 talks on Brexit,"This video can not be played Starmer: ""We haven't seen change of Brexit position"" ""The ball is in the government's court"" when it comes to a way forward with Brexit, Labour's Sir Keir Starmer says. Talks between Labour and the government began last week, with Theresa May saying only a cross-party pact would see MPs agree a deal in Parliament. But the shadow Brexit secretary said Mrs May's team had ""not changed its position"" on her existing plan. The PM will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. Mrs May's spokesman said she was also making calls to other European leaders from Downing Street on Monday afternoon. She is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday, where EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans ahead of the UK's scheduled exit date - Friday at 23:00 BST. Meanwhile, peers are continuing to examine a bill brought by senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which aims to force the PM to request a Brexit extension rather than leave the EU without a deal. Live updates: Lords scrutinise Brexit bill Brexit explained in flowcharts A really simple guide to Brexit Brexit Basics: The customs union Despite communications over the weekend, there were no further talks with Labour scheduled for Monday. However, Sir Keir - who is part of Labour's negotiating team - added: ""I have no doubt things will develop today."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the party was now ""expecting [an] updated proposal"" from the government, and more formal talks could take place this afternoon. Allow Twitter content?

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was leaving ""no stone unturned"" to try and resolve Brexit, while Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that all sides needed to be ""prepared to compromise"" to ""fulfil the primary objective"" of leaving the EU. But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told BBC's Radio 4's Today programme that talks between the parties had ""not been entirely productive"". Several Conservatives have also strongly criticised the move, with the former Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson using his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph,externalto warn that Tory MPs would not allow Mrs May to ""surrender"" to Mr Corbyn. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier,is in Dublin for talkswith the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The pair are expected to discuss developments in London, as well as ongoing planning for a possible no-deal scenario. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button On Sunday, Mrs Maytweeted,externala video message, explaining her decision to negotiate with Labour, saying: ""People didn't vote on party lines when it came to the Brexit referendum. ""And I think members of the public want to see their politicians working together more often."" If no compromise can be reached with Labour, Mrs May has committed to putting a series of Brexit options to the Commons and being bound by the result. Sir Keir said the talks had been taking place ""in good faith"" and that ""both sides... have approached this in the spirit of trying to find a way forward"". But he added: ""At the moment we are waiting to see what the government is putting on the table as a proposal. ""All they have done so far is indicate various things but not to change the political declaration [the non-legally binding document setting out the UK's future relationship with the EU] so the ball is in the government's court. ""We need to see what they come back with and when we do we will take a collective position on that."" This video can not be played Labour would consider voting to revoke Article 50 to avoid no deal - shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is also a member of Labour's negotiating team, described the mood as ""positive and hopeful"" - but she told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the government's proposals ""have not been compliant with the definition of a customs union"", which is her party's key demand. That would allow tariff-free trade in goods with the EU but limit the UK from striking its own deals. Leaving the arrangement was a Conservative manifesto commitment. However, Solicitor General Robert Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that ""something approximating a customs arrangement or customs union"" was the most likely outcome of the talks. ""In this particular hung Parliament none of us can get perfection, we need to compromise,"" he added. Ms Long-Bailey also suggested Labour could be prepared to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 - the legal mechanism through which Brexit is taking place - if the UK was heading towards a no-deal scenario on Friday. This video can not be played Brexit: 'It's like the playground, really' Although 12 April remains, in law, the date the UK will leave the EU, Mrs May has already requested that be rescheduled until the end of June. BBC political correspondent Vicki Young said if EU leaders did not think she had a credible plan to get Parliament behind a deal, they might refuse or insist on a much lengthier extension to the Brexit process. This outcome is opposed by some Tory Brexiteers as it would mean the UK having to take part in European Parliamentary elections. Monday:Possible resumption of talks between the government and Labour; House of Lords to examine bill proposed by Labour's Yvette Cooper aimed at extending Article 50 Brexit process Wednesday: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider UK request for further extension until 30 June, with the option of an earlier Brexit day if a deal can be agreed Friday:Brexit day, if UK is not granted a further delay Are you putting any important plans or decisions on hold due to Brexit negotiations?

Minute's silence begins Clutha inquiryTen people died when a police helicopter crashed into the roof of The Clutha bar in Glasgow on 29 November 2013.Glasgow & West Scotland,"This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded Eyewitnesses have described hearing noises coming from a police helicopter before it crashed into the Clutha pub. The final seconds of the flight in Glasgow city centre on 29 November 2013 were described at the opening day of a hearing into the tragedy. Statements on behalf of six of the 10 victims were also read out after a minute's silence was observed. The Fatal Accident Inquiry heard from a number of people, including a taxi driver and pedestrians. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street. They were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. In his evidence, Ernest Docherty, 64, told the inquiry - which is being held in a temporary court at Hampden Park football ground - that the Police Scotland helicopter ""was like an old car trying to start but a thousand times louder"". The retired transport worker said the noise grew louder as it flew overhead, causing him to hunch in the street. (Top: left to right) David Traill; PC Kirsty Nelis; PC Tony Collins; Gary Arthur; Samuel McGhee (Bottom: left to right) Colin Gibson; Robert Jenkins; Mark O'Prey; John McGarrigle; Joe Cusker Andrew Bergen, 30, was walking along the river bank when he saw the helicopter flying normally. The solicitor added: ""It made what I can only describe as a spluttering noise."" Mr Bergen said the helicopter's tail dipped and pointed toward the ground. He went on: ""Simultaneously the lights went out and it seemed to me that the rotor stopped spinning. It was still turning but not under power."" Taxi driver Tariq Malik, 41, was having a cigarette in the car park of the Grand Mosque on the opposite side of the river Clyde, when he spotted the helicopter. He recalled it was a clear night and everything initially seemed normal until it suddenly lost power. He told the court: ""All I could hear was a swooshing sound as it fell through the sky."" Christopher Jarvie, 36, described a ""stuttering noise"" while Brian Stewart, 50, said the sound from the helicopter was similar to a car stalling. Another witness, Craig Welsh, 42, talked of hearing a ""whining sound and then there were two distinct thuds"". The police helicopter crashed into The Clutha roof on 29 November 2013 Earlier, statements from six of the families of those killed were read out by their legal representatives. Testimonies came from the families of Mr McGhee, Mr Arthur, Mr Jenkins, Mr Gibson, Mr McGarrigle and Mr O'Prey. No statement was provided by relatives of Mr Cusker or the pilot and his two crew. Mr McGhee's daughter Kerry told how her father was born and bred in Castlemilk. The bus driver had to take early retirement to care for his partner, who died of cancer in 2007. She wrote: ""He was a good friend, neighbour and a sad loss to our close-knit community."" Colin Gibson was celebrating a friend's birthday on the night of the tragedy. He had never been in the bar before. In a statement, his family said: ""We will never know what he would have went on to achieve. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time."" This video can not be played Families of Clutha victims on fatal accident inquiry Mark O'Prey's father, Ian, said his ""wonderful son"" had ""many virtues"" and ""loved life and lived it to the full"". He thanked the hearing for the minute's silence, but said added: ""After five and a half years of silence from the Crown Office it is of no consequence to me personally."" Mary Kavanagh's partner, 61-year-old Robert Jenkins, was the oldest to die. Donald Findlay QC read out a statement on behalf of Ms Kavanagh, which said the father-of-two had many friends and was a keen football fan who would have loved to work at the Scottish Football Museum, based at Hampden Park. He said: ""Mary finds it very ironic that the FAI is taking place at a venue that Robert held in such high esteem."" Mary Kavanagh last saw her partner, Robert Jenkins, when he went to the bar to buy her a drink The couple were in The Clutha on the night of the disaster. She last saw Mr Jenkins as he went to the bar to buy her a cranberry juice. Mr Findlay concluded: ""All Mary wants to know is why she went into the bar with the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with and came out alone."" Follow the BBC's Paul O'Hare who is tweeting from the inquiry,external Clutha survivor: 'Going back to pub helped my recovery' Date announced for Clutha helicopter crash inquiry Clutha families 'punished again' over FAI The sisters of Gary Arthur described him as a ""joker"" and a ""loveable rogue"", and said the disaster had robbed him of so much. Their statement concluded: ""Nothing will ever bring our brother back, but hopefully we will be given the chance to have closure over the last five years and remember Gary as a much loved person and not just a victim from The Clutha."" John McGarrigle's son, John, described his father as his ""hero"". The court heard he was a writer and a Clutha regular who always used to sit in the same seat. The statement said: ""His talent was immense and his take on things was wry and humorous."" More than 100 people were in the bar when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof at 22:22. As well as the 10 who died, 31 people were injured. The Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, had been returning to its base on the banks of the River Clyde. The inquiry will not sit every day and is expected to hear about three months' worth of evidence between now and August. The first four weeks will involve eyewitnesses and representatives of the the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and Airbus. In October 2015 areport from the AAIBconcluded the pilot did not follow emergency protocol and flew on despite low fuel warnings. It also found fuel transfer pumps were turned off and a controlled landing was not achieved for ""unknown reasons"".

HPV vaccine now on offer to NI boys,"This video can not be played Cancer-preventing vaccine extended to boys Two new health initiatives are set to be rolled out in the fight against cancer. Boys aged 12-13 in Northern Ireland are to be offered a vaccine to protect them against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-related cancers. A better bowel cancer detection test is also being introduced. They are significant announcements for public health asthey bring Northern Ireland into linewith the rest of the UK. From September the HPV vaccine will be offered to all boys in year nine at school. It is hoped the immunisation programme will help reduce diagnoses of HPV-related cancers and save lives. It has also been decided that the Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) will replace the Faecal Occult Blood (FOB) test as the primary screening test for bowel cancer in the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) in Northern Ireland. Having HPV 'isn't rude or shameful' HPV vaccine linked to 'dramatic' drop in cervical disease Would you know if you had HPV? This however will not begin until early 2020. Department of Health permanent secretary Richard Pengelly said health protection clearly benefits the public. ""Both decisions have been under active consideration for some time and can now be made, following confirmation of the department's budget allocation for this year,"" he said. A very high proportion of all women under 25 have already taken up the opportunity to be vaccinated against the HPV virus since the programme was first introduced in 2008 and the intention is to protect boys through similar uptake rates. HPV is the name given to a common group of viruses; there are more than 100 types of HPV Many women will be with infected with HPV over the course of their lifetime without any ill-effect In the vast majority of cases, there will be no symptoms and the infection will clear on its own, but in some cases persistent infection can lead to cervical disease Some types of HPV are high risk because they are linked to the development of some cancers Nearly all cervical cancers (99.7%) are caused by infection from a high risk HPV Many types of HPV affect the mouth, throat or genital area. They're easy to catch - you can get HPV from sexual contact. Source:NHS Choices,external This extended programme offers the opportunity to make some HPV-related diseases and cancers a thing of the past building on the success of the programme in girls. The prevalence of the main HPV cancer-causing types 16 and 18 has already been reduced by more than 80%. Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride, said: ""We can now look forward to a future where we can be even more confident that we will reduce cervical cancer and other HPV related cancers that affect both men and women. ""This is an effective vaccine against a particularly harmful virus. I would encourage all parents to take up this offer and ensure their boys and girls are vaccinated."" The new FIT bowel screening test will be introduced from early 2020. While cancer charities welcome the move it had been hoped that it could have been introduced sooner. Self-testing kit 'saved my life' Jeremy Bowen diagnosed with bowel cancer Evidence has shown there is increased patient acceptability of the FIT screening test and increased uptake of screening will mean even more lives can be saved. Every year in Northern Ireland there are about 1,100 new cases of bowel cancer, with more than 400 deaths. The BCSP aims to pick up bowel cancer at an early stage, when treatment can be 90% successful. bleeding from your bottom and/or blood in your poo a persistent and unexplained change in bowel habit unexplained weight loss extreme tiredness for no obvious reason a pain or lump in your tummy ""The existing test for bowel cancer has proved hugely valuable in detecting cancer early and it is therefore essential that people invited to participate in the Northern Ireland Bowel Screening programme from 60-74 continue to complete it,"" Dr McBride said. Extending the HPV vaccination programme to include adolescent boys is based on advice from the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), an independent panel of experts that provides advice to the four UK Health Departments. In January 2016, the UK National Screening Committee recommended that quantitative Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) should be adopted by the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) as the primary screening test for bowel cancer.

Clutha helicopter inquiry set to begin,"This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded Eyewitnesses have described hearing noises coming from a police helicopter before it crashed into the Clutha pub. The final seconds of the flight in Glasgow city centre on 29 November 2013 were described at the opening day of a hearing into the tragedy. Statements on behalf of six of the 10 victims were also read out after a minute's silence was observed. The Fatal Accident Inquiry heard from a number of people, including a taxi driver and pedestrians. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street. They were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. In his evidence, Ernest Docherty, 64, told the inquiry - which is being held in a temporary court at Hampden Park football ground - that the Police Scotland helicopter ""was like an old car trying to start but a thousand times louder"". The retired transport worker said the noise grew louder as it flew overhead, causing him to hunch in the street. (Top: left to right) David Traill; PC Kirsty Nelis; PC Tony Collins; Gary Arthur; Samuel McGhee (Bottom: left to right) Colin Gibson; Robert Jenkins; Mark O'Prey; John McGarrigle; Joe Cusker Andrew Bergen, 30, was walking along the river bank when he saw the helicopter flying normally. The solicitor added: ""It made what I can only describe as a spluttering noise."" Mr Bergen said the helicopter's tail dipped and pointed toward the ground. He went on: ""Simultaneously the lights went out and it seemed to me that the rotor stopped spinning. It was still turning but not under power."" Taxi driver Tariq Malik, 41, was having a cigarette in the car park of the Grand Mosque on the opposite side of the river Clyde, when he spotted the helicopter. He recalled it was a clear night and everything initially seemed normal until it suddenly lost power. He told the court: ""All I could hear was a swooshing sound as it fell through the sky."" Christopher Jarvie, 36, described a ""stuttering noise"" while Brian Stewart, 50, said the sound from the helicopter was similar to a car stalling. Another witness, Craig Welsh, 42, talked of hearing a ""whining sound and then there were two distinct thuds"". The police helicopter crashed into The Clutha roof on 29 November 2013 Earlier, statements from six of the families of those killed were read out by their legal representatives. Testimonies came from the families of Mr McGhee, Mr Arthur, Mr Jenkins, Mr Gibson, Mr McGarrigle and Mr O'Prey. No statement was provided by relatives of Mr Cusker or the pilot and his two crew. Mr McGhee's daughter Kerry told how her father was born and bred in Castlemilk. The bus driver had to take early retirement to care for his partner, who died of cancer in 2007. She wrote: ""He was a good friend, neighbour and a sad loss to our close-knit community."" Colin Gibson was celebrating a friend's birthday on the night of the tragedy. He had never been in the bar before. In a statement, his family said: ""We will never know what he would have went on to achieve. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.""

He thanked the hearing for the minute's silence, but said added: ""After five and a half years of silence from the Crown Office it is of no consequence to me personally."" Mary Kavanagh's partner, 61-year-old Robert Jenkins, was the oldest to die. Donald Findlay QC read out a statement on behalf of Ms Kavanagh, which said the father-of-two had many friends and was a keen football fan who would have loved to work at the Scottish Football Museum, based at Hampden Park. He said: ""Mary finds it very ironic that the FAI is taking place at a venue that Robert held in such high esteem."" Mary Kavanagh last saw her partner, Robert Jenkins, when he went to the bar to buy her a drink The couple were in The Clutha on the night of the disaster. She last saw Mr Jenkins as he went to the bar to buy her a cranberry juice. Mr Findlay concluded: ""All Mary wants to know is why she went into the bar with the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with and came out alone.""

Their statement concluded: ""Nothing will ever bring our brother back, but hopefully we will be given the chance to have closure over the last five years and remember Gary as a much loved person and not just a victim from The Clutha."" John McGarrigle's son, John, described his father as his ""hero"". The court heard he was a writer and a Clutha regular who always used to sit in the same seat. The statement said: ""His talent was immense and his take on things was wry and humorous."" More than 100 people were in the bar when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof at 22:22. As well as the 10 who died, 31 people were injured. The Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, had been returning to its base on the banks of the River Clyde.

Labour expects more No 10 talks on Brexit,"This video can not be played Starmer: ""We haven't seen change of Brexit position"" ""The ball is in the government's court"" when it comes to a way forward with Brexit, Labour's Sir Keir Starmer says. Talks between Labour and the government began last week, with Theresa May saying only a cross-party pact would see MPs agree a deal in Parliament. But the shadow Brexit secretary said Mrs May's team had ""not changed its position"" on her existing plan. The PM will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. Mrs May's spokesman said she was also making calls to other European leaders from Downing Street on Monday afternoon. She is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday, where EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans ahead of the UK's scheduled exit date - Friday at 23:00 BST. Meanwhile, peers are continuing to examine a bill brought by senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which aims to force the PM to request a Brexit extension rather than leave the EU without a deal. Live updates: Lords scrutinise Brexit bill Brexit explained in flowcharts A really simple guide to Brexit Brexit Basics: The customs union Despite communications over the weekend, there were no further talks with Labour scheduled for Monday. However, Sir Keir - who is part of Labour's negotiating team - added: ""I have no doubt things will develop today."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the party was now ""expecting [an] updated proposal"" from the government, and more formal talks could take place this afternoon. Allow Twitter content?

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was leaving ""no stone unturned"" to try and resolve Brexit, while Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that all sides needed to be ""prepared to compromise"" to ""fulfil the primary objective"" of leaving the EU. But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told BBC's Radio 4's Today programme that talks between the parties had ""not been entirely productive"". Several Conservatives have also strongly criticised the move, with the former Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson using his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph,externalto warn that Tory MPs would not allow Mrs May to ""surrender"" to Mr Corbyn. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier,is in Dublin for talkswith the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The pair are expected to discuss developments in London, as well as ongoing planning for a possible no-deal scenario.

""And I think members of the public want to see their politicians working together more often."" If no compromise can be reached with Labour, Mrs May has committed to putting a series of Brexit options to the Commons and being bound by the result. Sir Keir said the talks had been taking place ""in good faith"" and that ""both sides... have approached this in the spirit of trying to find a way forward"". But he added: ""At the moment we are waiting to see what the government is putting on the table as a proposal. ""All they have done so far is indicate various things but not to change the political declaration [the non-legally binding document setting out the UK's future relationship with the EU] so the ball is in the government's court. ""We need to see what they come back with and when we do we will take a collective position on that."" This video can not be played Labour would consider voting to revoke Article 50 to avoid no deal - shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is also a member of Labour's negotiating team, described the mood as ""positive and hopeful"" - but she told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the government's proposals ""have not been compliant with the definition of a customs union"", which is her party's key demand. That would allow tariff-free trade in goods with the EU but limit the UK from striking its own deals. Leaving the arrangement was a Conservative manifesto commitment. However, Solicitor General Robert Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that ""something approximating a customs arrangement or customs union"" was the most likely outcome of the talks. ""In this particular hung Parliament none of us can get perfection, we need to compromise,"" he added. Ms Long-Bailey also suggested Labour could be prepared to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 - the legal mechanism through which Brexit is taking place - if the UK was heading towards a no-deal scenario on Friday. This video can not be played Brexit: 'It's like the playground, really' Although 12 April remains, in law, the date the UK will leave the EU, Mrs May has already requested that be rescheduled until the end of June. BBC political correspondent Vicki Young said if EU leaders did not think she had a credible plan to get Parliament behind a deal, they might refuse or insist on a much lengthier extension to the Brexit process. This outcome is opposed by some Tory Brexiteers as it would mean the UK having to take part in European Parliamentary elections.

"8 things we learned at the Olivier AwardsThe best acceptance speeches, jokes and backstage quotes.Entertainment & Arts","Beverley Knight opened the ceremony and performed again during the In Memoriam section Often at the Olivier Awards, a box office smash like Hamilton or Harry Potter will sweep the board. But it was a different story this year, with several shows sharing the top prizes. Come From Away, The Inheritance and Company each took home four trophies at Sunday night's ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall. Company wins big at Olivier Awards Summer and Smoke, Caroline or Change, All About Eve and Tina: The Musical were also recognised at the event. Here are eight things we learned - including the best acceptance speeches, jokes, and backstage quotes. Host Jason Manford may not be a West End star by trade - but he certainly embraced the theatrical theme with an impressive opening musical performance. Manford has fronted the Oliviers once before, in 2017. His best gags this year included: ""A wonderful performance there from The King And I. Or, if you went to a normal school, Me And The King."" ""In my experience, theatre ushers are the greatest actors in the West End. How they manage to keep a straight face when charging Â£35 for two drinks, a programme and a packet of Revels is beyond me."" ""Between me and Sally Field, we've won two Oscars, a Golden Globe, and a Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year Award."" ""When the Royal Albert Hall was first built in 1871, it had an 8,000-seater capacity. Today, it's 5,400. And if that doesn't tell you that people in this country have been getting fatter over the last 100 years, nothing will."" Patsy Ferran (left) with Summer and Smoke director Rebecca Frecknall Ferran won best actress for her role in a revival of the Tennessee Williams play Summer and Smoke - a part which required her to learn a huge amount of dialogue. She also had to master the accent of the play's Mississippi-born lead character Alma. ""I'm not good at all accents, but I think I find the American accent quite easy because we hear it a lot,"" Ferran tells BBC News backstage. At 30 years old, the actress is of the generation who grew up with the hugely popular sitcom Friends, which she says may have helped her not just with the US accent, but acting techniques in general. ""I genuinely will say this, any comic timing that I might have, I learned from that show, 100%"" she says. Kelsey Grammer presented the best new play award to writer Matthew Lopez ""I have to thank my husband Brandon, who read more drafts of this play than anybody else,"" said The Inheritance writer Matthew Lopez as he accepted the award for best new play. Which left us wondering just how many drafts of the two-part play he wrote. ""To various degrees, whether big changes or small, I have probably over 200 drafts of each play in my hard drive,"" he explains after his speech. In a world of smartphones and short attention spans, we ask, did he ever worry about whether audiences could stomach a seven-hour play? ""We did wonder that, actually. We were sort of curious as to whether or not they were going to stay with us,"" Lopez says. ""That's one of the reasons there are two intervals in each play. ""I don't think we engineered it that way, but we realised we had essentially made a Netflix series on stage. And so we thought, 'hey, we're gonna go with it'."" Sharon D Clarke also performed during the ceremony Clarke took home the best actress in a musical prize for her leading role in Caroline or Change. She also was responsible for one of the night's best acceptance speeches - where she balanced being funny and entertaining with a touching tribute to her parents. ""For my mum and dad who are no longer with usâ¦ mummy god bless you,"" she said from the stage. ""Caroline's strength, dignity and love comes from my mum,"" she added, before dedicating the trophy ""to every mother who is out there doing the best for her child"". Jade Anouka (left) and Art Malik (right) presented Monica Dolan with her trophy Monica Dolan took home the prize for best supporting actress for her role in All About Eve, in which she starred alongside Gillian Anderson and Lily James. But TV audiences might know her better for roles like Rose West in Appropriate Adult and the BBC press officer Tracey Pritchard in W1A (""I'm not being funny or anything..."") What would Tracey make of her win at the Oliviers? ""I think she'd be pleased for me, but that wouldn't last very long,"" laughs Dolan of her usually-panicking alter-ego. ""She'd be thinking of the best statement to put out to the press straightaway, and if she was here she'd be managing me and pushing me along to the next journalist, but in a very amenable way. ""And if there were any crises she'd deal with them straight away as only she can."" LuPone may have won best supporting actress on Sunday, but surely a far more significant milestone for her this week wasdeciding to join Twitter,external. ""Ha! Yes, Staci Levine convinced me to join Twitter,"" the actress explains, referring to the theatre producer she's worked with several times. But despite attracting 18,000 followers in her first week, LuPone has yet to follow anyone back. Is she planning to change that anytime soon? ""Don't know yet! But I'm enjoying it, I'm having fun,"" she says, before promptly tweeting a picture of her Olivier Award from her new account. The double Tony-winning actress adds she plans to keep her Olivier trophy in her husband's ""man cave"". ""Tony's in there, now Larry is going to be in there too!"" she laughs. Incredibly, the young actor landed the role that won him this year's Olivier for best supporting actor shortly after leaving drama school. Walley starred opposite Aidan Turner last year in The Lieutenant of Inishmore - a play by Three Billboards writer Martin McDonagh. Is this setting a dangerously high standard for the rest of his career? ""I probably have peaked! Maybe I'll just retire now, never do a play again - one hit wonder,"" he joked backstage. ""I feel so lucky to have gotten this. I can't imagine I'll be in this position again so I'm going to cherish this, I'm just so grateful."" Dyer rubbed shoulders with Tom Hiddleston and Zawe Ashton backstage You could easily have missed this because he's tried to keep it on the down-low, but EastEnders actor Danny Dyer is part of a Royal blood-line. The star found out he was related to Edward III in 2016 after taking part in the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? Manford referred to this early in the show, joking that the ""Regal presence"" at the Royal Albert Hall was Dyer rather than the Duchess of Cornwall. When he took to the stage later in the night to present an award, Dyer took the opportunity to say hello to her as well. ""Shout out to the Duchess up there,"" he shouted. ""No Charlie tonight I see. I'll pop up and see you later."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

""When the world was in turmoil, this tiny town in Gander didn't question anything,"" John Brant told BBC News backstage. ""Their initial response was 'these people are in trouble and we need to help them, and I think that means a lot right now. I think audiences are being pulled towards a story which as about kindness, love and compassion.""

Clutha helicopter inquiry set to open,"This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded Eyewitnesses have described hearing noises coming from a police helicopter before it crashed into the Clutha pub. The final seconds of the flight in Glasgow city centre on 29 November 2013 were described at the opening day of a hearing into the tragedy. Statements on behalf of six of the 10 victims were also read out after a minute's silence was observed. The Fatal Accident Inquiry heard from a number of people, including a taxi driver and pedestrians. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street. They were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. In his evidence, Ernest Docherty, 64, told the inquiry - which is being held in a temporary court at Hampden Park football ground - that the Police Scotland helicopter ""was like an old car trying to start but a thousand times louder"". The retired transport worker said the noise grew louder as it flew overhead, causing him to hunch in the street. (Top: left to right) David Traill; PC Kirsty Nelis; PC Tony Collins; Gary Arthur; Samuel McGhee (Bottom: left to right) Colin Gibson; Robert Jenkins; Mark O'Prey; John McGarrigle; Joe Cusker Andrew Bergen, 30, was walking along the river bank when he saw the helicopter flying normally. The solicitor added: ""It made what I can only describe as a spluttering noise."" Mr Bergen said the helicopter's tail dipped and pointed toward the ground. He went on: ""Simultaneously the lights went out and it seemed to me that the rotor stopped spinning. It was still turning but not under power."" Taxi driver Tariq Malik, 41, was having a cigarette in the car park of the Grand Mosque on the opposite side of the river Clyde, when he spotted the helicopter. He recalled it was a clear night and everything initially seemed normal until it suddenly lost power. He told the court: ""All I could hear was a swooshing sound as it fell through the sky."" Christopher Jarvie, 36, described a ""stuttering noise"" while Brian Stewart, 50, said the sound from the helicopter was similar to a car stalling. Another witness, Craig Welsh, 42, talked of hearing a ""whining sound and then there were two distinct thuds"". The police helicopter crashed into The Clutha roof on 29 November 2013 Earlier, statements from six of the families of those killed were read out by their legal representatives. Testimonies came from the families of Mr McGhee, Mr Arthur, Mr Jenkins, Mr Gibson, Mr McGarrigle and Mr O'Prey. No statement was provided by relatives of Mr Cusker or the pilot and his two crew. Mr McGhee's daughter Kerry told how her father was born and bred in Castlemilk. The bus driver had to take early retirement to care for his partner, who died of cancer in 2007. She wrote: ""He was a good friend, neighbour and a sad loss to our close-knit community."" Colin Gibson was celebrating a friend's birthday on the night of the tragedy. He had never been in the bar before. In a statement, his family said: ""We will never know what he would have went on to achieve. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time."" This video can not be played Families of Clutha victims on fatal accident inquiry Mark O'Prey's father, Ian, said his ""wonderful son"" had ""many virtues"" and ""loved life and lived it to the full"". He thanked the hearing for the minute's silence, but said added: ""After five and a half years of silence from the Crown Office it is of no consequence to me personally."" Mary Kavanagh's partner, 61-year-old Robert Jenkins, was the oldest to die. Donald Findlay QC read out a statement on behalf of Ms Kavanagh, which said the father-of-two had many friends and was a keen football fan who would have loved to work at the Scottish Football Museum, based at Hampden Park. He said: ""Mary finds it very ironic that the FAI is taking place at a venue that Robert held in such high esteem."" Mary Kavanagh last saw her partner, Robert Jenkins, when he went to the bar to buy her a drink The couple were in The Clutha on the night of the disaster. She last saw Mr Jenkins as he went to the bar to buy her a cranberry juice. Mr Findlay concluded: ""All Mary wants to know is why she went into the bar with the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with and came out alone."" Follow the BBC's Paul O'Hare who is tweeting from the inquiry,external Clutha survivor: 'Going back to pub helped my recovery' Date announced for Clutha helicopter crash inquiry Clutha families 'punished again' over FAI The sisters of Gary Arthur described him as a ""joker"" and a ""loveable rogue"", and said the disaster had robbed him of so much. Their statement concluded: ""Nothing will ever bring our brother back, but hopefully we will be given the chance to have closure over the last five years and remember Gary as a much loved person and not just a victim from The Clutha."" John McGarrigle's son, John, described his father as his ""hero"". The court heard he was a writer and a Clutha regular who always used to sit in the same seat. The statement said: ""His talent was immense and his take on things was wry and humorous."" More than 100 people were in the bar when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof at 22:22. As well as the 10 who died, 31 people were injured. The Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, had been returning to its base on the banks of the River Clyde. The inquiry will not sit every day and is expected to hear about three months' worth of evidence between now and August. The first four weeks will involve eyewitnesses and representatives of the the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and Airbus. In October 2015 areport from the AAIBconcluded the pilot did not follow emergency protocol and flew on despite low fuel warnings. It also found fuel transfer pumps were turned off and a controlled landing was not achieved for ""unknown reasons"". And it recommended all police helicopters be equipped with black box flight recording equipment. Families have waited more than five years for an FAI to be held 29 November 2013: Police helicopter crashes on Clutha bar in Glasgow, killing 10 people. 9 December 2013: AAIB preliminary report finds there was 95 litres of fuel onboard the aircraft. 14 February 2014: AAIB special report finds both engines ""flamed out"". One of the fuel tanks was empty, while a second contained 0.4 litres. A third contained 75 litres, but transfer pumps to take this fuel to the other two engine tanks were switched off. 23 October 2015: AAIB final report finds main cause of accident to be mismanagement of the fuel system by the pilot. 24 November 2017: Fatal accident inquiry announced.
