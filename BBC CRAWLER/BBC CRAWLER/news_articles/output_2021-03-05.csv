Government relaxes more trade rules between GB and NI,"The UK government has announced unilateral moves to ease the trade in plants from GB to NI. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods, which includes following EU plant health rules. This has meant soil from other parts of the UK cannot legally enter NI, causing difficulties for garden centres. The government is now temporarily relaxing that rule. It means that bulbs or vegetables that have been grown in soil can be sent from GB to NI with soil attached. The move has been taken without the agreement of the EU whichhas already said it is preparing legal actionagainst the UK for changing the implementation of the NI Brexit deal without its agreement. Plants grown in soil can also be moved with soil attached, provided they are from an authorised business meeting GB plant passporting requirements for soil. The move has been taken without the agreement of the EU Traders can move used agricultural machinery without the need for a plant health certificate, providing they have been washed to remove excessive soil and plant debris. NI garden centres struggling to get plants from GB Some GB plant businesses stop sales to NI Garden centres to get 'grace period' after Brexit This means machinery can still be moved if small amounts of soil remain. The government said: ""These temporary, practical arrangements recognise the need to ensure biosecurity on the island of Ireland is not compromised whilst addressing barriers which stop goods moving into Northern Ireland."" EU Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said the UK still remained bound to take ""practical steps"" relating to the implementation of the NI Protocol. ""If people are talking about us trying to find agreement on prolonging the grace periods, which must be a joint decision in the context of the joint committee, then the UK also has to do its homework on those practical steps that it has to implement. ""It should have implemented some of them already some time ago. ""We are looking to the UK to respect and implement those commitments."" DUP Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons acknowledged the announcements to extend grace periods. He said he was sure it was ""a welcome breathing space for local businesses"". ""However, I will continue to press both the UK and EU for permanent solutions that ensure GB's agri-food business can trade unfettered with NI,"" he added. Shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said that the action did not take Northern Ireland ""a single step closer to any lasting solutions that ease the red tape the prime minister's deal created"". ""Ministers have a responsibility to secure lasting solutions that benefit Northern Ireland, and ensure stability,"" she added. ""Without trust that will be impossible, and that trust is being undermined."" Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard said the UK government had ""gone off on a further solo run"". ""This is another reckless and unnecessary move by the British government and, instead of providing the certainty required, only adds to the confusion,"" he said.

Fears grow for woman who vanished on walk home,"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" The disappearance of a woman who has not been heard from since Wednesday night is causing ""increasing concern"", police have said. Sarah Everard, 33, vanished as she walked home to Brixton, south London, from the Clapham Junction area. Ms Everard spoke to her partner en route but has not been heard from since that point, friend Rose Woollard said. She said her phone signal was picked up last near Clarence Avenue, between her home and where she left another friend. Friends, who last heard from the 33-year-old at about 21:30 GMT on the day she went missing, were unable to contact Ms Everard on Thursday and notified the police. She is 5ft 4in (162cm), has a slim build and blonde hair, and was wearing a green coat, dark trousers and trainers, her best friend Ms Woollard said. Allow Twitter content?

John McAfee charged with fraud over cryptocurrency,"Businessman John McAfee, creator of the McAfee anti-virus software, has been charged in the US with conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering. Mr McAfee and his bodyguard Jimmy Gale Watson Jr are accused of promoting cryptocurrencies to Mr McAfee's large Twitter following to inflate prices. The currencies were then allegedly sold, making the pair $2m (Â£1.45m), prosecutors said. The men have not commented on the charges. Mr McAfee, 75, is currently beingdetained in Spain in relation to separate criminal charges relating to tax, which he denies. He faces possible extradition to the US. Mr Watson was arrested in Texas on Thursday. ""Jimmy Watson is a decorated veteran and former Navy Seal. He fought for other people's rights and liberties, and he is entitled to and looks forward to his day in court to exercise some of those very rights,"" said his lawyer Arnold Spencer. The strange life of John McAfee The latestcharges were filed in the Manhattan federal court in New York,external. The pair are accused of buying the cryptocurrency assets before promoting them on Twitter, where Mr McAfee has more than one million followers. They would then sell the assets as soon as Mr McAfee's endorsements saw prices rise, according to the US justice department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They allegedly made a further $11m (Â£8m) in payments from cryptocurrency start-ups for promoting their assets on Twitter, payments which were not disclosed to investors who  bought them. This video can not be played How crypto-currencies work That amounted to having ""exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception,"" federal prosecutor Audrey Strauss said. In the separate tax evasion case - which was announced last October - Mr McAfee is accused of failing to file any tax returns from 2014 to 2018. Prosecutors also say he used other people's names to conceal his assets, including a yacht and property. A controversial figure, he came to prominence in the 1980s when his company released the first commercial anti-virus software - McAfee VirusScan - and helped spark a multi-billion dollar industry. Although that business has since been sold to Intel, he still develops cyber-security products of his own. The entrepreneur, who was born in the UK, also launched unsuccessful bids to become the Libertarian Party's candidate for the US presidential elections in 2016 and 2020. Mr McAfee has previously expressed his disdain for taxes, tweeting in 2019 that he had not filed tax returns for years because ""taxation is illegal"". In 2012, he made headlines afterpolice in the Central American country of Belize investigated the death of one Mr McAfee's neighboursand named him as a ""person of interest"". Mr McAfee left the country saying he feared for his own safety. Officials ultimately said he was not a suspect.

MoS must publish front page notice of Meghan win,"Meghan pictured during her and Prince Harry's royal tour of South Africa in 2019 The Mail on Sunday has been ordered to publish a front-page statement about the Duchess of Sussex winning her copyright claim against the newspaper. Meghan sued the paper for a copyright breach over the publication of a letter to her father and won most of her claim. A High Court judge ruled the MoS must print on its front page and page three that it infringed her copyright. The MailOnline must also publish the statement ""for a period of one week"". A spokesman for the Mail On Sunday said: ""We will be applying to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal, including in relation to aspects of the judgment today."" Meghan, 39, brought the legal action against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) - the publisher of both the MoS and MailOnline. It was over a handwritten letter to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018, parts of which were later published in news articles. Last month,she won her privacy claimand most of her copyright claim. The judge ruled the letter was ""personal and private"" and Meghan had a ""reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private"". The publisher's lawyers applied for permission to appeal earlier this week but Lord Justice Warby refused. In Friday's ruling,externalthe judge Lord Justice Warby said the MoS must print a single statement on the front page, referring readers to a further statement on page three. ""The defendant devoted a very considerable amount of space to the infringing articles, which it continued to publish for over two years,"" he said. ""It has devoted a very considerable number of further column inches, and many hundreds if not thousands of words, to coverage of earlier stages of this litigation and commentary upon them. ""The wording sought is modest by comparison and factual in nature."" The MailOnline must publish the statement for a week with a link to his full judgment. The judge also granted Meghan a declaration that ANL ""misused her private information and infringed her copyright"". Royal Family tree and line of succession Profile: Duchess of Sussex 'Liberating' to be able to speak - Meghan Although the judge found the publication of the letter infringed the duchess's copyright, there will still be a trial to decide whether Meghan is the exclusive owner of copyright in all parts of the letter, or whether any other person owns a share. There will also be further hearings to determine whether the duchess is entitled to any profits or financial remedies relating to her claim.

Mystery UK person with Brazil variant found,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock has shared details of how the missing P.1 variant case was tracked down A mystery person in the UK infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil has now been traced. Last week, it was announced that six cases of the P.1 variant had been found in the UK - but the identity of one of the cases was unknown. The person, who lives in Croydon, has been traced, as have their contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the person ""stayed at home"" and there was no sign of any onward transmission - but local testing is being rolled out. Scientistssay the variantappears to be more contagious and there are concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it. But Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said it hoped vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant. Will vaccines work against the new variants? Brazil variant 'may spread more easily' News that the Brazil variant had been found in the UKwas released last Sunday.Three cases were found in England, and separately three in Scotland. The three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London. Health officials have been trying to trace all the passengers who were on their flight from Heathrow to Aberdeen. In England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February. The third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - was unknown for several days after he or she failed to register their test properly. Dr Hopkins said the person was finally identified when they called the NHS 111 number, after officials had spent days contacting potential households. The person lived in a household that had recently returned from Brazil and all of them had quarantined at home, she added. Mr Hancock said contact-tracers had worked ""flat out"" to narrow the search. ""The best evidence is this person in question stayed at home and there's no sign that there's been any onward transmission but as a precaution we're putting more testing in in Croydon, where they live, to minimise risk of spread,"" he said. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Earlier this week, Mr Hancock said work was under way to tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of the new strains. Dr Hopkins said there was not yet data to show whether the vaccine was effective against this variant - but there was some data for the variant from South Africa ""and we expect that it should at least perform in a similar way"". ""And therefore we think that it's likely there may be some reduction in risk of transmission, or reducing the risk of transmission, but we at least hope at the moment that it will have a strong impact in reducing hospitalisations and deaths. ""We do need to wait for studies to come out from South America and in particular Brazil, and those will come but it will take weeks rather than days I'm afraid."" The variant has been designated ""of concern"" because it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa. One of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade some of the immunity people may have already built against Covid. Preliminary data from Manaus- the Brazilian city hit hard by this P.1 variant - suggested the variant could be up to twice as transmissible as earlier Covid. But experts said this should not be used to predict what might happen in the UK. One of the lead researchers said it was unlikely P.1 would quickly take off in Britain when only six cases had been identified and these were being closely monitored. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Meanwhile, two-fifths of all adults in the UK have now had their first dose of the vaccine, Mr Hancock also said at Friday's press conference. He said the fall in the number of deaths was accelerating - down 41% compared with last week - which suggested the vaccination programme was working. ""What this all shows is that the link from cases to hospitalisations and then to deaths that had been unbreakable before the vaccine - that link is now breaking,"" he said. Latest government figures,externalshow the total number of people who have had their first dose of vaccine has now reached 21,358,815, while the number who have had their second dose has topped one million. There have been another 5,947 cases announced and a further 236 people recorded as having died within 28 days of testing positive.

Hancock defends 1% NHS pay rise after strike threats,"The health secretary has defended a proposed 1% pay increase for NHS workers in England this year, amid a backlash from unions. Matt Hancock said the proposal was ""what we think is affordable"" given financial pressures caused by the Covid pandemic. He added staff had been exempted from the wider freeze on public sector pay to reward their ""incredible"" work. A nurses' union has set up a fund to prepare for possible strike action. And Unite - the third largest union in the NHS - said it is considering a strike ballot. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has called the recommended 1% pay rise ""pitiful"", arguing that its members should get 12.5% instead. It would have to hold a ballot before strikes could go ahead. Nurses prepare for strikes over 1% NHS pay rise How much will NHS staff be paid? Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Speaking at Friday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said the pay award reflected the ""difficult financial circumstances the country is in"". ""One of the challenges we've faced as a country is in terms of the financial consequences of the pandemic,"" he told reporters. ""We've proposed what we think is affordable to make sure in the NHS people do get a pay rise,"" he said. The health department recommended the 1% pay award to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. It would cover nearly all hospital staff, but not GPs and dentists. In addition, some staff whose pay band is being changed will get more than a 1% increase as a result of apreviously agreed three-year pay deal. The government says newly-qualified nurses got a 12% pay rise over the course of that three-year agreement. The lowest minimum full-time salary - for newly employed drivers, housekeeping assistants, nursery assistants and domestic support workers - is Â£18,005 per year The starting salary for most newly qualified nurses is Â£24,907 Staff in ""high-cost areas"", such as London, get extra payments In itssubmission,externalto the panel, officials at the department argued the 1% rise would strike the ""right balance between pay and staff numbers"". The panel is due make its own pay recommendations in early May, when ministers will make their final decision. Some 1.3 million public sector workers will see a pay freeze next year, with those earning less than Â£24,000 guaranteed a pay rise of at least Â£250. A government spokesperson said 1% was a ""real-terms increase"", as the latest official inflation figure was 0.9%. But Unite's national officer for health Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe said it would turn into a ""pay cut in real terms"" if inflation rises over this year. RCN Chief Executive Dame Donna Kinnair has said the award shows ministers are ""dangerously out of touch with nursing staff, NHS workers and the public"". Labour's shadow health minister Rosena Allin-Khan said the recommended 1% pay increase was ""nothing short of an insult"". This video can not be played The Labour leader says NHS staff and other public sector workers ""need to be properly rewarded"" The NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations. The Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will bedelayed until the summer,externalbecause of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an ""interim"" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement. NHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised aone-off Â£500 ""special recognition"" paymentin January, following a similar announcement in Scotland. The Welsh government has said it will not set a ""ceiling"" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22. If you are an NHS worker, what are your views about your pay? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

'No ceiling' set for any Welsh NHS pay rise,"This video can not be played Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government will not set an ""artificial ceiling"" on any Welsh NHS pay rise recommendations Ministers will not try to cap any pay rise for Welsh NHS staff in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Wales' health minister has said. The UK government has faced a backlash after saying a pay rise for staff in England should be capped at 1%. Vaughan Gething MS said on Friday that Welsh NHS workers ""deserved a pay rise"". He said the Welsh Government had ""not tried to set a ceiling"" on any proposed wage increase. The NHS Pay Review Body - an independent body - looks at potential wage increases for NHS workers. It then recommends what pay rises - if any - should take place. Nurses prepare for strikes over 1% NHS pay rise Call for long-term plan to help 'burnt-out' nurses NHS staff sickness highest on record amid pandemic Both governments had made suggestions to the body. In England, the nurses' union has threatened possible strike action after the Department of Health suggested the 1% pay rise. Mr Gething said the Welsh submission would be made public, saying Wales had not suggested a ""ceiling"" on any increase in the same way. Trade unions said Welsh NHS staff are 'exhausted' a year into the Covid pandemic in the UK ""We're waiting to see the outcome of the pay review body and we expect to publish the evidence we've provided to that pay review body if not today then in the very near future,"" he said. The British Medical Association (BMA) said it had met with Mr Gething on Friday, and made it clear that England's proposals were ""nothing short of an insult to a profession which has gone above and beyond during the pandemic"". Chair of the Welsh council, Dr David Bailey said: ""We implore him to ensure that [the pay rise] is fair, given that doctors have given their all during the last year - their sacrifices deserve to be recognised."" Nicky Hughes said the pandemic had affected NHS workers' mental health after some became patients themselves The Royal College of Nurses (RCN), who are threatening strikes over the proposals in England, said the Welsh Government should commit to a ""12.5% increase"" for all staff. Nicky Hughes, RCN Wales Associate Director of Nursing, said the sector was struggling with staff shortages and could not attract graduates if the pay was not fair. ""In a week's time, we will be holding a memorial for all those health and social care workers who lost their lives during Covid-19,"" she said. ""This was the ultimate sacrifice. What more do nurses have to do to prove their valuable contribution to health care? A one-percent up-rise in pay is non-negotiable. We don't want excuses; we need action."" The UK government said the 1% pay rise for NHS workers was ""what's affordable"" whilst acknowledging the ""work and commitment"" of staff over the last 12 months. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Westminster had done all it can ""to protect jobs and save livelihoods"", and over a million NHS staff in England continued to benefit from existing multi-year pay deals. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the proposed 1% pay rise in England was ""absolutely disgusting"" and represents a real terms pay cut.""We support the call from the RCN and other health unions for a meaningful pay rise"".""This 1% isn't even a pay rise. Inflation is running at around 1.5 to 1.8%. It's a pay cut"".

And Unite - the third largest union in the NHS - said it is considering a strike ballot. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has called the recommended 1% pay rise ""pitiful"", arguing that its members should get 12.5% instead. It would have to hold a ballot before strikes could go ahead. Nurses prepare for strikes over 1% NHS pay rise How much will NHS staff be paid? Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Speaking at Friday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said the pay award reflected the ""difficult financial circumstances the country is in"". ""One of the challenges we've faced as a country is in terms of the financial consequences of the pandemic,"" he told reporters. ""We've proposed what we think is affordable to make sure in the NHS people do get a pay rise,"" he said. The health department recommended the 1% pay award to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. It would cover nearly all hospital staff, but not GPs and dentists. In addition, some staff whose pay band is being changed will get more than a 1% increase as a result of apreviously agreed three-year pay deal. The government says newly-qualified nurses got a 12% pay rise over the course of that three-year agreement. The lowest minimum full-time salary - for newly employed drivers, housekeeping assistants, nursery assistants and domestic support workers - is Â£18,005 per year The starting salary for most newly qualified nurses is Â£24,907 Staff in ""high-cost areas"", such as London, get extra payments In itssubmission,externalto the panel, officials at the department argued the 1% rise would strike the ""right balance between pay and staff numbers"". The panel is due make its own pay recommendations in early May, when ministers will make their final decision. Some 1.3 million public sector workers will see a pay freeze next year, with those earning less than Â£24,000 guaranteed a pay rise of at least Â£250. A government spokesperson said 1% was a ""real-terms increase"", as the latest official inflation figure was 0.9%. But Unite's national officer for health Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe said it would turn into a ""pay cut in real terms"" if inflation rises over this year. RCN Chief Executive Dame Donna Kinnair has said the award shows ministers are ""dangerously out of touch with nursing staff, NHS workers and the public"". Labour's shadow health minister Rosena Allin-Khan said the recommended 1% pay increase was ""nothing short of an insult"". This video can not be played The Labour leader says NHS staff and other public sector workers ""need to be properly rewarded"" The NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations. The Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will bedelayed until the summer,externalbecause of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an ""interim"" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement. NHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised aone-off Â£500 ""special recognition"" paymentin January, following a similar announcement in Scotland. The Welsh government has said it will not set a ""ceiling"" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22. If you are an NHS worker, what are your views about your pay? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Coronavirus: Evening updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening.UKGhost-hunters fined for breaking lockdown rulesFour people were stopped and fined for driving to ""ghost hunt and view castles"".Wales","Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. A mystery person infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazilhas now been traced.Six cases of the apparently more contagious P.1 variant had been located in the UK - but the identity of one patient remained unknown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street briefing the person concerned has been staying at home - and there was no sign of further transmission. But extra testing is being put in place in Croydon, where they live.Read more about the Brazil variant here.- and watch Mr Hancock's comments below. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock has shared details of how the missing P.1 variant case was tracked down The number of people infected with coronavirus in the UK has continued to decrease. Theweekly survey carried out by the Office for National Statisticsindicates about one in 230 people had the virus in the seven days ending on 27 February, compared with one in 155 the previous week. The health secretary called the figures ""encouraging news"" ahead of the opening up of schools to all pupils in England on Monday. Matt Hancock added an extra Â£79m would be spent on mental health support for pupils - saying the return to school was a ""long-awaited day for many... but for some it's also a moment of unease and anxiety"". At the same briefing, the health secretarydefended a proposed 1% pay increase for NHS staffin England this year, amid a backlash from unions. Mr Hancock said the proposal was ""what we think is affordable"" given financial pressures caused by the pandemic. But the union the Royal College of Nursing has set upa fund to prepare for possible strike actionover the proposals, which it calls derisory. Our health editor says the unions see the proposal as scant reward for the huge efforts of staff during the pandemic. Anyone travelling overseas from England from Mondaywill have to prove they are allowed to travel,or risk being turned away from the airport and fined. A ""Declaration to Travel"" document - available on  a government website - sets out that the trip is permitted under current restrictions, such as for education or work. Individuals could face a Â£200 penalty if they fail to produce a completed form. During the pandemic, the government has awarded thousands of contracts to private companies, spending billions of pounds of public money in the process. But the way these contracts have been awarded - and the huge sums of money involved - have led to accusations of a lack of transparency.

Young endometriosis sufferers told 'get pregnant',"Sophie Buchan was told to get pregnant as a way of controlling her pain Women in their early 20s are still being told to ""get pregnant"" as a way of treating the debilitating gynaecological condition endometriosis. Experts have criticised GPs for lack of understanding of the disease which affects one in 10 women. They are calling for more research and awareness for the condition that has few treatments and no cure. The shocking advice was given to 22-year-old Glasgow journalist Sophie Buchan last year. She told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programmeshe was shocked. ""Last year I had a really bad flare-up,"" she said. ""I was just in pain, I couldn't move. So I went to my GP and he told me to get pregnant. I was 21. ""He just said that a lot of women tend to find that their symptoms are better after they get pregnant. I was just really angry, to be honest."" Prof Andrew Horne, a leading expert on endometriosis at the University of Edinburgh, disagrees with the suggestion. BBC's Sam Poling kept endometriosis private to hide 'weakness' 'I'm a hormonal mess but it's worth it' Endometriosis care needs urgent improvement, MPs say ""That is awful,"" he said. ""I think it's a thing we had hoped as gynaecologists was out of date and was not happening. We shouldn't be telling people to get pregnant for any reason that improves their health and for the other reason that it is simply not true. ""We know patients' symptoms get better during pregnancy but it is definitely not a cure or a treatment."" The condition means cells such as the ones in the lining of the womb (uterus) are found elsewhere in the body. Each month these cells react in the same way to those inside the womb - building up, then breaking down and bleeding, but with no way to escape. Painful periods are just one of the potential symptoms, which can also include pain during sex, heavy, prolonged or irregular periods, pain when passing urine, symptoms of irritable bowel, back and leg pain, fatigue, infertility and depression. Surgery can also cause adhesions - which are bands of scar tissue that can bind two organs together. Because some symptoms are shared by other illnesses, diagnosis is very difficult. On average, it takes almost eight years between a woman first seeing a doctor about their symptoms and receiving a firm diagnosis. The cause is unknown and there is no definitive cure. Faye Farthing is the campaigns manager for Endometriosis UK. She said ""Comments such as 'just get on with it', 'the pain is all in your head', or even myths such as 'just get pregnant and your endometriosis will be cured', must become a thing of the past if we are to ensure those with endometriosis are accessing the support they need to manage this condition, and to reduce diagnosis time which currently averages at a shocking 8.5 years in Scotland. There is no cure for endometriosis, and it's time to call an end to such myths."" During endometriosis awareness month, there is also a call for more research and awareness among women with endometriosis from Scotland's black, Asian and ethnic minority communities. Scottish broadcaster Afua Adom has had really bad symptoms since she was 15 and was finally diagnosed at the age of 25. Afua Adom worries about the amount of painkillers she takes to manage her condition She said: ""I have been on painkillers every single day since I started getting symptoms, whether that is paracetamol, mefenamic acid naproxen, ibuprofen or co-codamol. ""You name it - I've thrown it at the situation. And I have not had less than two paracetamol every single day of my life since then."" It took 10 years for Afua to get a diagnosis, and that is not uncommon. She is now worried about the number of painkillers she is taking just to keep going. ""It's absolutely shocking. I mean, what are your options?,"" she said. ""You take painkillers every day, like I do. You have invasive laser surgery, which I had and perforated my bowel. And then it comes back so you have another surgery, you have another incision, and it comes back. ""There is no effective treatment, there is no effective cure. Essentially we are being told this is a horrible thing that happens inside of your body - go away and deal with it."" About 1.5m UK women are dealing with it, including radio presenter Katy Johnston, 25, from Glasgow. She was put into a chemical menopause in an attempt to ease her pain. Katy Johnston has had the menopause induced to help the symptoms of endometriosis She said: ""A 22-year-old should not know what it feels like to be kept up all night with hot flushes. But for me it was a case of menopause or crippling pain, can't get out of bed, can't function. At this point I was so poorly I hadn't left the house in months, I had to drop out of my postgrad in journalism. My quality of life was just zero."" Another issue flagged up by campaigners is a lack of research among BAME communities. Afua Adom said: ""We need to know how it affects black and Asian women differently and how long it takes them to get a diagnosis, how it ties in with fibroids and is it more prevalent and how the two sit together in the body. Prof Horne agrees this is an area that needs inspection. ""I run a number of research studies and we would like hear from the BAME community and make sure everybody gets involved, not just a subset of the population,"" he said.

He is expected to remain in that hospital for continuing treatment for a number of days, the palace said. Prince Philip, 99, underwent a procedure on a pre-existing condition at St Bartholomew's Hospital on Wednesday. He has spent 17 nights in hospital since being admitted on 16 February. The duke, who turns 100 in June, was first admitted to King Edward VII's after feeling unwell at home. He was treated for an infection before being moved to Barts on Monday for tests and observation on his heart. The exact reason for his initial admission was not disclosed, but it was not related to coronavirus.

On Wednesdaythe Duchess of Cornwall said Prince Philip was ""slightly improving"", during her visit to a Covid vaccination centre. During his first stay at King Edward VII's, Prince Philip was visited by his son, the Prince of Wales. The hospital is a private clinic in central London which has treated the Queen on several occasions as well as the duke and other senior royals. In 2011, Prince Philip suffered chest pains as the royal family was preparing for Christmas. He was treated for a blocked coronary artery at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire and had a stent fitted. The duke,who retired from royal duties in 2017, has received treatment for other health conditions over the years, including abladder infectionin 2012 and exploratory surgery on hisabdomen in June 2013. Prince Philip has been married to the Queen for 73 years, making him the UK's longest-serving consort The couple have spent most of lockdown at Windsor Castle for their safety and received their first Covid-19 vaccinations in January.

'Liberating' to be able to speak - Meghan,"The Duchess of Sussex has said being a royal was ""different than I think what people imagine it to be"". In a clip from the couple's interview with Oprah Winfrey, due to air in the US on Sunday, Meghan was asked why she has decided to give an interview now. ""We have the ability to make our own choices in a way that I couldn't have said yes to then,"" she said. ""That wasn't my choice to make."" She said it was ""really liberating"" to now feel ""able to speak for yourself"". It comes as Buckingham Palace is investigatingclaims the duchess bullied royal staff. The report about the allegations of bullying levelled at Meghanwere first published in the Times,externalafter the interview with Oprah was recorded. Meghan has called it the ""latest attack on her character"". The interview with Oprah, which will air in the US on CBS on Sunday and in the UK on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday, is expected to hear details about Meghan and Prince Harry's short period as working royals together before they stepped down for a life in the US. Profile: Duchess of Sussex Royal Family tree and line of succession Meghan accuses palace of 'perpetuating falsehoods' In the latest clip, shown on CBS's This Morning show, Oprah said to Meghan: ""So I just want to say, I called you either February or March 2018 before the wedding asking, would you please give me an interview. And you said 'I'm sorry, it's not the right time'. Finally we get to sit down and have this conversation."" Meghan replied: ""I remember that conversation very well. I wasn't even allowed to have that conversation with you personally, right? There had to be people [from the communications team] sitting there."" Asked why now was the right time, Meghan said: ""Well, so many things. That we're on the other side of a lot of life experience that's happened and also that we have the ability to make our own choices in a way that I couldn't have said yes to then. That wasn't my choice to make. ""So, as an adult who lived a really independent life to then go into this construct that is different than I think what people imagine it to be, it's really liberating to be able to have the right and the privilege in some ways to be able to say, yes, I'm ready to talk, to say it to yourself.

How much will NHS staff be paid?,"NHS staff in England will be given a 3% pay rise backdated to April. It had previously been suggested that nurses, health assistants and other NHS staffwould only be given a 1% increaseto their salaries. When defending the proposed 1% increase in March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described it as ""as much as we can at the present time"". However, the government now says: ""The economy is actually doing better than we anticipated four months ago"". At the start of the year, the International Monetary Fund predicted that the British economy would grow by 4.5% in 2021. Following the vaccine programme and the reopening of businesses, they now expect the UK economy to grow by 5.3% this year. The Bank of England expects the economy to grow by 7.25%, which would be the fastest growth in more than 70 years. According to the Office for National Statistics, the government received Â£62.2bn in taxes in June compared with Â£46.2bn in February. But in June alone, the government also borrowed Â£22.8bn and spent Â£8.7bn on interest payments after a year and a half of record borrowing. However, the prime minister's spokesman says the pay rise won't come from borrowing. ""It will be funded from within the NHS budget but we're very clear it won't impact frontline services."" Around half of all public-sector workers, including NHS staff, police officers and teachers, have their salaries negotiated by independent pay-review bodies. These pay bodies - made up of individuals not directly attached to the relevant department but with experience in economics and employee relations - work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with a recommendation on how pay should change each year. NHS workers in England offered 3% pay rise What are key workers paid? 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS This recommendation is non-binding - meaning ultimately the government decides. In November 2020,the government announcedthat public-sector workers would have their pay frozen in 2021-22. The exception was for those on salaries under Â£24,000 and for NHS staff. It was initially recommended, by the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC), that pay should rise by just 1% for 2021-22. The DHSC cited the ""uncertain"" financial situation and low inflation. It also said anything more than 1% would require ""reprioritisation"" of the NHS budget. But inflation has risen significantly since March. In June, it reached 2.5% -the highest it has beenfor nearly three years. On 9 March, the head of NHS England,Sir Simon Stevens, told a committee of MPsthat the health service's long-term plan - published in 2019 - had assumed a 2.1% increase this year. But he said ""things have changed"" since then, and said it should now be up to the pay-review body. The pay-review body takes evidence from other groups, including unions and NHS bodies, and will have done its own calculations before making its recommendation. On 21 July the government announced it would accept the pay review bodies' recommendations in full this year, giving NHS staff a 3% pay rise. In theory,the pay-review bodies make recommendations,externalfor all staff across the UK. However, it is up to the individual UK nations to decide whether to accept them. In Scotland,NHS staff have been offered a 4% pay rise(backdated to December 2020). This follows a one-off Covid payment for health and social care staff of Â£500. The Welsh government has said all of its NHS staffwill receive a 3% pay rise. In 2010-11, it was decided that pay would be frozen for all public-sector workers as part of government austerity measures. Strict pay freezes or pay caps were implemented until 2018-19, when the government removed these limits and a three-year pay agreement was implemented for NHS staff in England. But the impact of inflation means that over the whole period some salaries are worth less than they were a decade ago. What is the UK's inflation rate? For example, a newly qualified nurse starting in 2020-21 would be earning about 3% less than one who started in 2010-11, once we account for inflation and the impact of pay freezes and caps. Nurses are just one part of the NHS workforce and the pay agreement implemented in 2018-19 affected different staff members in different ways. For example, the agreement meant the wages of those in the very lowest pay band, such as housekeeping or security staff, increased by almost 30% over the past three years. Staff at the top of their pay bands would have had a smaller pay increase. And it's important to point out that the pay of many NHS staff increases as their experience grows and they move up within pay bands. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Mystery UK person with Brazil variant foundHealth officials have also traced the contacts of the person, it is understood.UK","This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock has shared details of how the missing P.1 variant case was tracked down A mystery person in the UK infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil has now been traced. Last week, it was announced that six cases of the P.1 variant had been found in the UK - but the identity of one of the cases was unknown. The person, who lives in Croydon, has been traced, as have their contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the person ""stayed at home"" and there was no sign of any onward transmission - but local testing is being rolled out. Scientistssay the variantappears to be more contagious and there are concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it. But Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said it hoped vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant. Will vaccines work against the new variants? Brazil variant 'may spread more easily' News that the Brazil variant had been found in the UKwas released last Sunday.Three cases were found in England, and separately three in Scotland. The three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London. Health officials have been trying to trace all the passengers who were on their flight from Heathrow to Aberdeen. In England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February. The third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - was unknown for several days after he or she failed to register their test properly. Dr Hopkins said the person was finally identified when they called the NHS 111 number, after officials had spent days contacting potential households. The person lived in a household that had recently returned from Brazil and all of them had quarantined at home, she added. Mr Hancock said contact-tracers had worked ""flat out"" to narrow the search. ""The best evidence is this person in question stayed at home and there's no sign that there's been any onward transmission but as a precaution we're putting more testing in in Croydon, where they live, to minimise risk of spread,"" he said. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Earlier this week, Mr Hancock said work was under way to tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of the new strains. Dr Hopkins said there was not yet data to show whether the vaccine was effective against this variant - but there was some data for the variant from South Africa ""and we expect that it should at least perform in a similar way"". ""And therefore we think that it's likely there may be some reduction in risk of transmission, or reducing the risk of transmission, but we at least hope at the moment that it will have a strong impact in reducing hospitalisations and deaths. ""We do need to wait for studies to come out from South America and in particular Brazil, and those will come but it will take weeks rather than days I'm afraid."" The variant has been designated ""of concern"" because it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa. One of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade some of the immunity people may have already built against Covid. Preliminary data from Manaus- the Brazilian city hit hard by this P.1 variant - suggested the variant could be up to twice as transmissible as earlier Covid. But experts said this should not be used to predict what might happen in the UK. One of the lead researchers said it was unlikely P.1 would quickly take off in Britain when only six cases had been identified and these were being closely monitored.

THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Meanwhile, two-fifths of all adults in the UK have now had their first dose of the vaccine, Mr Hancock also said at Friday's press conference. He said the fall in the number of deaths was accelerating - down 41% compared with last week - which suggested the vaccination programme was working. ""What this all shows is that the link from cases to hospitalisations and then to deaths that had been unbreakable before the vaccine - that link is now breaking,"" he said. Latest government figures,externalshow the total number of people who have had their first dose of vaccine has now reached 21,358,815, while the number who have had their second dose has topped one million. There have been another 5,947 cases announced and a further 236 people recorded as having died within 28 days of testing positive.

Today's writers were Becky Morton, Alex Kleiderman, Kate Whannel, Lauren Turner and Ella Wills. The editors were Chris Clayton and Rob Corp. We'll be back tomorrow morning with more updates from the UK and around the world. And as Friday's coverage draws to a close, here's what you need to know this evening: As the live page team prepare to close up for the day, here are some of the top coronavirus stories we have been
covering this Friday: Money tosupport children and young people's mental healthafter the ""disruption"" of the pandemic has been cautiously welcomed. It is part of a Â£500m pot for mental health servicesannounced in November. The government confirmed Â£79m would be allocated to support children in school and in the community. Charities and campaigners said the pandemic had had a significant impact on  young people's mental health, with one in six now estimated to have a mental health problem, according to Emma Thomas, head of charity Young Minds. ""Before Covid, we were looking at one in nine young people with a mental health diagnosable need,"" she said. But Ms Thomas warned against ""medicalising"" what are natural feelings of distress and said school might be the appropriate place for many children, who don't need formal mental health treatment, to seek support. She said it was ""absolutely right"" to boost mental health support in schools and the community. But others, like the Children's Society, condemned it as a ""sticking plaster"". ""Only about a third of children will receive support this way by April 2023,"" a spokesperson said. We've usually been able to report the UK's latest coronavirus statistics by now. But there's a delay to today's update and so thegovernment dashboard,externalwill be updated later this evening. However Public Health England has some of the figures. They said another 236 deaths had now been recorded, of people who had a positive coronavirus test within the previous 28 days. And 21,358,815 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine. Not all cinemas in NYC are opening this weekend The US film world will have its eyes on New York City this weekend
as some of its cinemas open there for the first time in nearly a year. While cinemas have reopened in some capacity elsewhere in
the US, New York has one of the countryâs biggest movie-going markets and is being seen as a litmus test for a return to communal screenings. Pandemic rules apply. Cinemas are only allowed to be a quarter full, and audiences must wear masks and will be assigned seats. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US film industry has been devastated by the pandemic, which drove down box office sales by more than 70% globally last year, the BBCâs business reporter in New York, Natalie Sherman, reports. Audiences have largely stayed away from other reopenings of cinemas, put off by health concerns and the limited titles on offer for the big screen. But virus cases in the US are dropping and the vaccination campaign is gaining momentum, our correspondent notes. You can read more of Natalie's report here. Figures show there is huge variation in the percentage of front-line NHS healthcare staff in England who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. More than 98% in the North East and South West have had a first dose - but only 79% in London, leaving around 35,000 staff unvaccinated there. Ministers are considering whether to make the jab mandatory for NHS staff. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in his Downing Street briefing today there are currently no plans for that. In England, NHS data suggests 93% of eligible front-line staff have been vaccinated - equivalent to one million doses. But, nearly three months after the vaccination programme began, up to 80,000 staff have still not taken up the offer. Front-line staff were among the first to be offered the vaccine. Read more.  Radio 4 PM Oxford vaccine lead researcher Prof Sarah Gilbert says that current coronavirus vaccines might need ""tweaking"" to deal with variants. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""A lot of the changes in the different variants coming from different parts of the world are actually the same. So, we are not seeing the virus mutating away in lots of different directions, which would make it harder to keep up with.â Prof Gilbert also stressed it was important to make sure the whole world was protected so that the virus could be suppressed. ""It's no good just to protect our country and have lots of infections going on in other parts of the world,"" she said, adding this could lead to new mutations. ""We need to make sure that when vaccines are being manufactured, they meet the same standards,"" she added. On the subject of whether everyone would have to be vaccinated every year, she said she didn't think this would be necessary. Instead, it might be that those at highest risk - like elderly people - are vaccinated each year. Prof Gilbert was speaking after receiving the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) Albert Medal. She said it was a ""great honour"". Previous winners include Winston Churchill, Marie Curie, Alexander Graham Bell, Stephen Hawking and Tim Berners-Lee. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock, whose grandmother worked nights as a nurse, says heâll âbow to nobodyâ in his admiration for the profession. But such a sentiment may jar with those who are furious about the proposed 1% pay offer. The health secretary reiterated the suggestion that the fact that any kind of increase is on the table at all marks NHS staff out, given the wider public sector pay freeze. Again, thereâs no sign that the governmentâs going to back down, with much depending on what the pay review body comes back with, later in the spring. However this row might well rumble on - and could create an awkward backdrop for ministers when theyâre seen to visit health settings or vaccination centres to praise the efforts of front-line workers. Reality Check On the subject of NHS pay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the government has âproposed what we think is affordable"". On Thursday, the government recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff (excluding doctors and dentists) to the staffâs pay review body. Currently, the NHS spends almost half of its budget on staff â a 1% pay increase across the board for 2021-22 could cost as much as Â£500m. The government has also argued that a 1% increase would be above inflation, which is currently at 0.7%. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that it could rise to 1.5% within the year, which would make the 1% increase a real-terms pay cut. The pay review body will now take evidence from other groups, such as unions and NHS employers before making its recommendation around May. It is possible that the review body could recommend a bigger rise, although the government has indicated it would be difficult to fund. Reality Check has looked athow NHS pay is decidedand how it has changed over time. The government has recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff. Many other public-sector workers will have their pay frozen, with the government warning that the country's finances are under ""huge pressure"" because of the pandemic. Health unions have criticised the 1% pay proposal and one - representing nurses - is calling for a 12.5% increase instead. We look at how decisionsover public sector pay are taken here. Today's Downing Street press conference, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Susan Hopkins of Public Health England, has just drawn to a close. Here are some of the main things we heard:    The final question comes from Megan Ford of the Nursing Times. She asks the health secretary if he is worried that the 1% pay rise will lead to nurses leaving the profession, making it hard to complete the vaccination programme and stabilise the NHS post-pandemic. Matt Hancock notes that 10,000 more nurses have joined the NHS in the last 12 months and that there has been a 34% increase in applications. He adds that nurses have had a 12% pay rise in the last three years. ""I bow to nobody in my admiration for nurses,"" he says adding that his grandmother was a nurse. However, he adds that ""times are tight"" and notes that nurses are getting a pay rise while others are seeing their wages frozen. And that concludes today's press conference John Johnston from PoliticsHome cites the Scottish Conservative leader's comments from earlier today, saying that Test and Trace didn't work as it should early in the pandemic. He asks if the health secretary accepts that analysis? He also asks for some explanation on why children are being asked to wear masks in schools. Matt Hancock says Test and Trace didn't exist at the start of the pandemic. He says there has been a programme of constant improvement. Dr Susan Hopkins says the advice for children to wear masks is to reduce the risk in schools amid increased transmission caused by new variants. That goes hand in hand with the testing, along with all of the other measures, she says. Nigel Morris from the i says the PM claimed to have a ready-made plan to fix social care in 2019 but yesterday his press secretary said the details were still being worked out. He asks when a plan will be ready. Matt Hancock says the government intends to publish a social care plan this year. He adds that it is ""more challenging to deliver this in difficult economic times"". Sky News asks the health secretary about the time it took find the Brazil variant, and Dr Susan Hopkins how helpful it would be to close the UK's borders at the moment. Matt Hancock says it's a tribute to Test and Trace ""that despite the fact the case was one of the few where the correct details weren't attached to the test itself, they managed to track down the individual"". He also says it's ""reassuring that all the evidence shows that that individual and all six where we found this variant of concern followed the rules and we obviously then put in the testing around that"". And he adds: ""We wouldn't know about any of this without the huge testing and sequencing capacity."" On border restrictions,  Dr Susan Hopkins says people coming into the country and leaving should only be doing it for essential reasons. She also says the day two and day eight tests in quarantine give extra reassurance in terms of detecting cases. And she details other restrictions currently in place, saying that even with smaller numbers of individuals coming into the country these work to minimise the risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks Matt Hancock how hard he fought for a more generous pay offer for NHS workers. And she asks Dr Susan Hopkins if the AstraZeneca vaccine works against the Brazil variant. Hancock says the government has to take issues of ""affordability"" into account but adds that he is glad the NHS was ""carved out of the pay freeze"". On the second question, Dr Hopkins says ""we do not yet have lab or clinical data for the Brazilian variant"" adding that this may take weeks to come through. However she says the vaccine may cause ""some reduction in the risk of transmission"". The BBC's Vicki Young asks Matt Hancock if a 1% NHS pay rise is fair, and if there is a case for mandatory vaccination of NHS staff? The health secretary says he ""pays tribute"" to the work of the NHS. But he says the country is facing a challenge in terms of the financial impact of the pandemic. He says the government has proposed what it thinks is affordable to make sure that the NHS gets a pay rise, and they are not part of they public sector pay freeze. On vaccinations, he says the government is not going to bring in mandatory vaccinations across the board and at this stage it is not proposing them for NHS staff. He says a review will look at the moral, ethical and practical questions about all of these issues. Hannah from Cornwall asks if the government has considered allowing under-16s who are shielding to get the vaccine. Hancock replies that it is allowed - as long as the child's clinician says it is in their best interest. Dr Hopkins adds that they are awaiting further data on the subject. Reality Check At the government briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that âan extra Â£79mâ will be allocated to supporting the mental health of children and young people affected by the disruption of the pandemic. Itâs an allocation of part of the Â£500mannounced for mental health servicesin England at the Spending Review in November. The money is aimed at:  You can read more about the planshere.

Vaccinated NHS staff numbers vary across England,"There is huge variation in the percentage of frontline NHS healthcare staff who have been vaccinated against Covid in England. More than 98% in the North East and South West have had a first dose - but only 79% in London, leaving around 35,000 staff unvaccinated there. Ministers are considering whether to make the jab mandatory for NHS staff. Health and social care workers across the UK were one of the first groups to be offered a vaccine. In England, NHS data suggests 93% of eligible frontline staff have been vaccinated - equivalent to one million doses. But, nearly three months after the vaccination programme began, up to 80,000 frontline staff have still not taken up the offer. Dr Lara Alloway, chief medical officer of Hampshire Hospitals, told the BBC that the trust was contacting staff individually if they haven't been vaccinated and ""making sure they understand why having a vaccine is so important"". Weekly online Q&A sessions are being held for staff, a dedicated helpline has been set up and clear information on the vaccine is provided to try to combat misinformation. More than 90% of staff at the trust have had a first dose. Dr Alloway said some had chosen to delay getting the jab because they were pregnant or breastfeeding or had already had Covid. Some were also concerned about their allergies. ""We need to make sure we are providing as much information to people to allow them to make the right decisions,"" Dr Alloway said. The idea of making the vaccine compulsory for NHS staff will be looked at as part ofa government review in England into whether vaccine passportsor certificates are a good way of proving someone's Covid status. Nurses, doctors, ambulance staff and other NHS staff were prioritised early in the vaccine rollout if they: were at high risk of being infected had a high personal risk of becoming ill with Covid were at risk of spreading it to vulnerable people in their care, or to colleagues But an estimated one in 10 frontline health care workers in England and Wales has not yet had their first dose, according to NHS England figures. Scotland and Northern Ireland were not able to provide comparable figures, although the Scottish government said it had exceeded its target to vaccinate frontline staff. Almost 123,000 health and social care staff have been vaccinated in Northern Ireland. Leon Ghulam, the Hampshire trust's black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) workforce lead, said language barriers were one reason why some staff, including Eastern Europeans, were hesitant to have the vaccine. A video in several languages has been shared with staff to reassure them. ""Family and friends can put pressure on staff - but we recommend all workforce to take the vaccine,"" he said. ""There is still progress to be made, but we are heading in the right direction."" A nurse, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC she was prepared to accept the risk of choosing not to being vaccinated. She said being forced to have the jab ""would be against my human right - I should be able to make my own decision"". In London, where just over three-quarters of frontline staff have been vaccinated, senior doctor Anton Emmanuel said he had met several staff members who decided to reject the vaccine for personal reasons. ""One of the most common reasons is about trust. When it comes to staff belonging to black, Asian and other minority communities, for example, some feel they haven't been at the front of the queue for anything in terms of health before, and question why they are suddenly at the front of the queue now,"" he said. ""Aside from the historical inequalities in healthcare, these staff have seen patients from these same communities dying of Covid in disproportionate numbers. And they feel too little was done to prevent it."" Dr Emmanuel has taken part in several events and discussions with healthcare workers about the vaccine and said having humble, honest discussions was crucial. ""I start by saying, 'I understand we don't deserve your trust but please do ask all your questions'."" He tells them he's had the vaccine and gives them the facts they ask for, saying it can protect them. ""You see people's eyes suddenly widen as their minds change."" Sir David Sloman, regional director of the NHS in London said they were ""continuing to reach out to eligible groups, working with local authorities, care homes, faith and community groups and others to encourage uptake of the safe, effective vaccines which will help save lives"". However, in Yorkshire, GP registrar Henna Anwar said she hadn't come across a single healthcare worker who had decided not to take the vaccine when offered it. She says vaccine uptake is high in this group and, in her experience, frontline staff are excited to have it. ""Although I don't feel vaccines should be mandatory, I felt it was almost a professional obligation,"" she said. ""It was not only about me - I could potentially have been carrying the virus without knowing it. ""For me it was about my patients and my family."" Who can get an NHS Covid jab this autumn?

Cautious welcome for child mental health support,"Money to support children and young people's mental health after the ""disruption"" of the pandemic has been cautiously welcomed.

Saadia, an 18-year-old from Swansea and volunteer for the charity Mind, said the pandemic had been a ""rollercoaster"" for her. ""There's a lot of time when I feel very tired. I miss my friends. I miss being in that learning environment. There have been a lot of highs and lows"". Now in her first year of university, Saadia was able to get support for her mental health - though she's mindful not all schools and colleges have such good support teams. ""I relied on [school support services] - more than on my friends and family - because when I was younger I didn't feel able to open up. ""I was very fortunate to be in that place where the right services were around, but I'm aware not every school has that."" She says the funding announcement is ""a big step forward"", but hopes young people will keep being involved and consulted at all stages of the process. Mind originally asked government for a Â£1bn investment in mental health - twice was what pledged. The Â£79m should pay for more mental health support teams in schools and therapy in the community, including for eating disorders. The Department of Health and Social Care said the money would be aimed at: Increasing the number of mental health support teams in schools and colleges from 59 to 400 by April 2023 Giving 22,500 more children and young people access to community mental health services Eating disorder treatment for about 2,000 more children and young people who need it Community mental health care includes talking therapies, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aimed at teaching people to change the way they think about and act on their problems. Ben, who is 18 and from Cumbria, says he was also ""very lucky"" at his school. While they didn't have a team of mental health support staff, teachers took on the role outside of their usual jobs to support students. He says extra support and funding for both teachers and students is needed with demand for such services ""growing all the time."" NHS mental health director Claire Murdoch said the pandemic had ""turned our lives upside down and hit children and young people particularly hard"". She said NHS mental health services had been working ""around the clock, proactively reaching out to and caring for children and young people despite challenging circumstances"". And as young people go back to school from Monday, Emma Thomas from the charity Young Minds called for their wellbeing to be prioritised as much as their need to catch up academically. ""It's a really unsettling timeâ¦they're going back into a school environment they haven't been in, to their social networks they haven't had, and many of them are uncertain about whether they'll have the support. ""Day one is just that first step,"" she said. ""Let's take each step as it comes"".

No 10 discussions over cost of PM's flat revamp,"Carrie Symonds and Boris Johnson have lived in Downing Street since July 2019 Top-level discussions have taken place within Downing Street about the cost of renovating Boris Johnson's official flat, the BBC understands. Sources said setting up a charity to allow members of the public to donate towards the revamp has been considered to cover the cost. Work on the flat, where the PM lives with his fiancee Carrie Symonds, is understood to be largely complete. The PM's spokesman declined to comment on press reports about the cost. When asked whether a charity had been set up, as firstreported by the Daily Mail,external, he said they ""wouldn't comment on speculation"". A source has told the BBC the interior designer Lulu Lytle has been involved in the upgrade. Plan to fund Downing Street makeover 'speculation' Call for inquiry into Symonds' influence in No 10 Publicly-funded pics of Boris Johnson's dog defended Like several of his recent predecessors, Mr Johnson is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, the chancellor's official residence. Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds moved into No 11 in July 2019. Their son Wilfred was born in April 2020. The four-bedroom flat, which is much larger than the one above No 10, was extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011. The Cameronsspent Â£30,000 on their revamp- the maximum annual public grant available to prime ministers for the upkeep of their accommodation. According to the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson and his fiancee are considering options for how any expenditure over this annual limit could be covered. Sources have suggested the matter has been of some considerable concern in Downing Street, with high-level meetings taking place. Designer Lulu Lytle (L), pictured here with Prince Charles on a visit to her firm's workshop, is involved in the upgrade Interior designer Ms Lytle is a co-founder of Soane Britain, an upmarket London-based interior design firm which specialises in traditional craft methods. According to the company's website, its furniture can be found in ""fine hotels and restaurants,"" private members' clubs, yachts and private houses. London's Connaught and Claridges hotels, the Somerset Georgian manor Babington House and Shoreditch House private members' club are listed as clients. Downing Street has said details of any work carried out on the Downing Street property would be published in the normal way later this year. On Friday, the PM's spokesman said the Downing Street complex was a ""working building"" where refurbishments were made periodically. Opposition parties have questioned the cost of the refurbishment, and whether conflicts of interest could arise if Conservative donors are approached to contribute. Labour MP Sarah Owen has written to the PM asking him for details of taxpayers' contribution. She has said the British public ""rightly expect probity, integrity and transparency when it comes to spending public money"". The SNP has said the move would be ""grossly inappropriate"", suggesting the PM - who is paid Â£150,000 a year - should fund the works out of his own pocket.

covering this Friday: Money tosupport children and young people's mental healthafter the ""disruption"" of the pandemic has been cautiously welcomed. It is part of a Â£500m pot for mental health servicesannounced in November. The government confirmed Â£79m would be allocated to support children in school and in the community. Charities and campaigners said the pandemic had had a significant impact on  young people's mental health, with one in six now estimated to have a mental health problem, according to Emma Thomas, head of charity Young Minds. ""Before Covid, we were looking at one in nine young people with a mental health diagnosable need,"" she said. But Ms Thomas warned against ""medicalising"" what are natural feelings of distress and said school might be the appropriate place for many children, who don't need formal mental health treatment, to seek support. She said it was ""absolutely right"" to boost mental health support in schools and the community. But others, like the Children's Society, condemned it as a ""sticking plaster"". ""Only about a third of children will receive support this way by April 2023,"" a spokesperson said. We've usually been able to report the UK's latest coronavirus statistics by now. But there's a delay to today's update and so thegovernment dashboard,externalwill be updated later this evening. However Public Health England has some of the figures. They said another 236 deaths had now been recorded, of people who had a positive coronavirus test within the previous 28 days. And 21,358,815 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine. Not all cinemas in NYC are opening this weekend The US film world will have its eyes on New York City this weekend
as some of its cinemas open there for the first time in nearly a year. While cinemas have reopened in some capacity elsewhere in
the US, New York has one of the countryâs biggest movie-going markets and is being seen as a litmus test for a return to communal screenings. Pandemic rules apply. Cinemas are only allowed to be a quarter full, and audiences must wear masks and will be assigned seats. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US film industry has been devastated by the pandemic, which drove down box office sales by more than 70% globally last year, the BBCâs business reporter in New York, Natalie Sherman, reports. Audiences have largely stayed away from other reopenings of cinemas, put off by health concerns and the limited titles on offer for the big screen. But virus cases in the US are dropping and the vaccination campaign is gaining momentum, our correspondent notes. You can read more of Natalie's report here. Figures show there is huge variation in the percentage of front-line NHS healthcare staff in England who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. More than 98% in the North East and South West have had a first dose - but only 79% in London, leaving around 35,000 staff unvaccinated there. Ministers are considering whether to make the jab mandatory for NHS staff. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in his Downing Street briefing today there are currently no plans for that. In England, NHS data suggests 93% of eligible front-line staff have been vaccinated - equivalent to one million doses. But, nearly three months after the vaccination programme began, up to 80,000 staff have still not taken up the offer. Front-line staff were among the first to be offered the vaccine. Read more.  Radio 4 PM Oxford vaccine lead researcher Prof Sarah Gilbert says that current coronavirus vaccines might need ""tweaking"" to deal with variants. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""A lot of the changes in the different variants coming from different parts of the world are actually the same. So, we are not seeing the virus mutating away in lots of different directions, which would make it harder to keep up with.â Prof Gilbert also stressed it was important to make sure the whole world was protected so that the virus could be suppressed. ""It's no good just to protect our country and have lots of infections going on in other parts of the world,"" she said, adding this could lead to new mutations. ""We need to make sure that when vaccines are being manufactured, they meet the same standards,"" she added. On the subject of whether everyone would have to be vaccinated every year, she said she didn't think this would be necessary. Instead, it might be that those at highest risk - like elderly people - are vaccinated each year. Prof Gilbert was speaking after receiving the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) Albert Medal. She said it was a ""great honour"". Previous winners include Winston Churchill, Marie Curie, Alexander Graham Bell, Stephen Hawking and Tim Berners-Lee. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock, whose grandmother worked nights as a nurse, says heâll âbow to nobodyâ in his admiration for the profession. But such a sentiment may jar with those who are furious about the proposed 1% pay offer. The health secretary reiterated the suggestion that the fact that any kind of increase is on the table at all marks NHS staff out, given the wider public sector pay freeze. Again, thereâs no sign that the governmentâs going to back down, with much depending on what the pay review body comes back with, later in the spring. However this row might well rumble on - and could create an awkward backdrop for ministers when theyâre seen to visit health settings or vaccination centres to praise the efforts of front-line workers. Reality Check On the subject of NHS pay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the government has âproposed what we think is affordable"". On Thursday, the government recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff (excluding doctors and dentists) to the staffâs pay review body. Currently, the NHS spends almost half of its budget on staff â a 1% pay increase across the board for 2021-22 could cost as much as Â£500m. The government has also argued that a 1% increase would be above inflation, which is currently at 0.7%. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that it could rise to 1.5% within the year, which would make the 1% increase a real-terms pay cut. The pay review body will now take evidence from other groups, such as unions and NHS employers before making its recommendation around May. It is possible that the review body could recommend a bigger rise, although the government has indicated it would be difficult to fund. Reality Check has looked athow NHS pay is decidedand how it has changed over time. The government has recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff. Many other public-sector workers will have their pay frozen, with the government warning that the country's finances are under ""huge pressure"" because of the pandemic. Health unions have criticised the 1% pay proposal and one - representing nurses - is calling for a 12.5% increase instead. We look at how decisionsover public sector pay are taken here. Today's Downing Street press conference, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Susan Hopkins of Public Health England, has just drawn to a close. Here are some of the main things we heard:    The final question comes from Megan Ford of the Nursing Times. She asks the health secretary if he is worried that the 1% pay rise will lead to nurses leaving the profession, making it hard to complete the vaccination programme and stabilise the NHS post-pandemic. Matt Hancock notes that 10,000 more nurses have joined the NHS in the last 12 months and that there has been a 34% increase in applications. He adds that nurses have had a 12% pay rise in the last three years. ""I bow to nobody in my admiration for nurses,"" he says adding that his grandmother was a nurse. However, he adds that ""times are tight"" and notes that nurses are getting a pay rise while others are seeing their wages frozen. And that concludes today's press conference John Johnston from PoliticsHome cites the Scottish Conservative leader's comments from earlier today, saying that Test and Trace didn't work as it should early in the pandemic. He asks if the health secretary accepts that analysis? He also asks for some explanation on why children are being asked to wear masks in schools. Matt Hancock says Test and Trace didn't exist at the start of the pandemic. He says there has been a programme of constant improvement. Dr Susan Hopkins says the advice for children to wear masks is to reduce the risk in schools amid increased transmission caused by new variants. That goes hand in hand with the testing, along with all of the other measures, she says. Nigel Morris from the i says the PM claimed to have a ready-made plan to fix social care in 2019 but yesterday his press secretary said the details were still being worked out. He asks when a plan will be ready. Matt Hancock says the government intends to publish a social care plan this year. He adds that it is ""more challenging to deliver this in difficult economic times"". Sky News asks the health secretary about the time it took find the Brazil variant, and Dr Susan Hopkins how helpful it would be to close the UK's borders at the moment. Matt Hancock says it's a tribute to Test and Trace ""that despite the fact the case was one of the few where the correct details weren't attached to the test itself, they managed to track down the individual"". He also says it's ""reassuring that all the evidence shows that that individual and all six where we found this variant of concern followed the rules and we obviously then put in the testing around that"". And he adds: ""We wouldn't know about any of this without the huge testing and sequencing capacity."" On border restrictions,  Dr Susan Hopkins says people coming into the country and leaving should only be doing it for essential reasons. She also says the day two and day eight tests in quarantine give extra reassurance in terms of detecting cases. And she details other restrictions currently in place, saying that even with smaller numbers of individuals coming into the country these work to minimise the risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks Matt Hancock how hard he fought for a more generous pay offer for NHS workers. And she asks Dr Susan Hopkins if the AstraZeneca vaccine works against the Brazil variant. Hancock says the government has to take issues of ""affordability"" into account but adds that he is glad the NHS was ""carved out of the pay freeze"". On the second question, Dr Hopkins says ""we do not yet have lab or clinical data for the Brazilian variant"" adding that this may take weeks to come through. However she says the vaccine may cause ""some reduction in the risk of transmission"". The BBC's Vicki Young asks Matt Hancock if a 1% NHS pay rise is fair, and if there is a case for mandatory vaccination of NHS staff? The health secretary says he ""pays tribute"" to the work of the NHS. But he says the country is facing a challenge in terms of the financial impact of the pandemic. He says the government has proposed what it thinks is affordable to make sure that the NHS gets a pay rise, and they are not part of they public sector pay freeze. On vaccinations, he says the government is not going to bring in mandatory vaccinations across the board and at this stage it is not proposing them for NHS staff. He says a review will look at the moral, ethical and practical questions about all of these issues. Hannah from Cornwall asks if the government has considered allowing under-16s who are shielding to get the vaccine. Hancock replies that it is allowed - as long as the child's clinician says it is in their best interest. Dr Hopkins adds that they are awaiting further data on the subject. Reality Check At the government briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that âan extra Â£79mâ will be allocated to supporting the mental health of children and young people affected by the disruption of the pandemic. Itâs an allocation of part of the Â£500mannounced for mental health servicesin England at the Spending Review in November. The money is aimed at:  You can read more about the planshere.

On vaccinations, he says the government is not going to bring in mandatory vaccinations across the board and at this stage it is not proposing them for NHS staff. He says a review will look at the moral, ethical and practical questions about all of these issues. Hannah from Cornwall asks if the government has considered allowing under-16s who are shielding to get the vaccine. Hancock replies that it is allowed - as long as the child's clinician says it is in their best interest. Dr Hopkins adds that they are awaiting further data on the subject.

Mystery person with Brazil variant in UK foundHealth officials have traced the sixth person known to have been infected with the new Covid variant.,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock has shared details of how the missing P.1 variant case was tracked down A mystery person in the UK infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil has now been traced. Last week, it was announced that six cases of the P.1 variant had been found in the UK - but the identity of one of the cases was unknown. The person, who lives in Croydon, has been traced, as have their contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the person ""stayed at home"" and there was no sign of any onward transmission - but local testing is being rolled out. Scientistssay the variantappears to be more contagious and there are concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it. But Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said it hoped vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant. Will vaccines work against the new variants? Brazil variant 'may spread more easily' News that the Brazil variant had been found in the UKwas released last Sunday.Three cases were found in England, and separately three in Scotland. The three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London. Health officials have been trying to trace all the passengers who were on their flight from Heathrow to Aberdeen. In England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February. The third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - was unknown for several days after he or she failed to register their test properly. Dr Hopkins said the person was finally identified when they called the NHS 111 number, after officials had spent days contacting potential households. The person lived in a household that had recently returned from Brazil and all of them had quarantined at home, she added. Mr Hancock said contact-tracers had worked ""flat out"" to narrow the search. ""The best evidence is this person in question stayed at home and there's no sign that there's been any onward transmission but as a precaution we're putting more testing in in Croydon, where they live, to minimise risk of spread,"" he said. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Earlier this week, Mr Hancock said work was under way to tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of the new strains. Dr Hopkins said there was not yet data to show whether the vaccine was effective against this variant - but there was some data for the variant from South Africa ""and we expect that it should at least perform in a similar way"". ""And therefore we think that it's likely there may be some reduction in risk of transmission, or reducing the risk of transmission, but we at least hope at the moment that it will have a strong impact in reducing hospitalisations and deaths. ""We do need to wait for studies to come out from South America and in particular Brazil, and those will come but it will take weeks rather than days I'm afraid."" The variant has been designated ""of concern"" because it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa. One of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade some of the immunity people may have already built against Covid. Preliminary data from Manaus- the Brazilian city hit hard by this P.1 variant - suggested the variant could be up to twice as transmissible as earlier Covid. But experts said this should not be used to predict what might happen in the UK. One of the lead researchers said it was unlikely P.1 would quickly take off in Britain when only six cases had been identified and these were being closely monitored.

THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Meanwhile, two-fifths of all adults in the UK have now had their first dose of the vaccine, Mr Hancock also said at Friday's press conference. He said the fall in the number of deaths was accelerating - down 41% compared with last week - which suggested the vaccination programme was working. ""What this all shows is that the link from cases to hospitalisations and then to deaths that had been unbreakable before the vaccine - that link is now breaking,"" he said. Latest government figures,externalshow the total number of people who have had their first dose of vaccine has now reached 21,358,815, while the number who have had their second dose has topped one million. There have been another 5,947 cases announced and a further 236 people recorded as having died within 28 days of testing positive.

Sports Direct owner warns of store closure risk,"Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has said it could be forced to close stores due to the cap on business rates relief announced in the Budget. It said the Â£2m cap rendered the package ""near worthless"" for large retailers. The group, which includes Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, said retailers needed a total overhaul of the business rates model. The rates holiday for non-essential retailers in England will end in June. From the start of July, business rates - which are taxes on properties used for commercial purposes - will then be discounted by two-thirds for nine months, up to a maximum of Â£2m if businesses are closed. Frasers Group said in a statement,externalthat the business rates relief package would ""mean we need to review our entire portfolio to ascertain stores that are unviable due to unrealistic business rates"". It warned last month that it expected a Â£100m hit due to continuing restrictions on trading. Frasers Group, which is owned by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley,had already announced a number of store closures in 2020. Budget 2021: Relief extended for businesses on rates and VAT 'If I have to pay Â£13,000, it will destroy my shop' Debenhams shops to close permanently after Boohoo deal The group suggested that many retailers would have expected further rates relief ""until structural reform is implemented"", adding that firms ""should pay the fair amount of rates in line with realistic rateable values, but instead we continue to have an unwieldy, overly complex, and out of date business rates regime"". Retail property expert Jonathan De Mello agreed. He told the BBC that the rates relief cap would ""place a significant rates burden on retailers with more than just a handful of stores"". He suggested that retailers with stores in large shopping centres and city centre locations would be hit hard: ""Some retailers pay more than Â£2m rates from just one store alone! ""The government missed an opportunity here to reform rates root and branch,"" he added. In response to the chancellor's Budget, the British Retail Consortium also said it hoped to see theongoing business rates review by government,externalreduce the ""burden"" on retailers. It added: ""Without further funding, it is likely that many 'non-essential' retailers will struggle under sluggish consumer demand and high Covid costs."" In Scotland, retail, hospitality, leisure and aviation businesseswill not pay non-domestic ratesthroughout the next financial year.The Welsh government has saidhospitality, retail, leisure and tourism will get full rates relief for another 12 months. Frasers Group also said on Friday that the business rates relief cap in England would ""make it nearly impossible to take on ex-Debenhams sites with the inherent jobs created"". The Debenhams brand and website werebought by fast fashion firm Boohoo in January, leaving many of the chain's 118 remaining shops vacant. It has been reported that Frasers Group is currently in talks over taking on a number of former Debenhams stores. Billionaire Mike Ashley had made an offer for Debenhams when it was initially put up for sale last April, which was rejected. The businessman had previously built up a 29% stake in the chain, but saw his Â£150m holding wiped out in 2019, when the company fell into administration and then ended up in the hands of its lenders - a consortium led by hedge fund Silverpoint. The rise of online shopping, expensive rents and coronavirus shutdowns have put department stores chains under increased pressure. Last year, 139-year-old Beales closed all of its shops after falling into administration, while the BBC understandsJohn Lewis is considering closingup to eight further department stores, on top of those already announced in 2020.

Stabbed boy video-calls mum for help,"James Bascoe-Smith remains critically ill in hospital A 16-year-old boy video-called his mum as he lay bleeding in the street after being stabbed, worried he was about to die. James Bascoe-Smith was trying out a new bike and had been gone no more than 10 minutes when he was randomly attacked on 23 February, his family said. The teenager told his mum Lisa what had happened and she stayed on the phone with him until she found him on Henry Road in Brixton, south London. He remains critically ill in hospital. James has been described as a ""bubbly, funny person"" James's aunt Rachel Duncan said: ""He was out no more than 10 minutes and then he FaceTimed his mum to say: 'I've been stabbed.'"" ""His mum ran to him. I thank God he had the strength and courage to FaceTime his mum; she was there with him and I believe that's what kept him alive, the fact his mum was coming to him,"" she said. Ms Duncan said the stabbing had left the entire family feeling ""broken"" and that his mum would ""never be the same again"". She described her nephew as a ""bubbly, funny person who is always caring for others"". Rachel Duncan said her nephew was usually with his family or studying She said he had always been involved in community projects and had never been involved in gangs. ""The way the media portray young black boys as being that boy out there in a gang, that's not James. He's not like that at all. He doesn't have time to think about being in a gang. He's always with his family or studying."" Ms Duncan added: ""We need to find the people who did this... I know there's been stabbings since James's attack - why are they still doing it? Why do they want families to go through this?"" She has implored anyone who knows what happened to James to share the information with the police. The Met Police has said the driver of a white van who was in the area between 18:15 and 18:20 GMT on Tuesday 23 February might have vital information and officers are urging that person to come forward.

covering this Friday: Money tosupport children and young people's mental healthafter the ""disruption"" of the pandemic has been cautiously welcomed. It is part of a Â£500m pot for mental health servicesannounced in November. The government confirmed Â£79m would be allocated to support children in school and in the community. Charities and campaigners said the pandemic had had a significant impact on  young people's mental health, with one in six now estimated to have a mental health problem, according to Emma Thomas, head of charity Young Minds. ""Before Covid, we were looking at one in nine young people with a mental health diagnosable need,"" she said. But Ms Thomas warned against ""medicalising"" what are natural feelings of distress and said school might be the appropriate place for many children, who don't need formal mental health treatment, to seek support. She said it was ""absolutely right"" to boost mental health support in schools and the community. But others, like the Children's Society, condemned it as a ""sticking plaster"". ""Only about a third of children will receive support this way by April 2023,"" a spokesperson said. We've usually been able to report the UK's latest coronavirus statistics by now. But there's a delay to today's update and so thegovernment dashboard,externalwill be updated later this evening. However Public Health England has some of the figures. They said another 236 deaths had now been recorded, of people who had a positive coronavirus test within the previous 28 days. And 21,358,815 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine. Not all cinemas in NYC are opening this weekend The US film world will have its eyes on New York City this weekend
as some of its cinemas open there for the first time in nearly a year. While cinemas have reopened in some capacity elsewhere in
the US, New York has one of the countryâs biggest movie-going markets and is being seen as a litmus test for a return to communal screenings. Pandemic rules apply. Cinemas are only allowed to be a quarter full, and audiences must wear masks and will be assigned seats. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US film industry has been devastated by the pandemic, which drove down box office sales by more than 70% globally last year, the BBCâs business reporter in New York, Natalie Sherman, reports. Audiences have largely stayed away from other reopenings of cinemas, put off by health concerns and the limited titles on offer for the big screen. But virus cases in the US are dropping and the vaccination campaign is gaining momentum, our correspondent notes. You can read more of Natalie's report here. Figures show there is huge variation in the percentage of front-line NHS healthcare staff in England who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. More than 98% in the North East and South West have had a first dose - but only 79% in London, leaving around 35,000 staff unvaccinated there. Ministers are considering whether to make the jab mandatory for NHS staff. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in his Downing Street briefing today there are currently no plans for that. In England, NHS data suggests 93% of eligible front-line staff have been vaccinated - equivalent to one million doses. But, nearly three months after the vaccination programme began, up to 80,000 staff have still not taken up the offer. Front-line staff were among the first to be offered the vaccine. Read more.  Radio 4 PM Oxford vaccine lead researcher Prof Sarah Gilbert says that current coronavirus vaccines might need ""tweaking"" to deal with variants. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""A lot of the changes in the different variants coming from different parts of the world are actually the same. So, we are not seeing the virus mutating away in lots of different directions, which would make it harder to keep up with.â Prof Gilbert also stressed it was important to make sure the whole world was protected so that the virus could be suppressed. ""It's no good just to protect our country and have lots of infections going on in other parts of the world,"" she said, adding this could lead to new mutations. ""We need to make sure that when vaccines are being manufactured, they meet the same standards,"" she added. On the subject of whether everyone would have to be vaccinated every year, she said she didn't think this would be necessary. Instead, it might be that those at highest risk - like elderly people - are vaccinated each year. Prof Gilbert was speaking after receiving the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) Albert Medal. She said it was a ""great honour"". Previous winners include Winston Churchill, Marie Curie, Alexander Graham Bell, Stephen Hawking and Tim Berners-Lee. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock, whose grandmother worked nights as a nurse, says heâll âbow to nobodyâ in his admiration for the profession. But such a sentiment may jar with those who are furious about the proposed 1% pay offer. The health secretary reiterated the suggestion that the fact that any kind of increase is on the table at all marks NHS staff out, given the wider public sector pay freeze. Again, thereâs no sign that the governmentâs going to back down, with much depending on what the pay review body comes back with, later in the spring. However this row might well rumble on - and could create an awkward backdrop for ministers when theyâre seen to visit health settings or vaccination centres to praise the efforts of front-line workers. Reality Check On the subject of NHS pay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the government has âproposed what we think is affordable"". On Thursday, the government recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff (excluding doctors and dentists) to the staffâs pay review body. Currently, the NHS spends almost half of its budget on staff â a 1% pay increase across the board for 2021-22 could cost as much as Â£500m. The government has also argued that a 1% increase would be above inflation, which is currently at 0.7%. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that it could rise to 1.5% within the year, which would make the 1% increase a real-terms pay cut. The pay review body will now take evidence from other groups, such as unions and NHS employers before making its recommendation around May. It is possible that the review body could recommend a bigger rise, although the government has indicated it would be difficult to fund. Reality Check has looked athow NHS pay is decidedand how it has changed over time. The government has recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff. Many other public-sector workers will have their pay frozen, with the government warning that the country's finances are under ""huge pressure"" because of the pandemic. Health unions have criticised the 1% pay proposal and one - representing nurses - is calling for a 12.5% increase instead. We look at how decisionsover public sector pay are taken here. Today's Downing Street press conference, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Susan Hopkins of Public Health England, has just drawn to a close. Here are some of the main things we heard:    The final question comes from Megan Ford of the Nursing Times. She asks the health secretary if he is worried that the 1% pay rise will lead to nurses leaving the profession, making it hard to complete the vaccination programme and stabilise the NHS post-pandemic. Matt Hancock notes that 10,000 more nurses have joined the NHS in the last 12 months and that there has been a 34% increase in applications. He adds that nurses have had a 12% pay rise in the last three years. ""I bow to nobody in my admiration for nurses,"" he says adding that his grandmother was a nurse. However, he adds that ""times are tight"" and notes that nurses are getting a pay rise while others are seeing their wages frozen. And that concludes today's press conference John Johnston from PoliticsHome cites the Scottish Conservative leader's comments from earlier today, saying that Test and Trace didn't work as it should early in the pandemic. He asks if the health secretary accepts that analysis? He also asks for some explanation on why children are being asked to wear masks in schools. Matt Hancock says Test and Trace didn't exist at the start of the pandemic. He says there has been a programme of constant improvement. Dr Susan Hopkins says the advice for children to wear masks is to reduce the risk in schools amid increased transmission caused by new variants. That goes hand in hand with the testing, along with all of the other measures, she says. Nigel Morris from the i says the PM claimed to have a ready-made plan to fix social care in 2019 but yesterday his press secretary said the details were still being worked out. He asks when a plan will be ready. Matt Hancock says the government intends to publish a social care plan this year. He adds that it is ""more challenging to deliver this in difficult economic times"". Sky News asks the health secretary about the time it took find the Brazil variant, and Dr Susan Hopkins how helpful it would be to close the UK's borders at the moment. Matt Hancock says it's a tribute to Test and Trace ""that despite the fact the case was one of the few where the correct details weren't attached to the test itself, they managed to track down the individual"". He also says it's ""reassuring that all the evidence shows that that individual and all six where we found this variant of concern followed the rules and we obviously then put in the testing around that"". And he adds: ""We wouldn't know about any of this without the huge testing and sequencing capacity."" On border restrictions,  Dr Susan Hopkins says people coming into the country and leaving should only be doing it for essential reasons. She also says the day two and day eight tests in quarantine give extra reassurance in terms of detecting cases. And she details other restrictions currently in place, saying that even with smaller numbers of individuals coming into the country these work to minimise the risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks Matt Hancock how hard he fought for a more generous pay offer for NHS workers. And she asks Dr Susan Hopkins if the AstraZeneca vaccine works against the Brazil variant. Hancock says the government has to take issues of ""affordability"" into account but adds that he is glad the NHS was ""carved out of the pay freeze"". On the second question, Dr Hopkins says ""we do not yet have lab or clinical data for the Brazilian variant"" adding that this may take weeks to come through. However she says the vaccine may cause ""some reduction in the risk of transmission"". The BBC's Vicki Young asks Matt Hancock if a 1% NHS pay rise is fair, and if there is a case for mandatory vaccination of NHS staff? The health secretary says he ""pays tribute"" to the work of the NHS. But he says the country is facing a challenge in terms of the financial impact of the pandemic. He says the government has proposed what it thinks is affordable to make sure that the NHS gets a pay rise, and they are not part of they public sector pay freeze. On vaccinations, he says the government is not going to bring in mandatory vaccinations across the board and at this stage it is not proposing them for NHS staff. He says a review will look at the moral, ethical and practical questions about all of these issues. Hannah from Cornwall asks if the government has considered allowing under-16s who are shielding to get the vaccine. Hancock replies that it is allowed - as long as the child's clinician says it is in their best interest. Dr Hopkins adds that they are awaiting further data on the subject. Reality Check At the government briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that âan extra Â£79mâ will be allocated to supporting the mental health of children and young people affected by the disruption of the pandemic.

The US film industry has been devastated by the pandemic, which drove down box office sales by more than 70% globally last year, the BBCâs business reporter in New York, Natalie Sherman, reports. Audiences have largely stayed away from other reopenings of cinemas, put off by health concerns and the limited titles on offer for the big screen. But virus cases in the US are dropping and the vaccination campaign is gaining momentum, our correspondent notes. You can read more of Natalie's report here. Figures show there is huge variation in the percentage of front-line NHS healthcare staff in England who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. More than 98% in the North East and South West have had a first dose - but only 79% in London, leaving around 35,000 staff unvaccinated there. Ministers are considering whether to make the jab mandatory for NHS staff. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in his Downing Street briefing today there are currently no plans for that. In England, NHS data suggests 93% of eligible front-line staff have been vaccinated - equivalent to one million doses. But, nearly three months after the vaccination programme began, up to 80,000 staff have still not taken up the offer. Front-line staff were among the first to be offered the vaccine. Read more.  Radio 4 PM Oxford vaccine lead researcher Prof Sarah Gilbert says that current coronavirus vaccines might need ""tweaking"" to deal with variants. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""A lot of the changes in the different variants coming from different parts of the world are actually the same. So, we are not seeing the virus mutating away in lots of different directions, which would make it harder to keep up with.â Prof Gilbert also stressed it was important to make sure the whole world was protected so that the virus could be suppressed. ""It's no good just to protect our country and have lots of infections going on in other parts of the world,"" she said, adding this could lead to new mutations. ""We need to make sure that when vaccines are being manufactured, they meet the same standards,"" she added. On the subject of whether everyone would have to be vaccinated every year, she said she didn't think this would be necessary. Instead, it might be that those at highest risk - like elderly people - are vaccinated each year. Prof Gilbert was speaking after receiving the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) Albert Medal. She said it was a ""great honour"". Previous winners include Winston Churchill, Marie Curie, Alexander Graham Bell, Stephen Hawking and Tim Berners-Lee. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock, whose grandmother worked nights as a nurse, says heâll âbow to nobodyâ in his admiration for the profession. But such a sentiment may jar with those who are furious about the proposed 1% pay offer. The health secretary reiterated the suggestion that the fact that any kind of increase is on the table at all marks NHS staff out, given the wider public sector pay freeze. Again, thereâs no sign that the governmentâs going to back down, with much depending on what the pay review body comes back with, later in the spring. However this row might well rumble on - and could create an awkward backdrop for ministers when theyâre seen to visit health settings or vaccination centres to praise the efforts of front-line workers. Reality Check On the subject of NHS pay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the government has âproposed what we think is affordable"". On Thursday, the government recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff (excluding doctors and dentists) to the staffâs pay review body. Currently, the NHS spends almost half of its budget on staff â a 1% pay increase across the board for 2021-22 could cost as much as Â£500m. The government has also argued that a 1% increase would be above inflation, which is currently at 0.7%. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that it could rise to 1.5% within the year, which would make the 1% increase a real-terms pay cut. The pay review body will now take evidence from other groups, such as unions and NHS employers before making its recommendation around May. It is possible that the review body could recommend a bigger rise, although the government has indicated it would be difficult to fund. Reality Check has looked athow NHS pay is decidedand how it has changed over time. The government has recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff. Many other public-sector workers will have their pay frozen, with the government warning that the country's finances are under ""huge pressure"" because of the pandemic. Health unions have criticised the 1% pay proposal and one - representing nurses - is calling for a 12.5% increase instead. We look at how decisionsover public sector pay are taken here. Today's Downing Street press conference, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Susan Hopkins of Public Health England, has just drawn to a close. Here are some of the main things we heard:    The final question comes from Megan Ford of the Nursing Times. She asks the health secretary if he is worried that the 1% pay rise will lead to nurses leaving the profession, making it hard to complete the vaccination programme and stabilise the NHS post-pandemic. Matt Hancock notes that 10,000 more nurses have joined the NHS in the last 12 months and that there has been a 34% increase in applications. He adds that nurses have had a 12% pay rise in the last three years. ""I bow to nobody in my admiration for nurses,"" he says adding that his grandmother was a nurse. However, he adds that ""times are tight"" and notes that nurses are getting a pay rise while others are seeing their wages frozen. And that concludes today's press conference John Johnston from PoliticsHome cites the Scottish Conservative leader's comments from earlier today, saying that Test and Trace didn't work as it should early in the pandemic. He asks if the health secretary accepts that analysis? He also asks for some explanation on why children are being asked to wear masks in schools. Matt Hancock says Test and Trace didn't exist at the start of the pandemic. He says there has been a programme of constant improvement. Dr Susan Hopkins says the advice for children to wear masks is to reduce the risk in schools amid increased transmission caused by new variants. That goes hand in hand with the testing, along with all of the other measures, she says. Nigel Morris from the i says the PM claimed to have a ready-made plan to fix social care in 2019 but yesterday his press secretary said the details were still being worked out. He asks when a plan will be ready. Matt Hancock says the government intends to publish a social care plan this year. He adds that it is ""more challenging to deliver this in difficult economic times"". Sky News asks the health secretary about the time it took find the Brazil variant, and Dr Susan Hopkins how helpful it would be to close the UK's borders at the moment. Matt Hancock says it's a tribute to Test and Trace ""that despite the fact the case was one of the few where the correct details weren't attached to the test itself, they managed to track down the individual"". He also says it's ""reassuring that all the evidence shows that that individual and all six where we found this variant of concern followed the rules and we obviously then put in the testing around that"". And he adds: ""We wouldn't know about any of this without the huge testing and sequencing capacity."" On border restrictions,  Dr Susan Hopkins says people coming into the country and leaving should only be doing it for essential reasons. She also says the day two and day eight tests in quarantine give extra reassurance in terms of detecting cases. And she details other restrictions currently in place, saying that even with smaller numbers of individuals coming into the country these work to minimise the risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks Matt Hancock how hard he fought for a more generous pay offer for NHS workers. And she asks Dr Susan Hopkins if the AstraZeneca vaccine works against the Brazil variant. Hancock says the government has to take issues of ""affordability"" into account but adds that he is glad the NHS was ""carved out of the pay freeze"". On the second question, Dr Hopkins says ""we do not yet have lab or clinical data for the Brazilian variant"" adding that this may take weeks to come through. However she says the vaccine may cause ""some reduction in the risk of transmission"". The BBC's Vicki Young asks Matt Hancock if a 1% NHS pay rise is fair, and if there is a case for mandatory vaccination of NHS staff? The health secretary says he ""pays tribute"" to the work of the NHS. But he says the country is facing a challenge in terms of the financial impact of the pandemic. He says the government has proposed what it thinks is affordable to make sure that the NHS gets a pay rise, and they are not part of they public sector pay freeze. On vaccinations, he says the government is not going to bring in mandatory vaccinations across the board and at this stage it is not proposing them for NHS staff. He says a review will look at the moral, ethical and practical questions about all of these issues. Hannah from Cornwall asks if the government has considered allowing under-16s who are shielding to get the vaccine. Hancock replies that it is allowed - as long as the child's clinician says it is in their best interest. Dr Hopkins adds that they are awaiting further data on the subject. Reality Check At the government briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that âan extra Â£79mâ will be allocated to supporting the mental health of children and young people affected by the disruption of the pandemic. Itâs an allocation of part of the Â£500mannounced for mental health servicesin England at the Spending Review in November. The money is aimed at:  You can read more about the planshere.

Breaking|Breaking newsMystery person with Brazil variant in UK foundHealth officials have now traced the sixth person infected with the new Covid variant.UK'No ceiling' set for any Welsh NHS pay riseThe UK government has faced backlash after suggesting a 1% cap on pay rise for NHS workers in England.WalesComments,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock has shared details of how the missing P.1 variant case was tracked down A mystery person in the UK infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil has now been traced. Last week, it was announced that six cases of the P.1 variant had been found in the UK - but the identity of one of the cases was unknown. The person, who lives in Croydon, has been traced, as have their contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the person ""stayed at home"" and there was no sign of any onward transmission - but local testing is being rolled out. Scientistssay the variantappears to be more contagious and there are concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it. But Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said it hoped vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant. Will vaccines work against the new variants? Brazil variant 'may spread more easily' News that the Brazil variant had been found in the UKwas released last Sunday.Three cases were found in England, and separately three in Scotland. The three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London. Health officials have been trying to trace all the passengers who were on their flight from Heathrow to Aberdeen. In England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February. The third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - was unknown for several days after he or she failed to register their test properly. Dr Hopkins said the person was finally identified when they called the NHS 111 number, after officials had spent days contacting potential households. The person lived in a household that had recently returned from Brazil and all of them had quarantined at home, she added. Mr Hancock said contact-tracers had worked ""flat out"" to narrow the search. ""The best evidence is this person in question stayed at home and there's no sign that there's been any onward transmission but as a precaution we're putting more testing in in Croydon, where they live, to minimise risk of spread,"" he said. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Earlier this week, Mr Hancock said work was under way to tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of the new strains. Dr Hopkins said there was not yet data to show whether the vaccine was effective against this variant - but there was some data for the variant from South Africa ""and we expect that it should at least perform in a similar way"". ""And therefore we think that it's likely there may be some reduction in risk of transmission, or reducing the risk of transmission, but we at least hope at the moment that it will have a strong impact in reducing hospitalisations and deaths. ""We do need to wait for studies to come out from South America and in particular Brazil, and those will come but it will take weeks rather than days I'm afraid."" The variant has been designated ""of concern"" because it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa. One of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade some of the immunity people may have already built against Covid. Preliminary data from Manaus- the Brazilian city hit hard by this P.1 variant - suggested the variant could be up to twice as transmissible as earlier Covid. But experts said this should not be used to predict what might happen in the UK. One of the lead researchers said it was unlikely P.1 would quickly take off in Britain when only six cases had been identified and these were being closely monitored.

'No ceiling' set for any Welsh NHS pay riseThe UK government has faced backlash after suggesting a 1% cap on pay rise for NHS workers in England.WalesComments,"This video can not be played Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government will not set an ""artificial ceiling"" on any Welsh NHS pay rise recommendations Ministers will not try to cap any pay rise for Welsh NHS staff in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Wales' health minister has said. The UK government has faced a backlash after saying a pay rise for staff in England should be capped at 1%. Vaughan Gething MS said on Friday that Welsh NHS workers ""deserved a pay rise"". He said the Welsh Government had ""not tried to set a ceiling"" on any proposed wage increase. The NHS Pay Review Body - an independent body - looks at potential wage increases for NHS workers. It then recommends what pay rises - if any - should take place. Nurses prepare for strikes over 1% NHS pay rise Call for long-term plan to help 'burnt-out' nurses NHS staff sickness highest on record amid pandemic Both governments had made suggestions to the body. In England, the nurses' union has threatened possible strike action after the Department of Health suggested the 1% pay rise. Mr Gething said the Welsh submission would be made public, saying Wales had not suggested a ""ceiling"" on any increase in the same way. Trade unions said Welsh NHS staff are 'exhausted' a year into the Covid pandemic in the UK ""We're waiting to see the outcome of the pay review body and we expect to publish the evidence we've provided to that pay review body if not today then in the very near future,"" he said. The British Medical Association (BMA) said it had met with Mr Gething on Friday, and made it clear that England's proposals were ""nothing short of an insult to a profession which has gone above and beyond during the pandemic"". Chair of the Welsh council, Dr David Bailey said: ""We implore him to ensure that [the pay rise] is fair, given that doctors have given their all during the last year - their sacrifices deserve to be recognised."" Nicky Hughes said the pandemic had affected NHS workers' mental health after some became patients themselves The Royal College of Nurses (RCN), who are threatening strikes over the proposals in England, said the Welsh Government should commit to a ""12.5% increase"" for all staff. Nicky Hughes, RCN Wales Associate Director of Nursing, said the sector was struggling with staff shortages and could not attract graduates if the pay was not fair. ""In a week's time, we will be holding a memorial for all those health and social care workers who lost their lives during Covid-19,"" she said. ""This was the ultimate sacrifice. What more do nurses have to do to prove their valuable contribution to health care? A one-percent up-rise in pay is non-negotiable. We don't want excuses; we need action."" The UK government said the 1% pay rise for NHS workers was ""what's affordable"" whilst acknowledging the ""work and commitment"" of staff over the last 12 months. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Westminster had done all it can ""to protect jobs and save livelihoods"", and over a million NHS staff in England continued to benefit from existing multi-year pay deals. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the proposed 1% pay rise in England was ""absolutely disgusting"" and represents a real terms pay cut.""We support the call from the RCN and other health unions for a meaningful pay rise"".""This 1% isn't even a pay rise. Inflation is running at around 1.5 to 1.8%. It's a pay cut"".

What are key workers paid?,"Every Thursday evening the UK is clapping for NHS staff, carers and other key workers. But many are on low pay. The weekly applause ran for 10 weeks during the UK's first coronavirus lockdown last spring and is set to return from 7 January. Key workers are the individuals recognised by the government as being critical to the running of the country, ranging from NHS and care workers to delivery drivers and shop workers. Clap for Carers to return as Clap for Heroes Across the UK, the median salary for all full-time employees last year was Â£31,461. We use the median income - the salary right in the middle of all employees - because, unlike the (mean) average, it doesn't get pushed up by the small number of extremely well-paid individuals at the top. It can therefore be seen as a better indicator of the ""typical"" income. The Office for National Statistics' (ONS)annual earnings survey,externalprovides a detailed picture of key workers' pay, as well as higher and lower pay brackets. The following chart represents where most workers - 60% - sit in the salary range. But 20% of people in each profession earn less than the bottom of this range. And 20% earn more than the top of the range. And in many cases, those starting out earn significantly less than the bottom of the range -  police officers can expect a salary of around Â£25,400 a year to start with, the lowest NHS pay band for a nurse is under Â£20,000 andjunior doctors receive under Â£30,000,externalfor their first foundation year. There are dozens of professions and roles that count as key workers. This selection has been chosen to cover a number of sectors but is not exhaustive. The average full-time cashier, shop assistant, care worker, food processor, bus driver and postal worker all earn below the median income. Nurses and primary teachers are paid just above the median income, while doctors and pharmacists earn substantially above it. However, working out average salaries is an inexact science with various factors affecting pay - like overtime, part-time work or extra money for working in an expensive area. Low income employees, for example, are more likely to work part-time or hour-by-hour (such as through zero-hour contracts). This means a large number will not earn anything close to their occupation's full-time median income. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health The ONS estimates that the hourly pay for a care worker, cashier or shelf stacker is under Â£9 - which is more or less in line with the minimum wage (Â£8.72 for those aged 25 and over). But that falls short of what theLiving Wage Foundation,externalcharity calculates is necessary to meet basic needs. It recommends Â£9.50 - or Â£10.85 in London. Analysis by the BBC's Shared Data Unit,externallast year found that hundreds of thousands of key workers earn below that. The government plays a large role in the pay of individuals working in the public sector - that's anyone whose job is directly funded by taxes. Police officers, nurses, civil servants and teachers all have representatives who work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with annual recommendations for how much pay should change. The government sets ""remits"" on these boards. Between 2011 and 2018, most public sector pay was either frozen or capped at 1%, as part of the government's austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit. This meant that as prices increased with inflation, salaries did not keep up. The government has less control over private sector pay. This includes people who work in transport, supermarkets, postal and courier services. It also includes most care home staff and any services (such as cleaning or catering) the NHS might outsource. The government does not directly set their wages, but they can lower taxes, provide benefits and increase the minimum wage. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in November's Spending Review that 1.3 million public sector workers would be getting their pay frozen again. But 2.1 million workers earning less than Â£24,000 a year werepromised a pay rise of at least Â£250. And more than a million NHS workers will get an increase. The minimum wage will go up by 19p to Â£8.91 an hour in April 2021. The Conservatives have pledged to increase this to Â£10.50 by 2024. Some private companies, including supermarkets and delivery services, have already increased pay for staff during the coronavirus crisis.

Budget key points at-a-glance,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled the contents of his Budget in the House of Commons. Setting out the government's tax and spending plans for the year ahead, he announced new measures to help business and jobs through the pandemic and to support the UK's long-term economic recovery and a series of tax-raising plans to help rebalance the public finances. Here is a summary of the main points.

How will the Budget affect you?,"With lives and livelihoods still at risk, Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget is focused on short-term support for people's jobs and finances. But there are signs of what will happen next and how this will affect the money in your pocket. Although it was announced in advance, like many other key measures, the extension of furlough is significant for millions of people. The scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic -Â has been extended until September. Furlough to be extended until September in Budget Young and lower-paid people have been among the most likely to have been furloughed during the pandemic. While this is designed to protect their jobs from redundancy, many will have found that their income has been a fifth less than they had anticipated over the course of 18 months. The National Living Wage will rise to Â£8.91 from April, from Â£8.72. That is a 2.2% rise and will be for people aged 23 and over. Money promised for the vaccine rollout does not directly affect the amount of money that goes into the pockets of individuals. But the extra Â£1.65bn to help vaccinate every adult by the end of July should mean people can get back to work and the economy can start to recover. Quicker jabs mean more jobs protected, which means that incomes can recover or be maintained. Tax on company profits to jump to 25% Stamp duty holiday extended to end of June Furlough supports employed people. The equivalent for the self-employed comes in the form of grants through the Coronavirus Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS). From next month, claims can be made for a fourth grant worth 80% of three months' average trading profits, up to Â£7,500 in total. This will then be followed by a fifth grant later in the year, covering May to September. However, the amount paid will depend on the amount of turnover lost. People whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will receive a grant that is equivalent to 30% of average trading profits. While many self-employed people remain ineligible - the source of considerable debate - those who can show they were trading in 2019-20 from their tax returns will now be eligible for the first time. They can receive the fourth and fifth grants. What extra help will the self-employed get? Another source of speculation for months has been the future for a Â£20-a-week top-up to universal credit. This has been described as a financial lifeline during the pandemic for many of those who have lost jobs or whose finances were already stretched. The chancellor said this would continue for another six months, but would then be withdrawn. Those on working tax credits will receive a one-off Â£500 payment. The government pledged in its manifesto not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. Although income tax is not rising, the tax bill that people may face in future years could go up. At present, people start paying 20% income tax when they earn Â£12,500 a year. The starting point for paying the higher 40% rate is Â£50,000. These thresholds will go up to Â£12,570 and Â£50,270 in April, but will then be frozen for five years. With these thresholds maintained at the same level until April 2026, many people receiving a pay rise may find themselves in a new tax bracket and having to pay more. Million more set to pay income tax by 2026 The government's official forecaster said this would mean 1.3 million more people paying income tax and one million more paying the higher rate of tax. That will raise a significant amount of money for the Treasury, estimated to be an extra Â£8bn a year by 2025-26, compared to what would have been the case if thresholds rose in line with the cost of living. Scotland has some tax-raising powers of its own. Million more set to pay income tax by 2026 Sunak: Tax rises to follow Covid spending spree Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance The chancellor confirmed that a government guarantee means first-time buyers should get a wider choice of mortgages that require a deposit of just 5% of the loan. This will be available when buying properties worth up to Â£600,000. However, some potential homeowners may still find it hard to get a mortgage if they do not have a regular income, while getting into negative equity if house prices fall is a threat. The new products will be available from next month. However, while there is support for homeownership, there are no specific policies to help those behind on their rents. Low-deposit buyers to get mortgage boost in Budget This tax break for homebuyers in England and Northern Ireland - as well as similar relief in Scotland and Wales - was due to finish at the end of March. This created a rush, as well as difficulties for some buyers to complete in time. The chancellor has now said that the current stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland - which means no stamp duty is paid on the first Â£500,000 of a property purchase - will be extended until 30 June. This relief will be reduced to the first Â£250,000 of a purchase until the end of September, before returning to its pre-pandemic level of Â£125,000 from the start of October. In total, 46% of sales would be exempt from stamp duty as a result of this policy, according to property portal Zoopla. Ministers in Wales have extended its stamp duty break until the end of June. Stamp duty holiday extended to end of June All duties on alcohol will stay as they are, for a second year in a row. These had been earmarked to rise. There has been a freeze on fuel duty for a decade and this will continue for at least another year. About 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT. There will be a new savings product designed to raise money for environmental projects. This ""green bond"" will be issued by the government-backed National Savings and Investments (NS&I), which has been criticised by savers and MPs for its customer service performance during the pandemic. It will be issued in the summer, but there are no details yet on the interest rate that will be paid to savers. What is your reaction to this year's Budget?

China to tighten grip on Hong Kong elections,"Thousands of lawmakers gathered as the annual NPC meeting began on Friday in Beijing China's top law-making body has unveiled plans to ensure only ""patriots"" can govern Hong Kong, as Beijing tightens its grip on the city with changes to the electoral system. Premier Li Keqiang, addressing the National People's Congress (NPC), warned the world not to interfere. The move follows the imposition of a tough security law. Critics say Beijing is crushing dissent and removing the ""one country, two systems"" agreement it made with the UK. Under the agreement, Hong Kong, a former British colony, was allowed to continue with its own legal system and have rights including free speech and freedom of the press. The background you need on Hong Kong's protests Hong Kong charges 47 in sweeping use of new law China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Lord Chris Patten, former governor of Hong Kong, said China's Communist Party had ""taken the biggest step so far to obliterate Hong Kong's freedoms and aspirations for greater democracy under the rule of law"". The EU has warned that it may take ""additional steps"" over the plans announced on Friday. It called on Beijing to ""carefully consider the political and economic implications on any decision to reform the electoral system of Hong Kong that would undermine fundamental freedoms, political pluralism and democratic principles"". Fears that Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems model"" was being eroded led to huge pro-democracy protests in 2019. Some turned violent and Beijing imposed the National Security Law, which it said would target ""sedition"" and bring stability. Thousands of lawmakers have gathered for the annual NPC meeting in Beijing. The rubber-stamp parliament is expected to also discuss and approve economic growth targets and environmental policies from the central government. NPC vice-chairman Wang Chen announced to the NPC that changes were needed as ""the rioting and turbulence that occurred in Hong Kong society reveals that the existing electoral system has clear loopholes and deficiencies"". He said ""risks in the system"" needed to be removed to ensure ""patriots"" were in charge. Premier Li warned that China would ""resolutely guard against and deter"" interference by external forces in Hong Kong's affairs. The week-long NPC will discuss the elections issue and no text has yet been made public, although Mr Wang and media sources did set out some areas to be discussed. The city's heavily pro-Beijing electoral committee would get new powers over the parliament, or Legislative Council (LegCo). The committee would effectively be able to vet all LegCo candidates and elect many of its members, diluting the number directly elected by the public. Ian Chong, politics professor at the National University of Singapore, told the BBC: ""In 2019, the pan-democrats did extremely well [in local elections], which was alarming to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], because it showed that all their negative rhetoric didn't seem to be working. ""I think for the CCP, they really want to remove the voices that they don't like to hear."" Willie Lam, China analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the AFP news agency that if the new NPC measures passed as he expected they would ""effectively wipe out any remaining opposition"". It's kind of incredible that the Chinese government felt the need to change what was already an electoral system heavily rigged in favour of the pro-Beijing camp. With only half the members of the territory's mini parliament directly elected, and the other half installed by political allies, why the change? What must have spooked the Communist Party was the drubbing handed to them at the hands of pro-democracy candidates at the most recent district council elections - with those advocating democratic reform taking control of all but one municipality. Now, after the coming electoral ""rebuild"" is ushered in - and it will be, given that it has been introduced to the rubber-stamp National People's Congress process - there won't be even the pretence of democratic elections in Hong Kong. An election committee - controlled by Beijing - will not only screen all candidates standing in elections, but also directly appoint ""a large proportion"" of the Legislative Council. It will be almost impossible for any candidate advocating democratic change to be elected to office - and that's the way China's senior leadership likes it. This video can not be played Hong Kong security law: The BBC's Stephen McDonell explains what it means, and what people there think The Basic Law, agreed with the UK before the return of sovereignty in 1997, allowed for an ""ultimate aim"" of universal suffrage, including the choice of leader, or chief executive. Subsequent NPC Standing Committee rulings, however, ensured Beijing would have control over who was appointed. Pro-democracy moves continued and came to a head with mass rallies in 2019.Last year, Beijing imposed the security law. Scores of arrests have been made. Last week, 47 pro-democracy activists were charged with ""subversion"" under the new law and could face life in prison. They were involved in preparations for last year's LegCo elections, which the government then postponed. Benedict Rogers, chief executive of Hong Kong Watch, an NGO that monitors developments in the city, said: ""Under these reforms, the majority of Hong Kongers face permanent political disenfranchisement, with any candidate who offers criticism of Beijing or support for Hong Kong's autonomy and democracy effectively barred from participation. ""Of course, most of the democratic slate [protesters] are now in jail anyway,""he said in a statement,external. Some 47 pro-democracy activists were charged with subversion last weekend The annual meeting has nearly 3,000 delegates representing provinces, autonomous regions, and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. While the NPC in theory is the country's most powerful institution, in reality the lawmakers usually end up approving plans and policies decided beforehand by the central government. On Friday, Mr Li saidthe country had set its economic growth target at above 6%.and updated the NPC on climate control targets. Over the next few days, the congress will also formally approve the 14th Five-Year-Plan - the economic strategy for the country. President Xi Jinping is also likely to highlight China's achievement in ""eradicating absolute poverty"" - something the country announced last week. Has China lifted 100 million out of poverty? Prof Chong told the BBC that the ""success of China in dealing with Covid"" was also set to feature large. The pandemic is largely under control, and for the majority of people, life has gone back to normal. Reporting by Yvette Tan China rebounds with economic growth target above 6% China kicks off top Communist Party meeting China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China approves 'president for life' change Hong Kong charges 47 in sweeping use of new law What is Hong Kong's national security law?

covering this Friday: Money tosupport children and young people's mental healthafter the ""disruption"" of the pandemic has been cautiously welcomed. It is part of a Â£500m pot for mental health servicesannounced in November. The government confirmed Â£79m would be allocated to support children in school and in the community. Charities and campaigners said the pandemic had had a significant impact on  young people's mental health, with one in six now estimated to have a mental health problem, according to Emma Thomas, head of charity Young Minds. ""Before Covid, we were looking at one in nine young people with a mental health diagnosable need,"" she said. But Ms Thomas warned against ""medicalising"" what are natural feelings of distress and said school might be the appropriate place for many children, who don't need formal mental health treatment, to seek support. She said it was ""absolutely right"" to boost mental health support in schools and the community. But others, like the Children's Society, condemned it as a ""sticking plaster"". ""Only about a third of children will receive support this way by April 2023,"" a spokesperson said. We've usually been able to report the UK's latest coronavirus statistics by now. But there's a delay to today's update and so thegovernment dashboard,externalwill be updated later this evening. However Public Health England has some of the figures. They said another 236 deaths had now been recorded, of people who had a positive coronavirus test within the previous 28 days. And 21,358,815 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine. Not all cinemas in NYC are opening this weekend The US film world will have its eyes on New York City this weekend
as some of its cinemas open there for the first time in nearly a year. While cinemas have reopened in some capacity elsewhere in
the US, New York has one of the countryâs biggest movie-going markets and is being seen as a litmus test for a return to communal screenings. Pandemic rules apply. Cinemas are only allowed to be a quarter full, and audiences must wear masks and will be assigned seats. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US film industry has been devastated by the pandemic, which drove down box office sales by more than 70% globally last year, the BBCâs business reporter in New York, Natalie Sherman, reports. Audiences have largely stayed away from other reopenings of cinemas, put off by health concerns and the limited titles on offer for the big screen. But virus cases in the US are dropping and the vaccination campaign is gaining momentum, our correspondent notes. You can read more of Natalie's report here. Figures show there is huge variation in the percentage of front-line NHS healthcare staff in England who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. More than 98% in the North East and South West have had a first dose - but only 79% in London, leaving around 35,000 staff unvaccinated there. Ministers are considering whether to make the jab mandatory for NHS staff. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in his Downing Street briefing today there are currently no plans for that. In England, NHS data suggests 93% of eligible front-line staff have been vaccinated - equivalent to one million doses. But, nearly three months after the vaccination programme began, up to 80,000 staff have still not taken up the offer. Front-line staff were among the first to be offered the vaccine. Read more.  Radio 4 PM Oxford vaccine lead researcher Prof Sarah Gilbert says that current coronavirus vaccines might need ""tweaking"" to deal with variants. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""A lot of the changes in the different variants coming from different parts of the world are actually the same. So, we are not seeing the virus mutating away in lots of different directions, which would make it harder to keep up with.â Prof Gilbert also stressed it was important to make sure the whole world was protected so that the virus could be suppressed. ""It's no good just to protect our country and have lots of infections going on in other parts of the world,"" she said, adding this could lead to new mutations. ""We need to make sure that when vaccines are being manufactured, they meet the same standards,"" she added. On the subject of whether everyone would have to be vaccinated every year, she said she didn't think this would be necessary. Instead, it might be that those at highest risk - like elderly people - are vaccinated each year. Prof Gilbert was speaking after receiving the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) Albert Medal. She said it was a ""great honour"". Previous winners include Winston Churchill, Marie Curie, Alexander Graham Bell, Stephen Hawking and Tim Berners-Lee. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock, whose grandmother worked nights as a nurse, says heâll âbow to nobodyâ in his admiration for the profession. But such a sentiment may jar with those who are furious about the proposed 1% pay offer. The health secretary reiterated the suggestion that the fact that any kind of increase is on the table at all marks NHS staff out, given the wider public sector pay freeze. Again, thereâs no sign that the governmentâs going to back down, with much depending on what the pay review body comes back with, later in the spring. However this row might well rumble on - and could create an awkward backdrop for ministers when theyâre seen to visit health settings or vaccination centres to praise the efforts of front-line workers. Reality Check On the subject of NHS pay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the government has âproposed what we think is affordable"". On Thursday, the government recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff (excluding doctors and dentists) to the staffâs pay review body. Currently, the NHS spends almost half of its budget on staff â a 1% pay increase across the board for 2021-22 could cost as much as Â£500m. The government has also argued that a 1% increase would be above inflation, which is currently at 0.7%. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that it could rise to 1.5% within the year, which would make the 1% increase a real-terms pay cut. The pay review body will now take evidence from other groups, such as unions and NHS employers before making its recommendation around May. It is possible that the review body could recommend a bigger rise, although the government has indicated it would be difficult to fund. Reality Check has looked athow NHS pay is decidedand how it has changed over time. The government has recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff. Many other public-sector workers will have their pay frozen, with the government warning that the country's finances are under ""huge pressure"" because of the pandemic. Health unions have criticised the 1% pay proposal and one - representing nurses - is calling for a 12.5% increase instead. We look at how decisionsover public sector pay are taken here. Today's Downing Street press conference, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Susan Hopkins of Public Health England, has just drawn to a close. Here are some of the main things we heard:    The final question comes from Megan Ford of the Nursing Times. She asks the health secretary if he is worried that the 1% pay rise will lead to nurses leaving the profession, making it hard to complete the vaccination programme and stabilise the NHS post-pandemic. Matt Hancock notes that 10,000 more nurses have joined the NHS in the last 12 months and that there has been a 34% increase in applications. He adds that nurses have had a 12% pay rise in the last three years. ""I bow to nobody in my admiration for nurses,"" he says adding that his grandmother was a nurse. However, he adds that ""times are tight"" and notes that nurses are getting a pay rise while others are seeing their wages frozen. And that concludes today's press conference John Johnston from PoliticsHome cites the Scottish Conservative leader's comments from earlier today, saying that Test and Trace didn't work as it should early in the pandemic. He asks if the health secretary accepts that analysis? He also asks for some explanation on why children are being asked to wear masks in schools. Matt Hancock says Test and Trace didn't exist at the start of the pandemic. He says there has been a programme of constant improvement. Dr Susan Hopkins says the advice for children to wear masks is to reduce the risk in schools amid increased transmission caused by new variants. That goes hand in hand with the testing, along with all of the other measures, she says. Nigel Morris from the i says the PM claimed to have a ready-made plan to fix social care in 2019 but yesterday his press secretary said the details were still being worked out. He asks when a plan will be ready. Matt Hancock says the government intends to publish a social care plan this year. He adds that it is ""more challenging to deliver this in difficult economic times"". Sky News asks the health secretary about the time it took find the Brazil variant, and Dr Susan Hopkins how helpful it would be to close the UK's borders at the moment. Matt Hancock says it's a tribute to Test and Trace ""that despite the fact the case was one of the few where the correct details weren't attached to the test itself, they managed to track down the individual"". He also says it's ""reassuring that all the evidence shows that that individual and all six where we found this variant of concern followed the rules and we obviously then put in the testing around that"". And he adds: ""We wouldn't know about any of this without the huge testing and sequencing capacity."" On border restrictions,  Dr Susan Hopkins says people coming into the country and leaving should only be doing it for essential reasons. She also says the day two and day eight tests in quarantine give extra reassurance in terms of detecting cases. And she details other restrictions currently in place, saying that even with smaller numbers of individuals coming into the country these work to minimise the risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks Matt Hancock how hard he fought for a more generous pay offer for NHS workers. And she asks Dr Susan Hopkins if the AstraZeneca vaccine works against the Brazil variant. Hancock says the government has to take issues of ""affordability"" into account but adds that he is glad the NHS was ""carved out of the pay freeze"". On the second question, Dr Hopkins says ""we do not yet have lab or clinical data for the Brazilian variant"" adding that this may take weeks to come through. However she says the vaccine may cause ""some reduction in the risk of transmission"". The BBC's Vicki Young asks Matt Hancock if a 1% NHS pay rise is fair, and if there is a case for mandatory vaccination of NHS staff? The health secretary says he ""pays tribute"" to the work of the NHS. But he says the country is facing a challenge in terms of the financial impact of the pandemic. He says the government has proposed what it thinks is affordable to make sure that the NHS gets a pay rise, and they are not part of they public sector pay freeze. On vaccinations, he says the government is not going to bring in mandatory vaccinations across the board and at this stage it is not proposing them for NHS staff. He says a review will look at the moral, ethical and practical questions about all of these issues. Hannah from Cornwall asks if the government has considered allowing under-16s who are shielding to get the vaccine. Hancock replies that it is allowed - as long as the child's clinician says it is in their best interest. Dr Hopkins adds that they are awaiting further data on the subject.

covering this Friday: Money tosupport children and young people's mental healthafter the ""disruption"" of the pandemic has been cautiously welcomed. It is part of a Â£500m pot for mental health servicesannounced in November. The government confirmed Â£79m would be allocated to support children in school and in the community. Charities and campaigners said the pandemic had had a significant impact on  young people's mental health, with one in six now estimated to have a mental health problem, according to Emma Thomas, head of charity Young Minds. ""Before Covid, we were looking at one in nine young people with a mental health diagnosable need,"" she said. But Ms Thomas warned against ""medicalising"" what are natural feelings of distress and said school might be the appropriate place for many children, who don't need formal mental health treatment, to seek support. She said it was ""absolutely right"" to boost mental health support in schools and the community. But others, like the Children's Society, condemned it as a ""sticking plaster"". ""Only about a third of children will receive support this way by April 2023,"" a spokesperson said. We've usually been able to report the UK's latest coronavirus statistics by now. But there's a delay to today's update and so thegovernment dashboard,externalwill be updated later this evening. However Public Health England has some of the figures. They said another 236 deaths had now been recorded, of people who had a positive coronavirus test within the previous 28 days. And 21,358,815 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine. Not all cinemas in NYC are opening this weekend The US film world will have its eyes on New York City this weekend
as some of its cinemas open there for the first time in nearly a year. While cinemas have reopened in some capacity elsewhere in
the US, New York has one of the countryâs biggest movie-going markets and is being seen as a litmus test for a return to communal screenings. Pandemic rules apply. Cinemas are only allowed to be a quarter full, and audiences must wear masks and will be assigned seats. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US film industry has been devastated by the pandemic, which drove down box office sales by more than 70% globally last year, the BBCâs business reporter in New York, Natalie Sherman, reports. Audiences have largely stayed away from other reopenings of cinemas, put off by health concerns and the limited titles on offer for the big screen. But virus cases in the US are dropping and the vaccination campaign is gaining momentum, our correspondent notes. You can read more of Natalie's report here. Figures show there is huge variation in the percentage of front-line NHS healthcare staff in England who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. More than 98% in the North East and South West have had a first dose - but only 79% in London, leaving around 35,000 staff unvaccinated there. Ministers are considering whether to make the jab mandatory for NHS staff. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in his Downing Street briefing today there are currently no plans for that. In England, NHS data suggests 93% of eligible front-line staff have been vaccinated - equivalent to one million doses. But, nearly three months after the vaccination programme began, up to 80,000 staff have still not taken up the offer. Front-line staff were among the first to be offered the vaccine. Read more.  Radio 4 PM Oxford vaccine lead researcher Prof Sarah Gilbert says that current coronavirus vaccines might need ""tweaking"" to deal with variants. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""A lot of the changes in the different variants coming from different parts of the world are actually the same. So, we are not seeing the virus mutating away in lots of different directions, which would make it harder to keep up with.â Prof Gilbert also stressed it was important to make sure the whole world was protected so that the virus could be suppressed. ""It's no good just to protect our country and have lots of infections going on in other parts of the world,"" she said, adding this could lead to new mutations. ""We need to make sure that when vaccines are being manufactured, they meet the same standards,"" she added. On the subject of whether everyone would have to be vaccinated every year, she said she didn't think this would be necessary. Instead, it might be that those at highest risk - like elderly people - are vaccinated each year. Prof Gilbert was speaking after receiving the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) Albert Medal. She said it was a ""great honour"". Previous winners include Winston Churchill, Marie Curie, Alexander Graham Bell, Stephen Hawking and Tim Berners-Lee. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock, whose grandmother worked nights as a nurse, says heâll âbow to nobodyâ in his admiration for the profession. But such a sentiment may jar with those who are furious about the proposed 1% pay offer. The health secretary reiterated the suggestion that the fact that any kind of increase is on the table at all marks NHS staff out, given the wider public sector pay freeze. Again, thereâs no sign that the governmentâs going to back down, with much depending on what the pay review body comes back with, later in the spring. However this row might well rumble on - and could create an awkward backdrop for ministers when theyâre seen to visit health settings or vaccination centres to praise the efforts of front-line workers. Reality Check On the subject of NHS pay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the government has âproposed what we think is affordable"". On Thursday, the government recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff (excluding doctors and dentists) to the staffâs pay review body. Currently, the NHS spends almost half of its budget on staff â a 1% pay increase across the board for 2021-22 could cost as much as Â£500m. The government has also argued that a 1% increase would be above inflation, which is currently at 0.7%. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that it could rise to 1.5% within the year, which would make the 1% increase a real-terms pay cut. The pay review body will now take evidence from other groups, such as unions and NHS employers before making its recommendation around May. It is possible that the review body could recommend a bigger rise, although the government has indicated it would be difficult to fund. Reality Check has looked athow NHS pay is decidedand how it has changed over time. The government has recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff. Many other public-sector workers will have their pay frozen, with the government warning that the country's finances are under ""huge pressure"" because of the pandemic. Health unions have criticised the 1% pay proposal and one - representing nurses - is calling for a 12.5% increase instead. We look at how decisionsover public sector pay are taken here. Today's Downing Street press conference, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Susan Hopkins of Public Health England, has just drawn to a close. Here are some of the main things we heard:    The final question comes from Megan Ford of the Nursing Times. She asks the health secretary if he is worried that the 1% pay rise will lead to nurses leaving the profession, making it hard to complete the vaccination programme and stabilise the NHS post-pandemic. Matt Hancock notes that 10,000 more nurses have joined the NHS in the last 12 months and that there has been a 34% increase in applications. He adds that nurses have had a 12% pay rise in the last three years. ""I bow to nobody in my admiration for nurses,"" he says adding that his grandmother was a nurse. However, he adds that ""times are tight"" and notes that nurses are getting a pay rise while others are seeing their wages frozen. And that concludes today's press conference John Johnston from PoliticsHome cites the Scottish Conservative leader's comments from earlier today, saying that Test and Trace didn't work as it should early in the pandemic. He asks if the health secretary accepts that analysis? He also asks for some explanation on why children are being asked to wear masks in schools. Matt Hancock says Test and Trace didn't exist at the start of the pandemic. He says there has been a programme of constant improvement. Dr Susan Hopkins says the advice for children to wear masks is to reduce the risk in schools amid increased transmission caused by new variants. That goes hand in hand with the testing, along with all of the other measures, she says. Nigel Morris from the i says the PM claimed to have a ready-made plan to fix social care in 2019 but yesterday his press secretary said the details were still being worked out. He asks when a plan will be ready. Matt Hancock says the government intends to publish a social care plan this year. He adds that it is ""more challenging to deliver this in difficult economic times"". Sky News asks the health secretary about the time it took find the Brazil variant, and Dr Susan Hopkins how helpful it would be to close the UK's borders at the moment. Matt Hancock says it's a tribute to Test and Trace ""that despite the fact the case was one of the few where the correct details weren't attached to the test itself, they managed to track down the individual"". He also says it's ""reassuring that all the evidence shows that that individual and all six where we found this variant of concern followed the rules and we obviously then put in the testing around that"". And he adds: ""We wouldn't know about any of this without the huge testing and sequencing capacity."" On border restrictions,  Dr Susan Hopkins says people coming into the country and leaving should only be doing it for essential reasons.

That we're on the other side of a lot of life experience that's happened and also that we have the ability to make our own choices in a way that I couldn't have said yes to then. That wasn't my choice to make. ""So, as an adult who lived a really independent life to then go into this construct that is different than I think what people imagine it to be, it's really liberating to be able to have the right and the privilege in some ways to be able to say, yes, I'm ready to talk, to say it to yourself.

"Breaking|Breaking newsDuke transfers back to King Edward VII's HospitalDuke of Edinburgh, 99, is recuperating after a heart procedure on a pre-existing condition.UK","Prince Philip, pictured last summer, was admitted to hospital on 16 February The Duke of Edinburgh has been moved back to King Edward VII's Hospital in London after his ""successful"" heart procedure, Buckingham Palace has said. He is expected to remain in that hospital for continuing treatment for a number of days, the palace said. Prince Philip, 99, underwent a procedure on a pre-existing condition at St Bartholomew's Hospital on Wednesday. He has spent 17 nights in hospital since being admitted on 16 February. The duke, who turns 100 in June, was first admitted to King Edward VII's after feeling unwell at home. He was treated for an infection before being moved to Barts on Monday for tests and observation on his heart. The exact reason for his initial admission was not disclosed, but it was not related to coronavirus. Philip has successful heart procedure, palace says Prince Philip moves hospital for further treatment Prince Philip 'slightly improving', says Camilla Royal Family tree and line of succession Members of the Royal family, including the Queen, have been continuing with their duties while the duke has been in hospital. On Wednesdaythe Duchess of Cornwall said Prince Philip was ""slightly improving"", during her visit to a Covid vaccination centre. During his first stay at King Edward VII's, Prince Philip was visited by his son, the Prince of Wales. The hospital is a private clinic in central London which has treated the Queen on several occasions as well as the duke and other senior royals. In 2011, Prince Philip suffered chest pains as the royal family was preparing for Christmas. He was treated for a blocked coronary artery at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire and had a stent fitted.

Diary reveals birth of secret UK-US spy pactNew documents detail the meetings that began at Bletchley Park and grew into the Five Eyes pact of today.,"Pages from the diary of Alastair Denniston - the head of Bletchley Park at the time - have been released New documents have been released about the birth of a secret intelligence pact between the US and UK 75 years ago. The documents, including diary entries, detail the war time meetings that began at Bletchley Park and led to the UKUSA deal being signed in March 1946. The alliance involved working together to intercept communications and break codes, sharing almost everything. It grew into what is today called the ""Five Eyes"" pact of the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. ""Together, we are greater than the sum of our parts,"" said Jeremy Fleming, director of GCHQ, and director of the US National Security Agency, Gen Paul Nakasone, in a joint statement to mark the anniversary, amid talk of expanding the group even further. A short entry from February 1941 in the diary of Alastair Denniston, released for the first time today by GCHQ, marked the beginning of what was once the most secret of relationships. ""The Ys are coming!"" it read - meaning the Yanks. Denniston was head of Bletchley Park and he was welcoming a group of American code breakers at a time when the US had not yet entered the Second World War. ""There are going to be four Americans who are coming to see me at 12 o'clock tonight. I require you to come in with the sherry. You are not to tell anybody who they are or what they will be doing,"" he told his assistant. Another entry from Alastair Denniston's diary from February 1941 reads the ""Ys arrive"" - meaning Yanks The Americans had undertaken a perilous crossing with their boat shot at by Nazi planes but they arrived at the home of British code breakers on a mission of huge importance. With the permission of then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the two groups of spies would share their most sensitive secrets - that the UK had broken the German Enigma code and the US the Japanese code called Purple. Further diary entries reveal how key figures would travel back and forth over the Atlantic, including Denniston to meet with his opposite number as well as code breaker Alan Turing. How the British and Americans started listening in The relationship forged in that visit would outlast World War Two and, after a series of meetings, be formalised at the start of the Cold War with a document signed in Washington on 5 March 1946. The agreement was something of a ""marriage contract"" - each agreed honesty, openness and commitment to the other including a ""no spy agreement"" in which they would not target the other side. They would share nearly all the intelligence they produced through breaking codes and intercepting communications (known as signals intelligence or SIGINT) although the agreement did allow some wiggle room if one side felt they had to act independently. Initially known as UKUSA, over the next 10 years it would be expanded as Australia, Canada and New Zealand joined, making up what is known today as the Five Eyes alliance. Details of the original deal were secret until 2010. The power of the alliance in WW2 has made it the heart of what is sometimes called the ""special relationship"" between the two countries. The term seems increasingly outdated but the one place where it has always been real is when it comes to code breaking. ""This alliance defines how we share communication, translation, analysis, and code breaking information, and has helped protect our countries and allies for decades,"" said Mr Fleming of GCHQ and Gen Nakasone in their joint statement. ""The modern digital world is constantly evolving. Threats don't respect international borders. Global partnerships are key to our security and economic prosperity - and none more so than the one between our two countries."" The relationship meant that the allies divided up the world between them when it came to intercepting communications. In the case of the Cuban Missile Crisis, this meanta GCHQ outstation in Scarboroughwould end up playing a critical role in delivering intelligence to the desk of President Kennedy in Washington. This video can not be played From 2016: A look at the intelligence relationship between the US and the UK The NSA and GCHQ continue to divide up tasks - GCHQ for instance monitors the hackers of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency and passed intelligence to the US when they saw them hacking into the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US Presidential election. The relationship remains close with staff from each side travelling over the Atlantic to work in the other side's agency and is far more intimate than that of MI6 and CIA, which deal with human, as opposed to signals intelligence. But the relationship has not always been smooth. Intimacy creates risks. In the early Cold War, there were fears that the other side might be ""leaky"". In Britain this came after revelations about the Cambridge Five showed individuals within British intelligence had betrayed secrets to the Soviet Union. The UK also has worried about showing it was contributing enough, especially given US resources dwarf its own (although expertise in code breaking has often made up for this). More recently, there was tension after a GCHQ whistleblower, Katharine Gun revealed an NSA memo that showed plans to spy on the UN in the run up to the Iraq War in 2003. And former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed to the world the extent to which the two allies had built a vast capability to intercept global communications with almost no public awareness and little oversight. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed much about the close relationship between US and UK intelligence gathering Other countries have sometimes suggested they wanted in on the deal. Germany made noises about a ""no spy deal"" in the wake of the Snowden revelations which showed the US spying on it. But Five Eyes is not simply an intelligence sharing alliance but an intelligence production alliance where members are expected to contribute and this appeared to be an obstacle. Recently, Western intelligence agencies have focused more on China, making Australia's role increasingly important. The sensitives were also on display when the US warned about limiting intelligence sharing if the UK continued to use Chinese telecoms Huawei in its new 5G network (the UK changed its position in 2020 to exclude the company). Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes? The changing focus has also led to talk about Japan and perhaps others in Asia joining Five Eyes. Officials say this is unlikely even though they do expect closer co-operation. The reality is that the alliance still remains one rooted in the trust and personal connections first forged during the WW2.

"Breaking|Breaking newsDuke transfers back to King Edward VII's HospitalPrince Philip has returned to King Edward VII's Hospital after undergoing ""successful"" heart procedure at another London hospital, Buckingham Palace saysUK","Prince Philip, pictured last summer, was admitted to hospital on 16 February The Duke of Edinburgh has been moved back to King Edward VII's Hospital in London after his ""successful"" heart procedure, Buckingham Palace has said. He is expected to remain in that hospital for continuing treatment for a number of days, the palace said. Prince Philip, 99, underwent a procedure on a pre-existing condition at St Bartholomew's Hospital on Wednesday. He has spent 17 nights in hospital since being admitted on 16 February. The duke, who turns 100 in June, was first admitted to King Edward VII's after feeling unwell at home. He was treated for an infection before being moved to Barts on Monday for tests and observation on his heart. The exact reason for his initial admission was not disclosed, but it was not related to coronavirus.

On Wednesdaythe Duchess of Cornwall said Prince Philip was ""slightly improving"", during her visit to a Covid vaccination centre. During his first stay at King Edward VII's, Prince Philip was visited by his son, the Prince of Wales. The hospital is a private clinic in central London which has treated the Queen on several occasions as well as the duke and other senior royals. In 2011, Prince Philip suffered chest pains as the royal family was preparing for Christmas.

Tsunami alert lifted after quakes rock New Zealand,"People wait on higher ground on Great Barrier Island amid the tsunami alert Three earthquakes, including one of the strongest ever to hit the region, struck off the coast of New Zealand on Friday, triggering tsunami warnings that have now been stood down. Thousands were evacuated from some coastal areas of the North Island after the third, 8.1-magnitude quake struck. There were reports of traffic gridlock as people tried to reach higher ground. The national tsunami warning was lifted at 15:43 (02:43 GMT), some 13 hours after the first quake. Some wave surges hit parts of the coast but, by Friday afternoon, authorities said the largest waves had passed. Residents were told they could return home but were warned to stay off beaches. This video can not be played New Zealand: ""What happens if there is another earthquake?"" The South Pacific archipelagos of New Caledonia and Vanuatu have been warned to prepare for dangerous waves. Their coasts could see wave surges as high as 3m (10ft), while parts of South America - including Peru, Ecuador and Chile - were warned they could see 1m waves reaching their coasts. The Hawaii-basedPacific Tsunami Warning Center said ""tsunami waves have been observed"",external, but as yet no damage had been reported. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted on Instagram: ""Hope everyone is ok out there."" The three earthquakes, all above 7.0 magnitude, came during the early hours of Friday. The last, at 8.1, struck at around 08:30 near the uninhabited Kermadec Islands, 1,000 km (621 miles) north-east of New Zealand. While earlier tsunami warnings had been called off, the third quake prompted the National Emergency Management Agency to send out a new alert and tsunami sirens sounded in some areas.

The agency told people near the coast in several areas to move immediately to high ground or get inland as far as possible. It said ""strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges"" with tsunami activity continuing for several hours. Local media reported gridlock in towns such as Whangarei and Whakatane as people tried to flee their homes, schools and workplaces. In nearby Ohope town, resident Leslie Peake was quoted by the New Zealand Herald as saying the traffic was ""bumper to bumper"" with ""huge queues of people evacuating"". New Zealand's civil defence department advised people to walk or cycle to avoid getting caught in traffic Meanwhile local media posted footage of waves rolling into Tokomaru Bay.

Tsunami warnings were also issued for Hawaii and American Samoa, but later stood down. Patrick Ti'a Reid, 37, was among those in American Samoa, situated some 3,300 km (2,000 miles) north-east of New Zealand, who had been told to evacuate to higher ground in an emergency bulletin. ""Alarms went off in our executive office building and we immediately took for higher ground,"" Mr Ti'a Reid, who works for the government in the US territory, told the BBC.

Four things that were missing from the Budget,"Chancellors like to claim their Budgets include something for everyone, and Rishi Sunak's tax and spend statement on Wednesday certainly cast the net wide. There were short-term policies to tackle the impact of Covid-19 and long-term plans for righting the nation's finances. But some people still feel there were gaps, areas where he could have done more: for those struggling to make ends meet, for example, and on action to fast-track the switch to a low carbon economy. Here are four areas where critics and commentators were surprised by what was left out of the chancellor's economic recovery Budget. The BBC has put their points to the Treasury for a response. Rishi Sunak wasn't silent on the environment in the Budget. He handed the Bank of England a duty to support the move to zero emissions. He set up a new infrastructure bank, to invest mainly in green projects, and a new green savings scheme. But does that amount to the revolution many people hoped would be kick-started in the Budget? Hardly, say critics. Mr Sunak held off a fuel duty rise for the 11th year in a row. And he is accused of clawing back money from a key home insulation scheme that supporters say was an easy win for the environment. The Â£1.5bn Green Homes Grant (GHG), launched last year, offered money for people to insulate their homes and install low carbon heating such as heat pumps. The deadline to apply is the end of this month and people must have their improvements completed by March 2022. But many householders couldn't contact installers, and some installers didn't get paid because the system was so creaky. Only 6% of the cash has been spent, so environmentalists want the money to be rolled over. But Sunak didn't mention it in the Budget so that won't happen and the scheme will be withdrawn as planned at the end of March. Fatima Ibrahim, from the group Green New Deal UK, said: ""Our response to the climate crisis should have been front and centre of the Budget, not a footnote."" Money has been showered on government departments to deal with pandemic costs: Â£150bn this year and the same again next. But there was no planning for Covid costs beyond April 2022, said Richard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent financial forecasts to the Treasury. He called it a ""source of risk"" for the public finances. The government's own roadmap out of lockdown has talked of the possible need for an annual vaccination programme and continuing test and trace capacity. Add to this the backlog of hospital appointments, additional help needed for school children, and reduced revenues for public transport, and many economists calculate that Covid costs will continue well beyond the next two years. Mr Hughes said: ""We don't know what the government's plans are for dealing with these legacy costs beyond this year. In fact the government has announced a reduction in spending after two years, he points out. ""Faced with these looming pressures, the chancellor's response so far has been to cut around Â£15bn a year from total departmental spending in the years beyond 2021-22, including a further Â£4bn cut in this Budget."" Another respected economist, Paul Johnson, director at the Institute of Fiscal Studies, agreed that the Budget left a big question mark over Covid costs. He tweeted: ""Spending plans from 2022 include precisely nothing for dealing with additional pressures arising from the pandemic, of which there are plenty. In fact they involve spending cuts relative to pre-pandemic plans. Is that really credible?"" There was no support for struggling renters in the Budget, pointed out social research group the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. ""The chancellor was silent on support for the 700,000 households already in rent arrears,"" it said. The Local Housing Allowance which is used to work out housing benefit will be frozen from April too, piling further pressure onto renters, the Foundation added. On the other hand, for those buying a home, the chancellor extended the stamp duty holiday for another three months and launched a new 95% mortgage guarantee scheme. ""These policies will compound the UK's housing crisis, driving up house prices and making it harder to address the issues faced by people in poverty,"" the JRF said. Higher house prices can have a knock-on effect, pushing up rents, and squeezing the finances of renters who are often struggling already. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""It is very disappointing to see the housing support announced is limited to home buyers. Hundreds of thousands of renters in arrears are facing eviction in a matter of weeks and must not be forgotten."" Extending the Â£20 boost to universal credit and the furlough scheme until September will help tenants plan ahead, ""but much more is required to avoid a mounting crisis in the private rented sector,"" said Timothy Douglas, policy & campaigns manager for letting agents' organisation Propertymark. ""As the impact of Covid continues to bite and unemployment rates rise, we are increasingly concerned about how tenants will avoid future rent arrears,"" he added. After the pandemic took the lives of more than 40,000 mostly elderly care residents there were widespread calls for reform of the social care sector. But the chancellor failed to offer even a whisper of fresh support for care homes or their staff. ""The sector was already on its knees before the pandemic hit, and now it is at crisis point,"" said Helen Wildbore, director of the Relatives & Residents Association. ""Following a year of unremitting challenges, with care services stretched to breaking point and staff burnt out, support from the chancellor was desperately and urgently needed."" She said the Association's helpline hears daily from people who are relying on these services who already feel neglected and left behind by the government. ""The Budget is an insult to older people needing care, and their families,"" she added. The day after the Budget, parliament's Housing, Communities and Local Government Committeelaunched an enquiry into the impact of COVID-19 on adult social care,external, conceding that the problems in the sector aren't simply a consequence of the pandemic. ""We have seen year-on-year the demand on services increasing, while local authority budgets have been stretched more and more,"" said committee chair Clive Betts MP. ""Unless the funding of social care is resolved there will continue to be more cuts to other council services."" But many wish reforms to social care and how it is funded had been tackled much earlier. ""The silence on social care funding proposals in the Budget was deeply disappointing,"" said Steven Cameron, director at pension firm Aegon. ""The devastating impact the pandemic has had on our most elderly has shown just how valuable but stretched our care system is, making it even more urgent that the government delivers on previously promised reforms to social care funding.""

Government has no climate change plan - MPs,"The government has been hit by a double whammy of reports from MPs criticising its performance on climate change. The influential Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says ministers have ""no plan"" to meet climate change targets, two years after setting them in law. And the business committee says the vital UN climate conference scheduled for Glasgow in November will fail unless its goals are made clear. The government says both reports are inaccurate and unfair. The PAC's report says ministers still don't have a coordinated strategy to realise the goal of removing almost all the carbon emissions from Britain by 2050. No 'green revolution' in Budget, critics say Why the battle for British coal matters to the world Demands grow for 'green industrial revolution' The report notes that the government intends to publish what the MPs call a ""plethora"" of strategies setting out how it will reduce emissions in sectors ranging from transport to heating buildings. But, it says, the policies aren't agreed yet. The MPs say the Treasury has changed its guidance to ensure departments place greater emphasis on the environmental impacts of their policies, but hasn't explained how this will work in practice. What's more, the MPs say, the government is not yet ensuring that its activities to reduce emissions in Britain are not simply transferring those emissions overseas - where so many of the carbon-intensive goods bought in Britain's shops are made. They also blame the government for failing to engage with the public. Meg Hillier, the committee's Labour chairwoman, said: ""The government has set itself a huge test in committing the UK to a net zero economy by 2050 - but there is little sign that it understands how to get there. "" We must see a clear path plotted, with interim goals set and reached - it will not do to dump our emissions on poorer countries to hit UK targets. ""Our new international trade deals, the levelling up agenda - all must fit in the plan to reach net zero. ""COP26 (the vital climate conference in Glasgow in November) is a few months away. The eyes of the world, its scientists and policymakers are on the UK - big promises full of fine words won't stand up."" The Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow will host the COP26 conference in November Meanwhile, the business committee says the government has provided no details so far about how success at the conference will be measured. Their report urges the prime minister to set out a clear list of ambitions for the summit, with a set of accompanying measures of success. Bishops would welcome Pope to COP26 climate summit Sharma leaves business job to focus on climate role New date agreed for UN climate summit in Glasgow It points out that the UK is currently guiding the summit to focus on key areas for change chosen by Britain. These are: Adaptation and resilience Nature based solutions Energy transitions Clean transport Switching the finance system to low-carbon investments. But the committee says: ""We have concluded the current 'themes'-based approach is too broad, without clear measures for success. ""More focus needs to be given to the overriding necessity to agree deliverable policies that keep global temperature rises to as close to 1.5C as possible."" A COP26 spokesperson said the government was making ""good progress"" but added ""there is no time to waste"". ""The COP26 President, Alok Sharma, our teams, and the full weight of our diplomatic network are all working tirelessly to push for accelerated action from our partners around the world"" the spokesperson added. Wildfires in California have been associated with climate change Nick Mabey, from the think tank e3g, argues that multiple potential goals must be achieved - and he believes those goals should be debated publicly. The aims would include: Strengthening nations' long -term commitments to cut emissions Measuring whether governments' policies match up to their promises No new coal power built. Major public banks withdrawing from fossil fuel investment Ending export finance for coal power stations Greatly increasing cash for poorer nations to adapt to inevitable global heating. ""This debate is up for grabs"" he told BBC News. ""It should be a public debate because we're talking out how to change whole economies. A lot of the outcomes from Glasgow will be decided in the court of public opinion."" Richard Black from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said: ""The lack of clarity on the vision for COP26 is seriously concerning. It is surely obvious that COP26 has to set the global economy on track to net zero emissions by mid-century. ""This means brokering agreements that kick-start decarbonisation in various sectors and it also means Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak stepping up to the plate on finance to help the poorest nations. ""Failure to sort this will fatally compromise COP26 - and the failure will lie squarely at the door of Downing St."" Scientists say climate change had an impact on bush fires in Australia in recent years Whatever global goals are eventually agreed, green groups warn the UK's negotiating position will be weakened unless it consistently cuts carbon domestically - it's currently slipping away from its long-term targets. Mr Black added: ""Coming on the back of a Budget that didn't even try to get the Conservatives on track to their net zero target, the conclusion that they don't have a plan for reaching it, just months before the UK hosts a major UN climate summit for the first time, should stimulate some serious thinking right across Whitehall."" A government spokeswoman said: ""It is nonsense to say the government does not have a plan when we have been leading the world in tackling climate change, cutting emissions by almost 44 per cent since 1990 and doing so faster than any other developed nation in recent years. ""Only this week in the Budget we built on the prime minister's Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution by encouraging private investment in green growth, and we are bringing forward bold proposals to cut emissions and create new jobs and industries across the whole country.""

China set to overhaul Hong Kong electoral system,"Thousands of lawmakers gathered as the annual NPC meeting began on Friday in Beijing China's top law-making body has unveiled plans to ensure only ""patriots"" can govern Hong Kong, as Beijing tightens its grip on the city with changes to the electoral system. Premier Li Keqiang, addressing the National People's Congress (NPC), warned the world not to interfere. The move follows the imposition of a tough security law. Critics say Beijing is crushing dissent and removing the ""one country, two systems"" agreement it made with the UK. Under the agreement, Hong Kong, a former British colony, was allowed to continue with its own legal system and have rights including free speech and freedom of the press. The background you need on Hong Kong's protests Hong Kong charges 47 in sweeping use of new law China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Lord Chris Patten, former governor of Hong Kong, said China's Communist Party had ""taken the biggest step so far to obliterate Hong Kong's freedoms and aspirations for greater democracy under the rule of law"". The EU has warned that it may take ""additional steps"" over the plans announced on Friday. It called on Beijing to ""carefully consider the political and economic implications on any decision to reform the electoral system of Hong Kong that would undermine fundamental freedoms, political pluralism and democratic principles"". Fears that Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems model"" was being eroded led to huge pro-democracy protests in 2019. Some turned violent and Beijing imposed the National Security Law, which it said would target ""sedition"" and bring stability. Thousands of lawmakers have gathered for the annual NPC meeting in Beijing. The rubber-stamp parliament is expected to also discuss and approve economic growth targets and environmental policies from the central government. NPC vice-chairman Wang Chen announced to the NPC that changes were needed as ""the rioting and turbulence that occurred in Hong Kong society reveals that the existing electoral system has clear loopholes and deficiencies"". He said ""risks in the system"" needed to be removed to ensure ""patriots"" were in charge. Premier Li warned that China would ""resolutely guard against and deter"" interference by external forces in Hong Kong's affairs. The week-long NPC will discuss the elections issue and no text has yet been made public, although Mr Wang and media sources did set out some areas to be discussed. The city's heavily pro-Beijing electoral committee would get new powers over the parliament, or Legislative Council (LegCo). The committee would effectively be able to vet all LegCo candidates and elect many of its members, diluting the number directly elected by the public. Ian Chong, politics professor at the National University of Singapore, told the BBC: ""In 2019, the pan-democrats did extremely well [in local elections], which was alarming to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], because it showed that all their negative rhetoric didn't seem to be working. ""I think for the CCP, they really want to remove the voices that they don't like to hear."" Willie Lam, China analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the AFP news agency that if the new NPC measures passed as he expected they would ""effectively wipe out any remaining opposition"". It's kind of incredible that the Chinese government felt the need to change what was already an electoral system heavily rigged in favour of the pro-Beijing camp. With only half the members of the territory's mini parliament directly elected, and the other half installed by political allies, why the change? What must have spooked the Communist Party was the drubbing handed to them at the hands of pro-democracy candidates at the most recent district council elections - with those advocating democratic reform taking control of all but one municipality. Now, after the coming electoral ""rebuild"" is ushered in - and it will be, given that it has been introduced to the rubber-stamp National People's Congress process - there won't be even the pretence of democratic elections in Hong Kong. An election committee - controlled by Beijing - will not only screen all candidates standing in elections, but also directly appoint ""a large proportion"" of the Legislative Council. It will be almost impossible for any candidate advocating democratic change to be elected to office - and that's the way China's senior leadership likes it. This video can not be played Hong Kong security law: The BBC's Stephen McDonell explains what it means, and what people there think The Basic Law, agreed with the UK before the return of sovereignty in 1997, allowed for an ""ultimate aim"" of universal suffrage, including the choice of leader, or chief executive. Subsequent NPC Standing Committee rulings, however, ensured Beijing would have control over who was appointed. Pro-democracy moves continued and came to a head with mass rallies in 2019.Last year, Beijing imposed the security law. Scores of arrests have been made. Last week, 47 pro-democracy activists were charged with ""subversion"" under the new law and could face life in prison. They were involved in preparations for last year's LegCo elections, which the government then postponed. Benedict Rogers, chief executive of Hong Kong Watch, an NGO that monitors developments in the city, said: ""Under these reforms, the majority of Hong Kongers face permanent political disenfranchisement, with any candidate who offers criticism of Beijing or support for Hong Kong's autonomy and democracy effectively barred from participation. ""Of course, most of the democratic slate [protesters] are now in jail anyway,""he said in a statement,external. Some 47 pro-democracy activists were charged with subversion last weekend The annual meeting has nearly 3,000 delegates representing provinces, autonomous regions, and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. While the NPC in theory is the country's most powerful institution, in reality the lawmakers usually end up approving plans and policies decided beforehand by the central government. On Friday, Mr Li saidthe country had set its economic growth target at above 6%.and updated the NPC on climate control targets. Over the next few days, the congress will also formally approve the 14th Five-Year-Plan - the economic strategy for the country. President Xi Jinping is also likely to highlight China's achievement in ""eradicating absolute poverty"" - something the country announced last week. Has China lifted 100 million out of poverty? Prof Chong told the BBC that the ""success of China in dealing with Covid"" was also set to feature large. The pandemic is largely under control, and for the majority of people, life has gone back to normal.

LiveLiveNHS 1% pay rise is what we can afford - minister11 minutes ago,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he is 'delighted' the missing person who had tested positive with the Brazil variant of Covid-19 has been found Officials believe the person quarantined but are carrying out extra testing in the Croydon area of south London where they live Passengers travelling from England will need to carry a form setting out that their trip is permitted under stay-at-home restrictions from Monday Cyprus and Portugal say they hope to open to vaccinated Britons from the start of May Unions have reacted angrily to the government recommending a 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England The British Medical Association says it is a ""kick in the teeth"" while the Royal College of Nursing has set up a strike fund But ministers have defended the proposal at a time when the economy is under ""huge pressure"" Levels of coronavirus infections in the UK have continued to fall, Office for National Statistics data shows Italy blocks AstraZeneca Covid vaccine export to Australia Edited by Chris Clayton and Rob Corp Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Today's writers were Becky Morton, Alex Kleiderman, Kate Whannel, Lauren Turner and Ella Wills. The editors were Chris Clayton and Rob Corp. We'll be back tomorrow morning with more updates from the UK and around the world. And as Friday's coverage draws to a close, here's what you need to know this evening: As the live page team prepare to close up for the day, here are some of the top coronavirus stories we have been
covering this Friday: Money tosupport children and young people's mental healthafter the ""disruption"" of the pandemic has been cautiously welcomed. It is part of a Â£500m pot for mental health servicesannounced in November. The government confirmed Â£79m would be allocated to support children in school and in the community. Charities and campaigners said the pandemic had had a significant impact on  young people's mental health, with one in six now estimated to have a mental health problem, according to Emma Thomas, head of charity Young Minds. ""Before Covid, we were looking at one in nine young people with a mental health diagnosable need,"" she said. But Ms Thomas warned against ""medicalising"" what are natural feelings of distress and said school might be the appropriate place for many children, who don't need formal mental health treatment, to seek support. She said it was ""absolutely right"" to boost mental health support in schools and the community. But others, like the Children's Society, condemned it as a ""sticking plaster"". ""Only about a third of children will receive support this way by April 2023,"" a spokesperson said. We've usually been able to report the UK's latest coronavirus statistics by now. But there's a delay to today's update and so thegovernment dashboard,externalwill be updated later this evening. However Public Health England has some of the figures. They said another 236 deaths had now been recorded, of people who had a positive coronavirus test within the previous 28 days. And 21,358,815 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine. Not all cinemas in NYC are opening this weekend The US film world will have its eyes on New York City this weekend
as some of its cinemas open there for the first time in nearly a year. While cinemas have reopened in some capacity elsewhere in
the US, New York has one of the countryâs biggest movie-going markets and is being seen as a litmus test for a return to communal screenings. Pandemic rules apply. Cinemas are only allowed to be a quarter full, and audiences must wear masks and will be assigned seats. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US film industry has been devastated by the pandemic, which drove down box office sales by more than 70% globally last year, the BBCâs business reporter in New York, Natalie Sherman, reports. Audiences have largely stayed away from other reopenings of cinemas, put off by health concerns and the limited titles on offer for the big screen. But virus cases in the US are dropping and the vaccination campaign is gaining momentum, our correspondent notes. You can read more of Natalie's report here. Figures show there is huge variation in the percentage of front-line NHS healthcare staff in England who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. More than 98% in the North East and South West have had a first dose - but only 79% in London, leaving around 35,000 staff unvaccinated there. Ministers are considering whether to make the jab mandatory for NHS staff. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in his Downing Street briefing today there are currently no plans for that. In England, NHS data suggests 93% of eligible front-line staff have been vaccinated - equivalent to one million doses. But, nearly three months after the vaccination programme began, up to 80,000 staff have still not taken up the offer. Front-line staff were among the first to be offered the vaccine. Read more.  Radio 4 PM Oxford vaccine lead researcher Prof Sarah Gilbert says that current coronavirus vaccines might need ""tweaking"" to deal with variants. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""A lot of the changes in the different variants coming from different parts of the world are actually the same. So, we are not seeing the virus mutating away in lots of different directions, which would make it harder to keep up with.â Prof Gilbert also stressed it was important to make sure the whole world was protected so that the virus could be suppressed. ""It's no good just to protect our country and have lots of infections going on in other parts of the world,"" she said, adding this could lead to new mutations. ""We need to make sure that when vaccines are being manufactured, they meet the same standards,"" she added. On the subject of whether everyone would have to be vaccinated every year, she said she didn't think this would be necessary. Instead, it might be that those at highest risk - like elderly people - are vaccinated each year. Prof Gilbert was speaking after receiving the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) Albert Medal. She said it was a ""great honour"". Previous winners include Winston Churchill, Marie Curie, Alexander Graham Bell, Stephen Hawking and Tim Berners-Lee. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock, whose grandmother worked nights as a nurse, says heâll âbow to nobodyâ in his admiration for the profession. But such a sentiment may jar with those who are furious about the proposed 1% pay offer. The health secretary reiterated the suggestion that the fact that any kind of increase is on the table at all marks NHS staff out, given the wider public sector pay freeze. Again, thereâs no sign that the governmentâs going to back down, with much depending on what the pay review body comes back with, later in the spring. However this row might well rumble on - and could create an awkward backdrop for ministers when theyâre seen to visit health settings or vaccination centres to praise the efforts of front-line workers. Reality Check On the subject of NHS pay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the government has âproposed what we think is affordable"". On Thursday, the government recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff (excluding doctors and dentists) to the staffâs pay review body. Currently, the NHS spends almost half of its budget on staff â a 1% pay increase across the board for 2021-22 could cost as much as Â£500m. The government has also argued that a 1% increase would be above inflation, which is currently at 0.7%. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that it could rise to 1.5% within the year, which would make the 1% increase a real-terms pay cut. The pay review body will now take evidence from other groups, such as unions and NHS employers before making its recommendation around May. It is possible that the review body could recommend a bigger rise, although the government has indicated it would be difficult to fund. Reality Check has looked athow NHS pay is decidedand how it has changed over time. The government has recommended a 1% pay increase for NHS staff. Many other public-sector workers will have their pay frozen, with the government warning that the country's finances are under ""huge pressure"" because of the pandemic. Health unions have criticised the 1% pay proposal and one - representing nurses - is calling for a 12.5% increase instead. We look at how decisionsover public sector pay are taken here. Today's Downing Street press conference, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Susan Hopkins of Public Health England, has just drawn to a close. Here are some of the main things we heard:    The final question comes from Megan Ford of the Nursing Times. She asks the health secretary if he is worried that the 1% pay rise will lead to nurses leaving the profession, making it hard to complete the vaccination programme and stabilise the NHS post-pandemic. Matt Hancock notes that 10,000 more nurses have joined the NHS in the last 12 months and that there has been a 34% increase in applications. He adds that nurses have had a 12% pay rise in the last three years. ""I bow to nobody in my admiration for nurses,"" he says adding that his grandmother was a nurse. However, he adds that ""times are tight"" and notes that nurses are getting a pay rise while others are seeing their wages frozen. And that concludes today's press conference John Johnston from PoliticsHome cites the Scottish Conservative leader's comments from earlier today, saying that Test and Trace didn't work as it should early in the pandemic. He asks if the health secretary accepts that analysis? He also asks for some explanation on why children are being asked to wear masks in schools. Matt Hancock says Test and Trace didn't exist at the start of the pandemic. He says there has been a programme of constant improvement. Dr Susan Hopkins says the advice for children to wear masks is to reduce the risk in schools amid increased transmission caused by new variants. That goes hand in hand with the testing, along with all of the other measures, she says. Nigel Morris from the i says the PM claimed to have a ready-made plan to fix social care in 2019 but yesterday his press secretary said the details were still being worked out. He asks when a plan will be ready. Matt Hancock says the government intends to publish a social care plan this year. He adds that it is ""more challenging to deliver this in difficult economic times"". Sky News asks the health secretary about the time it took find the Brazil variant, and Dr Susan Hopkins how helpful it would be to close the UK's borders at the moment. Matt Hancock says it's a tribute to Test and Trace ""that despite the fact the case was one of the few where the correct details weren't attached to the test itself, they managed to track down the individual"". He also says it's ""reassuring that all the evidence shows that that individual and all six where we found this variant of concern followed the rules and we obviously then put in the testing around that"". And he adds: ""We wouldn't know about any of this without the huge testing and sequencing capacity."" On border restrictions,  Dr Susan Hopkins says people coming into the country and leaving should only be doing it for essential reasons. She also says the day two and day eight tests in quarantine give extra reassurance in terms of detecting cases. And she details other restrictions currently in place, saying that even with smaller numbers of individuals coming into the country these work to minimise the risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks Matt Hancock how hard he fought for a more generous pay offer for NHS workers. And she asks Dr Susan Hopkins if the AstraZeneca vaccine works against the Brazil variant. Hancock says the government has to take issues of ""affordability"" into account but adds that he is glad the NHS was ""carved out of the pay freeze"". On the second question, Dr Hopkins says ""we do not yet have lab or clinical data for the Brazilian variant"" adding that this may take weeks to come through. However she says the vaccine may cause ""some reduction in the risk of transmission"". The BBC's Vicki Young asks Matt Hancock if a 1% NHS pay rise is fair, and if there is a case for mandatory vaccination of NHS staff? The health secretary says he ""pays tribute"" to the work of the NHS. But he says the country is facing a challenge in terms of the financial impact of the pandemic. He says the government has proposed what it thinks is affordable to make sure that the NHS gets a pay rise, and they are not part of they public sector pay freeze. On vaccinations, he says the government is not going to bring in mandatory vaccinations across the board and at this stage it is not proposing them for NHS staff. He says a review will look at the moral, ethical and practical questions about all of these issues. Hannah from Cornwall asks if the government has considered allowing under-16s who are shielding to get the vaccine. Hancock replies that it is allowed - as long as the child's clinician says it is in their best interest. Dr Hopkins adds that they are awaiting further data on the subject. Reality Check At the government briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that âan extra Â£79mâ will be allocated to supporting the mental health of children and young people affected by the disruption of the pandemic. Itâs an allocation of part of the Â£500mannounced for mental health servicesin England at the Spending Review in November. The money is aimed at:  You can read more about the planshere.

'Right and just' for students to get Covid refunds,"University students in England should be given financial compensation for the disruption to their studies from the pandemic, says Sir Anthony Seldon. The former University of Buckingham vice-chancellor said it would be ""right and just"" for students to have refunds. Larissa Kennedy, National Union of Students president, backed his call, saying: ""Students deserve better than to be pushed into financial hardship."" The Department for Education said refunds were a matter for universities. Students have complained about paying rent on accommodation they cannot use and paying full tuition fees while studying online and not having access to campus facilities. Sir Anthony, who has been a university and school head as well as a political biographer, said despite the best efforts of universities, it had been a ""restricted"" experience for many students. ""Students deserve something,"" he said, including ""financial recompense"", in recognition of how much they had missed during the pandemic. University pays compensation for 'less valuable experience' Should students get a refund? Student rent: 'We're paying for what we're not getting' 'I'm paying thousands for housing I can't use' Many are still studying online at home and do not have a date for going back to face-to-face teaching. Those in their third year will have had two successive years of disruption. Maya Cooper in Liverpool has been among the students paying rent on a room she could not use But rebates for students should be funded by the government, because many universities ""cannot afford to pay"", said Sir Anthony. This week the university complaints watchdog, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, revealed that a university had topay a student Â£5,000 in compensationfor lost teaching time during lockdown. In Northern Ireland,students are to receive Â£500 eachin recognition of the disruption caused to their studies during the pandemic. Sir Anthony, also writing in the Times, says universities should be more assertive in ""challenging the government to come up with money to compensate students"". He argues that universities should have a higher status after their role in tackling the pandemic, including developing Covid vaccines. Sir Anthony Seldon says universities should have a higher status after their vaccine research But instead, Sir Anthony says universities are being publicly blamed by ministers for ""one misdemeanour after another"" and ""put on the naughty step"". He wants universities to take a tougher collective line with politicians and to start ""punching their weight"". On rebates on tuition fees, Universities UK said: ""The government is clear that there should not be blanket tuition refunds."" A spokesman said additional measures were in place for students, such as online learning, ""enhanced wellbeing and mental health support and significant hardship funding"". Many student rooms are privately rented, but Universities UK said universities were ""actively working with government and looking at ways to ensure a fair deal for students"". NUS president, Ms Kennedy, warned the ""economic strain"" of the pandemic meant many students faced ""difficult decisions as to whether they will be able to continue their education"". The Department for Education (DfE) said universities were autonomous and claims for a fee refund would depend on the contract between the individual student and university. A DfE spokeswoman said: ""We have been clear that universities should maintain the quality and quantity of tuition, and ensure it is accessible to all students, regardless of their background, and the Office for Students is monitoring online teaching to ensure this is the case.""

Diary reveals birth of secret UK-US spy pact,"Pages from the diary of Alastair Denniston - the head of Bletchley Park at the time - have been released New documents have been released about the birth of a secret intelligence pact between the US and UK 75 years ago. The documents, including diary entries, detail the war time meetings that began at Bletchley Park and led to the UKUSA deal being signed in March 1946. The alliance involved working together to intercept communications and break codes, sharing almost everything. It grew into what is today called the ""Five Eyes"" pact of the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. ""Together, we are greater than the sum of our parts,"" said Jeremy Fleming, director of GCHQ, and director of the US National Security Agency, Gen Paul Nakasone, in a joint statement to mark the anniversary, amid talk of expanding the group even further. A short entry from February 1941 in the diary of Alastair Denniston, released for the first time today by GCHQ, marked the beginning of what was once the most secret of relationships. ""The Ys are coming!"" it read - meaning the Yanks. Denniston was head of Bletchley Park and he was welcoming a group of American code breakers at a time when the US had not yet entered the Second World War. ""There are going to be four Americans who are coming to see me at 12 o'clock tonight. I require you to come in with the sherry. You are not to tell anybody who they are or what they will be doing,"" he told his assistant. Another entry from Alastair Denniston's diary from February 1941 reads the ""Ys arrive"" - meaning Yanks The Americans had undertaken a perilous crossing with their boat shot at by Nazi planes but they arrived at the home of British code breakers on a mission of huge importance. With the permission of then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the two groups of spies would share their most sensitive secrets - that the UK had broken the German Enigma code and the US the Japanese code called Purple. Further diary entries reveal how key figures would travel back and forth over the Atlantic, including Denniston to meet with his opposite number as well as code breaker Alan Turing. How the British and Americans started listening in The relationship forged in that visit would outlast World War Two and, after a series of meetings, be formalised at the start of the Cold War with a document signed in Washington on 5 March 1946. The agreement was something of a ""marriage contract"" - each agreed honesty, openness and commitment to the other including a ""no spy agreement"" in which they would not target the other side. They would share nearly all the intelligence they produced through breaking codes and intercepting communications (known as signals intelligence or SIGINT) although the agreement did allow some wiggle room if one side felt they had to act independently. Initially known as UKUSA, over the next 10 years it would be expanded as Australia, Canada and New Zealand joined, making up what is known today as the Five Eyes alliance. Details of the original deal were secret until 2010. The power of the alliance in WW2 has made it the heart of what is sometimes called the ""special relationship"" between the two countries. The term seems increasingly outdated but the one place where it has always been real is when it comes to code breaking. ""This alliance defines how we share communication, translation, analysis, and code breaking information, and has helped protect our countries and allies for decades,"" said Mr Fleming of GCHQ and Gen Nakasone in their joint statement. ""The modern digital world is constantly evolving. Threats don't respect international borders. Global partnerships are key to our security and economic prosperity - and none more so than the one between our two countries."" The relationship meant that the allies divided up the world between them when it came to intercepting communications. In the case of the Cuban Missile Crisis, this meanta GCHQ outstation in Scarboroughwould end up playing a critical role in delivering intelligence to the desk of President Kennedy in Washington. This video can not be played From 2016: A look at the intelligence relationship between the US and the UK The NSA and GCHQ continue to divide up tasks - GCHQ for instance monitors the hackers of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency and passed intelligence to the US when they saw them hacking into the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US Presidential election. The relationship remains close with staff from each side travelling over the Atlantic to work in the other side's agency and is far more intimate than that of MI6 and CIA, which deal with human, as opposed to signals intelligence. But the relationship has not always been smooth. Intimacy creates risks. In the early Cold War, there were fears that the other side might be ""leaky"". In Britain this came after revelations about the Cambridge Five showed individuals within British intelligence had betrayed secrets to the Soviet Union. The UK also has worried about showing it was contributing enough, especially given US resources dwarf its own (although expertise in code breaking has often made up for this). More recently, there was tension after a GCHQ whistleblower, Katharine Gun revealed an NSA memo that showed plans to spy on the UN in the run up to the Iraq War in 2003. And former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed to the world the extent to which the two allies had built a vast capability to intercept global communications with almost no public awareness and little oversight. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed much about the close relationship between US and UK intelligence gathering Other countries have sometimes suggested they wanted in on the deal. Germany made noises about a ""no spy deal"" in the wake of the Snowden revelations which showed the US spying on it. But Five Eyes is not simply an intelligence sharing alliance but an intelligence production alliance where members are expected to contribute and this appeared to be an obstacle. Recently, Western intelligence agencies have focused more on China, making Australia's role increasingly important. The sensitives were also on display when the US warned about limiting intelligence sharing if the UK continued to use Chinese telecoms Huawei in its new 5G network (the UK changed its position in 2020 to exclude the company). Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes? The changing focus has also led to talk about Japan and perhaps others in Asia joining Five Eyes. Officials say this is unlikely even though they do expect closer co-operation. The reality is that the alliance still remains one rooted in the trust and personal connections first forged during the WW2.
